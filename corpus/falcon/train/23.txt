Despite the reduction in the total number of insurance companies, the cumulative authorized share capital for the year has grown by 5.1%, from 150.2 billion rubles to 157.8 billion rubles. The portion of equity share capital of Russian companies owned by foreign insurance companies has doubled to 9.8% In 2007, the consolidated in 2007, comprising up to 15.4 billion rubles in money terms. authorized share capital of The increase in foreign ownership share during 2007 was essentially brought insurance companies in Russia about by the purchase by the foreigners of equity in the largest Russian insurers. In this regard and according to the Federal Insurance Service Authority, the top was 157.8 billion rubles. 10 companies that were able to acquire foreign participation were: InGosStrakh, RESO-Garant, ROSNO, Soglasie, Rossiya, Zurich, Retail (formerly NASTA), Total authorized share capital of EnergoGarant, Progress-Garant, NSG and AIG Life.

In comparison with 2006, the number of transactions In 2007 there were several noticeable market markedly increased on the transactions with foreign participation. Among the largest of them are the creation of insurance groups, and following also capital transactions with the -the purchase by the joint ALLIANZ ROSNO of Progress Garant; participation of foreign companies -Wiener Stadtische acquired 15% of the stock of Stolichny insurance group; -the acquisition by ZURICH of the company NASTA; -the acquisition by AXA 36.7% of the stock of RESO-Garant.

Create insurance group Acquisition Reconstitution of Participate as charter Subsidiary capital of foreign company 5 Along with Federal level Almost one fourth of the investments into the insurance market were made by companies, the regional foreign participants. During the year the share of foreign shareholders of companies are also engaged in the authorized share capital in Russian insurance companies has doubled to 9.8%. acquisition of small insurance Additional global players will continue to expand into the up and coming companies. domestic market, as can be seen be the activities during the 1 st quarter of 2008, as follows: By the fact of negotiations by Generali to purchase insurance company MAX By the acquisition of Saint Petersburg company Region by If P&C By the transaction between TBIH Financial Services N.V. and Russian Insurance Company The consolidation of insurance companies allows not only the increase to accessible insurance capacity and financial stability, but also provides the opportunity to raise the quality of service by the rationalization of resources of the several companies thanks to an economy-of-scale effect. For the small insurance companies trying to identify market niches for itself everything will be more difficult, as follows: The necessity for insurance intermediaries is gradually disappearing, the segment of insurance for large businesses has long since been apportioned out, and in retail insurance without the developed subsidiary network, smoothly functioning system of settlement of losses and well-known brand to bypass market leaders; it will be hardly possible to succeed against those factors. Appearance of specialized Simultaneously with the third stage of the increase of the minimum capital companies in the market – primarily those companies that reserves in the authorized share capital, in the summer of 2007 amendments to specialize in providing life the law on the organization of the insurance business will have been enacted, insurance. concerning the segregation of the insurance business. Aside from the creation of During the last year 17 specialized insurers of life insurance were created. A specialized companies, in 2007 portion of those companies were created on the basis of restructuring subsidiary foreign players have started entities or on the basis of acquisition of marginal insurers in the interest of actively entering the life insurance transferring life insurance operations. market. In 2007 licenses for life insurance were granted to full featured subsidiaries of such foreign insurers as: АХА, ACE, АVIVA, Sozhekap, ING, and so on. Boom of collaboration with the Via banks almost all types of retail insurance are on sale: auto insurance, banks property and casualty insurance, mortgage insurance (borrower’s life insurance, pledge security, title insurance), and insurance of bank risks. These concepts being offered show the maximum interest in a variety of opportunities. If, according to the estimates of Expert PA, the volume of the premiums collected under bank programs or on insurance with direct bank risks, had reached 1 billion dollars in 2006, and based on the expected results of 2007 it could reach 3 billion dollars, which would exceed the most optimistic forecasts.

The transition of finish development strategy for the hazardous production facility insurance from a voluntary type into a mandatory insurance sector for the above- requirement does not meet with much support from the business sphere: it adds mentioned period additional financial burden, therefore throughout all of 2007 the consideration of the bill was constantly postponed. On April 1, 2008 Vladimir Putin sent an instruction to implement the prompt introduction of industrial insurance in action against the position of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. However, last time this was attempted in the summer of 2007, the same instruction and resolution on the hazardous production facility insurance could only be made by the approval the State Duma committee. The bill joining Russia to "the Green card" was signed in the 1st quarter 2008, however throughout all 2007 the bill was submitted in the Duma for consideration. The joining of Russia to the international system "Green card" will allow the Russian insurers to arrange directly contracts for mandatory third- party insurance for automobiles for Russian drivers leaving to go abroad. The bill mandating the acquiring of medical insurance policies for foreign citizens and for individuals without citizenship but located in Russia. The government did not support the amendment on medical/health insurance of migrant workers, after referring to contradictions to other standards of this law. The bill on mandatory financial or insurance requirements for tour operators. By June 2007 Russian tour operators have implemented the new requirement of the law on tourism in the Russian Federation on the formation of financial guarantees. After a cancellation from licensed tour operators this reserve should meet contract obligations towards their clients. Approximately 95 % of the tour operators in the Russian Federations who are registered in the official register have preferred to procure the bank guarantee versus civil liability insurance policy. Amendments to the Air Laws Regulation will considerably increase the size of the insurance sums in mandatory insurance towards the liability of air carriers for the damage caused to a life, health, luggage and personal items of the passengers. Amendment on the specialization of insurers. This simplifies the solution to the problem of the separation of insurance business into "life” and "no-life" for the universal insurers. New amendments to the law of "On the Organization of the Insurance Business" will allow companies to fulfill their contractual obligations up to the time expiration of their requirement after July 1, 2007. 7 Amendment about insurance of the liability of house-builders in case of the non-fulfillment of obligations towards tenants of a residential flat building. According to bill, the house-builders and banks are required to have civil liability insurance policies, that will cover the risks of the appearance of deficiencies in the building projects, within the limits of a warranty period, against non-fulfillment or delay of satisfaction on the transfer of real estate to property owner, the non-fulfillment of the responsibility of the bank in the recovery of money for the property owner. Thus far amendments so were not accepted after the several repeated attempts to introduce them, in March they again returned to the sponsor for modifications. Amendments to the law on insurance business on accredited insurance actuary; “Insurance” amendments to the tax code introduce changes in the order of the taxation of insurance payments, and insurance payments according to the agreements of life insurance, concluded both by individuals and legal entities. Amendments to the law on insurance business require residents of the Russian Federation to insure sea risks in foreign companies in "the cases provided by federal laws" that, in particular, concerns the terms and conditions of insurance described in the Merchant Marine Code. The amendments concerning the term of limitation of actions on claims resulting from the insurance contract. The law proposes to establish a three-year term of limitation of actions under the requirements following from the contract of insurance on liability risk under claims arising from harm to life, to health, or to the property of other persons. Amendments to the law about Mandatory Third-Party Insurance for Automobiles. The most significant impact in market innovations was the simplification of procedures for the registration of road accidents, the DTP (“the European report”) and the introduction of a system for the direct settlement of claims. Offering these innovations, the insurance companies and RSA (Russian Association of Motor Insurers) assumed that improvement in the quality of services and expansion of liability would be compensated appropriately by an increase in tariffs; however, the legislature has resolved this issue in another way. As a result insurers expect sharp decrease in profitability, and, as consequence, during the year of 2008, 10-15 more companies will probably leave the market of Mandatory Third-Party Insurance for Automobiles. 8

Did I say small? Roca Redonda is real tall, but real tiny! As Frederico observed, “a small rock in a big water”. Can I spell scary? Frederico also astutely commented to me, “I have dive every site in islands. But HERE I am always especially careful.”
Where the current hits the point of the island, it sweeps to each side at a swift 3-4 knots. If that weren’t enough with which to contend, there’s a surge that whips in and out at a perpendicular to the current and it is a vertical 5-10 feet.
Obviously, we got off the surface as fast as possible! I entered with no air in my BC, as I have learned to do nearly every dive in these islands. Went quickly to 30 feet, found a rock to hold onto, which promptly broke off and I went ass-over-teakettle with the current. Managed to grab another barnacle encrusted rock at 35 feet and looked down current for Mike. The force of the current pulled my mask from my face. I was forced to grab for my mask and lost my hold again. By the time I cleared my mask, I was being tossed around by surge and current again. Got Mike’s attention and signaled that I was aborting the dive. Only 3 minutes had passed.
The dinghy drivers, Homer and Rufino, are stupendous. They were there in a flash. They had me and my equipment in the boat and were assured of my well-being. Mike and I do not regret missing this one! Some of the very experienced divers were surfacing ¼ mile out. And it was 62 degrees down there at 30 feet!
Dive masters and divers opted to not repeat a dive here, with today’s conditions. We had lunch and napped while our captain transported us to Cabo Marshall on the east side of Isabella.
This was a nice drift dive with very little current and no surge. Saw every kind of fish imaginable, tons of turtles and a huge school of barracuda. Very pleasant. After the dive we made a quick visit to a colony of flightless cormorants.
During the trip to Isabella we sighted 3 whales breaching and as we left, a very large school of small mantalike rays called mobulas surfaced to feed and bid us goodbye.
Tomorrow we dive twice in the morning. At 0700 we dive at Gordon Rock, followed by breakfast, then a land walk on Plaza Island to see the land iguanas. A shallow dive with the sea lions (sea lion “soup” promised) follows to conclude our sea sojourn. We’ll tour the Darwin research center in the afternoon.Caption

The.>Wrong, there is no statistical significance between generation of >stable cells using Linearized vs. Plasmid...OLD WIVES TALE enlightening indeed ... at hotmail.com may be, in real life things are more complicated there are different things to consider, one for example is it worth at all to respond to an anonimous letter and the rest of them are listed here: 1. linerized DNA is more recombinative then circular - fact (dont they do gene nock-outs with linear DNA?). 2. over-expression of any gene during transfection leads to cell death, linear DNA gives lower expression levels - fact that gives you two effects - lower transient expression of the selected gene and lower expression of your gene at the start. 3. linear DNA will probably polymerize (NHEJ) leading to possibly higher copy number - I think 4. method of transfection and the cell line - how many DNA molecules you introduce into your cell (level of initial expression and therefore cell killing). 5. kind of plasmid - I heard people could poduce stable cell lines based on COS7 (expresses SV40 large T antigen) transfecting them with linear DNA that contained SV40 promoter/ori - can someone confirm that?? I would very much like to know if it is true. 6. luck or lack of luck - unfortunate fact generally, I think the consensus is that it is better to linearize your expression construct, I am sure with good spirits one can do it anyway he or she wants and produce a great clone. BTW, the subject has been discussed here before (check those links and follow the responses). okay, that is getting really late, my cells are ready and I must be off good luck with your stuff, Peter ---European markets come off lows after good U.S. economic data.

Matador Ambassador / champion freeskier Drew Tabke and crew get unreal backcountry access in Alaska.
IN LATE APRIL I went to Alaska with two of my good friends from Chile — Chopo Diaz and Claudio Vicuña. Our plan was to be dropped off by a ski plane on a glacier near Glacier Bay National Park.
Once on the glacier we’d make camp and backcountry ski for about 10 days. It was the best of both worlds: mechanized assistance to get us to an incredible mountain environment, and the isolation, freedom of choice, and independence offered by camping and ski touring.

I rated this recipe last night and this morning used the leftovers to make a simple hash. I fried some pork sausage, drained it and then added the veggies and kale (chopped pretty small). I served it with scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese on top and it was totally delicious, a huge hit at my house.
This was a nice change from just plain roasted veggies. I cut the veggies a little bigger, but the cooking time was right on. When I reheated the leftovers I put a little grated Parmesan cheese on top and that was good, too. Thanks, Carole in Orlando
Roasted Vegetables With KaleNBC "Today" - Transcript
NBC "Today" Interview With Alaska Governor Sarah Palin: And now to our exclusive interview with Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. She is in Texas this morning discussing a $26 billion energy project that she's championed for her home state. She's here to talk about that and some other headlines she's been involved with in recent weeks.
Governor Palin, it's nice to see you. Good morning.
GOV. PALIN: Hey, thank you so much. Thanks for having me.
MR. LAUER: Let's talk about this project, because it's huge -- $26 billion. It's a natural gas pipeline that would connect Alaska to Canada and then to the contiguous 48 states. It's far from a done deal; I think we need to say that. And some have said this has been talked about a lot in the past and it hasn't come to fruition.
Why do you think you can get it built now?
GOV. PALIN: It's been talked a lot about in the past decades in Alaska, the need to commercialize our rich natural gas resources from the North Slope, flow them into these very hungry markets throughout North America.
Finally, though, we have a vehicle called AGIA, the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act, that can provide for the private sector enough incentives and enough protections for the resource owners -- that's the people of Alaska -- to actually see the thing come to fruition.
The nice thing about the step that was taken yesterday is the largest company in the world, Exxon, has aligned with TransCanada. TransCanada Alaska is the world's best pipeline-building company, too; companies like that, world-class, with the experience and financial backing needed, to actually see the project come to fruition. It's going to happen. And we're very excited about this development.
MR. LAUER: While you're excited, some people have had a cooler response. Mike Hawker -- and I know you know this name; he's the Republican co-chairman of the committee in Alaska, or the legislature, that writes the budget -- he was asked for his opinion of the announcement and he said, quote, "My take is what's going on here is a completely overblown media circus, that the announcement is long on ambition and short on details."
Would you like to respond to that?
GOV. PALIN: Well, that representative, along with most of the legislators in Alaska, voted very enthusiastically for AGIA to make sure that Alaska's gas would be commercialized, with the protections for the resource owners. Hawker was one who supported it. He still supports it. It's politics, Matt. And coming up here on an election year, I think a lot of the folks are positioning themselves for future runs for things --
MR. LAUER: Right.
GOV. PALIN: -- and so they have to say some things like that.
MR. LAUER: Well, but, Governor, even The Wall Street Journal questions whether we actually need this pipeline, saying that North America is in the midst of a natural gas glut right now that's driven down prices, and saying future imports are expected to be higher as some overseas producers dump their product on the U.S. market. So do we really need the pipeline?
GOV. PALIN: Absolutely short-sighted for anyone to think that we don't need this pipeline and that we don't need to flow our clean- burning natural gas from Alaska, domestic supply, into North American markets -- absolutely shortsighted.
Yep, we need that resource; much better than the alternative, and that is for America to continue to rely on foreign sources of energy to fuel our economy and heat our homes and run our businesses, reliant on foreign sources that are controlled in some cases by regimes that are volatile, dangerous, don't like America. I'd much rather see the jobs and the economic boost be provided to America. And here in Alaska, we're in a position to be able to contribute to the U.S. economy and to national security issues --
MR. LAUER: Right.
GOV. PALIN: -- by flowing our very rich sources of energy into these markets.
MR. LAUER: We will be following this project along, Governor, and we thank you for talking about it.
Can we talk about some of the other ways you've been in the news lately? And you know about this. There's been this feud this week with "Late Show" host David --
GOV. PALIN: If we must.
MR. LAUER: Oh, I know. But there's been a feud this week with David Letterman over some comments he made about your family, some jokes about your daughter in particular. I'm just curious. How did you hear about the comments and the jokes? Were you watching, or did someone tell you about them?
GOV. PALIN: No, the next day I had an interview with John Ziegler on his new radio show, and he asked me about a comment that Letterman had made regarding my appearance as a slutty flight attendant. And my first thought was, "Hey, don't disparage flight attendants. They work hard. We love them. How condemning of them. Don't say such a thing."
And then I found out later that -- the comment that was made about statutory rape of my 14-year-old daughter Willow, knowing that crossed the line, and then others chiming in, other comments that Letterman has made; just, you know, quite, I think, a sad commentary on where we are as a culture, as a society, to chuckle and laugh through comments such as he had made the other night. I think it's quite unfortunate.
MR. LAUER: Since David Letterman's here, let me just say that he did not mention Willow by name, and he then went on to say he was not referring to your 14-year-old daughter. I do want to read this statement that you released --
GOV. PALIN: And Matt? And Matt?
MR. LAUER: Go ahead.
GOV. PALIN: Okay, Matt,, you know, regardless, as he did --
MR. LAUER: You issued a statement --
GOV. PALIN: -- and to think that that's acceptable.
MR. LAUER: Governor, at the end of your statement, you said that "A joke like this contributes to the atrociously high rate of sexual exploitation of minors by older men who use and abuse others."
GOV. PALIN: Yep.
MR. LAUER: Now, it was a joke. It was probably, by most standards, in bad taste.
But can you really connect the dots to criminal activity the way you did in that statement?
GOV. PALIN: I connect the dots to a degrading statement made about young women, and that does contribute to some acceptance of abuse of young women. Let me read to you something that I received in the middle of the night, an e-mail from somebody who's not a known feminist, not someone who is an activist, but this, I think, speaks to this issue.
This person wrote that, hey, the women organizations across America, they are starting to rise up and say, "Enough is enough," and that was a ridiculous comment. And, yeah, it was a so-called joke, but it wasn't funny.
This e-mail says, "Every male organization, civic, religious, et cetera, should rise up and shout in defense of their daughters, their sisters, their mothers. We're in a position to encourage the whole country to take a stand against the disrespect shown to females. No wonder girls have such low self-esteem when people laugh at the innuendoes and downright crudeness of comments made to and about them. Shame on all of us --
MR. LAUER: When you --
GOV. PALIN: -- if we haven't had the nerve to walk out or at least boo when a so-called comedian makes such a comment."
MR. LAUER: When you were asked if you might appear on David Letterman's show to hash all this out, your spokesperson issued a statement and said, ?
GOV. PALIN: Hey, take it however you want to take it. It is a comment that came from the heart that Willow no doubt would want to stay away from David Letterman after he made such a comment. And you can interpret that however you want to interpret it.
MR. LAUER: Well, but is that not perhaps in bad taste also, Governor, if you're, you know, suggesting that a 62-year-old man --
GOV. PALIN: No, it's not in bad taste.
MR. LAUER: -- couldn't be trusted?
GOV. PALIN: It's not in bad taste. Hey, maybe he couldn't be trusted because Willow's had enough of this type of comments, and maybe Willow would want to react to him in a way that maybe would catch him off-guard. That's one way to interpret such a comment.
MR. LAUER: He's tried to explain --
GOV. PALIN: But the problem is, it's not --
MR. LAUER: -- this. Does he owe you an apology?
GOV. PALIN: Here's the problem, Matt -- the double standard that has been applied here. One, let's talk politically the double standard..
But, here again, the double standard when it comes to acceptance of a celebrity being able to get away --
MR. LAUER: And I would agree with that. And I'm not sure that you can be so easy to say that he's kind of that thread that is throughout our culture, that makes it sound like it's okay to talk about young girls in that away, where it's kind of okay, accepted and funny to talk about statutory rape.
MR. LAUER: Right.
GOV. PALIN: It's not cool. It's not funny.
MR. LAUER: Let me move on, then. And a lot has been made about the future of the Republican Party after a disappointing election and who's going to be the face of that party. Your name has been on a list with people like Newt Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh and Dick Cheney. And it's very well understood that you perhaps are the biggest superstar when it comes to fund-raising in the party now. If people want to make money, they get you to an event; that event makes a lot of money.
Does that translate to you being the future of the GOP?
GOV. PALIN: No, absolutely not necessarily. You know, I want to help. I want to be able to help the cause. And the cause is to get Americans to remember that big government is not the answer. That's not the way that we're going to secure our nation and progress our nation and get our economy back on the right track.
And we're going to see a lot of manifestations, I believe, of actions that the federal government -- that it's taking right now that will actually hurt our economy and take away the private sector's and our families' opportunities to grow and progress and prosper, keep more of what we earn so that we can meet our own priorities instead of having federal government come in and meet priorities for us.
So, no, not necessarily me. I don't think I need any kind of title in order to effect change. I think there's a lot of agreement within the party --
MR. LAUER: Do you think you deserve a shot, based on --
GOV. PALIN: -- right now, though.
MR. LAUER: Based on what you brought to the last campaign, do you think you at least deserve the right of first refusal in terms of being the face of the party?
GOV. PALIN: Oh, heck, no. Nobody's entitled to that right of approval. There's no entitlement that's accepted, I believe, in our party. And that's another nice thing about the principles of the GOP. You know, you have to walk the walk and not just talk the talk. Your actions have to speak louder than words. Your accomplishments have to speak for what it is that you stand for. And, no, nobody's entitled to any kind of front-running position in the GOP.
MR. LAUER: Governor Sarah Palin. Governor, it's nice to see you again. I appreciate you stopping and spending some time with us this morning.
GOV. PALIN: Thank you so much. Have a great day.
MR. LAUER: You too.
END.

Cook 15 mins
This recipe is an updated version of #76004 on this site. As a result of the comments on this recipe, this reworking turned out to be some of the tastiest cookies I've ever had. Recipe yield is too small!
Ingredients Nutrition
- 3⁄4 cup butter
- 1⁄2 cup sugar (preferably turbinado or demerarra)
- 2 tablespoons orange zest
- 1⁄2 cup pumpkin
- 1 egg yolk, beaten
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 2 1⁄2 cups whole wheat pastry flour
- 1⁄4 teaspoon salt
- 1⁄4 teaspoon nutmeg (scant)
- 1⁄2 teaspoon clove (scant)
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 2 teaspoons cinnamon
Directions
- Cream butter and sugar.
- Blend in flavorings: orange zest, salt, cinnamon, clove, ginger, nutmeg, vanilla.
- Incorporate yolk, then flour.
- Divide in two balls, wrap separately and chill at least 1/2 hour.
- Use cookie cutters on dough rolled 1/4 inch thick (thinner for crispy cookies, thicker for chewier).
- Bake 15 minutes at 375-degrees.
- Frost with any icing. For Haloween we used powdered sugar (maybe 3 cups? Sorry, don't know quantity) mixed with cream cheese (2 Tablespoons) flavored with orange zest (1/2 teaspoon) and maple syrup (1/4 cup). Add milk to moisten to proper consistency (just add by the dropful; a little goes a long way and you want the resulting icing thick enough not to run off the cookies). Apply sprinkles to wet frosting so they harden on top.

(( BLOCK-PARTY )) // GOGO //Yesterday Scott and I spent almost the entire day in downtown. One of our many stops throughout the day (promise to share more about these stops later) was Stinkweeds Record Store. This local record shop has been around for ages, and is owned buy one of the coolest ladies in town.
Scott and I went to Stinkweeds to pick up our tickets for the Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin show, and also to see if they had the most recent Neon Trees album. Generally Stinkweeds is known to carry CD's and records from almost any indie band you can think of. While there I realized that my outfit was supporting this indie influence (tweed mini-skirt and moccs? yes!), and figured it would be best to take a few shots in front of the exposed brick that lines the back side of the building.
Outfit:
Shirt: Target
Necklace: Vintage typewriter J charm (wish you could see it better)
Mini-skirt: Gap
Grey footless tights: c/o We Love Colors
Moccs: Minnetonkas
Outfit:
Sunglasses: Ray bans
Flannel: Levi's
Jeans: Levi's
Shoes: Lacoste
Both Scott and I have been going to Stinkweeds since we were in our teen years. It was always the place to get the best music, and to see amazing bands for free (remember all the great in-store shows they used to have PHX residents?).
Scott has a leather pouch that he wears every day. It generally holds his ipod, and sometimes other little things in the tiny pocket. Over a year ago he found it at a local Goodwill and the cashier gave it to him for free because there was no price on it. This pouch has become quite the conversation starter, and almost every day Scott gets asked about it.
The other day I picked up this new pair of moccs. I've had my previous pair for almost two years now and they were pretty worn out. To me, moccs are the most comfy pair of shoes you can wear, and generally I like to wear them with everything.
This pair of Lacoste shoes is one of Scott's favorites. He got them for his birthday from me a few years ago, and has taken great care of them to keep them looking nice.
Also, I've found that I don't smile in a lot of my photos. I've figured this is pretty much a sin since I went through months of headgear (oh yes, I said it), a year of braces, and eight years of wearing my retainer (I still wear it every night). Here's to smiling more.
Do you have a favorite record shop in your area? What's it like?
-Chelsea
i live right down the street from a pretty awesome record store that has great in stores. but the BEST record store in dfw is in the middle of the metro and it is literally a warehouse. full of awesomeness! you could easily spend $300 in there on any given day.
you two just look so perfect! I love your shoes <3
Aw. This makes me miss my moccasins! I have almost 5 pairs back in utah! Hope you are doing well! <3
I'm loving the moccasins! They look very comfy. If there is an awesome record store near my college campus, I haven't found it yet. My favorite clothing store here sells albums and stuff, but not of my taste in music. :(
Kristin- That store sounds amazing!
Saving- Awwwh, thanks love :]
Rachael- Five pairs? Oh my! Hope you get them back soon!
Kenoshia- Thank you! They are SOO comfy! Hope you find a neat record store soon!
What a cute skirt! And you make me miss my moccs. I wore my pair all the way out, like, holes in the toes out. Maybe it's time for a new pair.
You and your bf are just too cute. I love following your adventures!
Cute tights! ;)
My favorite record shops in Miami are Uncle Sam's Music and Sweat Records
I have those Minnetonkas and they're my FAVORITE pair of shoes. So comfy.Agbonlahor and Walcott stay with Under-21s
Theo Walcott and Gabriel Agbonlahor have travelled with the England Under-21 squad to Portugal ahead of their Euro 2009 qualifier in Agueda on Tuesday.
Injuries to Wayne Rooney, Michael Owen and Emile Heskey has left senior boss Steve McClaren short on attacking options for the crucial clash against Croatia the following day, with Walcott and Agbonlahor currently focusing on the under-21s.
Tottenham striker Darren Bent, who played for the under-21s two qualifying campaigns ago, is another option for McClaren after Israel's win against Russia put England back in control as they look to reach Austria and Switzerland next summer.
Qualifying for Stuart Pearce's youngsters has not been as traumatic as it has for the seniors, and they protect a 100% record in Portugal.
A point in Agueda will see them reach the play-offs for their finals in Sweden.
Agbonlahor, who has played in every qualifier this season like Walcott, suffered a slight knee injury against Bulgaria on Friday but Pearce is still hopeful the Aston Villa striker will play against Portugal.
Pearce has been using graduation to the seniors as an incentive for his youngsters, and Craig Gardner is hoping McClaren's men can complete the job - because it will put an end to Villa boss Martin O'Neill being linked with being England boss.
'Hopefully we'll qualify and I think we have a great chance,' said Gardner. 'Obviously the gaffer will stay at Villa, and that's how we want it.'
O'Neill has shaped a squad at Villa Park full of young English talent, with the likes of Gardner and Agbonlahor impressing.
'The gaffer likes to bring in young players, he's signed under-21s from last season like Scott Carson, Ashley Young and Nigel Reo-Coker,' added Gardner.
'He gives us a lot of praise in training and has a laugh as well. He has to take a lot of credit for getting the best out of the young players at the club.'

Definitely most people’s favorite Obey print of late right here, “Evolve To Devolve” is ready to drop sometime Friday. It’s an 18″ x 24″ screenprint, has an edition of 450, and is $45. These will go up sometime during Friday, August 29. Keep your eyes on ObeyGiant.com.
That looks like a great print. I’ve been trying to get my hands on the past couple of prints, but don’t know when the best time to hit the website is. As I have a corporate job, it’s not easy for me to leave the window open and constantly refresh the page. Any clues on when the prints go on sale? I liked it better when it was at noon.
not so inspired by this one….am i missing something
tip for purchasing on website….F5 unfortunately….no real time regularity
Barf
i am in the same boat last time i tried to get one it took me 45 minutes trying to load the page go through paypal and all that junk to just be told “the item in your Cart is SOLD OUT”.
these sunsets are making me thirsty.
Hopefully I can get 2 of this one too!
I HAVE NOT YET DECIDED WHETHER OR NOT I WILL PURCHASE THIS PRINT.
I really love this one. I think It has a lot of meaning, i would love to one.
Is expresso bean down?
I liked this one enough to pluck down the 60 bones. Can’t wait to see it
easiest OG purchase in a long time
How do you buy these prints? I have been trying for 6 months with no luck. It seems like as soon as they go up the website goes down and when it comes back up they are sold out. Guess these are for the die hard flippers only.
In for 2, again!
i am now 0\3 everytime i try to get one get to paypal send the money them BAAAMMM Timeout!
oh well 4th times a charm i guess …
Error establishing a database connection. I am sick of Obey’s crappy servers and bad database issues. Wow! This time I made it to the cart and paypal before it timed out! Okay I am now 0/6 on this. With every release I get more angry with Obey. Get with the times and update your website. the server obviously can’t handle the load.
I got conf… but it took a few tries through paypal… email conf though… hope I don’t get a refund…
E…it’s still up…keep trying. You gotta be persistant
dkn…they have raised prices so that they can fix the technology issues
for those who having troubles…
I went through paypal and clicked sumbit and got some page of webcode. Fearing the worst I was discouraged, but checked email and received an invoice! So despite getting the error, the order was still processed.
Good luck to u all..
I can’t get one!!! Anyone else getting “Sorry, the shop is inaccessible temporarily. Please try again later.”??? I’ve never been able to get through the rush for these
i got 2 the pay pal contineu screen twice and still no dice..but they wer up till now 3.08 indiana time

OUT OF STOCK. I got one…but was trying for a 2nd for my bro…guess he’s SOL.
OUT OF STOCK. I’ll never get one :'(
i had it in my cart but it was sold out? was on the site as they released it and no go after paypal also
ME…try emailing them and explain your situation. I am sure they will help you out with purchasing one if you had one in your cart.
I got one if any of you wanna make an offer
they don’t care if you had one in your cart, there were probably 1,000 other people in the exact same spot. plus, chances are good that if you’d gone all the way through it would have kicked it out of your cart as it was already sold out.
Got one, and they didn’t charge me for shipping either…
Payment To Obey Giant Art, Inc. Aug. 29, 2008 Completed Details -$45.00 USD $0.00 USD
Hopefully, they ship it.
meatloaf,
having one in your cart means absolutely nothing. once it’s sold out then it’s sold out, no matter who many are still in people’s carts…. you can email them all you want but it won’t change the fact that it’s sold out.
JUST IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING, I DECIDED TO PURCHASE THIS PRINT.
yea i had it in cart, got through paypal and it crashed. wouldn’t go back and then it sold out. i hate my life.
I got duality of humanity 3 in my cart payed for it got a confirmation email they took the money and then a week later they refunded the money to my paypal acount no explanation . not going to be trying again

Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I first would like to thank my dear friend and colleague, Doctor Donna Christensen of the Virgin Islands for anchoring this special order hour. I cannot think of a more fitting person to lead us in a discussion of health care tonight than Dr. Christensen, who is not only a medical doctor, but also the co-chair of the CBC's Health and Wellness Taskforce along with Congressman Danny Davis of Illinois.
Dr. Christensen has been at the forefront of our fight to ensure that health care reform makes significant strides toward eliminating racial and ethnic disparities, and achieving disparities for residents of the U.S. territories. Thank you, Dr. Christensen for your leadership and your hard work.
I'm Congresswoman Barbara Lee of the Ninth Congressional District of California and chairwoman of the 42 member strong Congressional Black Caucus. I stand here brimming with pride and joy because of what we did here last night after such a long journey that began many decades ago.
Yesterday morning members of the Congressional Black Caucus attended church services together, where we were reminded of the moral imperative to reform health care.
Strengthened by the power of prayer we forged ahead with clarity of purpose, courage and determination, undeterred by the losing hateful rhetoric and threatening tactics of anti-health care protesters.
Last night, my colleagues and I cast a historic and monumental vote to improve the health and wellness of millions of Americans who suffer because they are uninsured and under-insured and because of massive gaps in our nation's health care system.
I spend a lot of time in emergency rooms with my 85 year old mother and my sister who has Multiple Sclerosis. I see these people--the uninsured. They are desperate. Many are hard working people who may have lost their jobs, or simply fallen on hard times, or have never even had the opportunity to make their way in society. Some of them can't hold a job because they are chronically ill. This is simply unacceptable.
So, the members of the Congressional Black Caucus.
Throughout the long and arduous process culminating in the historic vote last night, many members of the CBC worked tirelessly to make sure that this bill holds insurance companies accountable and included a number of cost-saving provisions. We were vocal advocates for provisions in the bill to combat health disparities, illnesses and diseases that disproportionately affect our community.
The statistics are startling, but they are clear:
Nearly one in five African Americans (19%) is without health care insurance.
African Americans in general spend a higher percentage of their income on health care costs compared to their white counterparts (16.5% vs. 12.2%). However despite spending a larger share of their income on medical care, African Americans face continuing health care disparities.
African Americans also tend to reside in areas without hospitals or hospitals that have limited resources and may affect the quality care they offer. This is particularly a problem for hospitals in predominately African American communities where Medicaid reimbursements are low, charity cares is higher, and there is a shortage of health care providers who find it more difficult to maintain a practice.
African Americans suffer from higher percentages of chronic diseases such as heart disease, kidney disease and diabetes which are perpetuated by a lack of access to quality care. Currently, 48% of African American adults suffer from a chronic disease compared to 39% of the general population.
To those who suffer from those health disparities, our vote last night carried significance similar to the passage of the Civil Rights Act in that it fulfills a dream that has been elusive for far too long and for far too many Americans.
Among the key provisions in the legislation that CBC members fought to have included are:
Expanded support for community health centers, which play a vital role in expanding access to preventive and other care in our nation's most vulnerable communities.
Key health equity provisions: greater support for programs that will increase the racial and ethnic diversity in the nation's health workforce, as well as improved data collection so that we can better measure health inequities and develop solutions to end all health disparities.
Strengthening the existing Office of Minority Health at HHS, creating new Offices of Minority. Health across HHS agencies, and establishing the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities at NIH as an Institute.
Inclusion of coverage for residents of the U.S. territories, including a significant infusion of new Medicaid dollars, as well as access to the Exchange so that Americans in the territories will have access to affordable, high-quality health insurance plans.
The bill:
Expansion of community health centers.
This bill makes several immediate reforms that will directly improve the health and wellness of millions of Americans. Some of those provisions are:
Offers tax credits to small businesses to purchase coverage;
Provides relief for seniors who reach the Medicare prescription drug donut hole;
Provides immediate access to insurance for Americans who are uninsured because of a pre-existing condition through a temporary high-risk pool;
Requires new plans to cover preventive services and immunizations without cost-sharing;
Requires new plans to cover an enrollee's dependent children until age 26;
Prohibits pre-existing condition exclusions for children in all new plans;
Prohibits individual plans from dropping people from coverage when they get sick.
I could go on because the list of all the good things in this bill are many.
So to put it simply, this bill is a victory not only for our constituents, but for all Americans because it will make us a stronger and healthier nation.

Angelina Multeni, who emigrated from the Philippines in 1969 and has lived in Arlington for more than three years, has no health insurance and her medications cost in excess of $1,000 a month. But at the clinic she receives free health care services and medication and the advice of volunteer doctors and nurses.
“I can’t afford to pay for my medication,” said Multeni, who works three times a week as a baby-sitter and whose husband drives a taxi cab in Arlington. “Without the clinic I don’t know what I would do. I might be dead already.”
Every week dozens of low-income, uninsured county residents like Multeni come to the Arlington Free Clinic for regular check-ups, specialty care, mental health counseling and to receive free medication from its licensed pharmacy. The clinic is a private, nonprofit organization and provided services to more than 1,400 residents in 2004. Five times a week the clinic holds a four-hour session, during which an average of 30 patients seek medical treatment and guidance. The pharmacy wrote 16,000 prescriptions last year.
“I love the spirit of the clinic because everyone here is working to help those who don’t have enough money to pay to help themselves,” said Caroline Hufford, who volunteers once or twice a month. “We do our very best to help people through the worst circumstances.”
To qualify for the free services, individuals must be county residents for six months, have proof of living in the United States for at least one year, have no medical insurance and meet income requirements, which work out to approximately $29,000 a year for a family of four, said Executive Director Nancy Pallesen.
“Every time I come here I feel like I’m the only patient they have,” said John Murray, who came to the clinic last year with agonizing stomach pains and was diagnosed with acid-reflux disease.
IN THE EARLY 1990s members of the Arlington Medical Society came together to find a solution to the growing number of Arlington residents who had no health insurance and could not afford to pay for their medication.
“We had a lot of immigrants coming into the county at that time and people were losing their jobs as the economy was going south,” Pallesen said.
A committee was formed to determine the feasibility of establishing a free clinic and in 1994 the first general medical sessions began at Thomas Jefferson Middle School. In 1998 the clinic moved to Columbia Pike. It is currently housed in the Ballston Medical Center during construction on a new Colombia Pike facility, due to open in 2008.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 11 percent of Arlington residents possess no health insurance. More than 60 percent of the clinic’s patients are Hispanic and Pallesen estimates up to 90 percent speak English as a second language. Bilingual staff members are on hand at all times to help translate.
Virginia Hospital Center is the clinic’s largest supporter, and supplies lab, testing and x-ray services for patients — and many of the hospital’s doctors and nurses volunteer at the clinic.
Last year 700 patients used the clinic’s mental and behavioral health assistance and hundreds more took part in its wellness education programs. Many patients do not know the basic components of living a healthy lifestyle and the clinic strives to get them to take better care of their bodies, said Paula Potts, the clinic’s development officer for foundation and benefit support.
Multeni said the clinic staff has helped her begin a strict regiment of dieting and exercise, and calls her frequently to ensure she is staying on her program.
“They tell me how to eat, drink and exercise,” she said. “I’m following all of their advice.”
More than 500 individuals volunteered at the clinic last year, including 145 physicians. The volunteers are “the back bone of the clinic and what make it work,” Potts said.
“The volunteers do anything you ask of them and are so willing to learn,” said Kate Wilson, director of clinical administration. “They make the patients feel so welcomed and really care about what happens here.”
THE CLINIC RECEIVES the majority of its funding from grants, with 22 active grants from a variety of government sources, companies, other nonprofit organizations and faith-based groups. But it is a constant challenge to win grants, especially in a market as competitive as the Washington Metropolitan region — where there are a multitude of nonprofit health organizations.
“It’s a precarious existence,” Potts said. “We never sit back and say we are in great shape. We’re always looking for new sources of funding.”
The clinic raises almost one-third of its yearly budget during its annual fall benefit gala, which was held on Oct. 22 at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Tysons Corner. More than 640 people attended the black-tie event, from which the clinic netted $350,000.
“It was our best year yet and we were very pleased with the turnout,” Pallesen said. “We were a little worried people wouldn’t support us because all of the resources going down to the Gulf Coast.”
The clinic is stepping up its outreach program and soliciting donations throughout the holiday season, but with so many other charities asking for money this time of year it can be difficult to raise a large sum.
“It’s a never-ending struggle,” Potts said. “The costs of providing medical care continue to escalate and we have to increase our efforts to keep up.” --- Comment #7 from James Graham <jgraham@opera.com> 2010-03-15 10:53:45 --- As the original reporter, I don't think this issue is substantially related to the @summary issue.

What the broadcaster calls its "most ambitions global wildlife series ever" will air simultaneously in 140 countries (more on that bit later) starting Sunday May 6th, then every Thursday and Sunday for three weeks. The plan is to track animals in seven different locations around the world in real time as they struggle for survival and broadcast it all in HD. One segment features Top Gear's Richard Hammond following a pride of lions across southern Kenya, while another will track black bears in Minnesota. The bad news? If you're in the US or Canada you're not on that 140 country list and won't be seeing any of this live. We're not sure if there's time to make this a campaign issue in the 2012 presidential election but we figure that, or at least bugging BBC America (while we're on the subject -- where's our global iPlayer?) is worth a try. Check after the break for a press release with all the details on where and when it is airing, as well as a trailer.
Update: While we won't be getting the live simulcast, BBC's Paul Deane dropped in a comment below noting it will air the next day on National Geographic Wild retitled as 24/7 Wild. We haven't located a program description yet, but there are already listings in the schedule starting May 7th -- schedule your DVRs accordingly.

This May the Earth's most charismatic animals will be followed day and night by award winning BBC Natural History Unit film makers, international wildlife specialists and BBC viewers around the world* - for an epic global animal soap opera Planet Earth Live where nature writes the script.
Click to tweet: The most ambitious BBC global wildlife series ever undertaken #Planetearthlive to air globally in 140 countries
Filming in six different time zones, across five diverse continents, in seven locations using spectacular cinematography, real-time filming techniques and up-close HD wildlife footage – the young animals' struggle for survival during the critical month of May will air across BBC channels around the world. The lives of the Earth's youngest animals truly hang in the balance over the course of the series including baby elephants in Kenya, black bears in Minnesota, macaque monkeys in Sri Lanka, meerkats in South Africa, grey whales in the Pacific and lion cubs in the Masaai Mara.
Anchored in Southern Kenya, Top Gear's Richard Hammond will fulfill his childhood dream as he tracks the Marsh pride of lions with specialist camerawoman Sophie Darlington. The group of lions, made famous by the BBC's Big Cat Diary, are reaching a crucial time in their history thanks to a pride takeover. A lioness has already escaped with the cubs but with limited food, their survival remains threatened.
Meanwhile over 13,000 kilometres away in the wild Northwoods of Minnesota, Julia Bradbury will get up close and personal with one of the most feared predators on the planet – black bears. Julia joins wildlife expert Dr Lynn Rogers as bear families emerge from their dens with new born cubs. On the Pacific coast Julia will also follow the epic migration of grey whales and their calves running the gauntlet of killer whales.
From the team behind the global phenomenon Frozen Planet , Planet Earth Live will simultaneously broadcast to a global audience** via BBC Knowledge (Australia, New Zealand, Africa, Poland, the Nordic Region, Asia and Italy) BBC Entertainment (India), BBC HD (Latin America, the Nordic Region, Poland and Turkey) and in a selection of European countries on the BBC Global iPlayer***.
David Weiland, SVP Programming and TV Channels comments: "We are the only network in the world which can broadcast the biggest wildlife series ever undertaken to an international audience, across multiple platforms. The culmination of ten years development and digital technological innovation from the BBC's Natural History Unit means our audiences will be a part of this truly global viewing experience, where even the show's producers don't know what's going to happen next, to this cast of truly incredible animals".
Planet Earth Live is the latest synchronised broadcast from BBC Worldwide, reinforcing the network's commitment to stage bold and ambitious global television events, showcasing the very best of British programming and UK talent to the World. Following on from The Royal Wedding in 2011, Sport Relief in March 2012; Planet Earth Live is the second global moment for our international audiences to share this year. Planet Earth Live will be closely followed this summer by London Calling - a unique season of programming celebrating the music, fashion, art, culture and history of Britain's capital city; led by live coverage from the spectacular Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

Spring fever continues to pummel primetime, with most firstrun shows — even hits like “Modern Family” and “Glee,” in their returns — at or near season-low levels last week.It also remains a challenging time for new series looking to establish themselves, though ABC launched “Don’t Trust the B in Apt. 23″ to pretty good numbers thanks to its lead-in from “Modern Family,” which despite lower numbers was the week’s top scripted show among young adults. The Alphabet also saw OK perfs from “Scandal” in its second week and “GCB” in its sixth, while CBS saw its cop show “NYC 22″ open modestly and NBC’s new comedy “Best Friends Forever” looked weak in its second. It’s been years since a scripted series launched in April went on to become a ratings hit, so the shows trying to establish an audience right now are certainly fighting an uphill battle. One returning show that is thriving despite the distractions that accompany spring is HBO’s second-year drama “Game of Thrones,” which was cable’s top primetime scripted show last week in both young adults and total viewers. Overall last week, Fox rode “American Idol” to a victory among young adults, with its 2.4 rating/7 share in adults 18-49 followed by CBS (2.1/6), ABC (1.8/5), NBC (1.7/5) and Univision (1.5/4), according to Nielsen estimates. Fox tied CBS for the lead in adults 25-54, while the Eye led easily in total viewers. “Idol” claimed the week’s top spots on the 18-49 ranker with its performance show (5.0/14 in 18-49, 16.81m) and results seg (4.3/13, 15.81m). The Fox vet has been TV’s top-rated music contest for five straight weeks now, after lagging NBC’s “The Voice” in February. “Glee” returned from a six-week break with solid numbers for this time of year (2.7/8, 6.76m), placing second in its Tuesday slot. The stronger lead-in also helped 9 p.m.’s “New Girl” (2.8/7, 5.23m) rise from its low of the previous week. Top scores for CBS came from Monday comedy anchors “Two and a Half Men” (3.6/9, 10.40m) and “How I Met Your Mother” (3.5/11, 8.00m), with the latter one of only two scripted programs to do better than a 10 share among adults 18-49 last week. Also, “NCIS” (3.1/9, 17.66m) was the week’s No. 1 drama in 18-49, 25-54 and total viewers. The net, which is considering an expansion of its Thursday comedy lineup next fall, tried a “Big Bang Theory” repeat Thursday at 9 and it narrowly led its half-hour (3.1/8 10.21m). And an hour later, “Person of Interest,” the net’s current Thursday 9 p.m. show, looked good in a repeat at 10 (1.8/5, 8.58m). CBS preemed “NYC 22″ to lackluster numbers on Sunday (1.5/4, 8.86m), though it did retain most of its “Good Wife” lead-in (1.8/5, 10.16m). ABC welcomed back “Modern Family” (4.2/11, 10.35m) after three weeks of repeats, and the show emerged as the week’s No. 3 series in 18-49, and No. 1 among scripted shows. It helped launch “Don’t Trust the B in Apt. 23″ to solid numbers (2.9/7, 6.91m), tying for 14th on the week in the demo. Thursday newbie “Scandal” held steady in its second week (2.0/6, 7.28m), airing out of “Grey’s Anatomy” (2.9/8, 8.85m). The net’s new take on “Titanic” sank, with Saturday’s three-hour segment doing a 3 share in 18-49 and Sunday’s hourlong conclusion doing a 2. On Sunday it led into “GCB” (1.5/4, 4.43m), which took a hit as a result. NBC was paced by “The Voice” (4.0/11, 10.52m), the frame’s No. 4 show, and also saw improved numbers for the show’s Tuesday results seg (3.5/9, 9.00m). Also, “Celebrity Apprentice” was on the rise Sunday (2.2/6, 6.66m). Otherwise, it was slow going for the Peacock, with “The Office” its top scripted skein (2.2/6, 4.39m). HBO’s “Thrones” held steady (1.8/4, 3.77m), which was good enough to put it ahead of other scripted cable originals for the week, with BET’s “The Game” (1.2/3, 2.26m) and FX’s season finale of “Justified” (1.1/3, 2.66m) coming closest in 18-49. Faring well in its second week was Lifetime’s “The Client List” (1.0/3, 2.85m), which built on its “Army Wives” lead-in (0.9/2, 2.91m) in all key demos. At AMC, “Mad Men” (2.69m) and “The Killing” (1.81m) were down a bit week to week.With Boomvang Creative Group, you’re harnessing the power of words. To tell your story. To create a buzz.

The map of the city makes radiation data much more easily available to consumers – which is key to figuring out the payback time on a system.
Tue, May 19, 2009 at 10:14 AM
If you look closely at the San Francisco solar map and click on the little red dots, which represent the SF Public Utility Commission’s monitoring stations, you can see how much solar radiation a particular system has been receiving month to month. (More data from the monitoring stations is available here.) The consolidated solar map was created by a Colorado-based engineering services company called CH2M Hill, which is now being funded by the U.S. Department of Energy to provide similar solar initiatives for 25 cities across the country. The company’s techniques include detailed local assessments of rooftop quality – for example, the presence of things like air conditioning units and ducts, the direction of the sun, the roof’s slant, and the shadows cast by other structures – to cut down the uncertainties in planning a site survey. So you enter an address into the mapping tool, and up pops an estimate of that location’s solar potential: projections on the amount of electricity produced, the electricity savings, and the resulting carbon savings. This company release includes the full city list.
Another interesting company is also taking on the renewable-energy resource mapping challenge – 3Tier, based in Seattle, just launched a comprehensive solar radiation map of the Western Hemisphere, apparently at 3 times the resolution of existing U.S. solar radiation maps. The solar mapping, which is ongoing, is part of the company’s Remapping the World initiative, which seeks to capture and model the energy potential for solar, wind, and hydro installations across the world, country by country. Last March, it released its comprehensive U.S. wind potential map.

Basically Kidda's a bit like Marmite; you'll either love him or hate him.
Elle J Small 2008
Happy-go-lucky; feelgood; summery: these are just a few of the words that spring to mind when pressing play on Kidda's debut album. Caught somewhere between funk, pop, hip-hop and old skool rave, Going Up is the perfect soundtrack to this summer's festivals. Pop it in your car stereo for the journey down or load it onto your iPod for a private tent shindig.
Kidda has managed to coordinate the unthinkable as umpteen uplifting genres join force for a massive party, all under one roof. The featuring artists alone (Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody, The Beat Nut's Psycho Les and the almighty Blak Twang) are proof of this diversity.
If you're a dance floor bunny, then Under The Sun will undoubtedly be your highlight. An uplifting floor-filler, but with added bleeps and freaky reverb, this acid house throwback is sure to be a firm winner with club DJs. Meanwhile Doo Whot will tickle avant-garde hip-hop heads' fancies, with slick rhymes (courtesy of Blak Twang and Lomax) and a beat The Teletubbies could breakdance to. On opening number, Strong Together, Kidda, AKA Brighton boy Ste McGregor, has created the ultimate credible, radio-friendly gem; an upbeat, sing-a-along anthem.
Just a smidgen of lowlights arise: the overuse of effects being the most notable. And while Going Up's blatant and intended cheesiness appeals to this particular scribe, more straight-laced musos may find it all a bit too camp and annoying. Basically Kidda's a bit like Marmite; you'll either love him or hate him.Have you ever seen a chimpanzee? Take a look at this dilemma..

Take a look at this dilemma.. By counting off, you can quickly locate the median. You may also notice the importance of lining up the numbers in columns so that you can quickly see how many data items there are per row.
If our situation had used numbers in the hundreds, then the hundreds would have become the largest stem. If it had been in the thousands, then the thousands would have been the largest stem. You get the idea!
If we had been given two sets of data, then we could have made a double stem-and-leaf plot!
Use this data set to answer the following questions.
Example A
Which stem would have the most leaves?
Solution: 20's
Example B
Would you use stems in the ones or tens?
Solution: Tens
Example C
Which stem would have the least leaves?
Solution: 40's
Now let's go back to the dilemma from the beginning of the Concept..
Vocabulary
- Stem-and-Leaf Plots
- a visual display of data that takes the largest base ten of a value and separates it by large bases and smaller values in the data.
- Double Stem-and-Leaf Plots
- Stem-and-leaf plots that show two different sets of data on the same display by organizing according to stems and leaves of base ten values.
Guided Practice
Here is one for you to try on your own.
Create a stem-and-leaf plot
Now we need to build a stem-and-leaf plot. We can begin by organizing the data.
The stem for this plot could be either the ones place or the tens place. If we use the ones place, it would require 24 rows. That’s too many to be useful. We should, then, use the tens place.
The stem-and-leaf plot is complete.

Cheryl Reid, founder and CEO of Lotus Records, is proud she took the leap in performing her dance tune Move Your Sexy Body.
"So many songs are about lost love and betrayal. I appreciate that style but I don't always want to feel like I'm going to cry or go knock on someone's door." Cheryl laughed and countered with her view. "I believe we need more tunes that are lighter, sexy, and let people dance the night away and put away those negative thoughts when the song is playing," she told me.
Her recording is proof she takes the advice she gives to new artists she scouts for her independent label with distribution through Universal Music Group: be serious about your career and create with passion.
Move Your Sexy Body was written and produced by Wirlie Morris and was inspired by Cheryl's questions on handling her femininity in her personal life and in the workplace.
"I started taking pole dancing classes and it released a lot of stress and brought out the erotic feelings in me. As women grow older, we set aside those feelings and think other things are more important than ourselves.
"Taking the classes showed me what sexy is about and that's being yourself and full of confidence and sex not being a chore."
"A lot of women put on the male hat in the business world and by the time you get home, you've lost a sense of being feminine."
Cheryl's personal confidence is an attitude she wants to pass along to new artists with raw talent who are willing to work hard. "You may be discouraged if others say you don't have what it takes for a musical career, but it only takes one person to believe in you."
Music industry success means having a good product combined with effective promotion to build a fan base. An artist can't sit still and wait for others to put out the effort. They have to move. In Cheryl Reid's world, one can work hard and still be sexy.

well, turco was taken out of retirement. not fair. fernandez, when healthy, was very good. and even guys like alex auld were okay. i certainly don't think the goalies are made by the system, but it does help their save percentage numbers. in the cup season, the bruins allowed the second most shots in the NHL, yet, they allowed 189, second fewest only to vancouver (180). Thomas had a lot to do with that, but it's a trend in CJs system. a lot of outside shots, from non traditional scoring angles are taken because it's pretty hard to get in the slot with the puck. It doesn't make the goalie, but it certainly helps the save percentage stat.
Not disagreeing with you to a point. A good D can limit quality scoring chances for sure.
However, at the end of the day the goalie still needs to make the save. Some are simply better at this than others, regardless of the system in front of them.In concerns to the regard of humanity and things of the like, I being a human male have discovered some startling secrets about humanity and its behavioral standards. Along the coast of lesser seen shores hope beckons like a hollow cry of wind out an old oak tree. Witnessed, what we though was a form of progression. When in fact we were only severing ourselfs from the purpose of existence. Half of the people in the world can’t even define what spirituality means to them because we have lost contact with our true identity. For if we knew and realized in a moment of who we are as a whole. We wouldn’t allow such hypocrisy to stand in idol light before us, like the Roman Catholics swarming over “heathens” during the Spanish inquisition. I don’t belong to any particular label or subculture, but I do recognize the level of corruption within the establishment. Just as Martin Luther Recognized what was occurring in the Catholic Church during the dark ages. History has been written by the victors, and all of the things we grow up to learn in school are only the subjective realities of those who ordain such things. We now function within a system so organized (despite the economic downfall) to destroy ambition and progress for humanity. Where Wars are a frequent method of draining resources, clever marketing strategies aim to robotically fixate and tear at the current youth with thoughtless material objects. People now, are coordinated by world class elites and given statements to reply to the public. The Celebrity persona is created now by puppet writers and both liberal and conservative parties are locked in a useless battle designed to run the clock. While these rich elite bastards laugh it at us in pity. Mocking the disgrace of our Ghettos and meth ravaged minorities cutting 8 balls by the time they are 15 years old. Our Human resources and current political system only remains to hide the truth of their REAL FREEDOM. Freedom to exploit the 3rd world and its rich sustenance. Suffocating countries like El Salvador, Peru, and Belize. (The list goes on) While we the people say that the free market is just that, in all truth it has never been self-regulated! It’s just a tool used to shed down the economy when needed. I ask that you open your minds brothers and sisters. Open your eyes, pick up a book and study what you won’t learn in your school curriculum…..

African Americans were 25 percent of the population in 1800, and the majority of them were enslaved. By 1830, however, most were free people. Yet slavery remained. African Americans, of course, resisted slavery and injustice by organizing churches, private schools, aid societies, and businesses; by amassing wealth and property; by leaving the city; and by demanding abolition. In 1848, 77 free and enslaved adults and children unsuccessfully attempted the nation's largest single escape aboard the schooner Pearl. On April 16, 1862, Congress passed the District of Columbia Emancipation Act, making Washingtonians the first freed in the nation, nine months before President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863. Congress had the authority to pass the DC Emancipation Act because it was granted the power to "exercise exclusive legislation" over the federal district by the U.S. Constitution. This federal oversight has been a source of conflict throughout Washington's history. During the Civil War (1861-1865) and Reconstruction (1865-1877), more than 25,000 African Americans moved to Washington. The fact that it was mostly pro-Union and the nation's capital made it a popular destination. Through the passage of Congress's Reconstruction Act of 1867, the city's African American men gained the right to vote three years before the passage of the 15th amendment gave all men the right to vote. (Women gained the right to vote in 1920.) The first black municipal office holder was elected in 1868. When Washington briefly became a federal territory in 1871, African American men continued to make important decisions for the city. Lewis H. Douglass introduced the 1872 law making segregation in public accommodations illegal. But in 1874, in part because of growing black political power, the territorial government was replaced by three presidentially appointed commissioners. This system survived until the civil rights movement of the 1960s brought a measure of self-government. By 1900 Washington had the largest percentage of African Americans of any city in the nation. Many came because of opportunities for federal jobs. Others were attracted to the myriad educational institutions. Howard University, founded in 1867, was a magnet for professors and students and would become the "capstone of Negro education" by 1930. The Preparatory School for Colored Youth, the city's first public high school, attracted college-bound students and teachers, many with advanced degrees. (Founded in 1870, the school became renowned as M Street High School, and later, Dunbar High School.) As far back as 1814, churches had operated and supported schools and housed literary and historical societies that promoted critical thinking, reading, lecturing, and social justice. African Americans also created hundreds of black-owned businesses and numerous business districts.
At the dawn of the 20th century, African Americans had created a cultural and intellectual capital. Washington had relatively few "Jim Crow" laws. However, segregation and racism were endemic. The few existing laws mandated segregation in the public schools and recreation facilities but not in the streetcars and public libraries. African Americans, therefore, reacted strongly to President Wilson's (1913-1921) institution of segregation in all of the federal government agencies. Clashes between African Americans and European Americans reached a fever pitch during the July 1919 race riot, when women and men fought back against violent whites, giving another meaning to the term "New Negro," a term usually associated with the cultural renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s. During the Great Depression (1929-1939) and World War II (1939-1945), the early civil rights movement gained ground.
In 1933, the same year that President Franklin Roosevelt (1933-1945) began to end segregation in the federal government, the young black men of the New Negro Alliance instituted "Don't Buy Where You Can't Work" campaigns against racist hiring practices in white-owned stores in predominantly black neighborhoods. The Washington chapter of the National Negro Congress also organized against police brutality and segregation in recreation beginning in 1936. The "Double V" effort - Victory Abroad, Victory at Home - increased civil rights activity. In 1943 Howard University law student Pauli Murray led coeds in a sit-in at the Little Palace cafeteria, a white-trade-only business near 14th and U streets, NW, an area that was largely African American. In 1948 the Supreme Court declared racially restrictive housing covenants were unconstitutional in the local Hurd v. Hodge case. Beginning in 1949 Mary Church Terrell led a multiracial effort to end segregation in public accommodations through pickets, boycotts, and legal action.
Four years later, in District of Columbia v. John R. Thompson Co., the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that segregation in Washington was unconstitutional based on the 1872 law passed during Reconstruction but long forgotten. In 1954 a local case, Bolling v. Sharpe, was part of the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision, which declared separate education was unconstitutional. In 1957 Washington's African American population surpassed the 50 percent mark, making it the first predominantly black major city in the nation, and leading a nationwide trend. The 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom brought more than 250,000 people to the Lincoln Memorial. Its success was helped by the support and contributions of local churches and organizations. The assassination of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., on April 4, 1968, triggered immediate and intense reactions throughout the nation and the city.
During the 1968 riots, when buildings were burned and destroyed, many African Americans rebelled against continued racism, injustice, and the federal government's abandonment of the city. Even before Dr. King's assassination, demands for justice undoubtedly helped push the federal government to take first steps towards "home rule" by appointing Walter Washington as mayor in 1967. In 1974 residents chose Washington as the city's first elected black mayor and the first mayor of the 20th century..

Keystone State to Weigh Hikes for Preschool and High School
Pennsylvania
Gov. Edward G. Rendell has asked the Pennsylvania legislature to approve expansions in early-childhood and high school programs as part of his fiscal 2008 budget proposal.
In his budget address on Feb. 6, the second-term Democrat proposed a $9.3 billion pre-K-12 education budget, a 5.8 percent hike from the amount spent in fiscal 2007. Gov. Rendell’s proposal includes expansion of his “foundation funding” formula, which supplements funding for the poorest districts.
The governor continued his emphasis on early-childhood programs by proposing $75 million to expand prekindergarten and $25 million more to establish more full-day kindergarten.
Mr. Rendell asked the legislature to approve a $90 million addition to his effort to put laptop computers in high schools; a $3 million increase to his “Project 720,” so that 30 more high schools could join the 118 already piloting more rigorous curricula; and a $2 million boost for a dual-enrollment program that allows high school students, particularly those from low-income families, to take college courses.

And, of course, by “watched,” I do mean “taped and fast-forwarded to the sex scene.” What the two stars lacked in actual chemistry they made up for in choreography – some of the most intricate I’ve ever seen in a Lifetime movie. (I sense a new Emmy category. Okay, a Bravo A-List category.)
Emilie, from what I deduced, plays a hostage negotiatior/single mom and Ivan is a tall, wealthy, well-built bar owner with an amazing house. Because I’m a lady and like context, I watched the scene before the sex, and saw that Emilie had canceled a lunch date with Ivan, but one of her coworkers grabbed her cell phone and told Ivan that she hadn’t had sex in a over a year so she’d be right over. When Ivan opened the door, it was on…on the counter, on the stairway, on the wall. He was putting his hands in all kinds of places (that we got close-ups of).

donna, so far so good. this place abounds with homeopaths - who are all md types here. my winter homeopathic 'prevention' (and i must say, it's done a splendid job despite this little tumble...compared to last year, this is nothing!) is a 'recipe', as you say, from a homeopathic doc in the SW of france and shared by a friend of mind in amsterdam. merci for the healing thoughts...i'll take 'em all!

Enjoy splashing in puddles...both of you!
So sorry that the "bug" finally chased you down, found you and has you on the sofa.
I hope you have a nice period of relaxation and can re-cooperate fully before you're hectic schedule starts up again.
I usually take 4 packets a day of EmergenC...mega doses of vitamin C (1000 mg). It usually helps and in some cases has kept me from coming down with a cold. I don't know of any homeopathic doctors around here...wish I did.
Stay well.
Kris, merci, m'dear. I've been doing EmergenC as well...along with a tincture of Eccinacea and a blend of other goodies. I'm convinced it all helped to keep this from hitting me harder...but hit me it did. dammypoo. I'm blaming it on the guy in the poste who coughed all over me about 10 days ago.

The disclosed invention relates generally to surgical implements and methods used in spinal surgery, and more particularly to an expandable implant for stabilization of vertebrae and a method for stabilizing vertebrae.
Chronic back pain is one of the most common and perplexing problems facing the field of orthopedic surgery. In addition to patient discomfort, chronic back pain has severe adverse societal impacts including lost income, decreased involvement in family and community life, as well as possible chronic dependence on drugs and/or alcohol. In many cases, back pain can be avoided by preventing relative motion between spinal vertebrae, a therapy commonly referred to as intervertebral stabilization.
Surgical techniques are known for use in intervetebral stabilization. These surgical techniques seek to rigidly join vertebrae separated by a degenerated disk. Ideally, the surgery effectively replaces the vertebra-disk-vertebra combination with a single rigid vertebra. Various surgical techniques have developed which attempt to approach or approximate this ideal.
One technique known in the art is to place either bone or nothing into the space left after removing a damaged disk. Placing nothing in the space allows the space to collapse which may result in damage to the nerves. With this technique, the space may also fill with scar tissue and eventually lead to a reherniation. The use of bone is less than optimal. If the bone is obtained from the patient, additional surgery is required and the bone is of limited availability in its most useful form. If the bone is obtained elsewhere, the bone may lack living bone cells, carry a significant risk of infection, and/or is also limited in supply since it is usually obtained from accident victims. Furthermore, the bone only provides marginal structural support and lacks a means to either stabilize itself against dislodgement, or to stabilize the adjacent vertebrae.
Another technique involves the use of an implant which, acting alone or in combination with bone fragments, replaces the use of bone grafts. The implants are sometimes expandable to contact adjacent vertebrae and achieve vertebral fusion after a sufficient amount of bone growth occurs. While conventional implants can be filled with bone fragments to expedite bone growth, it is believed that the mere presence of the bone fragments is not enough to achieve the rate of bone growth that would be provided if the bone fragments or any other osteogenic material were extruded from the implant during expansion of the implant.
Whether or not bone fragments or other osteogenic material are used, many implants are less than satisfactory for supporting healing vertebrae after implantation. When a circular bore is drilled into the intervertebral disk space and also into adjacent portions of the vertebrae above and below the intervertebral disk space, many prior art implants provide less than fully satisfactory support to the undrilled, rigid outer surface portions of the vertebrae. As a result of this less than fully satisfactory support, more spinal support structures may be needed, or each of the vertebrae may tilt from side to side, eventually causing spinal misalignment.
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that there is a need for an expandable intervertebral implant which is adapted to extrude osteogenic material during its expansion and to expedite the bone growth and fusion process than compared to the prior art. By expediting the bone growth and fasion process, it is possible to reduce the amount of time between surgery and the patient's ability to return to work or perform physically demanding activities.
Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that there is a need for an expandable intervertebral implant which is adapted to expand against cancellous bone tissue surfaces of vertebrae while providing improved support to vertebrae during the bone growth and fusion process. By providing expansion and improved support, it is possible to reduce the risk of spinal misalignment and decrease the need for additional spinal support structures.
The disclosed invention is just such an implant and achieves the advantages and overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art through use of an expandable intervertebral implant. The expandable intervertebral implant of the present invention extrudes osteogenic material during expansion, and includes a curvalinear shoulder for improved support of vertebrae during the bony growth and fusion process.
It is an object of the invention to provide an expandable implant that will extrude osteogenic material during expansion thereof and which will provide improved support of healing vertebrae during the bony growth and fusion process.
It is another object of the invention to provide an expandable implant that will expand against cancellous bone tissue of a vertebrae while providing improved support of a periosteal membrane surface of the vertebrae during the bony growth and fusion process.
It is yet another object of the invention to provide a method of stabilizing first and second vertebrae with respect to one another that will expedite the bony growth and fusion process while reducing the risk of spinal misalignment.
An expandable intervertebral implant pursuant to the present invention is adapted to be inserted at least partially into vertebrae or in between two vertebrae, and is adapted to be secured thereto by expansion. The implant comprises a first shell, a second shell, and at least one extrusion opening. The first shell has a first end and a plurality of engaging members extensible from the implant for engagement with cancellous bone tissue of a vertebra. The engaging members axially extend from the first end. A cross section of the first shell includes at least one curvalinear shoulder for supporting a periosteal surface of a vertebra. The second shell is operatively connected to the first shell and has a second end with at least one bearing surface engageable with the engaging members. A cross section of the second shell including at least one curvalinear shoulder for supporting a periosteal surface of a vertebra. The first and second shells cooperate to form a cavity delimited by inner surfaces thereof. There is at least one extrusion opening in at least one of the first and second shells. Movement of the second shell with respect to the first shell causes expansion of the implant and at least partial extrusion of material contained in the cavity through the extrusion opening.
An expandable intervertebral implant pursuant to the present invention is adapted to be inserted at least partially into a bore drilled between two adjacent vertebrae to expose cancellous bone tissue within each of the two vertebrae, and is also adapted to be secured to the vertebrae by expansion. The implant comprises first and second shells and first, second and third axes. The first shell has a first end and a plurality of engaging members extensible from the implant for engagement with the cancellous bone tissue of a vertebra. The engaging members axially extend from the first end. A cross section of the first shell includes at least one curvalinear shoulder for supporting a periosteal surface of a vertebra. A second shell is operatively connected to the first shell and has a second end with at least one bearing surface engageable with the engaging members. A cross section of the second shell includes at least one curvalinear shoulder for supporting a periosteal surface of a vertebra. The first axis extends between the first and second ends, while the second axis extends perpendicular to the first axis. The third axis extends perpendicular to the first and second axes, wherein the second axis has a length greater than a diameter of the bore and the third axis has a length less than the diameter of the bore.
A method for stabilizing first and second vertebrae with respect to one another pursuant to the present invention comprises the following steps. A bore is formed between two vertebrae to expose cancellous bone tissue in at least one vertebra. At least one expandable intervertebral implant containing osteogenic material is provided. The implant has first, second and third axes and first and second opposed shells. A cross section of the implant has at least one curvalinear shoulder for supporting a periosteal membrane of one of the two adjacent vertebrae. The first axis extends between the ends. The second axis extends perpendicular to the first axis and has a length greater than a diameter of the bore. The third axis extends perpendicular to the first and second axes and has a length equal to or less than the diameter of the bore. At least one of the first and second shells has engaging members extensible from the implant for engagement with the cancellous bone tissue, wherein the engaging members extend axially from an end of the at least one shell. The implant is inserted in the bore so that the curvalinear shoulder bears against and supports the periosteal membrane. The implant is expanded. An osteogenic material is extruded from the implant during expansion thereof.
These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description and independent claims.
The invention may be best understood with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein an illustrative embodiment is shown.
FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the inventive implant.
FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of two of the inventive implants as inserted into an implant site between adjacent vertebrae.
FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of an actuator installed inside the second shell of the inventive implant.
FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of an extension for use with the inventive implant.
FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view of a tool for use with the inventive implant.
Expandable intervertebral implant I, as best shown in FIGS. 1-6, has a first shell 2 operatively connected to a second shell 5. Movement of second shell 5 with respect to first shell 2 effects radial outward expansion of implant I along with extrusion of osteogenic material through extrusion openings 8. The osteogenic material may be bone material or any other substance capable of expediting or facilitating bone growth. Implant I has a configuration adapted to provide improved support to rigid portions of a vertebrae at a surface of a periosteal membrane.
As best illustrated in FIG. 1, first shell 2 has a first end 11, a plurality of circumferentially spaced engaging members 14 that axially extend from first end 11, and a plurality of extrusion openings 8 formed in engaging members 14. First end 11 has a smooth, essentially uninterrupted, concave-shaped surface 15. A cross-section of concave-shaped surface 15 is oval. First end 11 also has a plurality of circumferentially spaced bearing surfaces 17 that alternate with attachment points 20 of engaging members 14. Preferably, first shell 2 has six engaging members 14 and first end 11 has four bearing surfaces 17. Engaging members 14 are arcuately shaped, i.e., a cross-section of each engaging member 14 taken orthogonal to the axial extension direction describes an curve or arc. Bearing surfaces 17 and distal ends 23 of engaging members 14 are beveled.
As best shown in FIG. 1, second shell 5 has a second end 26 and a plurality of circumferentially spaced engaging members 29 axially extending from second end 26. Second end 26 has an oval planar surface 32 with a raised cylindrical portion thereupon 35. Raised cylindrical portion 35 has external threads 38 for engaging an installation tool. A hole 41 is formed through raised cylindrical portion 35 for receiving a fastener for connecting first and second shells 2, 5. Oval planar surface 32 is oriented orthogonal to a smooth, essentially uninterrupted, curvalinear surface 44 having an oval cross-section. Second end 26 also has a plurality of bearing surfaces 47 that alternate with attachment points 50 of engaging members 29. Preferably, second shell 5 has four engaging members 29 and second end 26 has four bearing surfaces 47. Similar to first shell 2, bearing surfaces 47 and distal ends 51 of engaging members 29 of second shell 5 are beveled.
Osteogenic material may be placed into a cavity that is defined by inner surfaces of first and second shells 2, 5. As second shell 5 is moved toward first shell 2, the cavity decreases in volume and the osteogenic material is extruded through extrusion openings 8. The osteogenic material promotes bony growth and eventual fusion of vertebrae.
As best illustrated in FIG. 3, movement and operative connection of first and second shells 2, 5 is preferably effected by an actuator 53 that is threadedly connected to an internally threaded post 54 inside first shell 2. Actuator 53 has a head 56 with a slot 59 formed therein and a shank 62 having external threads 65 formed about a lower half thereof. A groove 68 is formed in shank and receives clip 71, thereby keeping actuator 53 from coming apart from second shell 5 during installation and manipulation of implant I. Actuator 53 extends through hole 41 in second shell 5, where head 56 is retained upon surface 74.
As best shown in FIG. 1, engaging members 14 of first shell 2 are interdigitated with engaging members 29 of second shell 5 and each engaging member 14, 29 bears upon its corresponding bearing surface 47, 17. As a user applies torque in one direction to actuator 53, actuator 53 threadedly engages the threaded post 54 of first shell 2, causing second shell 5 to move toward first shell 2. Application of torque in an opposite direction causes second shell 5 to move away from first shell 2. Thus, a surgeon may freely adjust a relative position of first shell 2 with respect to second shell 5. As second shell 5 is moved toward first shell 2, engaging members 14 of first shell 2 are urged radially outwardly by bearing surfaces 47 of second shell 5. Similarly, engaging members 29 of second shell are urged radially outward by bearing surfaces 17 of first shell 2. Beveled distal ends 23, 51 and beveled bearing surfaces 47, 17 ease this radial outward movement of engaging members 14, 29. A combination of the radial outward movement of engaging members 14, 29 causes implant I to become radially expanded.
As best illustrated in FIGS. 1-2, the configuration of implant I may also be described with reference to first, second, and third axes 77, 80, 83. First axis 77 (partially shown as a hidden line in FIG. 1) extends between first and second ends 11, 26. Second axis 80 extends perpendicular to first axis 77 and third axis 83 extends perpendicular to both first and second axes 77, 80. Third axis 83 has a length L3 less than a diameter of surgical bore 89 allowing implant I to be inserted into intervertebral space 92 and expanded against cancellous bone tissue 95 of first and second vertebrae 96, 97. Because second axis 80 has a length L2 greater than the diameter of bore 89, curvalinear shoulders 98 jut out to either side of implant I to support surfaces of periosteal membrane 101 over an rigid outer bony later 119 of vertebrae 96, 97, as best shown in FIG. 2. In such a configuration, outer surfaces of first and second shells 2, 5 cooperate to form an ellipsoid, of which second end 26 is generally planar and oriented orthogonal to axis 77. Thus, a cross-section of implant I taken at a point along axis 77 has an oval shape. One skilled in the art will appreciate that implant I need not have an ellipsoid shape or an oval cross-section. In this embodiment, the cross-section need only describe at least one curvilinear shoulder 98 for supporting rigid outer bony layer 119 of vertebrae 96, 97 at a surface of periosteal membrane 101.
While various dimensions can be provided, depending on the intended use of each implant I, preferred dimensions permit use of implant I as an intervertebral stabilization device. First and second shells 2, 5, in this regard, are provided with dimensions that permit insertion of implant I between two vertebrae 96, 97 and radial expansion of engaging members 14, 29 in order to provide stabilization of vertebrae 96, 97 with respect to one another. The exact dimensions will depend on a size of intervertebral space 92 in a patient. For example, the dimensions will be correspondingly smaller for implants I designed for pediatric patients than those designed for adult patients. Exemplary dimensions for an adult spinal patient include a first axis length L1 of about 20 to 26 millimeters. The unexpanded third axis length L3 for an implant I designed for an adult patient preferably is about 9 to 10 millimeters, with a diametric expansion of about 8 to 10 millimeters being provided for outward movement of engaging members 14,29.
With reference to FIG. 5, a tool 104 may be used with implant I for purposes of inserting or otherwise manipulating implant I. Tool 104 should be capable of turning actuator 53 to effect expansion or contraction of implant I while actuator 53 is engaged with implant I. A preferred tool 104 is disclosed in my U.S. Pat. No. 5,531,792, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
Tool 104 has a sleeve 107 which is internally threaded to engage external threads 38 of raised cylindrical portion 35. A screw driver portion 110 passes through sleeve 107 and engages head 56 of actuator 53 to permit manual turning of actuator 53 while sleeve 107 remains engaged to external threads 38. Sleeve 107 allows implant I to be manipulated as a unit to achieve a desired position in an implant site, while screw driver portion 110 facilitates movement of second shell 5 for purposes of selectively expanding or contracting implant I. Screw driver portion 110 preferably is connected to a screw driver handle 113 which provides a mechanical advantage when screw driver portion 110 is turned. A knurled ring 116 is rigidly connected to sleeve 107 to facilitate turning of sleeve 107 with respect to external threads 38, for example, when connecting or disconnecting tool 104 from implant I.
Each of first and second shells 2, 5 and actuator 53 are preferably made of biocompatible material, such as surgical grade titanium or surgical grade stainless steel. The osteogenic material is preferably bone material.
With reference to FIGS. 1 and 3, the implant I may be assembled by inserting actuator 53 through hole 41 of second end 26 and installing clip 71 within groove 68. Engaging members 29 of second shell 5 are brought into interdigital orientation relative to engaging members 14 of first shell 2, and actuator 53 is rotated so that threads 65 engage the internally threaded post 54 in first shell 2. Actuator 53 is further rotatably inserted within the internally threaded post 54 so as to snugly fit beveled distal ends 23, 51 of engaging members 14, 29 against corresponding beveled bearing surfaces 47, 17, but not so much as to cause engaging members 14, 29 to be urged or extended radially outwardly. Implant I is thus in the non-expanded condition, suitable for insertion into a previously prepared implantation site.
Implant I may be used to perform a method of stabilizing vertebrae. First, a surgical bore 89 is drilled into an intervertebral disk space 92, as best shown in FIG. 2. Surgical bore 89 should be at least partially drilled into vertebrae 96, 97 in order to expose cancellous bone tissue 95. Tool 104 is then attached to implant I as explained above, and implant I positioned inside surgical bore 89.
As best shown in FIGS. 1-2, the unexpanded implant I provides improved support of vertebrae 96, 97 during the bony growth and fusion process. Each of first and second vertebrae 96, 97 have a periosteal membrane 101 which covers a rigid outer bony layer 119, which in turn encloses cancellous bone tissue 95, otherwise known as spongy bone tissue. Implant I is configured such that curvalinear shoulders 98 are well suited to support rigid portions of vertebrae 96, 97 at surfaces of periosteal membrane 101. Because vertebrae 96, 97 are supported in such a manner, they are less prone to rock, tilt or shift, thus reducing the risk of spinal misalignment, and decreasing the need for additional vertebral support structures. Once placed within surgical bore 89, implant I should be carefully positioned so that curvalinear shoulders 98 bear against and support rigid portions of vertebrae 96, 97 at periosteal membrane 101.
As best illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 5, implant I may be expanded by passing screw driver portion 110 through sleeve 107, and allowing it to engage slot 59. Handle 113 is then rotated so that second shell 5 is moved toward first shell 2. As first and second shells 2, 5 come closer together, bearing surfaces 17, 47 urge engaging members 29, 14 radially outward so as to engage cancellous bone tissue 95 and effect radial expansion of implant 1. The movement of second shell 5 toward first shell 2 also effects a reduction in volume of the cavity contained therein. As a result, osteogenic material is extruded through extrusion openings 8. Rotation of handle 113 is stopped once the desired degree of radial expansion is achieved. If implant I is over expanded, screw driver handle 113 may be rotated in the opposite direction to move first and second shells 2, 5 apart, thus radially contracting implant I. Once the surgeon determines that a satisfactory degree of expansion is attained, screw driver portion 110 may be removed from sleeve 107, and sleeve 107 unscrewed from threads 38 to remove tool 104 from implant I.
It should be appreciated that smooth surfaces 15, 44 permit implant I to be inserted and installed with minimal damage, if any, to surrounding vertebrae 96, 97. The construction of implant I permits engaging members 14, 29 to extend gradually radially outwardly, thereby reducing the risk of overstressing surrounding vertebrae 96, 97. Compressing cancellous bone tissue 95 by expansion of implant I causes implant L to be secured and fixed within surgical bore 89. During a necessary period of time for healing of vertebrae 96, 97, osteogenic material in intervertebral space 92, in the implant I cavity, and against cancellous bone tissue 95, will promote bony growth. Once bony growth is substantially achieved, vertebrae 96, 97 will have become fused together.
In treating some patients (e.g., scoleosis patients, patients with spinal curvature, and/or trauma patients), it may be desirable to connect implant I to a spinal stabilization rod. Such rods are well known in the art. As shown in FIG. 4, the implant I can be provided with an extension 122. Extension 122 includes internal threads 125 adapted to engage external threads 38 of raised cylindrical portion 35 and thus can be used to secure extension 122 to implant I. Extension 122 further includes a neck portion 128 and a ball 131. Ball 131 and neck portion 128 can be engaged and locked to a suitable spinal stabilization rod in a trailer hitch-like manner. Alternatively, other engagement and locking means can be used to connect the rod and implant I.
While the expandable intervertebral implant and method of the present invention are particularly well-suited for use in stabilizing vertebrae, it is understood that the invention is not limited to such use. The inventive implant can be modified and/or used to stabilize other bones, as one having ordinary skill in the art would readily appreciate from the instant disclosure.
Moreover, while this invention has been described as having a preferred design, it is understood that the invention is not limited to the illustrated and described features. To the contrary, the invention is capable of further modifications, usages, and/or adaptations following the general principles.'Homeless' Gere Fools New Yorkers, Clooney Lashes Out Over Obama Insult
Actors can be pretty convincing. Case in point: Richard Gere, who fooled lots of people on the streets of New York City in his role as a homeless man. He was so convincing that one woman even brought him a bag of food.
Gere was being filmed from across the street while he ate a burger out of a trash can and drank from a paper bag. The 64-year-old star, who is filming a movie called "Time Out of Mind," didn't even break character when he received the free food.

In the clip above, Michael Tammero, host of In the FOXlight, stopped by Fox and Friends to discuss the latest celeb news, including a reported outburst by George Clooney in Las Vegas.
Clooney was at dinner with hotel-casino magnate Steve Wynn a few weeks ago when he stormed out after Wynn made a derogatory remark about President Obama.
Wynn told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that Clooney, a vocal supporter of Obama, had too much tequila and the restaurant was "empty" when the argument started.
“Clooney’s fun to be with when he’s sober. ... If you have a chance to drink with him, you want to get there early, and don’t stay late," said Wynn.
Clooney's publicist confirmed the incident, with Clooney writing that Wynn was being "a jackass."

Here we are on the front porch of one of our neighbors bringing the tidings of the Season.Talk about a fairy-tale wedding!
Tonight's 100th episode of Gossip Girl features Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) walking down the aisle, and suffice to say, it's possibly the most divine-looking wedding party TV has ever seen. So how'd they do it?
We chatted exclusively with Gossip Girl wardrobe designer Eric Damon and the designer of all the girls' gowns, Vera Wang, for all the scoop, along with a detailed look at Blair's two wedding dresses!
More: Here Comes the Blair! Watch Leighton Meester Walk Down the Aisle in Tonight's Episode
Wang makes an appearance in tonight's wedding episode and cracks that it's "the beginning and end of my television career!" She admits to repeatedly flubbing her lines and says with a laugh, "I don't know, maybe I was just so in awe of looking at Leighton in the dress. She kind of just blew my mind away when she first walked onto the set!"
As revealed in our first look at Blair walking down the aisle, she does make quite the mind-blowing impression. (Do not watch while operating heavy machinery!) And for you who are wondering whether she actually says "I do" to Prince Louis, I can't give anything way, but let's just say I personally was surprised!
Blair and Serena's (Blake Lively) dresses—which were designed by Vera (a self-professed, longtime Gossip Girl fan) and chosen by G.G.'s stylist extraordinaire, Eric Damon—were specifically chosen to suit their personalities.
"Blair Waldorf is an American princess," Damon explains. "So for me, [her wedding dress] had to be very tailored and very modern, but also have a very classic kind of Old World sense to it." He reveals they struggled deciding between two dresses, and in the end, spoiler alert: They were able to use both on the show.

Well, a new study may help you rest a little easier about eating something fried.
Contrary to just about everything you may have heard about the dangers of fried food, it turns out it may not always be harmful to your health.
In fact, according to a new study, it's a myth that regularly eating fried foods causes heart attacks. How can that be?
There's mounting research that it's the type of oil used in frying the food that really matters.
Researchers in Spain followed 40,000 people for 14 years and found the amount of oil they consumed made no significant difference in the incidence of heart disease.
But here's the thing: In Spain, people tend to fry "fresh" in unsaturated olive or sunflower oil. The research, published in the British Medical Journal, is more evidence, dietitians say, that people should switch to healthier oils from saturated fats like butter, lard and palm oil.
But don't heat up that deep fryer just yet, Dr. Holly Phillips said on "CBS This Morning." Fried foods still contain more calories and are often loaded with salt. They've also been linked to high blood pressure and obesity.
Still, she said, "If you need a fried food fix, consider a switch to olive or sunflower oil - or just have dinner in Spain."You must fill out fields marked with: *

The incorporation of few monolayers of Ge chemisorbed on Si surface has been found to have significant impact on the electrical properties of crystalline grown epitaxially on Si substrates. Although the Ge coverage on Si surface does not show any influence on the epitaxial quality of layers, however, it exhibits a strong impact on their electrical properties. We show that by incorporating few monolayers of Ge at the interface between and Si, the capacitance-voltage characteristics, fixed charge and density of interface traps of capacitor are much superior to those layers grown on clean Si surfaces.

EmEasy DIY: Succulent Centerpiece
Succulents are low-maintenance, don't require a lot of water, and look great in just about any container, which makes them the ideal plant for a centerpiece. Longer lasting than flowers, they're easy to plant in trays, tin cans, or even teacups.
If you want the centerpiece to last a long time, use a planter that has drainage and won't let the roots get soggy. If you're just using the centerpiece for an event, you can use any type of planter and filling you want, and then replant the succulent in a proper container later.
To learn how to properly plant a succulent, see this post from Apartment Therapy or this video from Sunset Magazine.
The examples above illustrate a few different ideas for creative planters. We also love the idea of using unexpected materials, like espresso beans or cranberries, to fill a holiday centerpiece. (Just remember to replant the succulent after your party!)

After the end of talks between Iran and the six mediators over Iran’s nuclear issue in the city of Almaty in Kazakhstan on Friday, representatives of Russia and Iran held two-sided talks.
The six mediators over Iran’s nuclear issue are the US, the UK, France, Russia, China and Germany.
After the end of the seven-sided talks, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said that Russia would appreciate more efforts for talks from the side of Iran.
“It is hard to say whether we’ll be able to persuade Iran to suspend its work of enriching uranium at a nuclear facility near the village of Fordo,” Mr. Ryabkov said. “This would take many efforts from the mediators.”
On Sunday, the seven-sided talks will resume.
Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov says that the talks between Iran and six mediators over Iran’s nuclear issue, which took place in the city of Almaty in Kazakhstan on Friday, bore little fruit.
The talks will resume on Sunday.
“However,” Mr. Ryabkov said, “the fact that the process is going slowly is evidence of how seriously the sides are approaching this problem.”
He added that “the plan for cooperation for solving the Iranian nuclear issue, which Iran suggested to the “Six” at these talks, raises more questions than provides answers”.
Sergey Ryabkov refrained from any forecasts concerning what results the Sunday round of talks may bring.
A Western diplomat who does not disclose his name says that the six mediators did not see anything new in Iran’s new plan on cooperation in solving the Iranian nuclear issue.
Iran presented this plan at talks that recently ended in the city of Almaty in Kazakhstan.
“In fact, the plan includes nothing other than the suggestions that Iran put forward at the previous talks in Moscow, only slightly changed,” the diplomat said to the Russian news agency “RIA Novosti”.
He added that the “Six” have persuaded Iran to hold another round of talks later on Friday.
“Probably this round will bring more success”, the diplomat hopes.
Iran has yet to give a clear response to a proposal from world powers for ending the decade-long nuclear dispute, Western officials said on Friday after a first round of talks in Almaty.

- and share viaRepublican Gov. Rick Scott holds an edge over Democrat Charlie Crist among voters age 50-plus, according to a survey released Tuesday by AARP-Florida.
The survey was conducted in late June and July and spans a range of issues on the minds of older voters. Scott was leading 47-40 percent over Crist but among those surveyed, one-in-five voters said they could change their minds before the November election.
Scott and Crist were tied among Hispanic voters age 50 and older, the survey showed, while Scott was more popular among whites and Crist was strongly supported by older black voters.
President Obama’s approval numbers among these voters was not so hot, with 53 percent disapproving of his job performance with only 36 voicing approval.
“Florida voters 50+ are worried about their futures,” said Jeff Johnson, AARP’s Florida state director. “And voters 50+ overwhelmingly say candidates for governor haven’t done enough to explain their proposals for responding to these concerns.”
By an 82 percent margin, Florida voters 50+ say a candidate’s position on jobs and the economy would be very important in deciding whom to support in the governor’s race. Only 7 percent said it would be less or not important.
Those surveyed also overwhelmingly supported the state expanding Medicaid, a move authorized under the Affordable Care Act but blocked by the state’s Republican-led Legislature. Crist favors expansion and Scott says he still does, although he did nothing to promote the effort the past two years in the Legislature.
Older voters favored Medicaid expansion 57 percent to 26 percent with 17 percent undecided. Hispanic voters 50+ favored Medicaid expansion 69 to 18 percent, white voters 50+ favored it 53 to 28 percent and African-American voters by 84 to 6 percent, the survey showed.
The telephone poll of 800 Florida voters was conducted June 26-July 6 and has a margin-of-error of plus-or-minus 4.4 percent.
The full survey can be found here:
AARP is a dead wood organization. If the retiree with Social Security dies, SSA will pay $250.00 for funeral.
The law might have been passed many decades ago. Can you find any funeral director who will bury one with that amount? Do not, please join AARP. That is a waste of your money.
Among the revelations regarding Scott and his massive, record, medicare fraud;
keep in mind that Scott as the CEO of the company, and took the 5th 75 times during his questioning..
OK; time for the senior citizens to wise up. Scott stole money earmarked for your healthcare. Any senior citizen who votes for Scott, should be denied any further medicare benefits.
If Florida re-elects Rick Scott, it proves you can fool most of the people most of the time.
Scott and his GOP cronies have blocked every attempt to provide insurance for Florida's neediest.
I thought the Latinos in Florida voted as a majority for President Obama?
If the 50+ in Florida want to believe that Rick Scott has their best interests in mind, I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell them too.
How many of those 700,000 jobs Scott promised has he provided and at minimum wage too?
What's that?
I can't hear you.
ANYONE WHO VOTES FOR RICK SCOTT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HE STEALS!
Which so far is over $1 Billion from the Citizens Reserve Fund using phony insurance companies set up by his pals months after he was elected.
The 50+ crowd must have early-onset dementia to even CONSIDER voting for Rick Scott.
@formerlyv HAHA LOL if not for I mostly agree I laugh harder

None of theUS budget goes to Medicare or Social Security. They are paid for out of seperate funds. In fact, the government has actually borrowed from the SS trust fund but has yet to pay it back. But, hey, I wouldn't expect a tea party nut to let facts get in the way of their rants. Keep spreading the lies and shoving your foot in your mouth.
Unfortunately, I would venture to guess that many, if not most, of those polled are transplants from the mid-west with republican backrounds that have no idea, or don't care, about Scott's background and they support republicans regardless. They couldn't care less that Scott is a crook, a liar and one step above pond scum on the evolutionary scale.
If you support AARP you support a group SUCKING UP 41% of entire US Budget going to Social Security & Medicare for people like Rick Scott to steal from!
I'd actually consider AARP a financial terrorist group, not in line with core HARD WORKING AMERICAN VALUES!
As a republican myself I can not support someone who STOLE from Medicare like Rick Scott.
AARP, being 40, I already tell everyone not to join AARP because when Social Security & Medicare go BANKRUPT by the year 2032 (not long from now) AARP goes bankrupt too.
I understand why 50 year old + like Rick Scott,
50+ are welfare babies (BABY BOOMERS), that there parent (GREATEST GENERATION WWII) gave everything to and are SPOILED BRATS, that have never work for anything in there life.
Gen X'er will tell AARP to F itself cuz we worked for what we have and our education and ARE NOT WELFARE BABIES like BABY BOOMERS that think STEALING MEDICARE FUNDS like Rick Scott did.
Example my mother republican, lives off her inheritance, NEVER WORKED FOR ANYTHING, common for most Baby Boomers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If the Citizens of Florida are foolish enough to re-elect a kleptocrate like Rick Scott or for any Republican legislator who conspired to subvert the Florida constitution through redistricting and targeted selection of certain groups by denying them their right to vote, the people of Florida will no one to blame but themselves.
@formerlyv IN TAX LAW TERMS the above means:
EVERY US BUDGET year 41% of the Total money US Spends in it's budget goes DIRECTLY to SOCIAL SECURITY and MEDICARE. Benefit paid are not actual what people paid into the SS system. SS requires BY TAX LAW that every 3 to 4 employee's paid 1 SS's Benefits.
AGAIN SS BABY BOOMER is not actual what paid into SS. They are getting back hirer interest rates then most STOCKMARKET or BOND'S paid.
SSA.gov TRUSTEE clearly by COVERED OPINION STATES SS & MEDICARE are going bankrupt.
AARP is helping destroy the United States we currently live in!
@formerlyv MORON, LOL both the Social Security Act of 1935 and Medicare Act Amendment to it are both TAX LAW TITLE 26&31, as in BUDGETING!!!!!!
GOSH before you call someone a MORON, maybe it'd of help'd you actually knew what the hell you talking about yourself.
Let me guess WORTHLESS BABY BOOMER jealous I HAVE LEGAL EDUCATION. CURRENT life long YALE! PAID FOR BY ME!
DON'T hate me, hate yourself for not expecting more of yourself! PS I'm retirement PAID FOR I'm not SS PONZI SCHEME WELFARE BABY like you! I'm your DADDY!

Left: End of the road.
This first set of images is taken with the Sigma 24-70mm/f2.8 AFD EX DG, a lens which is not a macro lens, although the minimum distance is acceptable for some types of shots. The main gripe I have is that although the lens works perfectly on a Nikon F100, the exposure is often wrong by about two full stops on a Sigma S5 pro. The 'DG' letter should ensure digital camera compatibility, but it doesn't seem to be the case. Many of those shots have been post-processed to bring the exposure back from the dark side.

Left: This unfortunate butterfly has been caught on a thistle flower like on velcro. I began to wonder why I could take pictures so easily and it didn't seem afraid, until I got a closer look and saw it was long dead and dessicated. Nice pose though.
This second series of images is taken with the Sigma 18-50mm/f2.8 AFD DC EX Macro, a lens optimized both for digital sensors and macrophotography. The results are much better as you can see, both in terms of minimal distance, enlargement ratio, sharpness and exposure accuracy.

On the set of images above, I used either no flash or a mounted SB-800. On this set I used the internal flash of the S5 to control the SB-800 in remote mode, which I would simply hold in my left hand with a reflector. This solution gives good results... sometimes ! It is highly unreliable as the remote flash sometimes forgets to fire or fires at full output, which is very weird since it's barely 50cm from the master. Also the lens as illuminated by the master can be seen on some shots. Sure, it's possible to set the master in control mode (no flash), but I didn't bother at the time. I'd better build a forward reflector for it.

But you can still study. This is what our president Obama has pointed out. He has made it quite clear to the authority that they should do something for the moms. He feels that the moms should not be forgotten and they should be rewarded for the pain they bear.
As per the Obama's stimulus plan, around $10000 has been fixed for each mom in America. Thus all the moms are entitled to get this money from the government. Hence, they can now sit back and then continue their study.
Single mothers are sometimes caught off guard having to deal with in early pregnancy that may jeopardize the focus of their life especially in regard to obtaining a college degree. Most of them are unable to find jobs that pay a decent wage because of their low level of education. Because they are wanting to provide their children with the best possible situation, they are always on the outlook for jobs that will help them maintain the best lifestyle for themselves and their loved ones.
If you are single parent looking for a solution to your economic woes, one of the best ways is to look to the government in order to find a more stable job in higher wage or salary that can come from obtaining a college degree..

Currently in the United States, if you want to make a (legal) wager on the outcome of a sporting event, your options are limited to sports books in Delaware, Oregon, and Nevada. California state senator Roderick Wright (D-Inglewood) wants to see those options expanded. Wright stopped by ESPN Radio Los Angeles with Mason and Ireland to discuss why he wants Californians to be able to bet on 49ers games and what obstacles are in the way of making that dream a reality.
On why he's joined officials in New Jersey in supporting legalized sports gambling:
"You're talking about an industry that's already a multi-billion dollar industry in the United States. We allow three states – Oregon, Delaware and Nevada – to have sports betting. In addition, if you take the internet that is kinda-sorta now going – internet poker in particular but some of the other online gaming that takes place – you're talking about an industry, in the United States, that's probably close to $15 to $20 billion a year already."
On the argument that gamblers have enough options:
"If you said to me, if I could prevent people from gambling, if I could stop it and make it work, [I would]. But if you look at the history of this country, our success in preventing people from doing what they want to do has not been very good."
On the argument that gambling particularly hurts those with lower income levels:
"That's factually inaccurate. What we've found, for example, in our lottery, is that you look at it two ways. … A dollar from a guy who only makes $20,000 is a bigger piece of his revenue, that's absolutely right. But what you find is that the more affluent the neighborhood, the greater the handle on the people who play the lottery. The people who have more money tend to play more."
On whether he'll ask the California legislature to join the fight by New Jersey officials:
"We're looking at it. When you talk about gaming or alcohol or prostitution, there's kind of a push-back from people. … But particularly in this lawsuit, we're talking about sports betting. I'm not a lawyer, but the lawyers to whom I've spoken, it's kind of an equal-protection portion of the federal constitution. How am I able to do something in Oregon that I can't do in California. What is it about Oregon that gives them a privilege that a guy in San Francisco can't have?"
On the hurdles of making this happen:
"In order to get sports betting, the first thing that would have to happen is that the … Bill Bradley law would have to be overturned, and that would only happen in a court. Then, after the Bradley Law is overturned … after that occurs, then California would have to affirmatively opt into a scheme that would allow it to be done."

Among the many disturbing questions for such a scenario is: How will my doctors know my treatment preferences if for some reason I cannot communicate?
There are important steps you can take in advance to document your healthcare desires. A very common option is to create an advance directive.
What Advance Directives Can Do
Advance directives, also referred to as living wills, can address a number of issues, such as whether a patient wants to receive artificial respiration, dialysis, tube feeding or artificial hydration, or donate an organ in the event of death. The document may also include a do-not-resuscitate-order, which instructs doctors not to perform CPR if the patient stops breathing or their heart stops.
“An advance directive provides a clear statement by the patient of his or her wishes with respect to his or her health care,” said William Roach Jr., Esq., an American Heart Association volunteer and co-author of Medical Records and the Law, now in its fourth edition. “This helps to avoid disputes that can arise among family members concerning how to treat an incapacitated relative and gives direction to healthcare providers concerning the level of care to provide the patient.”
An advance directive may also include a durable power of attorney for health care or healthcare proxy, in which the patient names another person to make healthcare decisions for them if they are unable to do so.
However, the individual (often referred to as an advocate or surrogate) named in this document cannot make the decision to terminate life-sustaining care unless this is specified in the durable power of attorney document.
Who Can Create Advance Directives
Advance directives are available to any adult, regardless of health status. However, no one is required to create advance directives, and advance directives can be revoked at any time at the patient’s request.
Before providing care, hospitals are required by law to ask patients if they have an advance directive and provide guidance and necessary documents if the patient chooses to create one.
If a patient is unable to make healthcare decisions and does not have an advance directive, healthcare providers will consult with the patient’s spouse, adult children, parents, siblings or other adult relatives, among others, as required by state law.
How to Create Advance Directives
To create an advance directive, contact your doctor or an area hospital. You may also want to contact an attorney, although this is not a requirement.
Many organizations, including the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, provide state-specific advance directive instructions and forms. Laws regarding advance directives vary from state to state.
To learn more about the laws in your state, visit the U.S. Living Will Registry website.
The National Institutes of Health has more information on advance directives.

Development and pesticides have ravaged Texas bees, and a lot more than honey is at stake.
In a sun-dappled elm thicket in Grimes County on a cloudless day in late March, Binford Weaver is looking for queens.
“Let’s check this little hive here,” says Weaver. “I don’t have a smoker. So we’ll just see if they object to this.” He deftly removes the long rubber band securing the top of a small queen-rearing hive or “nuc.” Once he has removed the top, dozens of bees begin buzzing around Weaver, who is wearing a faded chambray work shirt, jeans and a stout pair of work boots. Working slowly to avoid alarming the hive, he removes a frame covered with bees and begins scanning it. After a second or two, Weaver points his gnarled index finger at the long-bodied queen, the only bee in the hive that lays eggs. It’s a Buckfast, a strain of bee developed about 50 years ago by an English monk. “There she is,” says Weaver with delight as he surveys the egg-filled cells she’s producing. “Is she ever a laying queen!”
After showing his guests the frame and scanning another, Weaver gently replaces them, secures the top of the hive and begins scanning some of the 2,200 other queen-rearing hives on the property. It has been a wet spring, and Weaver’s bee operation, one of the largest in the country, is behind schedule. The rain has prevented the queens and drones from mating and that has slowed his package bee business. Weaver, 73, has been raising bees since he was a child, and he’s renowned throughout the country for producing prolific queens, which he sells to professional and hobbyist beekeepers around the world. In recent years, he has shipped them as far away as Poland, Japan and Saudi Arabia.
And while Weaver’s business has been relatively good — he’ll sell half a million pounds of honey this year, along with 20,000 queens and tens of thousands of pounds of live bees — he’s worried.
Bees are under assault. And that may mean bad news for all Texans, from those who like honey to those who enjoy looking at wildflowers. Researchers are finding that without bees the state might not have bluebonnets, foxgloves or columbines, all of which are pollinated by bees.
Bee populations — both domesticated and wild — are falling. Lower honey prices combined with introduced natural threats such as Africanized bees and varroa mites, an Asian bee parasite, have crippled the Texas bee business. Other threats include pests such as tracheal mites and diseases such as foulbrood and chalkbrood. The combination of these forces could be catastrophic. Not only do honeybees pollinate some $587 million worth of crops every year in Texas, they also play a key role in pollinating wild plants. “We feel like we are a vital cog in the wheel of the flora and therefore the fauna in the wild,” says Weaver.
Native bees, which pollinate hundreds of plants, also are declining. Texas has hundreds of species of native bees, many of which never have been scientifically studied. Like their domesticated cousins, they have been hit hard in recent years. Urban sprawl has chewed up their habitat, and the increasing use of pesticides has reduced their numbers. Although few statistics are available, native bee populations seem to be declining like those of honeybees.
The loss of bee populations will do far more than affect the price of honey at the grocery store. But because little scientific work has been done on native and domesticated bees, the long-term effects are difficult to predict. Weaver and other beekeepers are lobbying the state to fund more scientific work on bees.
“There has been no study of the value of bees to native flora,” says Weaver. “We have it pretty well-documented that bees pollinate billions of dollars’ worth of agricultural crops. But there’s not a whisper about what they do for wildlife.”
Sage Kawecki, formerly a native plant information specialist at the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center in Austin, says bees are critically important because so many of the state’s wildflowers rely on bees for pollination. She points out that many flowers have evolved bee-sized shapes. That architecture helps assure pollination when an insect visits the plant. Other plants, such as the rockrose, which produces delicate violet flowers, have ultraviolet nectar guides that help direct the bee down into the flower. “Plants have very specific pollinator needs, so if something happened to the bee population, it’d be very tough on native plants,” she says.
Native Texans
Jack Neff is too old to say words like “goody.” But on a cool, overcast morning in April, the husky biologist can’t control himself. As we drive slowly past an abandoned driveway on a narrow, deserted farm road in rural Bastrop County, it’s immediately clear to Neff that there are dozens upon dozens of new nests of Andrena sitiliae, one of Neff’s favorite native bees.
Unlike honeybees, which live in colonies that number in the tens of thousands, native bees are solitary and each nest is founded by a single female. Many species, especially those that nest in the ground, live close to each other in loose aggregations, possibly for mutual nest defense against predators and parasites. The andrena bee that Neff studies is typical. It’s a small, stingless bee that nests underground. (About 90 percent of the species that are native to Texas nest below the surface of the earth.) The entrance to its nest is marked by a small mound of dirt that sticks out of the ground like a tiny volcano. As soon as his car rolls to a stop, Neff bounds out to examine new nests on the small patch of dirt. The rainy spring has been good for the bees. In his years of visiting the site, Neff never has seen so many nests. Tiny mounds, hundreds of them, jut through the surface and small, black andrena bees flit among the plants.
During the past two decades, Neff, an independent researcher with a Ph.D. in biology, has seen a sharp decline among native bees. Neff estimates that about 800 species of bees are native to Texas. That’s a big number. For comparison, consider that 622 species of birds have been recorded in the Lone Star State. And unlike birds, which have a large and growing constituency, native bees have been largely ignored by the state’s scientists, which means that Neff’s estimate of 800 species may be too low.
Despite the solitary nature of his work, Neff continues documenting bee populations, and he has found some shocking declines. At the University of Texas Brackenridge Field Laboratory in Austin, where Neff does some of his field research, he has documented 218 different species of native bees. But today, that number is less than 100, says Neff, and the number probably is falling.
Like many other native bees, the bee that Neff studies is host-specific, meaning it favors a certain plant over all others. For andrena, the favored host is the false dandelion, a common, bright yellow spring flower on which it depends for pollen. The male and the queen will forage for pollen for about three hours per day, then disappear back into their tunnel, which may extend three feet under the surface.
Neff gathers his net and other gear from the car, and we spend the next 30 minutes capturing andrena bees – many of them by hand – and examining them at our leisure. For people wary of bees — and their stingers — handling the andrenas is an odd experience. They are remarkably easy to catch. And though their buzz is a bit disconcerting, it quickly becomes clear why they are often referred to as “tickle bees.” They lack stingers and the rapid vibration of their wings is exhilarating. Neff makes a few more notes about the site and we begin looking for other native bees. We are rewarded quickly. We find a bee called Diadasia afflicta, another native, stingless bee that prefers small violet flowers known as winecups.
What Happens Next?
Scooter Cheatham had to work quickly. The renowned botanist had arrived at the site east of Vidor before daybreak to photograph a plant uncommon in Texas, Aureolaria flava. The plant, which occurs in only a few locations in East Texas, produces a beautiful but delicate yellow flower. And Cheatham knew if he was going to get a good photograph of the blossoms, he’d have to vie with a mass of bees eager to rob the plant of its nectar.
Cheatham got the shot he wanted. But he was amazed at the bees. “An hour after we got there,” he says, “the flowers were starting to turn black and curl up because the bees had been working them so hard.”
Cheatham is the principal author of The Useful Wild Plants of Texas, the Southeastern and Southwestern United States, the Southern Plains, and Northern Mexico, an encyclopedia of some 3,000 plants native to the region. (The second volume of the 12-volume set has just been published.) In his three decades of work on the project, he visited every corner of the state, cataloging, researching and photographing plants. And he has no doubt about the value of bees. “It’s clear that without the bees, the plant kingdom would go away. There are other pollinators, but bees are the dominant ones.”
Cheatham and other scientists point out that the value of bees goes far beyond beautiful flowers. The American diet is highly dependent on bees. Watermelons, cantaloupes, almonds, apples, citrus and many other food products depend on pollination by domesticated bees. Modern farmers must have a reliable source of pollination for their crops, and that usually means hiring a beekeeper to bring in a load of beehives for several weeks while the crops are flowering. Such contract pollination has become a key source of income for many beekeepers. And while many are worried about pests and honey prices, there are some positive developments on the horizon.
Beekeepers are successfully domesticating the bumblebee, an important pollinator. Bumblebees often are better pollinators than honeybees because their larger, fuzzier bodies collect more pollen from the stamens of plants, and they make better contact with the pistils than honeybees and other insects. Bumblebees, which are native to Texas and many other parts of the world, are being raised in the northern United States, Israel and other countries, and breeders have used them successfully to pollinate crops such as tomatoes, that are grown in greenhouses.
There are other positive developments: A new breed of varroa mite-resistant bee known as the Harbo, a line bred by U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists, is being tested in the United States. If the varroa-resistant stock is a good honey producer and exhibits other positive characteristics, it may become an alternative to better-known varieties such as the Buckfast.
In addition, the scientific world has grown increasingly aware of the importance of bees and other animals in pollination. During the past few years, several scientists, including Gary Nabhan, Stephen Buchmann and others, have published books and magazine articles about the roles pollinators play in our ecosystems.
Beekeepers have been heartened that although the Africanized bee has infested large areas of South Texas, it has not come into the state’s big cities, and its progress throughout the state has slowed considerably.
But researchers such as Neff believe more aggressive conservation efforts will be needed if the state’s bee populations are to recover. Education, money and intensive efforts to preserve large stretches of habitat will be needed.
“It’s hard to put a value on one particular bee, but it’s all part of the whole ecosystem,” he says. “Honeybees are not a universal pollinator, nor are bumblebees. There’s no such thing. Each bee has its role.” Whether that role is pollinating bluebonnets, row crops, apple orchards or fields of cotton, Neff insists that our civilization needs bees. “We really are dependent on these things.” O
Bumblebees often are better pollinators than honeybees because their larger, fuzzier bodies collect more pollen from the stamens of the plants.
Honey and Allergies: A Sweet Cure?
Honey’s medicinal uses have been known for millennia. Some 1,500 years before the birth of Christ, the Egyptians were using honey both internally and externally for the treatment of more than 200 different maladies.
While some of those nostrums may seem silly today — such as using honey and animal fat to cure baldness — honey’s reputation as a healing agent remains strong, particularly when it comes to dealing with allergies. Although modern medicine has not concluded that locally produced honey helps reduce symptoms, many allergy sufferers swear by it. The rationale is this: local bees harvest pollen and other plant products from a region, then refine those products into honey. By eating honey produced from local plants — including those that produce allergy-causing pollen — people with allergies can bolster their immunity to those plants. (Keep in mind that children younger than 18 months old should not be fed any product containing honey.)
Treating allergies with honey requires that the honey be minimally processed and produced as close as possible to your home. Getting that type of honey may require a bit of effort. Much of the honey now sold in America is imported from countries as far away as China, Argentina and Vietnam.
“Almost everybody is buying honey from elsewhere and packing it and selling it,” says Clint Walker, owner of Lone Star Honey Co. in Rogers and president of the American Beekeeping Federation. Walker says most commercial honey is heated, clarified with diatomaceous earth, then run through a fine mesh filter system. While that process makes the honey look prettier on the shelf, it also strips it of much of its nutritional value. “Zero pollen makes it through that filter,” he said. “So if you are using honey to treat your allergies, you aren’t helping.”
Walker says the best way to get unprocessed honey is to buy it directly from beekeepers. The easiest way to do that is by frequenting your local farmers’ market. (If you can’t find a beekeeper, call your local agricultural extension agent, who can probably put you in touch with the local beekeepers association). You can also shop at roadside stands and small country stores. If the label doesn’t specify where the honey is produced, ask the proprietor.
When shopping for locally produced honey, expect to pay a bit more than you would at the supermarket. Texas beekeepers say they sell much of their product for about $3 per pound. Bill Bates, who has been keeping bees for more than 50 years in Bell County, says that he sells about 60 percent of his honey to people interested in treating their allergies. And none of them quibble with him over price. “They can buy cheaper honey,” says Bates. “But they can’t buy honey that will work on their allergies.”
Supporting honey producers like Bates helps sustain Texas’ struggling beekeeping industry –— and assure a healthy population of pollinators for the state’s diverse ecosystem. And it may even provide some sweet relief from your allergies.To delete a section which you don't want to print, click on the red highlight or red X.

As expected the majority of the Ulster families are the R1b1b2 haplogroup and its subclades. The group comes in circa 85% at present. The dominate subclade in the group is the R1b1b2a1b5, which includes the Northwest Irish modal, the R1b1b2a1b5b, or as some like to call it the Niall of the Nine Hostages group. Most of the participants classified into the R1b1b2 group have not yet done the necessary subclade tests to determine if they also would be R1b1b2a1b5 group and it is very likely that the majority would test positive to it.
These people are the descendants of Celtic tribal groups indigenous to northern Ireland, Argyll, Aryshire, Wales, and other locations in northern Britain.
The second most numerous group is the I haplogroup and its subclades. Like the R1b1b2 group, there has been a lot of research which has discovered new subclades in the I group. Many of the I sublades have obvious links to the Norse and Norman presence in Ulster, yet there are other I subclades that geneticist believe are indigenous to the British Isles, such as the I2b1a group. It is possible that the I2b1a group represent the very first people in Ulster.
The are also small numbers from a wide variety of haplogroups, C, E, G, J, Q, T, and even two from the rare as hens' teeth, A haplogroup.

Can I order white handles for this faucet set?A. Unfortunately white handles are not an option for the Moen T4570.
Do the handles come with the faucet?A. Yes, the Moen T4570 Double Handle Widespread Lavatory Faucet with Metal Lever Handles does include the Handle as part of the kit.
Does the T4570p show here include the 9000 kit? How is the drain assembly ordered?A. The Moen T4570 does not come with the necessary rough in valves, the Moen 9000. It does come up with the pop-up which in conjunction with the 9000 give you a fully functional drain.
How do you remove the spout?A. The spout for the Moen T4570 is not removable as it is all one piece.?A. The Moen CAT4570 and the T4570 are only the trim and you would want to also purchase the CA9000 rough-in valve. No, you cannot purchase the T4570 and have it shipped to California.
How do I remove the handles?A. The handles on the Moen T4570 Faucet unscrew counterclockwise at the base where they get wider.
I believe we have the chrome/brass Moen 2 handle lavatory faucet. The top part of the hub & elbow assembly is wobbly and very loose. How, if possible, can that be tightened?A. The Moen T4570 is able to be tightened. The Tub screws on. If the elbow is what is loose, unscrew the hub, you will find a Phillips screw, this will tighten the elbow..
Do you have white with polished brass. One of mine on vanity is bad the other like new, and they match my garden tubA. Thank you for choosing Build.com! I'm happy to help! The only option we have close to that for this faucet is the chrome/polished brass.
What is the part number for the extension kit necessary for a counter top that is greater than 1 1/4 inches thick?A. The Moen 115001 is the thick deck extension kit.
Do you have to have a rough in valve to install the Moen T4570 and is the T4570 a lead free or low lead faucet?A. The Moen T4570 works with the Moen 9000 rough-in valve and the T4570 is low lead compliant.

A report says that, although Apple has prototypes of the iTV living in its locked-down design studios, it’s having trouble securing the content deals that it wants and it may be another year or so until the integrated TV launches.
Apple is supposedly looking at 42-inch or larger TV set models for the initial release. This contradicts previous alleged supply chain leaks that say that the company will be launching with smaller (and cheaper) 32- and 37-inch sets; that report also had the sets arriving in mid-2012.
The new report cites an alleged former Apple employee who says that a slick 50-inch TV set is housed in Sir Jony Ive’s locked-down Cupertino design studio. As Ive’s studio is where all of Apple’s ideas go to take physical form, this is hardly surprising news; Ive may have had TV prototypes in there for years.
More of a revelation is the news that Apple is getting hung up in trying to make content deals. A source who allegedly was part of the Apple TV team says that content providers are resisting Apple’s courting. The company supposedly wants to give customers à la carte packages: think of it as a build-your-own cable package.
Such an offering would be a revolution in content distribution, and customers would embrace it wholeheartedly. And that’s exactly why content providers are reluctant to make a deal. They’re perfectly happy with charging sky-high rates for tiered cable packages, and will likely fight tooth-and-nail to preserve their old method. Apple nudged (nay, shoved) the music industry into the 21st century with its iTunes content deals; a similar seismic shift in the television industry frightens content providers.
Aside from the possible new content distribution method, the TV set would also incorporate Siri and iOS devices as remote controls. You could simply ask Siri to “play something by Martin Scorcese from the last ten years,” and watch as Gangs of New York begins. Likewise, Apple would likely release its own Apple TV apps for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch for slightly more traditional controls.
When will we see the Apple TV set? This report cites an analyst who believes that it’s still over a year away. That may or may not be the case, but the product’s release probably does hinge on Apple’s content deals. Without those, it’s just a slick-looking TV with Apple TV built-in.

Is Chris Kreider a top contender for the Calder Trophy? -- @surlysailor
Indeed he is among the top contenders for the Calder Trophy. In fact, our own Jon Lane wrote that Kreider would win the Calder Trophy if it were handed out today. Kreider, though, has serious competition from the likes of Nathan MacKinnon, Valeri Nichushkin and Aleksander Barkov. What I like about Kreider's game is how physical he is. He's a powerful player with a particularly strong lower body. His legs power him, and he's using them better this season than he has in the past. He's been an effective player since coming back from the AHL. As long as he continues to use his legs, Kreider should be able to create offense and stay in the Calder race.
The Capitals, Hurricanes, Blues and Ducks have an abundance of goalies. Who moves and who is interested? -- @paulfrank17
I can see the Washington Capitals and St. Louis Blues potentially making moves. The Carolina Hurricanes shouldn't do anything as long as Cam Ward is on injured reserve. The Anaheim Ducks are in the same position with Viktor Fasth. The other thing with Anaheim is that Frederik Andersen does not have to clear waivers, so if Fasth returns, they can send Andersen to the AHL without any concern. Trading Jonas Hiller would be a mistake even though he's in the final year of his contract. He's been excellent, and Anaheim is a contending team.
The funny thing with the Blues is they could actually be in the market for a goalie even though they have Jaroslav Halak, Brian Elliott and Jake Allen. Blues general manager Doug Armstrong may try to acquire Ryan Miller from the Buffalo Sabres before the NHL Trade Deadline on March 5. He'd likely want to trade Elliott or Halak in the deal. They're scheduled to be unrestricted free agents after the season.
In Washington, Philipp Grubauer's play is making Michal Neuvirth appear expendable, especially since Braden Holtby is better than he has played and simply needs his confidence back to be good again. Neuvirth carries a $2.5 million salary-cap charge next season. It would make sense for the New York Islanders to make a play for him.
Where do you rank John Tavares as far as player rankings? Third behind Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin? -- @notFABRIZI
Player rankings are difficult because Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin are completely different players, so how do you rank them? I know that sounds like a cop out, but it's true. How do you rank a pure goal-scorer next to a playmaking center? I will always lean toward the playmaking center as being more valuable player because he makes other players around him better. But the goal-scorer can be the game-breaker. Ovechkin is the best scorer in the NHL.
That said, to answer your question, I'd put Tavares behind Crosby, Pavel Datsyuk, Jonathan Toews and Steven Stamkos, but a notch ahead of Ovechkin. But like I said, I'm a big believer in the playmakers because they make the goal-scorers better, not the other way around.
What country will be the biggest potential dark horse in Sochi? -- @the_saad
Finland. It seems like people always take the Finns for granted, but they're the only country that has medaled three times since NHL players started participating in the Olympics 16 years ago. They have arguably the deepest goaltending in the tournament with Tuukka Rask, Antti Niemi and Kari Lehtonen. Minus Saku Koivu, they have the same core as they usually do, plus they have some young studs in Aleksander Barkov and Olli Maatta. They know how to play the big-ice game. The one question I have is will their defense hold up, but I'm on the lookout for the Finns.Star Retread
I went to see Star Trek opening night a few weeks ago at a multiplex an hour away. From the opening scene to the closing credits I was enthralled. The Enterprise has never looked better. The special effects have never been more spectacular. All the actors chosen to play the famous original crew are perfectly cast, young doppelgangers through and through. Pacing is swift with just the right amount of dialogue. Humor is fresh and lively. And did I mention Leonard Nimoy making a final curtain call as Spock? Simply poignant. So you can imaging my surprise driving home when I was overcome with a feeling of disappointment, a let-down that only became more pronounced as I made my way down the dark highway.
Been there. Done that. For all the great casting and special effects the undeniable truth remains; there's nothing new under the sun or in the galaxy to be found in Star Trek. There's time travel. Unlikely as always. Check. Please see Voyage Home and First Contact. There's a nasty villian bent on revenge. Check. See The Wrath of Khan and Nemesis. Nero goes around blowing up planets with an eerie looking drill. Near the film's climax he attempts to destroy the Earth. Evidently the planet has no defenses for it's just the Enterprise that intervenes made of a crew of recently graduated cadets. Plot hole. Check. See all other Star Trek movies.
What there isn't much of is a story. It's almost as if the narrative simply exists to give the young crew of the Enterprise something to do as they get to know eachother and we them. Trouble is, we already know them, and after Star Trek there won't be any remaining mystery to unravel.
There was an episode from The Next Generation featuring the Enterprise crew as children. It was a fun gimmick for one show, but I wouldn't try and build a series around it. Sadly, that is what the new movie does all too successfully. It regurgitates with exquisite detail the beloved characters from the 1960s and pumps them up with up with 21st Century CGI as well as overused plot devices. An argument could be made that each successive generation of Star Trek is simply a slightly new version of the original, incorporating all the basic elements in a new wrapper. Spock=Data=Odo=7of9. With the new movie, however, any notion of a new wrinkle or appearance is discarded in favor of blatant nostalgia. U2 had a song from the early 1990s titled Even Better Than the Real Thing. That's what Abrams' film is, and it is both its success and ultimate failure. In the absence of any new idea or Roddenberry philosophical dilemma we get slickness and action. Lots of it. The cast is good. Maybe a little too good. If you're like me you won't realize what you've missed until later, if at all.
Star Trek boldly goes, alright, but it goes we've already gone before. At the end of the picture as the lights came up and the credits rolled the audience members began to applaud spontaneously. I think I've only been in a theatre once or twice when that has happened. When I was a boy of twelve I went to see Star Wars. The audience, including my cousin and I, applauded with abandon, mesmerized by what we had just seen, even transformed. Never for a moment did I think of clapping for Star Trek. Now I know why.
With all that said will I see it again when it comes to my local theatre? You betcha. Will I buy the DVD when it comes out, hopefully with lots of extras? Without a doubt. Will I enjoy every minute of it despite my reservations? Damn right I will! Will I still pine for an original cinematic idea instead of sequel after sequel after sequel. Of course.
Sure it wasn't all new, and they didn't boldly go where any other Star Trek's have gone before, but it was entertaining and refreshing to me. To Kirk and Spock meet for the first time and to keep the nostalgia of the original series was perfect for me. All I liked about the original series I love in this prequill. There doesn't have to be a "but". A 1000 things doen right and only about 3 things done wrong. Not many movies are this good.

Purdue University President Mitch Daniels speaks at the Monitor-hosted breakfast for reporters in Washington, D.C., Wednesday, Oct. 30, 2013.
Michael Bonfigli/The Christian Science Monitor
Purdue University President Mitch Daniels, director of the Office of Management and Budget under George W. Bush and a two-term Republican governor of Indiana before assuming his current role in 2013, was the guest at the Oct. 30 Monitor Breakfast.
Q: President Obama's proposal to tie federal financial aid to new government ratings of universities and colleges:
A: "The general idea of focusing more on performance ... is a good idea, but I am pretty dubious about the federal government being the ones to put a system together."
The nation's $17 trillion debt:
"The debts we are piling up right now are an obstacle to growth.... It is the largest nonmilitary danger we have ever faced."
Young people and the nation's finances:
"This generation has a right to be as upset with its elders as any in history. They are going to inherit a mountain of debt."
Young people and the Affordable Care Act:
"[It] soaks the young to benefit their elders. Premiums for young people will go up way beyond whatever is actuarially fair and accurate in order to subsidize the elders."
The longer-term response to the Affordable Care Act by young people:
"I don't think they have quite focused on this. But when they do, they are going to say 'We got handed a really raw deal here.' "
Why faster economic growth is critical:
"We are not going to be ... an economically successful country, a solvent country, or – frankly – a societally harmonious country at 1 to 2 percent growth rates. It will destroy something bigger than the middle class; it will destroy the sense of upward mobility and therefore social cohesiveness that we have always been blessed with."2005 Honda Accord EX 2.4L 4 cylinder from North America
Summary:
Poor reliability keeps me from enjoying my new Accord
Faults:
Interior rattles and shakes badly.
Passenger seat broke.
Air conditioner compressor replaced twice.
General Comments:
I bought the Accord new in February 2005 hoping to have the same reliability that others have had with older Hondas, however this car has been a nightmare from day one.
There is an annoying popping noise from the base of the windshield every time I hit the slightest bump or the body flexes a little. There are several service bulletins about it, but my dealership cannot seem to fix it.
The door panels buzz and rattle. So does the sunroof. The recliner broke on the passenger seat, and my passengers had to ride laying down until I could get it to the dealer for repair.
The interior seems to be the most shoddy part of this car, but also, the dealer had to replace the air conditioner compressor twice, because it started to sound like someone had dropped their keys down into the motor when I had the air on.
I have an arbitration hearing in December to find out what Honda is going to do. I have requested that they buy the car back, since the number of times it has been in for repairs qualifies it for lemon laws.
The new Hondas are not built reliably like the older ones were. I won't buy another one.
Would you buy another car from this manufacturer? No
Review Date: 9th December, 2005
31st Dec 2005, 11:13
May be you did drop your keys into the AC compressor. Twice! Maybe a little child got into the car and played with the recliner. sounds like a good way to break any seat recliner.

Sounds like a lemon. However, the interior rattles, such as the annoying window rattle on the driver's side, are common problems.International Students Zones” –.For almost 80 years now, the best national teams in the world have come together every four years to do battle for the greatest prize the game has to offer. An impressive number of countries have already staged the FIFA World Cup™, each of them giving the event its own special and unique flavour.

I thought they meant portable computers utilizing headgear as a display device, but when I clicked the link, I discovered they were talking about dental headgear. Well, to make it short, there’s new headgear that monitors how long patients where the gear. This allows dentists to better motivate and monitor kids’ progress through the use of headgear (haha.. I had to wear that before. I wore it about 1/3 of the time I was supposed to, and the dentist always said my teeth were doing great and I must be doing a good job wearing the ‘gear’). Anyway, the one thing that made the article worth reading was this statement:
“He’s the father of headgear,” Jacobson said.
That’s so funny. Just imagine a bunch of guys that work with headgear all day long idolizing a guy as being the ‘father of headgear’. Well, it makes me laugh anyway.
0 Responses to “Headgear”Face to Face with Etienne Roux of ALS Surface Logging
Etienne Roux, Managing Director, ALS Surface Logging
There may be few people in the oil and gas industry who have literally dug so deep in the field as Etienne Roux, whose first training was 12,777 feet underground in the gold mines of South Africa.
A tinkerer all his life — his family didn’t own a television until he was 12 — Roux knew he wanted to study engineering. In South Africa, that means you start in the gold mines.
“The South African industry has been there since the ’60s, and there is massive infrastructure under the earth. It’s an extremely tough working environment,” he said. “I figured out it was probably not where I wanted to work for the rest of my life, in 110 degree heat in massive humidity.”
Still, as part of his scholarship for college, Roux spent two years learning the mining business before Schlumberger Ltd. (NYSE: SLB) hired him. Today, Roux runs the shop in Houston as managing director of ALS Surface Logging, which analyzes the geography of potential hydrocarbon properties for oil and gas exploration and production companies.
How did your upbringing in South Africa shape your approach to life and work?
It taught me from early age to have a goal in mind, to do something specific and then set out how to achieve it. From sporting matches to building — it just taught a lot of responsibility early on to (use a) set and systematic fashion. It’s one of the things I like about engineering. I’m not the type of person to wake up in the morning and wing it.
It was a good way to grow up. You were left to your own devices to achieve what you wanted, which is what engineering is about, especially in the oil and gas industry. It allowed me to look at challenges and not get too intimidated. Too often, people see a big challenge and the scope puts people off right from the beginning. Rather than get to a solution, they just keep spinning around. You have to break it down into smaller problems and move forward.
What have been the highlights along the way?
From a professional point of view, it’s been to grow in the companies where I’ve spent time working professionally. The biggest highlight is to be with the reservoir group and able to execute that strategy. It’s proved that I’m achieving what I set out to achieve professionally. Personally, it’s such an achievement to come home and see (my children) chase me down at the door.
What’s something that most people don’t know about you?
I’m a big commercial aviation junkie. I don’t fly, but I’ve logged the miles from every flight. It’s 2.4 million miles now. It started out as just an Excel spreadsheet.
My first flight was from Cape Town to Johannesburg for a scholarship (interview). I was a hero in my final (school) year when I returned. Everyone wanted to know about the flight, and I told them the jet lag was terrible. The flight was all of one hour.
Coming from a vastly different culture, what’s your take on Houston?
It’s such a family-friendly place. We’ve been in Houston since I took this job in 2011, but I had a previous assignment in Houston in 2008 with Schlumberger. All roads lead to Houston. On my first trip to Houston, I went to Sugar Land from Alaska, and I arrived wearing a North Face jacket in June. I told the driver, ‘I will never live in this city, ever.’ He laughed and said, ‘If you’re in oil and gas, my friend, you will be here for a long time.’
What’s your best advice?
Don’t sweat the small stuff — look at the big picture. It frustrates me when people look at something so complicated and then sit there for two days. Look, move on and always remember the decisions we make dictate the lives we live. That’s true in business, too.
What is your biggest pet peeve?
Not paying attention to details. If you put a proposal out to a client who wants to pay you $2 million, you owe it to them to cross all the Ts, dot the Is, and make sure everything is a reflection of your business. That attention to detail, for me, is so important.
Hidden talents?
I think I’m a hard-driving businessperson, but I always have time for people. It’s probably not that obvious on a daily basis, but I will always close the laptop or switch off the phone and listen.

So the Maxi Shackle was designed to offer a decent level of security when fastened to either a block wall, gatepost or similar.
It takes the form of a long plate with a U-shaped bulge welded ﬁrmly to it and has four holes that enable you to ﬁt the shackle to an immovable object. The kit comes complete with the ﬁtting of your choice – Liebig Safety Bolts for walls, through-ﬁtting all thread studs or even a chemical resin mounting kit.
The Shackle’s opening is 50x50mm, widening to 80mm. That’s big enough to take most chains. The plate steel is very resistant to cutting and the combination of long bolts with resin capsule fittings and the long base plate make the Maxi Shackle extremely strong.
We threaded a chain through and swung it around, trying to get the Shackle to pull away from the wall. It didn’t budge at all. If you don’t have the option of fitting a ground anchor then the Maxi Shackle is pretty much the next best thing. We’d advise installing it in a place where your bike obscures it, which should make it even more difﬁcult for a thief to attack.GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Long underwear. Insulated gloves. Snowboots.

Beer festival. Outdoors. In February.
Enjoying beer and winter at the same time is the idea behind Michigan’s annual Winter Beer Festival, held in a minor league baseball stadium parking lot outside Grand Rapids.
Many of the most lauded brewers in Michigan — which has become a craft-brewing powerhouse — pour at the festival.
Brewers both large and take part.
The suds festival requires layer upon layer of clothing, thick necklaces of homemade snacks such as pretzels and string cheese and, perhaps most important, a positive disposition to drink beer outside for six hours during the winter.

Travelers interested in trying the offerings at the Winter Beer Festival, though, will have to wait until 2015.

834 Austin Court, Lawrenceville, GA 30046
1472 Brentwood Drive, Marietta, GA 30062.SPRINGFIELD, Mo.-- We've seen two meth lab fires in the Springfield area in just the last couple weeks. Of course, they raise concern for neighbors, and it's more than just the fire danger, or the criminal activity. Whether past or present, the toxins left behind by a meth lab can cause negative health effects.
Springfield firefighters were called to a house fire on west Webster Sunday night, only to find a meth lab. Brookline Fire found a similar situation near Sunshine and West Bypass a couple weeks ago.
"If this place would have blew up, everybody would have been gone," said neighbor William Dunn.
Thankfully, there were no injuries in either fire. But Springfield firefighters take some extra precaution when dealing with a meth lab fire, because of the explosion hazard. Not to mention the smoke is toxic.
"A lot of times, they use household chemicals, so there's not much more hazard with a meth house fire then there is with a regular household fire, unless it's a massive scale," says Chris Schaefer with Sunbelt Environmental Services.
While it's easy enough to get away from the smoke, it's harder to tell when you're being exposed to meth fumes or residue. "My girlfriend says the last few days she smelled something kind of weird," said Dunn.
The smell can be one indicator, or of course, finding a working lab. But many times it's a big question.
"They have us come out and do some air sampling sometimes and wall sampling," Schaefer says.From Getty Images. Why Don’t We Know More about the Great White North?

PECOS, Feb. 28, 1996 - Despite almost missing the chance for mammography
services, Reeves County Hospital will host the grand opening of the West
Texas Cancer Prevention Partnership mobile unit March 20.
Iris Rives, assistant administrator, told the hospital board Tuesday
that mammograms will be offered on April 3 and during the health fair on
April 13.
"They will send people out here to go to doctors' offices and to the
hospital for in-service training," Rives said. "We will be the first
grand opening of the mobile unit. The next day it goes to Fort Stockton."
Chief Executive Officer Terry Andris said that Reeves County was four
months behind when he learned of the project and almost missed the
chance to participate.
Literature sent to the hospital never got to administrators or to the
board of directors, he said.
"This is a good quality service for the community and revenue for the
hospital," Andris said. "We were supposed to have a hospital member and
a community health advocate on the committee."
Jeannette Alligood asked for a report to the board on who from this area
was on the committee and "why we almost lost it."
"I don't think we appointed anyone," said board chairman Raul Garcia,
who had earlier told the board about the project. "I made contact
personally because this advertising was all over, except Reeves County
Hospital didn't know about it. So Terry and I made phone calls."
Andris said he sent Nancy Ontiveros and Rives to a meeting to learn
about the project.
The Texas Cancer Council and Texas Tech University Health Sciences
Center have teamed together to form the West Texas Cancer Prevention
Partnership, Andris said.
The Council provided state funds to Tech for the purchase and
administration of the mobile mammography clinic.
TTUHSC will operate the clinic and provide medical oversight of the
clinic services.
The two state agencies are teaming with the American Cancer Society,
local physicians, community hospitals and the West Texas Community Care
Consortium to provide breast cancer education and to help women with
abnormal mammogram results obtain diagnosis and treatment service.
Scheduling will be done from Lubbock for the first few visits.
Diagnostic mammograms will be available for symptomatic women as well as
basic screening mammograms.
Each patient is required to have a clinical breast exam prior to
receiving a mammogram. Interested patients can call 1-800-222-8388 to
schedule an appointment, Andris said.
"There will be other services offered through this," he said. "Dr.
(W.J.) Bang was happy because he was looking for a piece of equipment.
Dr. Bang had earlier recommended that the board purchase a mammography
unit for local use.
In other action, the board voted to contract with VHA to obtain bulk
purchase discounts on supplies; with TPA for a cardiac acute
intervention program, in which Activase will be available to dissolve
blood clots in heart attack victims; agreed to purchase a centrifuge for
the laboratory and a range for the kitchen; and approved a change in the
organization chart to include a trauma nurse coordinator.
They ordered an election for May 4 to elect three directors: Precincts 1
and 3 and at large. Early voting begins April 15 in the hospital lobby,
with Nadine Smith serving as early voting clerk.
Brenda Martinez McKinney was named judge of the early voting ballot
board and Linda Jones is alternate judge.
Members of the central counting committee are Iris Rives, Craig Hill,
Mary Ann Canon, Jodi Exum, Virginia Palomino, Ellen Friar, Frances
Garcia, Dora Villaneuva, Yvonne Abila, Belinda Chabarria, Rosa Granado,
Christina Vasquez and Esther Alvarez.
Dr. Kai-Wood Ma was appointed to the active staff, with clinical
privileges.
Andris recommended the board defer approval of a contract with John J.
Ingram & Associates for services to assist the hospital in qualifying
patients for payment through Supplemental Security Income.
"I need to investigate complaints on the way John J. Ingram does
business," Andris said.
Dr. James Cam said the medical staff wants to confer with attorney Scott
Johnson before making a recommendation on a request to approve Dr. Shun
Chon Lee as an indigent care health provider, since he is not on the
active staff.
Board member Chel Flores said the financial statement is "looking better
and better."
Andris said some collections have increased revenue, but that "the
census has fluctuated all over the board. We started with 11 this
morning and we down to six this evening. We had 16 at the beginning of
the week. It is up and down with the wind."
Finance officer John Lowery said that tax collections through January
were 77.89 percent of the levy, compared with 83.85 percent last year.
Tax assessor-collector Elfida Zuniga is depositing tax collections in
the hospital's account when they reach $1,000, he said, "So we are
getting money one month sooner into our interest-bearing account."
Sales tax receipts are $3,600 ahead of budgeted projections, with
$30,700 received in January.
Andris said the quality improvement programs for the business office
began on Feb. 13, and will be ongoing.

From Staff and Wire Reports
Property taxes levied by local government and school districts in Texas
rose 4.7 percent in 1994 to $15.44 billion, the state comptroller's
office reports.
That's in contrast to local rates, which remained stable for taxpayers
in Reeves County in 1994, and fell slightly last year.
For the first time since 1987, the comptroller said, school districts
reported raising taxes at a slower rate, less than 4 percent.
``For the preceding six years, school taxes have increased at annual
rates ranging from 6 (percent) to 14 percent,'' the report said.
The property tax remained the single largest levy, with the state sales
tax running No. 2 at $9.8 billion.
A total of $35 billion in taxes of all kinds was levied for 1994
government spending.
Pecos-Barstow-Toyah ISD, Reeves County and the Reeves County Hospital
District kept the same tax rate in 1995 as they had in 1994. The city of
Pecos lowered the rate 2 cents per $100 in 1995, after paying off bond
indebtedness.
As a group, Pecos' combined tax rate of $3.02 per $100 valuation remains
among the highest in the state, but it is offset in part by low property
values within Reeves County.
Citing rising property taxes, Gov. George W. Bush has been looking at
possible ways of replacing the school levy. The latest report shows that
need, Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Monday.
``This underscores the governor's concern that the property tax burden
is too high and may be near the breaking point,'' Ms. Hughes said.
As for the slower growth in school taxes, she said, ``Even a modest
increase on top of an already big burden is overwhelming for some
people.''
In a preliminary analysis, a special tax study group outlined several
options to Bush, including: a gross receipts tax on business revenues; a
value-added tax, which is a form of indirect sales tax paid on products
and services at each stage of production or distribution; and increasing
or expanding the current 6.25 percent state sales tax.
Ms. Hughes said the study group should have a final report ready by
mid-March.
According to the comptroller's office, which looked at the most recent
data available, the largest portion of property taxes - $9 billion - was
levied by school districts.
Of all taxing units, counties reported the largest percentage increase
from 1993 to 1994 - 5.9 percent. Cities and special districts -
including junior colleges, hospitals, utilities and flood control -
showed a 5.5 percent increase.
School property taxes, levied by the 1,040 independent school districts,
accounted for 58 percent of all 1994 property taxes.
Taxes by 968 cities reached nearly $2.5 billion, or 16 percent of the
total, while county taxes were $2.3 billion, or 15 percent. Property
taxes by special districts in 1994 topped $1.6 billion, about 10 percent
of the total.
The report found that the average of school tax rates reported rose
about 3 cents in 1994 to just over $1.35 per $100 of value, the same
amount of increase as in 1993.
The P-B-T school tax rate has remained at $1.40 for the past four years.
The 1994 school rates ranged from 46 cents in Allamoore ISD in Hudspeth
County, the low, to $2.03 per $100 of value in Huffman ISD in Harris
County, the high.
Only 26 districts had rates of less than $1 per $100 of value. About 85
percent, or 879 districts, had tax rates ranging from $1 to $1.50.
Another 134 districts had rates ranging from $1.50 to $2.03.
``Taxpayers in about 516 districts, or 50 percent of all districts, saw
their tax rates rise in 1994,'' the report said. About 32 percent, 336
districts, didn't change rates, and another 187 reduced rates from the
preceding year.

Houston Chronicle
ANTHONY, Texas - For decades, this hamlet on the Texas-New Mexico line
languished in obscurity beneath the cruel desert sun. It was a swell
place to raise onions. And the sand storms really weren't all that bad.
But as for fame, glory, respect?
Forget it.
An important state reference book mislocated the town by 20 miles.
Even die-hard Anthonians shrugged when asked how the town got its name.
Maybe it was named for the nearby mountain said to resemble St.
Anthony's nose; maybe for a former resident named Anthony.
Who really cared?
But all that - the sneers, the yawns, the produce jokes - was before
Anthony, Texas, population 3,328, crowned itself ``Leap-Year Capital of
the World.''
Now Anthony gets respect.
Thursday - Leap Year Day 1996 - will bring as many as 10,000 tourists to
town for a four-day party for those whose birthdays come once every four
years. And the celebration will have been worth the wait.
There will be a parade, carnival, hot-air balloon flight, baseball and
golf tournaments, marathons and an arts and crafts show. Savings bonds
will be presented the oldest leap year baby and the one who travels the
farthest to attend the festivities. And, of course, there will be a
giant cake.
In retrospect, the idea of Leap Year Capital of the World seems a
natural for this town 20 miles northwest of El Paso. But for years, Leap
Year Chairwoman Mary Ann Brown said, the chamber of commerce struggled
in vain to come up with a lively idea for a festival.
``They considered onions, cotton, pecans, chili - but all those already
had been claimed by someone else,'' she said. ``Things never got beyond
the talking stage. One member even said that Anthony isn't the capital
of anything.''
Then eight years ago, Brown - who will celebrate her 16th leap year
birthday Thursday - talked things over with her leap year neighbor,
Birdie Lewis, who will turn 19, and the grand party plan leaped to life.
No one else was doing it, the local auto parts store owner told chamber
members. ``I told them this was a guaranteed good thing,'' she said.
``And I told them one of the best things was that we'd have to gear up
for the festival only every four years. We'd have plenty of time to plan
things.''
The initial chamber response was mixed.
``Some just kind of looked blank,'' Brown recalled last week. ``But
there was one member, David Sell from the local Alpo dog food plant, who
had a broader vision. He really supported the idea and we got it
going.''
Key to the plan, Brown said, was creation of a World Wide Leap Year
Birthday Club - and, of course, a massive publicity campaign. Articles
in area newspapers quickly brought 23 memberships. But, as the idea was
broached at a Feb. 1 chamber meeting, there was little time to do more
than plan a very small birthday party in 1988.
By the end of 1991, though, the World Wide Leap Year Birthday Club
claimed 87 members. And the 1992 celebration, featuring a parade down
Main Street, brought visitors from throughout the United States.
Twenty-three leap year babies attended - the oldest born in 1920 - and
the local Sonic drive-in reported its best weekend in 17 years.
As Anthony's fame has grown - the festival has received national
television coverage - mail from leap year babies has poured in. Even a
leap year child from Saudi Arabia wrote to inquire about joining the
group. Club membership has approached 300, and chamber leaders can only
conclude they've tapped a previously neglected market - those who feel
slighted by a glitch in the Gregorian calendar.
Simply explained, the addition of an extra day to February every four
years is necessary because it takes 365-1/4 days for the earth to make
its annual orbit around the sun. The usual Gregorian year, of course,
officially contains only 365 days.
As a result, some leap year babies always feel slightly out of step with
the rest of the world. ``When it comes time to celebrate,'' said local
farmer Richard ``Buck'' Sommerville, himself not a leap year child,
``they really celebrate. They have three lost years to make up for.''
A lone leap year child in a family of 12 children, Birdie Lewis said she
grew up feeling birthday-deprived. ``I always felt cheated,'' the former
Houston resident said.
Lewis, who will be 76 in conventional years Thursday, preferred to
discuss only her leap year age. ``A woman who will tell her age will
tell anything,'' Lewis said. ``I always say I'm not as old as I look nor
as young as I feel.''
``You always have to celebrate your birthday on Feb. 28,'' Brown
groused. ``Or, you could move it up 'til March 1, but then you're not
even in the same month.''
Debbie Apodaca, an El Paso woman who will celebrate her ninth leap year
birthday in Anthony, joked that such once-in-four-years events are
``great for husbands.''
For some, the Anthony festival is a chance to dress up; to see and be
seen. In 1992, Brown dressed up as a clown and, equipped with broom and
pan, followed the horses to scoop up droppings.
Margarita Evaro of nearby La Mesa, N.M., who will celebrate her 12th
leap year birthday, this year will deck herself out in pink baby
bloomers and bonnet and ride on the local Veterans of Foreign Wars
float. ``I'm really excited about it,'' she said. Evaro, who once won a
Halloween contest dressed as a cow, is somewhat famous for the
inventiveness of her costumes.
``I'm planning to come some year dressed as a streaker,'' she said,
declining to specify the event she will so favor.
On a slightly more serious note, chamber president Ruth Ashby - Brown's
sister - said she thinks the true value of the festival is the way it
unites the town. ``We view this celebration as a kind of gift to the
community,'' she said. Numerous non-profit groups use festival events as
a way to raise money.
``The festival could mean one less bake sale, less knocking on doors for
these groups,'' she said. ``I don't think they'll come up with a great
big sum, but they'll have more than they had. And there will be a
tremendous sense of community in doing it.''
Even as the final touches are put on the 1996 leap year celebration,
plans are being discussed for the year 2000 - the first millenial leap
year since 1600. ``We're already getting excited about it,'' Brown said,
adding that the celebration will feature ``leaping events.''
``Oh, we'll have a long jump competition, a leapfrog game. Any leaping
thing will be given great emphasis.
``The year 2000 is going to be a really big shindig.''

intersection during an investigation by police of a two-vehicle accident
at the corner of Washington and Hackberry Streets. The police report
indicated that Norma R. Evaro was eastbound in a 1976 Oldsmobile Delta
'88 in the 1300 block of Washington when she was struck by Levario, who
was eastbound in the 800 block of Hackberry in a 1988 Ford Tempo.
Levario allegedly pulled into the intersection from a stopped position.
During the early morning hours of Feb. 12, Ezequiel Morales Arevalo was

year ago, my mother had very deep pantry shelves. When she didn't see something near the front, she simply bought a couple more of it. So one day when I decided to clean out the pantry, I found 27 cans of tuna (and no, there were no warehouse stores back then). Also found an exploded can of what used to be peaches ... black tar covering the back of a lower shelf. Blech!

A chinese friend of mine said that most of the cooks and waiters at a japanese sushi restaurant are chinese (she speaks and understands mandarin). Most americans can't tell orientals apart so they "get away with it."

The Top Grocery-Store Etiquette Gaffes
I find that the 4-6pm crowd at the supermarket are the worst, probably because they are hungry, tired and need to get home to feed their families. But it's still not excusable. The best time seems to be after 7pm on a weekday or before 9am on Sunday.

I thought it was called an ice cream float because ice cream floats on top of the soda, whether it goes in first or last, because of the air in it. And, that it becomes an ice cream soda if the ice cream is stirred/mixed into the soda.

Our 12 tips of Christmas (part 2)
In the run up to Christmas, I’m working with Kevin Baughen to put our heads together to work through the examples of various charity and fundraising communications we’ve seen in 2012 and try to share the 12 tips we think they’ve taught us.
Some will be new and).
You can read Kevin’s first three tips on his blog. In the meantime, here are tips four to six.
4. Review your processes to make sure they are donor focussed
When was the last time you checked your processes from a donor perspective? It’s something that’s been on my to do list all year and I’ve finally got round to doing it in the last few weeks.
I wished I’d done it six months earlier, as it uncovered some interesting findings. For example, I discovered that we only thank donors who give via CAF when the money comes into our bank (which makes financial reconciliation easier), but this means that donors end up waiting four to six weeks for a thank you letter.
As we pride ourselves on the speed of our thank you’s (we generally aim for 48 hours max), then it is something we needed to address and improve from a donor perspective.
We also found areas for improvement with our communications with in-memoriam donors, event supporters and people who stop their regular giving.
5. Setting donor care standard benchmarks: how mystery shopping can help
One of the best ways to check your donor care performance and processes is through mystery shopping. This doesn’t have to expensive or difficult to do. Enlist some friends. Get them to make a donation, send an e-mail enquiry or ring up for information. It’s amazing what you can discover.
You’ll hopefully find some bright spots, but there are also likely to be areas for improvement. For example, when I’ve done this in the past, I’ve found that we were really good on the phone when you could get through to us, but that was trickier than it sounded!
Our system was set up to go to voicemail quickly and you couldn’t pick up colleagues calls without getting up and physically answering the phone.
Working with our IT team we were able to change the call settings and groupings and vastly increased the number of donor calls we were able to answer.
6. First impressions count: make sure your front of house and donor care are welcoming
One of the most annoying quotes we’ve heard from a senior manager from another department was that answering calls, sending thank you’s etc was ‘just admin’ and not important. To us this completely misses the point.
The welcome you receive at a reception. The thank you letter when you donate. Getting donor’s names and addresses correct. These are the little big things that matter and set the tone for the way a charity treats its supporters.
I recently had to visit the customer service desk in two branches of the same supermarket. The experience between the two couldn’t have been more different.
At both I had to wait for a manager to come down from the offices to help resolve my query. In the first branch I was asked if I wanted a seat, engaged in polite conversation and offered a drink. Ultimately they were unable to resolve my query, but they apologised profusely and I was treated in a professional, friendly way.
In the second store it was the complete opposite. There was a customer in front of me, who was already looking fed up. I had to wait a couple of minutes before anyone asked if they could help, as the staff were too busy talking to each other.
I was then left standing by the main door for 15 minutes. No chair or drink was offered. The person I needed to speak to finally appeared and I explained the problem. They rolled their eyes, sighed and trundled off to the office. At the same time, the customer in front of me finally lost her temper with the in-difference shown and demanded to see the manager.
I continued to wait (and ended up helping a shopper struggling with their shopping as none of the staff helped) and after nearly half an hour in total the relevant person appeared with the package I needed. It was an awful experience and a total failure in customer service. I’ll definitely think twice before using the same service again.
There’s no point having the greatest fundraising appeal or message if it is let down by poor customer service.
Tips seven to twelve will appear next week.

Second Best
Posted By Cliff Corcoran On September 24, 2007 @ 8:01 pm In Bronx Banter | Comments Disabled
The Yankees finished second to the Blue Jays in yesterday’s makeup game, which doubled as their regular season home finale. Thus, the half game in the AL East standings was rounded up, and the Red Sox hold a two-game lead with just six games left. The good news is that the Tigers came in second to the Twins, so the Yanks clinched a tie for the Wild Card, and can clinch outright with a win over the Devil Rays or a Tiger loss tonight.
As for the game it self, A.J. Burnett was supposed to start for the Jays, but had to head home for personal reasons. Instead, the Yankees faced Jessie Litsch, who beat the Sox his last time out. Yesterday, Litsch seemed to do one of two things, get groundballs right at his fielders, or give up doubles. Unfortunately for the Yankees, he did a lot more of the former. Of the 30 Yankees Litsch faced over 7 2/3 innings, eighteen hit a grounder right at an infielder and four doubled.
The first double was hit by Doug Mientkiewicz with one out (a ground out, of course) in the third. He moved to third when Curtis Thigpen booted a grounder by Melky Cabrera (the only Blue Jay error of the day), held when Johnny Damon hit a week grounder down the first base line, and was stranded by a rare fly out hit by Derek Jeter. The second double was hit by Hideki Matsui with two out (both ground outs, of course) in the fourth. Jorge Posada jutted his right knee into a pitch to reach base, then Robinson Cano grounded out to end the inning. Derek Jeter hit the third double leading off the sixth, moved to third on an Abreu grounder, and scored on a grounder by Alex Rodriguez for what would be the only Yankee run of the day. The last double was hit by Bobby Abreu with two outs (both ground outs, of course) in the eighth. It finally drove Litsch from the game after just 99 pitches, but Casey Janssen got the final out to strand Abreu, then picked up the save in the ninth.
Andy Pettitte, meanwhile, had a rough second inning, allowing three runs on a walk and three hits, including doubles by Thigpen and John McDonald. The Jays added a run in the third when Alex Rios doubled with one out, moved to third on a fly out to right, and scored when Derek Jeter booted the third out. Andy faced the minimum over the next three innings, but, with Litsch cruising, the damage was done. Final score 4-1 [1] Jays.
Hey the folks who put out the Bronx is Burning asked me to mention that Mickey Rivers will be signing the DVD at Modell’s at 51 East 42nd Street from 5-7 pm today and Graig Nettles will be doing the same at the FYE in 1290 Avenue of the Americas from 6-8 pm. I’m doing so because I thought some of you might actually want to go meet Mick and Puff, and because they sent me a free copy of the DVD. I hope to have a review of it for those of you who missed the series when it ran on ESPN, likely after the postseason. If I had to summarize that as-yet-to-be-written review in one word, that word would be “mixed.”

A California public school district is refusing the place on a new school campus six bricks inscribed with Bible verses. The district also is refusing to give a refund to the two women who bought and paid for the fundraising bricks.
The women who now possess the bricks sued the district this week for violating their constitutional rights to free speech, religion and masonry.
Another brick in the wall of separation?
Or a brick through the church’s stained-glass windows?
“Christians shouldn’t be discriminated against and excluded from expressing their faith on public high school campuses when that door of communication is open to virtually everyone else,” David Cortman, senior counsel for the Alliance Defense Fund, which is taking the case to court, said in a statement.
Objection, Mr. Cortman. There’s no evidence that the Desert Sands Unified School District is discriminating against Christians.
No doubt many, if not most, of the hundreds of people who purchased fundraising bricks for the new Palm Desert High School are Christians. This is America.
The verses and citations on two of the bricks were from the Hebrew Scriptures (Psalms and Proverbs), so if the district isn’t necessarily picking on Christian texts.
And the translations used on the bricks weren’t exactly word for word from King James or the King of Kings.
For example, one brick claims to carry this verse from Psalm 68:34: “TELL EVERYONE ABOUT GOD’S POWER.”
I couldn’t find that wording in any of the most popular and authenticated English versions of the Bible.
The King James Version puts it this way: “Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds.”
The NIV: “Proclaim the power of God, whose majesty is over Israel, whose power is in the skies.”
The NRSV: “Ascribe power to God, whose majesty is over Israel; and whose power is in the skies.”
Maybe someone on the school board prefers a more literal translation.
Besides, who is more qualified to quote correctly the Word of God? Public school officials who sell vanity bricks to economize or people who buy bricks to evangelize on in public schools?
Exactly.
School officials actually claimed a higher motivation:
“We need to respectfully decline the donation of bricks quoting scripture from the Bible,” a school official wrote in a letter to the two women. “I’m sure most parents will understand the Constitution regarding the separation of church and state.”
Objection, ma’am. If you were trying to uphold the principal of separation of church and state, why did you accept bricks inscribed with these messages?
OMG YOU DID IT IN 2007
GOD BLESS YOU BABE
SI SE PUEDE PHIL. 4:13
The last one references Phillippians 4:13, which according to King James says: “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.”
Yes, you can, but apparently only in Spanish.
The strangest part of the story is that the two women actually received the six biblical bricks they ordered. The district delined to use the bricks, but kept the $750.
So if they accept money from evangelical Christians, but decline to accept evangelical messages from Christians, does that make them hypocrites?
Or does that just make them government officials?
I wonder if the school district, or the Alliance Defense Fund, would accept a brick bearing a verse from Isaiah 65:3, describing “a people who continually provoke me to my very face, offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on altars of brick.”
Probably not.First Fridays :

this wiki
GeneralEdit
an overview of Glitterdelve
Glitterdelve is a small dwarven mining town between Wesrin Cross and Stonebridge . It has a couple of buildings such as the smelting forge, the Coughing Jak Tavern and a mule trading barn, it is also the place where you find Gloern , the third free party member.
Glitterdelve MineEdit
the main part of the mines
Its mine is huge, and is one of the biggest mines in Ehb. A lot before the events of Dungeon Siege the king wanted to improve the conditions in the mine so the first mages of the kingdom created a gigantic magical machine rocky silts.
HistoryEdit base necessities of a smelting forge, mule trading barn, and the Coughing Jak Tavern, there were few permanent structures to be found.
In the decades since, little has changed in this insular community of rugged mountain-men, miners, and self-styled individualists. So long as gold still glitters in the seams of rock, and the Kingdom's tax collectors leave them with a coin to spend in the local tavern, they are content to be citizens of Ehb.
Events in Dungeon SiegeEdit
After the krug raided stonebridge, they went on to raid glitterdelve, they depopulated glitterdelve and the only known citizens of Glitterdelve after the attack are Gloern and his brother Torg, although there are probably more since Torg said he will gather the dwarfs to return to work. before Torg was saved the mines were filled with Krug Mine Worms, Rock Beasts, Darklings , and more. Glitterdelve pass which connects Glitterdelve and Stonebridge was destroyed and blocked by the Krug so the legion couldnt pass.
TriviaEdit
any thing special?Obstructive sleep apnoea is independently associated with an increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome
Abstract%,
). In order to determine whether these associations were independent of obesity and other known covariates, a regression analysis adjusted for age, BMI, smoking, and alcohol consumption was performed. This demonstrated that OSA was independently associated with increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, higher fasting insulin and triglyceride concentrations, decreased HDL cholesterol, increased cholesterol:HDL ratio, and a trend towards higher HOMA values. Metabolic syndrome was 9.1 (95% confidence interval 2.6, 31.2:
) times more likely to be present in subjects with OSA. Conclusions OSA is independently associated with an increase in the cardiovascular risk factors that comprise the metabolic syndrome and its overall prevalence. This may help explain the increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.
- Obstructive sleep apnoea
- Fasting glucose
- Blood pressure
- Lipids
- Metabolic syndrome
Introduction ⩾5 and daytime hypersomnolence.1 Although the main symptom of OSA is daytime hypersomnolence, patients with OSA also have a higher incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.2 It was previously assumed that this occurred because of the related obesity, however, recent data suggests that OSA may also be associated with a number of cardiovascular risk factors independently of obesity, such as hypertension,3,4 insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance,5–7 and dyslipidaemia.8–10.
Methods ⩾180/110. OSA was diagnosed by a combination of clinical history and polysomnography, with an apnoea/hypopnoea index greater than 15 h−1 defining a positive diagnosis.16 OSA was excluded in controls using a domiciliary sleep study. Daytime sleepiness was assessed using the Epworth sleepiness score (ESS) with a score of ten or more defining excessive daytime sleepiness.17 None had commenced nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment at the time of study. The study complied with the declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local research ethics committee. All subjects gave written informed consent. ⩾4% desaturation in the following 30 s. Hypopnoea was defined as 50% reduction in airflow accompanied by ⩾4%⩾1.7 mmol/l, HDL cholesterol<1.04 mmol/l, blood pressure⩾130/⩾85 mmHg, and fasting glucose⩾6–Whit–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.
Results).
Components of the metabolic syndrome
The mean, median, and percentage difference (and 95% CI for the difference) were presented for normal, skewed, and categorical data, respectively. For log-transformed data the ratio of geometric means (and 95% confidence interval for the ratio) was presented. Bonferroni-corrected unpaired
tests were performed on normally distributed and log-transformed data, Bonferroni-corrected Mann–Whitney on non-normally distributed data and Bonferroni-corrected
on categorical data. Corrections were performed using a sequential rejective Bonferroni procedure. *

↵d Geometric mean (95% confidence interval).).
The association of obstructive sleep apnoea with components of the metabolic syndrome
Due to the nightly variability of the RDI, OSA was coded as a dummy variable before being entered as a predictor into the regression model. Data were analysed using multiple linear regression unless otherwise stated and assumptions were checked by inspection of the residuals. All data were adjusted for age, BMI, smoking, and alcohol consumption.
coefficients were expressed as the
coefficient (95% confidence interval). These represent the average change that OSA causes in each outcome.
↵a Multiple linear regression was performed on log-transformed outcome data. In this instance the
coefficient (95% confidence interval) was antilogged to give the values presented in the table.
↵b Categorical outcome data were analysed using multiple binary logistic regression and assumptions checked using the Hosmer Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. In this instance the
coefficient refers to the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of having the outcome in patients with OSA when compared to subjects without.
Discussion
Previous studies have demonstrated that OSA is independently associated with a number of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension,3,4 insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance,5–7 and dyslipidaemia.8–hip–hip–34–39.

The book is straight-forward, pragmatic and actionable! Be prepared to dog-ear, highlight and nod your head as you read. You know I don’t love books that tell you what you need to do but don’t tell you how to do it. No worries with this book — every page is a how to primer!
Marketing Smart is written specifically for those professionals who are creating marketing strategies/tactics for Challenger brands — fighting against a bigger competitor who is likely to outspend them every time.
John’s got tons of practical counsel on how those Davids can take their Goliaths and win.
As you know, I like to ask the authors a few questions when I’m reviewing their book. Here’s what John had to say about Marketing Smart.
If you had to describe the content of your book in a single sentence (no run ons) what would it be?
Proven marketing strategies and tips designed to help Challenger Brands maximize their promotional efforts so they take on their larger competitors and win!
What one book that you’ve read do you wish you could claim as your own?
The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
In your opinion, what is the one trait that all uber successful business people possess?
Drive
What’s the biggest business mistake you’ve ever made and what did you learn from it?
Recognizing opportunity. It only knocks once, so I now make sure I analyze everything as that potential big opportunity.
Why did you have to write this book? What truth or insight was missing from the human consciousness — that you’ve now answered?
I felt there was a real need to write a marketing book designed specifically for Challenger Brands. I wanted to provide proven and practical advise in a step by step format that they should put into use immediately.
After someone is done reading your book — what do you hope they do as a result?
They understand what being a Challenger Brand really means and they learn the strategies needed to be a successful Challenger Brand Marketer. And as a result, they’ll refer back to Marketing Smart for real answers and “how to advice” for years to come.

COLUMN: Time to differentiate between ‘need’ and ‘want’
How can you knock an organization that does great work in the community – an organization that in some ways helped my family gain a greater perspective of those who are a part of our greater community?
So do I think having a YMCA in Abbotsford is a good idea? Absolutely! Back in the ’80s my sons became lifeguards and swimming instructors at the Chilliwack Y. My eldest son taught disabled children to swim at the facility, nurturing in him life skills that he even subconsciously may now be passing on to his own children.
The underlying reason, however, for the success and great contribution to Chilliwack of the Y was that it was the only full-facility recreation centre in the city. Back then, the Y was “it.”
Abbotsford, on the other hand, had McMillan Pool and later added Matsqui Recreation Centre, and in the meantime privately owned gyms abounded as free-enterprise took advantage of the move towards better health through fitness.
Which brings me to the point. We want the pool and programs the Y could bring here to Abbotsford, but we don’t “need” them.
And we certainly don’t “need” them enough to justify spending $17.5 million of taxpayer dollars by a city that maintains it has precious few dollars to spend on anything.
I’m sure that city hall can, and will if it makes the decision, find the money somewhere in its contingency or reserve fund accounts. But if there is money sitting around waiting to be spent, then it should be dispensed where the “need” is, not where the “want” is.
Also, should the city and your tax dollars be spent on fitness facilities that compete with the operations of the taxpaying private sector? Granted, we are already doing that with exercise rooms and equipment in our publicly owned recreation centres, but do we need more located in a YMCA that is to be constructed with 50 per cent public funding by the taxpayers?
Obviously I don’t agree with this expenditure, just as I don’t agree that the proposed site on the vacant and valuable land of the old MSA Hospital should be used for anything other than significant tax-generating development. That site is prime real estate that, along with other lands along the McCallum strip, could help revitalize a key part of the city.
It could be said, however, that the Y might become an anchor tenant which may attract private investment on and surrounding the location. And it is, of course, near the university.
All of the above, however, may be moot. At 3 p.m. on the day I write this (yesterday, in fact), the city may decide, without referendum or detailed and lengthy discussion, to approve giving $17.5 million of your dollars to the YMCA to green-light the project.
Unfortunately, I don’t think the timing is right.
A few years down the road, when and if more tax dollars are pouring into city coffers, such a proposal might be acceptable.
Today, with the financial pressures we all face (the most powerful economy in the world, the U.S., is at the cliff-edge right now), city hall and all governments that rely on taxation must curtail discretionary spending.
At least until the good times return, it is time to stop believing we can operate on a limitless credit card of tax dollars, and put aside expenditures on public art, international friendship gardens and $17.5-million giveaways, no matter how good they look or how much we “want” them.
markrushton@abbynews.comGood, bad or indifferent? It’s all a matter of perspective
I have good news and bad news. Which do you want first? Wait, this is my column so I guess I have to decide. The only reason I asked is because I’m not sure which news is good and which is bad.
The words “good” and “bad” do not have strict, scientific definitions. In fact, the two words probably best describe a spectrum in which some things are perceived as good and other things are perceived as better or worse. Good and bad are values, not facts. But we use a lot of euphemisms for the two concepts and sometimes that’s bad.
There are things that most humans agree are good and bad. Most humans think killing other humans is bad. Unless, of course, it’s to avoid something we think is worse. It seems most humans think love and affection are good. I sure can’t figure out some people’s taste though.
Science doesn’t deal in values. Science deals with the physical world and matters that can be verified with empirical data. In fact, some scientists think that things like religion and morality are bad. These are often the scientists who claim that we should fund scientific research because science does so much good.
Obviously, the same science that brings us electric lights also created the electric chair. The science that discovered antibiotics has created the antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The same science that created the nuclear bomb now provides us with nuclear-powered electric plants.
It isn’t science that is bad. It’s how science is applied that can be considered good or bad. Those scientists who attack religion as bad fail to recognize that it is not religious belief, but the application thereof that may be bad — just as with science.
Did you know that generally a person with a common cold heals cuts faster? So are colds bad or good? I suppose that depends on how seriously you are cut. If it is just a scratch, then no one cares and the cold is miserable (another word for bad). If the carotid artery is severed, a cold is the least of your worries. But there might be an advantage to having a cold if you have a serious cut on the arm. The faster the cut heals the less chance of infection. Colds can be good.
The parasitic amoeba, Entamoeba histolytica, can make us deathly ill, but millions of people seem to harbor it with no apparent ill effects. So is the amoeba bad or good? That depends on which group you’re in.
I much prefer to be healthy. Healthy is defined as not having anything abnormal, out of order, or bad going on. So the word health is a euphemism for good. The fact is there are numerous things in my life that are bad: work, meetings, other drivers, broccoli ... so am I healthy? If I am not, then I must be unhealthy, or un-good. Isn’t that the same as bad? It is if I am eating broccoli.
If I have a disease, I am not at ease. That’s not good. So it must be bad. So is broccoli a disease? Of course! But since bad is a relative term, there must be some things worse than broccoli. No, wait, I’m serious.
Is high blood pressure worse than gout? People with high blood pressure are at risk of heart attack and death. Someone having a gout attack will not die. They probably only wish they could. Hydrochlorothiazide is a commonly prescribed water pill for lowering blood pressure, but it is one of the major causes of gout attacks. So is Hydrochlorothiazide good or bad? Sorry! Science doesn’t deal in value questions.
So, we have 20 percent of the American economy devoted to the science of health (good) care. Is that good? Well, I have good news and bad news.
Which do you want first?

My favorite, favorite Austen. It's more of a pure romance than her other books. The social satire is still there, in spades, but it takes a backseat to the glowing romance. And SUCH glowing romance it is, too.
rachelellen
It's a bit presumptuous to rate Jane Austen on the same five point scale one uses for everyone else. But what can you do? At the risk of seeming low brow, I still prefer Pride and Prejudice and Emma. But I do not begrudge Anne Elliot her much delayed happiness.
jasonfurman
Probably the most sober of all of Jane Austen's novels, Anne Elliot is on the road to being an old maid when the man she came close to marrying years back returns to her life. It can be painful at times as he is flirted with right in front of her, and she can't say anything as she was the one who rejected him in the first place. Of course, she was persuaded to do so, hence the title. Of all of Jane Austen's books, this was the one I stayed up all night to finish.
ladygata
This is my favourite Austen book. Quiet, poignant and perfectly written, it has some of the best drawn characters I have ever read. Sir Walter, Elizabeth Elliot and Mary Musgrove are all deliciously aggravating, and Anne Elliot is a compelling heroine. It is perhaps more serious than Pride and Prejudice, and doesn't have the same kick as Emma, but don't let that put you off. It's had me laughing at Austen's seemingly flawless perception of human foibles and aching with sympathy for her heroine. It's also the most romantic of Austen's six novels, without ever becoming sappy.Am I gushing? Yes. But go read the book.

People are doing double takes when they see this new chocolate commercial with the one and only Audrey Hepburn.
The new British chocolate commercial advertising for Galaxy chocolate have brought Hepburn back from the dead to play their star, reports Entertainment Tonight Online
The commercial begins with a setting in Italy while the lovely Audrey Hepburn sits in the back of a bus looking as graceful and poised as ever.
The actress you see on screen is of course a computer image of one of Hollywood’s favorite actresses, says the Inquistr.
Hepburn’s sons, Sean Ferrer and Luca Dotti, have control of her estate and gave permission to use the computer generated image of her in Galaxy’s ad. They, however, charged a fee for using their mother’s image.
They were reported to have said their mother would have loved the new role and also mentioned she had a love for chocolate.
It has been fifty years since people have seen Hepburn on-screen. She is not the first who has been generated on-screen again and she will not be the last.Tim Schafer wants to work on a systems-based game after Broken Age

His unexpected passing yesterday at the Sundance Film Festival has generated a lot a press. The New York Times notes, “He started his formal career in 1981 in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s New York office, where he sold library titles to hospitals, colleges and ships at sea”. Yep, that’s where I met him, where we worked side-by-side in MGM/UA’s nontheatrical department, renting 16mm prints to various venues.
Bing was a hilarious guy and it was absolutely true that everyone loved him. He left MGM/UA and ultimately became the head of several movie companies including Samuel Goldwyn and United Artists. He started his own film distribution company, October Films, in 1991 and one of his first acquisitions was Bill Plympton’s The Tune. He was always there for advice, a joke, or to simply share his enthusiasm for film. He will be missed.
Rest in Peace, Mr. Bing.Why Guest Blog for Cheerios and Lattes?

I don’t usually do blog-pointer things. I typically write mini stories about new stuff I find interesting—with a point of view tacked on. But there’s a new blog that I think people ought to look at and contribute to. It’s about how businesses can lessen poverty around the world by developing new business models with the potential for turning paupers into consumers and productive workers. Most stuff that is written in blogs is self-indulgent crap, or mean-spirited political spin. Here’s a blog worth spending time and effort on.Hunts & Trips Auction Info

But this is where the traditional model falters. While it’s based on publishers taking all of the risk, it also grants them most of the reward, meaning that authors who produce high sales do not always reap the financial rewards of their books’ success. Typically, an author’s package consists of some sort of arbitrary advance (the amount is based on “projected book sales”) and a small royalty for every book sold (royalties do not kick in, however, until the author has paid back the advance in book sales). In order to increase book sales, the author often hires his or her own outside marketing or public relations teams to supplement or do all the work for the publishing house’s minimal to nonexistent publicity efforts.
The author has now done all of the legwork on behalf of the publisher. He or she has built the audience and platform, written a book and paid an outside company to promote it. But the author is still making less money than the publisher on each book sold. If only there were a way to cut out the major publisher and offer authors the same benefits and luxuries of working with a big house...
There is.

yea, why dont the Obama people give up all their guns, and go ahead and disarm all the schools that the celebrity kids go to, I am sure they are protected by many weapons, while it is agianst federal law for public schools to have guns on property

Disagree. If you want reduce the population that bad why not make birth control free? No point letting people be born only to shoot each other....
Could you imagine what hell that would be. Look not everyone is an excellent shot for starters. Plus had one too many sherbets and instead of a fist fight it is guns out and shooting.

Now that is not a rational idea.<br />
Hence the reason many countries have laws<br />
that prevents most people obtaining or holding<br />
a firearm license.
why not, that is what background checks are for, it is your right to bear arms, called 2nd amendment, and every citizen in the United States has a right to go buy a gun, not for duck hunting but to prevent government tryrany, like what happened in Germany, China, Australia, North Korea, etc etc etc .......
2nd amendment was not brought, this is what our country was founded on, for the people was armed and the government was not, now its backwards, I think that the White House should turn in all there semi-auto and machine guns first...........
I never said that, Americans have a right by the 2nd amendment to bear arms for protection agianst idiots that shoot our children and agianst a tryranical government
I find a fishing rod is more useful most of the time.

The sources told UNI that "the entire unit is moving back to its original location and persons involved in the clash on Thursday night will be made available to the court of inquiry as and when needed".
However,no soldier has been detained as yet in the case, said a source.
There are conflicting versions of what happened during a firing exercise by the unit but the sources confirmed that all the four wounded soldiers, including the CO of the rank of Colonel, were hospitalised at the nearby field hospital of the Army.
Army headquarter has submitted a preliminary report of the clash to the Defence Ministry, detailing sequence of events and reasons behind 'the brawl'.
Initially, the Army had dismissed the clash a "minor scuffle" but soon it realized the seriousness of the matter when details started unfolding in the media.
Army chief general VK Singh personally apprised Defence Minister AK Antony of the incident and a court of inquiry was instituted within hours of the violent clash between the officers and jawans during which the CO, too, got wounded when he tried to calm the situation.
It is said officers and jawans fought a pitched battle for nearly two hours on Thursday night.
Though the Army has rubbished the media reports about the clash as 'baseless', only the court of inquiry will come out with the truth.
Facing intense heat over the Nyoma incident involving army officers and jawans, the Army categorically denied on Saturday evening that it was a mutiny within the ranks and said at worst it could be dubbed an "act of indiscipline".
An Army spokesman said the incident at the Mahe Field Ranges camp in Ladakh region during a firing exercise by artillery regiment can in no way be termed as mutiny. "The entire episode can at worst be seen as an isolated act of indiscipline."
A senior army officer told UNI that no arms and ammunition were used by anyone. The armoury has not been captured by the troops as is being wrongly reported in a section of the media."Nobody has been removed, dismissed or suspended."
The Army statement said, Colonel P Kadam, the Commanding Officer, was not assaulted by other officers. The CO as well as Major AK Sharma and Sepoy Suman Ghosh, who suffered superficial injuries, have been given medical treatment.The contamination indexes, which measure pollution levels, in Spain’s most important cities—Madrid and Barcelona, are at an all time high. What are the authorities doing to purify the air?
Madrid’s city council called on commuters to take public transportation as part of a “day without car” initiative in more than 200 Spanish cities. But cars in Madrid are seen as necessities, something commuters can’t give up, and so the “day without a car” saw as many cars in transit as any other day.
Government as well as environmental initiatives are all on the table, but the City Council as well as the mayor refuse to take enact measures, seeing the issue as “an issue much too important to be tackled by a government ending its term in office”.
Madrid’s city council is already under scrutiny for failing to tackle air pollution, and apparently distorting data; city council officials reportedly moved air pollution sensors from heavy traffic areas, to parks, where the readings were significantly “purer,” throwing the average off, but still not under 40 micrograms of NO2 (Nitrogen dioxide) per cubic meter, the EU suggested average annual level.
Levels of NO2 in Madrid - mainly the result of car exhausts - are consistently over the EU hourly limit of 200 micrograms per cubic meter.
Proposals include creating more “Taxi Cab Stops” so as to reduce the number of empty cabs in transit, to reduce the emissions from boats docked in the city’s port, and making the loading and unloading of cargo in the city to be performed with electrical vehicles.
No measure will be implemented however, until after municipal elections since these are “important issues, not to be approved in the last days of an administration”.Tom Brady isn’t the only star to get suspended by his league.

Austin Smith: All right, guys, we're here in The Motley Fool Dojo, doing an After-Hours Stock chat.
I want to throw a question your way and see which stocks really surprised you guys in the tech space in 2012. I know you guys both cover the sector. What stocks really surprised you with their outperformance?
Eric Bleeker: Andrew, do you want to go first?
Andrew Tonner: I can say at least that, over the last several months, a couple of stocks that people left for dead -- Nokia and Research In Motion -- have both been some of the top performers in the sector over the last three months.
They're at least up 75%, almost approaching a double from these companies that people largely had given up on. I think, in the case of Research In Motion at least, now you're seeing the conclusion of the storyline where they had no products to ship because we know BB10 will be coming out on Jan. 30, and then they'll be launching a series of products in the following months.
They keep kicking this product launch down the line and down the line; I think that was a drag on the stock. That's not to say they're going to make money any time soon, but at least there's a timeline for that now. Investors have something they can anchor their expectation on. I think that's been a real boost.
The second thing I think has turned around the stock as well has been a little bit of consistency coming from management. They got rid of the two-CEO structure now, there's some clear leadership.
Say what you will about Thorsten Heins, he's largely still unproven. He hasn't really shipped a flagship product that he can really hang his hat on, but again, now there's some level of consistency, and at least investors know what to expect here.
That being said, I'm definitely not bullish on this continuing. I think Apple and Google are going to still retain their spots at the top of both the tablet and smartphone space, but you want to talk about surprising, those are two stocks I wouldn't have said would be some of the strongest performers going into the end of the year.
Austin: Yeah, I definitely did not see that one coming.
Eric: Not a lot of us did.
Austin: What about you, Eric?
Eric: I think we really need to look at the death and rebirth of social media as a real interesting storyline this year. It's a tangent storyline to mobile in general. We saw Facebook immediately come down after its IPO. It was the story of the year; it was getting absolutely crushed, and now people are rebuying on mobile.
Not only that, but a company like LinkedIn -- I love LinkedIn, I love its recurring revenue model -- I think it is incredibly disruptive to recruiting itself. I think investors out there who aren't buying in should take a second look, but they didn't collapse at all during the entire Facebook thing, and they're now sitting very pretty.
You've got a company that, by all means, I was expecting to crash with the rest of social media stocks, and LinkedIn soaring, and now you've got Facebook with this negativity cycle, making a comeback. I think it's a really fascinating storyline across the year.
Whether they can continue that mobile storyline in 2013 now becomes a dominant mobile theme across the next year for investors to watch.
Austin: Definitely.
Eric: What about you?
Austin: I don't have one.
Eric: You don't have one at all?
Austin: No. [laughs]
Eric: That was interesting.
Austin: I already did three videos on it, so I can't do any more.
Andrew: I would note too, though, that we are seeing a lot of the companies are kind of tied to the same sector, the Web 2.0 companies as well, that are trading in lockstep with Facebook -- the Zyngas and Groupons -- have also been strong performers the last several months as well; probably something investors didn't really see coming their way.

The chairman of Yisrael b'Aliyah built his public career on the basis of his glorious past as a fighter for human rights and as one who paid a high price for his determined struggle against an undemocratic regime.
Housing Minister Natan Sharansky, the chairman of Yisrael b'Aliyah, started the 2003 election campaign as the sole representative of the immigrants in Israel; he is reaching the finish line after having positioned himself as an alternative to the nationalist leadership of the right, with the slogan "the clean, sane right." In the transition from an immigration lobbyist to the aspiration for national leadership, bad things have happened to Sharansky.
The most recent was his crude attack on the chairman of the Central Elections Committee, Justice Mishael Cheshin. "His hyperactivity," as Sharansky defined the judge's decisions, led the politician to complain to Cheshin's "boss," the president of the Supreme Court. In the letter he sent to Justice Aharon Barak, Sharansky also claimed that "Cheshin serves as a tool at the hands of manipulative elements." This irresponsible attack was answered by a sharp letter from Cheshin himself, who took pains to remind Sharansky that this is not the way things are done in a "Western democracy," as well as by a cold comment from Barak.
Before his well-publicized attack on the Supreme Court justice, Sharansky came out publicly against the High Court of Justice ruling that allowed Arab Knesset Members Azmi Bishara (Balad) and Ahmed Tibi (Ta'al) to take part in the elections. He claimed that "the Supreme Court judges should have displayed more sensitivity at a time of war."
In both cases, Sharansky justified his position by his deep desire to preserve Israeli democracy. But although he sings the praises of democracy, his actions show a cynical attempt to appeal to those right-wing circles that dispute the validity of Israel's democratic institutions. Sharansky is not the first politician to do this, but he is the last person from whom such conduct might have been expected.
The chairman of Yisrael b'Aliyah built his public career on the basis of his glorious past as a fighter for human rights and as one who paid a high price for his determined struggle against an undemocratic regime. In a place where others built a career from the scars they earned in wars, there is nothing wrong with extracting political capital from the scars of a different battle. The nine years he spent in a Soviet prison not only made Sharansky a part of the Israeli ethos, but also established his world status as a symbol of the human spirit in its struggle for democracy.
Now Sharansky is deriving his political philosophy from what he learned during those dark days. He explains the vagueness of his positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by the need to first get democracy in the Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority before making any move to reach a peace agreement with them. His program details very precisely the process of democratization that is demanded of the Palestinians, without resolving the contradiction between this process and the deepening of the Israeli control involved in getting it.
At all his election events during the past weeks, Sharansky has taken care to remind the audience how much the current American administration supports the connection between the enemy's democratization and making peace with it. In a Hebrew campaign flyer directed at voters on the right, he notes that the American administration has adopted his democratization plan, and at the same time promises his voters that "Yisrael b'Aliyah will continue to maintain the rule of law."
It can be said that Sharansky first used democracy for his own gain, in the positive sense.
Now, however, he has turned it into a blunt instrument with which he is striking at Israeli democracy. He is not the only one, but he is the one who should be held accountable on this issue. The idea of demanding more from Sharansky because of his status is not a cliche, it is rather a legitimate expectation of a politician who claims moral authority.
Sharansky enjoys a special public status. Among all the ranks of the Russian-speaking community, he still enjoys great personal popularity, far greater than the popularity of his party. Recently, he has turned to a new group of voters, the English-speaking community in Israel. The respect with which he was received at a campaign gathering in Jerusalem about a month ago was unlike any other campaign event. Many in the audience remembered not only the glorious days of his earlier years, but also remembered the glorious days of their own youth when they conducted campaigns to free him from prison. All in the name of democracy.
But all this, as well as his huge influence on the Russian-language media in Israel, give Sharansky not only credit, but also special responsibility. Not only as one who wants to preserve his status as a symbol, but also as one who has a profound influence on the shaping of public opinion. Sharansky is a senior partner in establishing the norms of a large public, which is forging its positions vis-a-vis the democratic institutions of their new homeland. This is the contract he has made with his public, and therefore he cannot afford to engage in populist electioneering. There is already one (National Union-Yisrael Beiteinu) Avigdor Lieberman in this arena.

For the Android test phone I'm using, a T-Mobile G1, the update was smoother than the process by which the software problem came to light publicly on October 24.
The handset I'm testing gave me a message Saturday afternoon: "A system update is available," and a choice to update now or later. When I clicked the button to begin the update, it downloaded new software, which took a few minutes, then installed it, then resumed working with no hitches.

CAUGHT IN THE CAMERA.
SOME OF NEW YORK'S MOST NOTED
PHOTOGRAPHERS.
How the Art Grew and Has Flourished--Reminiscences of the Past--The
Spirit Photograph Swindle and How It Deluded an Old Banker.
HERE are more than 300 photograph galleries in this city at the present
time," said "Ben" Gurney in the course of a conversation the other day.
"Vanity of vanities; all is vanity." On the sole basis that people are
fond of looking at themselves and having other people look at them, can
it be understood how so many cameras are leveled every day in the year?
Of course all of these 300 photographers are not amassing fortunes, but
the majority of them are coining not a little cash from collodion.
There are large and small men in the business. Men who take portraits
of milliners and millionaires, of artists and actresses, of pastors and
patriarchs, of babies and belles. Their prices vary with their work
and the localities of their galleries, but the principle of production
is the same, and it is only by study and improvement of the principle
that photography has become what it is day.[sic]
Photography was introduced in this country about thirty-six years
ago. It was the successor of the daguerreotype. As far back as 1839
Daguerre, Professor Morse and I. Gurney experimented on the discovery
of Daguerre on the roof of the university building, the "Chrysalis
Hall" of Winthrop's Hall" of Winthrop's delicious novel "Cecil
Dreesne," where, by the way, Professor Morse also made his first
experiments in telegraphy. In the early part of the same year the
elder Gurney, who was then a jeweler in Saratoga, met an Englishman
named Shaw, from whom he bought a camera in exchange for a watch. He
brought this crude affair to New York and started in the daguerreotype
in connection with his jewelry business. He opened a jewelry shop at
No. 189 Broadway and in his show case put four daguerreotypes. They
were small affairs, but he charged $5 each for a portrait. The first
day he had one sitter, the second two, and from then on success was
assured. Daguerreotypes were the rage, and the public clamored for
them as loudly as they do now for first night seats at the debut of a
society belle.
Associated with Gurney a year or two later was C. D. Fredericks and
Daguerre. About this time M. B. Brady was a journeyman in the jewelry
case manufacturing house of E. Anthony & Co., who made the cases for
Gurney's daguerreotypes. He saw there was money in the new art and
started a rival gallery on the corner of Fulton street and Broadway.
The elder Bennett became friendly to him; he was extensively noticed in
the columns of the Herald, and secured sittings from many of the
leading men in the country. since then Brady's gallery became one of
the institutions of Washington, and has almost historic interest.
Gurney was a close competitor, however, and while Brady was securing
the politicians he was doing a splendid business among society people.
The daguerreotype is now a thing of the past; the cheap tintype
being the only things that now represents it. A man named Talbot was
the discoverer of photography and the first paper prints were called
Talbotypes. C. D. Fredericks, who was in Paris at the time of the
discovery, brought it to this country, and Cutting and Rehn of Boston
improved on the patent, which was purchased by Gurney, who gave the
name of Chrystalotype. The first photographs were small in size and
were called cartes de visite. Benjamin Gurney, who by this time was a
partner with his father, suggested enlarging the size of the card.
They had just taken a portrait of Admiral Farragut, young "Ben," as he
is called by his friends, showed to his father the advisability of
making something larger than the carte de visite. The father accepted
the proposition, and "Ben" christened the new-sized picture the
"Imperial." They were sold for $10 a dozen. Now you can buy them at
some galleries for $3. but the "Imperial" was an odd size and did not
fit the albums of that date. "Ben" Gurney was not dashed a whit,
however, and he ahead 500 special albums made, and to every person who
bought a dozen "imperials" he presented an album. "Ben" Gurney, by the
way, has been one of the business men in the business. While with his
father he made portraits of the Prince of Wales, who sent him a gold
medal, the Duke Alexis, King Kalakaua and other notables, and when
Lincoln's remains were lying in state at the City Hall he caught the
features of the dead President in his camera, but Secretary Stanton
sent an order from Washington ordering the destruction of the
negatives.
One of the curiosities of photography was the spirit photograph
craze, which bloomed blossomed and died about twenty years ago. It had
many dupes. One of them was a well-knon banker of this city, who was a
widower. He had become impressed with the idea of spiritualism, and
the Fox sisters, then in the height of their prosperity, claimed him as
their own. These spirit photographs were made in a dark room with a
magnesium light placed on top of the camera. One of the Fox sisters
sat by the side of the subject and after the lens had been focused on
the subject the operator was instructed to turn his head away from the
group.
On one occasion the elder Gurney, who had done much in investigating
those spirit photographs, turned his head suddenly, and behold! there
was one of the Fox sisters holding above the head of the old banker a
cardboard portrait of his dead wife.
The secret of spirit photography was discovered, and the banker, who
thought he had been seeing the portrait of his dead wife, found that it
was all a delusion and a snare.
. . .[ three paragraphs not transcribed ] . . .
C. D. Fredericks is one of the veterans. He was born in 1823 and at
the age of 20 was a clerk in a bank. Then he took lessons in
daguerreotyping from Gurney, and being in possession of a camera, he
went to Augostura on the Orinoco on a business speculation, soon after
which he was induced to devote himself exclusively to daguerreotyping,
in which he met with good fortune. Visiting Pernambuco, Rio Janeiro,
Rio Grande, and other places during a trip, he was paid for his
daguerreotypes by the poorer class in horses, of which he soon became
proprietor of a large drove. In 1853 he opened a photographic
establishment in Paris, and was the first to make life-size heads,
employing artists to finish them in pastel. Returning to New York he
entered into partnership with Gurney, which having been subsequently
dissolved he has since remained at the head of the establishment. The
specialty that Mr. Fredericks makes at present, is the taking of club
portraits, and in this he has built up a vast business which has no
cessation in prosperity.
There is no more persistent "first nighter" at the theater than T.
M. Mora. He was born in Cuba thirty-eight years ago, and his
photographs of society and theatrical people have brought him into
prominent notice. He studied his art in France and then this country,
here under Sarony. He occupies the gallery 707 Broadway, once known as
Gurney's and, far down town as it is, the business done there is
remarkable.
Much more might be written of photography I New York, its
advancement, its improvement, its prosperity. It is worthy of note
that American photographs are now sold in Europe and that almost every
mail brings orders for them to this country.

December 1st, 2009
My husband and I used to have sex all the time but now I am lucky if I get it 2 or 3 times a year. And when we do try husband has no problem staying hard during oral sex, or if I masterbate him but almost immediately upon entering me he goes completely soft. He is in his late 40's and I am early 50's. I am physically fit and as many people say I look like I am in my late 30's or early 40's. He just seems to have no desire at all and it is driving me crazy. He went to the doctor on my request and everything checks out normal. I have found though that he is going onto porn sites and seems to prefer the large ladies and "mature" women sites. What gives with that? I tried to talk to him about it a couple of times but he is not forthcoming with any answers. I don't want to cheat but I don't want to be living life as a roommate or nun. HELP

You must talk with ur hubby. actually its his problem. i dont think that there is any problem with his sex strength. coz u said that, he is fine when u masterbate him. i think there is a problem within his mind and thinking. if he is not helping himself than i think u should think about desire. tell him to masterbate u. then u can understand, if he still interested on u or not.

He may be in a lot of stress also when a man get into "certain age" their stiffness is not as before, and you need to know that, if you guys are in the middle age group, he needs to check his testosterone levels, usually some viagra (or any of this kind of medictions) for sometime correct the problem and ,he goes back to normal, I think he was not too clear talking to his doctor because any doctor knows about the viagra trick and the testosterone levels. Go to another doctor. And maybe this is the way is going to be for now on.

not sure what "checks out normal" really means...? How is his overall health? Is he in shape? Any cardio? Sounds like he may have ED and doesn't want to admit it... and it also sounds like his libido is intact. I went through the same stage, and "preferred" oral sex, or at least that's what i was implying to my wife. In reality, I was a little ashamed I couldn't "finish". My solution? Improve my diet, lost some weight, exercised including cardio, off the booze, and if a smoker that's a problem too. there are OTC supplements he can try. Make sure his supplements include zinc, and two or three grams of an amino acid called L-arginine every day. Good under the covers is a benefit from having a healthy body. And finally, the pharmacy companies are really appreciative when we mention cialis... but the Rx should only be a part of the total picture. Much better to avoid cialis and just be healthy. And btw... the above helped me about 90%, so life is good yet once again!

Same boat. I want it, he does too, but he deflates..
I've decided sex just isn't worth the anxiety.
First it was me who wasn't so interested for the last couple years, now it's his physical problem.
I told him I think most of it is performance anxiety.. thinking he needs to satisfy me but he doesn't have to. I hate to get worked over and over for sometimes nearly an hour without an orgasm. .. Knowing full well he could easily have one himself if he entered and got off within a few minutes. So.. either that or nothing for either.
Both near 50.

Hi momof2gramof2 and welcome to ehealth: You would be surprised at what you can do with sexual words of praise when he is near his height of ejaculation...Try doggy sex at the end of the bed with him standing on the floor and you in the crouching postition on the bed with your butt up in the air...Have him finger and lick you...Then lay the hot sexual words on...I mean really hot...What a stud he is and go from there...Tell him to pound you or whatever you want done

Men at age 40 begin to naturally drop in their testosterone levels. The way a Urologist explained it is that men can go through what is referred to as male menopause. Also in time due to prolonged masturbation men grow what is like a "bond", if you will, with masturbation. This can be a problem of the same nature that you speak of. (the porn and no problems while masturbating). Here is a quick quiz for Low Testosterone.
1) do you have a decrease in libido (sex drive)?
2) do you have a lack of energy?
3) do you have a decrease in strength and/or endurance?
4) have you lost height?
5) have you noticed a decreased enjoyment in life?
6) are you sad and/or grumpy?
7) are your erections less strong?
have you noted a recent deterioration in your ability to play sports?
9) are you falling asleep after dinner?
10)has there been a recent deterioration in your work performance?
Yes or No - Did you answer Yes to either question 1 or 7?
Yes or No - Did you answer Yes to at least three questions?
(if you answered yes to questions 1 or 7, or answered yes to any 3 questions, you may be suffering from Low Testosterone. Share your results with your doctor and ask about a simple blood test that can help better diagnose Low Testosterone and your treatment options.)
So could be a mixture of Low Testosterone and perhaps a Psychological problem. I hope this helps some.

All AboutTow week on the grounds that the appeal should have come before the board. The appeal was dismissed because only nine of the 13 protesters were present at the April 22 hearing.
"'It shall be heard' is what the law says," Brooks said Wednesday. "Their not having a hearing ... was totally in error."
Brooks is representing 13 property owners in the ninth election district — which includes Towson — who oppose the business' change from a rock-and-roll venue to Torrent Lounge, which will feature electronic music in a dance club setting.
One of the two motions filed as already been denied, Brooks said.
On Tuesday, the court denied a request for a stay of judgment which said the protest dismissal "was illegal, arbitrary, and capricious and denied protestants of their right to present evidence by the Board."
"I filed a motion to stay to afford them the opportunity to correct their mistake and have a hearing rather than go to the Circuit Court," Brooks said.
Because the request for a stay was denied, Brooks' next option is a petition for judicial review. Brooks filed the review petition on May 8, and said that once the liquor board files its records, both sides have 30 days to respond. A decision must be made within 90 days, Brooks said.
Much of the liquor license renewal opponents' grounds center on the language in the state Annotated Code and the county's liquor laws.
According to the court filings, the law says licenses may not be approved without a hearing if a protest is filed, and that protest "shall be heard." Additionally, county code says all protesters "should" be at the hearing in person. The word "should" leaves room for interpretation, and since there were nine of 12 protesters at the hearing it should not have been dismissed, Brooks said.
People from pockets of the community expressed concern when the Recher brothers, Scott and Brian, owners of Recher Theatre, announced their intentions earlier this year to close the rock venue and open a nightclub.
Despite the legal battle, Brian Recher said they've continued with work on the transformation into Torrent Lounge, as well as begun adding seats to Towson Tavern, their restaurant next door.Copyright © 2015, The Baltimore SunYo Megan - was there any Stranger/Lineout representation at Pharoahe Monch's Nectar show last night?

This past weekend marked the beginning of the third SRT Tour in Monterey, California, at the American Le Mans Series race weekend at Laguna Seca Raceway. Four drivers and four SRT vehicles have since embarked on a three month cross-country adventure, with stops at numerous venues where enthusiasts can get up-close and personal with the entire SRT line-up, which consists of the Dodge Challenger and Charger SRT8, Chrysler 300 SRT8 and the all-new 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8. The 2013 SRT Viper will appear at select venues as well.
A roster of SRT drivers, including John “Hammer” Palazzolo, Sean Yoder, Jamie Jantz and Rachel Miller will be on hand to talk to fans and answer questions.
"We’re excited to travel the country for the third summer in a row and share our entire SRT lineup with the thousands of high-performance fans and loyalists,” said SRT marketing director Beth Paretta in a statement announcing the tour. “Building off the success we’ve had over the last two SRT Tours, our team always looks forward to showcasing the power, performance, luxury and security features offered on all of our SRT vehicles.”
In May, SRT Tour stops include a show in Riverside, California, Cars and Coffee in Irvine, California, and Bill Luke Dodge in Phoenix, Arizona.

The Hollywood Reporter reports that New Line Cinema has already locked up deals with director Brad Peyton, who'll be returning to the franchise for his second go-'round, and writers Brian and Mark Gunn to make JOURNEY 3 or whatever it'll be called.
The plan is to have the third movie ready for a 3-D release by 2014, although there's no word yet on which of the cast may be returning. Josh Hutcherson might be a little busy moving forward with the expected popularity of THE HUNGER GAMES, and The Rock seems to have a pretty full agenda right now. I bet they could always bring Brendan Fraser back, if needed. It's not like he's been doing too much as of late.
I didn't catch JOURNEY 2, primarily because the first JOURNEY was quite enough for me, but, from those who did see it, the second effort seems to have been somewhat of an improvement over the initial offering (Pec Pop of Love notwithstanding).
The only real question now is: After journeying to both the center of the earth and the Mysterious Island, where is the next family adventure headed?

A Big Fat Stigma: Does Obesity Really Increase Global Warming?
From the Department of Highly Questionable Scientific Claims comes this theory: Obese people are responsible for global warming.
The New York Times has a great article (and an even better cartoon) about researchers at the University of Illinois who have linked obese Americans to global warming.
Their premise goes like this: As America grows fatter, we need more gas to haul all that extra poundage around. They say that it costs us (I kid you not) billions of gallons of oil each year.
Uh-ho, I thought, does this mean that the chocolate croissant I indulged in earlier today will have lasting global consequences? Are the ten pounds I'd like to lose contributing to raising temperatures? Could skipping a workout somehow be responsible for the melting ice caps?
Fortunately, most health experts (and thinking people everywhere) don't seem to put much stock in the idea. The article questioned the rationale (if not the math) behind the claim and cited several obesity experts who quickly dismissed it. They also pointed out that this was the latest example of how overweight people — who now comprise 64 percent of our population — are routinely scapegoated and stigmatized.
In the end, it seems that the real problem isn't that fat people are to blame for global warming. It's that we're far too willing to blame fat people for global warming — and just about everything else.
It gets worse. A more credible study (in my opinion, anyway) from a well-regarded obesity center at Yale University found that when people are stigmatized for being overweight, many say that it causes them to eat more.
Discriminating against overweight Americans doesn't prompt anyone to shed pounds or improve their health. If anything, it worsens the situation. Apparently, being blamed for the world's problems is is not a great motivator either.
Besides, how could global warming compare to things that truly motivate us ... like feeling healthy or wanting to fit into a pair of jeans from high school.

In the US Supreme Court case Bilski vs Kappos, the court has ruled that Bilski's business method patent was invalid, but also ruled that the "machine or transformation" test, which earlier courts had applied as an exclusive rule, was not the only test for patentability. Within the free software community, hopes had been pinned on the court confirming the lower courts' rulings, as this would have opened up a route to challenging software patents which could often fail the exclusive "machine or transformation" test.

Their lots of tulle out their so many kinds, My was from walmarts for a 1.17 dollars a yard. I seen some for 65cents a yard. Some I saw was 2.00 dollar a yard but very nice.
my blue one is a pixie cut tutu. it have two layers.
first you need lots of tulle. I really don't know how much you need, it depends on how many colors you pick out. like me I did 5 yards of black 5 yards of gray and 5 yards of purple. or just one color I start with 10 yards. It took me 4 trips to the store. that alot of tull but I'm a plus size woman. for you small girls it shouldn't take much.
First, you're going to need to cut the tulle into strips, cut stripes about 6 inches wide. this is, if you can't find them in rolls. I have to buy my in yards. Then measure and mark your size and cut elastic. To me this is easy part, tie elastic to chair to chair like a clothe line.
now your can just tie the tulle on easy and tight togather.
Place the tulle in a "U" shape underneath the elastic. Try to keep the ends as close to even as possible to one another. Again, though, don't worry about perfection because slight variances actually add flair.
Bring the two upper portions of the tulle "U" over the elastic. Together, pull them underneath the curved bottom of the "U" for the beginnings of a knot. Pull tightly, securing the tulle against the elastic.
Repeat this step until you have went all around your elastic. There should be no elastic visible when completed. If you wish to make a 2 or more color Tutu, simply alternate colors as you continue this step. before your get clost to your size tie a knot in the elastic and keep on going utill the knot is cover with tulle
When completed, your tutu waistline should like the one in this photo. As you can see, there is no elastic showing. if you want you can glue a bow to the back.
now you are really for all most every fairytale. dark or light fairy or you want to be a rockstar or puckrocker or ballet dancer. you can make them short or long. this one I make it long in the back and short in the front. I like my tutu so much I thinking about making a long wedding dress. like the skirt be a tutu and just buy a top at a bride store.
I find this Video of a mother and daugther making a tutu for her daugther hallween. And it help me out.

I'm using your version (considering i'm a curvy lady myself) I found 6in/25yrd spools of tulle for 85cents a spool. I bought five colors for a grand total (s&h includes) of $8.25. I really hope my tutu turns out well!!!! Thanks for posting this. =]
Bekk yes that should be good. Love to see it when you done
this is so cute! i need to try this
quick question... i just ordered 6'' 25 yards of tulle i don't want it uber puffy... and its going to go down to either my knee or a little bit below that.... anyways i was going to use 13 yards for it and my friend is going to use the other 12 for hers.... im a size 17/18 .... do you think 13 yards would be enough??
I'm about to make a black and fuschia one for gothy/rave fun. Hopefully it will come out as awesome as yours did.
Yea i wish i can sell my tutu but no one will buy them. they want less for how much i but into them.
very nice and easy skirts to make my daughter does dancing and i could make these instead of buying as there so exspensive
also there great for dress ups
has any one got any other dance skirtsIt would be great to be able tu use a RSA key stored in

That would be pretty cool. It might be straightforward,
given a better understanding of the Mozilla NSS libraries
than I have (they might support OpenSC already), but I don't
know.
I'm not going to have time to work on this, but I'd be happy
to entertain any patches.

Former Schlitz Taverns Up For Landmark Status
Schuba’s is one of eight current and former taverns under consideration for landmark status for their historic Schlitz beer globe reliefs. (credit:)
The City Council is considering landmark status for eight current and former Chicago bars that feature a relief of a Schlitz beer globe prominently on their facades.
The City Council Landmarks Division on Thursday was scheduled to vote on preliminary landmark recommendations for the former “brewery-tied houses.” When they first opened, they all operated under the rule that only Schlitz beer could be sold on the premises, architecture critic Lee Bey explained in his Vocalo.org blog.
The “tied house” system was blamed for a proliferation of drinking establishments in the city in the years before Prohibition, and the federal government outlawed tied houses after Prohibition was repealed, Bey reported.
But the stately old signs remain at many of the old taverns, some of which still operate as bars today.
The former Schlitz tied houses up for consideration for landmark status are:
–1801 W. Division St. in Wicker Park, now Mac’s American Pub;
–11400 S. Front Ave. in Roseland;
–3456 S. Western Ave. in Brighton Park, now One Stop Food and Liquors;
–958 W. 69th St. in Englewood, most recently Caribbean Bar;
–2159 W. Belmont Ave. in Roscoe Village, now a Starbucks Coffee;
–1944 N. Oakley Ave. in Bucktown, now Floyd’s Pub;
–3159 N. Southport Ave. in Lakeview, now Schuba’s Tavern;
–5120 N. Broadway in Uptown, now the South-East Asia Center.
Also up for landmark status is the former Schlitz stable at 11314 S. Front Ave., which now houses Argus Brewery.
As Bey points out, not all the old Schlitz tied houses are up for landmark status. According to the Web site Forgotten Chicago, there are at least 20 former taverns with the Schlitz globes still standing around the city. Among the ones not up for landmark status are Southport Lanes and Billiards, at 3325 N. Southport Ave., and a prominent building at 2000 W. Armitage Ave. that now houses medical offices.
While most of the former tied houses in Chicago were linked to Schlitz, several others were tied to a number of other breweries and labels, including Blatz, Miller and Atlas, and the long-defunct Birk Bros., Stege and Peter Hand, according to Forgotten Chicago.
Also scheduled for the Thursday meeting was an announcement of landmark designation for the old Shoreland Hotel, at 5454 S. Shore Dr. in the Hyde Park neighborhood. The 84-year-old building was a stopping point for Amelia Earhart, Al Capone and Elvis Presley, among other notables. It later served as a University of Chicago undergraduate dorm, until the university sold it two years ago for a conversion into apartments.,...
- Police charged veteran officer Constable Scott Andrew Terry with sexual assault and possession of child pornography in early 2012. He is scheduled to appear in court again next week in pretrial proceedings.
- Constable Jamie Broadstock received probation for 18 months and a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to drug possession. The Crown dropped a trafficking charge.
- Police charged Constable Tara Cramp with drug trafficking, breach of trust and fraud in a major bust in June 2012 involving about 30 individuals.
- Constable Thomasz Stefanski received a fine of more than $850 late last year for driving 155 km/h or almost double the speed limit in Clarington while off duty the previous May. The force also "informally" disciplined two other officers who initially stopped him and let him go.
- A court gave Constable Lee Douglas an absolute discharge in December after he pleaded guilty to stealing a dead man's shotgun. However, in a separate proceeding under the Police Services Act, he received a demotion in rank for 18 months that will cost him more than $15,000 in lost salary.
- The force charged off-duty Constable Matthew McLaughlin with two counts of impaired driving last October after he attended a police memorial golf tournament in Ajax and collided with another vehicle. He was seriously injured.
- The Durham Regional Police Association accused Chief Mike Ewles in January 2011 of balking at a security guard's request to check his wife's purse before a hockey game. The group also alleged he interfered in a case involving a friend's speeding ticket. No agency regulating police has found any wrongdoing by Chief Ewles.
DURHAM -- A hockey night out on the town for some officers courtesy of Durham Regional Police unravelled recently when a post-game bar stopover ended in a car crash and penalties for "wilful blindness" and misconduct.
Constable Richard Robinson received a demotion for "discreditable conduct" in a police disciplinary hearing after he drove his car into a ditch, fled the scene and then dumped equipment belonging to the force in the garbage around midnight on Dec. 14.
Const. Robinson also faces charges of careless driving and leaving the scene of an accident under the provincial Highway Traffic Act.
Constable Tim Wray, who was working that night and didn't attend the game, lost three days' pay for "wilful blindness" in his handling of the accident when he went to the scene, according to sources familiar with the incident.
"Any time allegations of professional wrongdoing come forward, we take these matters seriously and investigate them thoroughly," said David Selby, spokesman for Durham Regional Police.
"This matter was thoroughly investigated by independent officers in our professional standards unit. As a result, the two officers received punishment under the Police Services Act."
In response to questions, Durham police said the force had rewarded four officers in its Whitby detachment for unidentified "outstanding work" in December, giving them paid time off and free hockey tickets at the "end of their shift" to see an Oshawa Generals junior game.
The officers were not on duty while at the game, Mr. Selby noted in an e-mail.
The officers attended the game at the General Motors Centre, which started at 7:30 p.m. and ended at 10 p.m. The hometown Generals won 3-2 over the Belleville Bulls.
After the game, police said, the officers headed to the Thirsty Monk pub, a few slapshots away from the arena. When Const. Robinson, one of the officers, left for home later in his car, he lost control and landed in a ditch off a Whitby road.
Const. Robinson called an on-duty officer to pick him up at a location near the accident, according to police. That officer drove him to downtown Oshawa.
Durham police would not say whether the on-duty officer or anyone else conducted a blood-alcohol breathalyzer test on Const. Robinson.
Two sources familiar with the incident said the on-duty officer was Const. Wray, who was working on a local RIDE check. Police would not confirm that information.
Police said they received other calls about the crash and a sergeant went to investigate. That resulted in charges against Const. Robinson of careless driving and leaving the scene of an accident. A court has adjourned the case until next month.
There was no evidence to support any other charges of improper conduct against Const. Robinson, police said.
Mr. Selby would not comment on whether the actions of the two officers had amounted to an attempted coverup.
The force's professional standards unit investigated and charged Const. Robinson with discreditable conduct. An internal police disposition report on the incident after his hearing disclosed he fled the scene and "purposely discarded police-issue equipment in the garbage."
Police would not identify the equipment.
Const. Robinson, 40, received a four-month reduction in his rank, from first- to second-class constable, for leaving the accident scene. It effectively meant a loss in gross pay of about $2,700.
Meanwhile, the on-duty officer was disciplined for displaying a "wilful blindness while involved in a situation with an off-duty officer," the same disposition report showed. Police would not disclose any other details about what the "blindness" entailed.
The report indicated the officer forfeited 24 hours of pay, or about $960. Durham Police would not disclose any other details about the resolution of his case, including his name, because it did not involve a public hearing.
Constables Robinson and Wray could not be reached for comment.
The incident is the latest example of Durham officers running into legal trouble.
Officers have been hit with charges over the past two years, ranging from drug trafficking to sexual assault, possession of child pornography, speeding and impaired driving. One officer pleaded guilty recently to stealing a shotgun from a dead man.
Police Chief Mike Ewles has also faced allegations of interfering in cases and refusing a search by security staff at a hockey game. Authorities later exonerated him of wrongdoing in each incident.

Brussels, 6 November 2008
Commission President José Manuel Barroso said ".
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes commented: "I am confident that this
solution will maximise opportunities for viable economic activity to continue at
these historic sites, with good prospects for sustainable jobs there, while
putting an end to the disproportionate distortion of competition caused by the
huge subsidies received by these shipyards in recent years. This solution has
been made possible by the very positive cooperation we have enjoyed with the
Polish Government in recent weeks. I can well imagine that the buyers of certain
assets would want to engage in shipbuilding at the sites, and that would not be
a problem for the Commission because there would be no new subsidies and they
would buy the assets at a market price. And if those acquiring the assets want
to pursue other economic activities than shipbuilding, they must be allowed to.
What matters most is the break with the past, viable economic activity at these
sites and sustainable jobs."
Since 2002, Gdynia Shipyard benefited from various aid measures (in
particular capital injections, loans and tax write-offs) amounting to €700
million and from production guarantees of €916 million (both in nominal
value). Szczecin Shipyard received aid of €1 billion as well as production
guarantees of €697 million (again, in nominal value). The decisions
require that Poland recovers from the yards all state aid unlawfully granted
since May 2004.
The two yards have been in difficulties since the 1990s. In April 2004,
Poland notified restructuring aid for the two yards and the Commission opened
formal investigations in June 2005 (see IP/05/644).
Poland submitted restructuring plans for both yards in September 2005 and
September 2006, both with substantial delays. None of the plans would have
ensured long-term viability to the yards and the restructuring would have been
financed entirely by state aid.
In December 2006, Poland decided to privatise the shipyards, a process,
delayed several times, that eventually progressed in the course of the year and
lead to potential investors submitting restructuring plans for the two yards on
12 September 2008. The plans represented an improvement in comparison to
previous versions. However, despite further large amounts of state aid and
substantial job losses foreseen in these plans, the yards would still not have
been commercially viable. The Commission therefore concluded that the subsidies
received by the Gdynia and Szczecin shipyards did not comply with the guidelines
on rescue and restructuring aid but rather constituted illegal operating aid.
The Commission decision requires repayment of the illegal aid.
Asset sale
In order to reduce the potential negative social and regional effects of
these decisions, the Commission agreed with Poland on specific modalities of
implementation, along the model developed in the recent Olympic Airways decision
(see IP/08/1336).
Poland has submitted that it needs to take legislative action to implement the
sale of assets.
Poland committed that the recovery will be implemented by way of a sale of
assets or small bundles of assets in an open, transparent, non-discriminatory
and unconditional tender. The proceeds from the sale of the assets will be used
to repay creditors, including the recovery claim of the state related to the
unlawful aid. The existing companies owning the yards, with the remaining assets
and liabilities, will be liquidated.
The assets have to be sold at market price to the highest bidder. The tender
must be non-discriminatory, ensuring access to all profiles of potential buyers,
irrespective of the purpose of their investment. No conditions can be attached
to the tender (for example, a requirement that a bidder purchases all the assets
of a given yard). The sole award criterion for the selection of the winning bid
will be revenue maximisation for the benefit of the yard's creditors. An
automatic transfer of employees to the new economic activity cannot be imposed.
Any write-off or repayment of public or private liabilities, financed by the
State, would amount to additional state aid and could not be accepted. All
creditors and clients must be treated in the same way as they would be in the
framework of insolvency procedures. The sale must be conducted by an independent
sales administrator under the close supervision of the creditors ensuring that
it is conducted on market terms. In addition, Poland and the Commission will
appoint jointly a monitoring trustee with the specific task to verify that the
sale and the recovery of the aid take place in full compliance with the
decisions. Poland committed to complete the sale by the end of May 2009.
Poland was assured today in a letter from Commissioner Kroes that, provided
that these conditions are respected, this sale would not be considered to
involve new aid to buyer(s) of the yards' assets and the assets could be
transferred to the buyer(s) free of any liability concerning the reimbursement
of unlawful state aid. The buyers of the assets could therefore restart economic
operations without the burden of the past and in the absence of any limitation
concerning their future activity.
The non-confidential version of the decisions concerning Gdynia Shipyard and
Szczecin Shipyard will be made available under the case number C
17/2005 and C
19/2005 in the State Aid
Register on the DG
Competition website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved. New

Earth Hour — the global campaign by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to raise awareness about climate change — will be observed from 8.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m on March 29. This year’s campaign will mark the sixth year of the movement in the country and will ask individuals and organisations to switch to renewable energy, said WWF-India representatives at a press conference in the city on Tuesday.New Wiggins video. unreal
Gotta love what you see from Wiggins. He had a nice crossover from left to right which is a good sign because many players his age only have handles from right to left. His array of spin moves looks like they will be tough to stop. The play where he tipped it up and dunked it back in on his second jump may be the most impressive on here. You aren't supposed to be able to explode off the ground like this guy.
I don't think I have ever been as excited to watch a player who has yet to arrive in college. I am not a fan of any of the teams on his list but wouldn't mind seeing him at UNC. He would thrive in their uptempo offense and could play against Jabari at least twice.
No matter where he lands for College, he will make the team an immediate conference/national contender. I believe that he should go to North Carolina. Marcus Paige is a great freshman point guard, Reggie Bullock and P.J. Hairston are great outside threats that can slash, and they have some good young bigs with length and height. Wiggins would fit right in with the up-tempo style of play and he is a much better version of McAdoo. No one in the ACC would be able to keep up with the Tar Heels with Wiggins on the squad.
His other top choices for schools are Kansas, Florida State, and Kentucky.
Considering how much talent is leaving Kansas, how little talent there is at Florida State, and the fact that Kentucky is already stacked with incoming freshman and returning players, I think that North Carolina is his best option to improve/shine/make a difference.
Oh you mean the 9-9 (in ACC) team that had one senior on its team and one healthy junior this year. The one that broke in seven newcomers including five freshmen this year. The one with three 7-footers returning including Mel Turpin's son. The one that will have Okaro White, Terrance Shannon, and Ian Miller (I think this site had him as a top 10 pick at one point) returning all of whom has Sweet 16 level experience. Or the one that will have Wiggins' best friend and #28 overall recruit next year Xavier Rathan-Mayes. I like our chances.
i would love it if he just flipped the scrip on everyone and choose a mid major program with a strong schedule and win a title there. florida gulf coast? i know i got there fever right now and it wouldn't happen, but it would be something else to put a smaller program on the map right away. not necessarily that team, but you know, something around those lines.
Don't think he's a good fit at UNC. If you know how Roy's offense runs, you'll agree. While FSU is better, still not an ideal situation imo. And then Kentucky already has so many players on the wing.
To be honest, Wiggins ideal location for next year really is the Bobcats or the Magic and it &$#%#&@! me off we have to wait for a talent like this.
I have no idea where he's going but I'll go out on a limb here and pick what seems like the least likely destination in Kentucky. The fact that there has been so much buzz lately about FSU and UNC and the fact that Wiggins has been showing a touch more love to those two schools on twitter just makes me think more and more that it's UK.
It's just a ruse imo and I think Calipari has perfected it. He lands these kids fairly early in the process (with the help of WWW) but tells them to play it out till the spring because not only would it stop the NCAA from sniffing around, but it also allows the kids to take all their official visits and have a good ass time with all of the attention.
So yeah I think he's going to UK even though I don't know how it's going to work.
in my humble opinion i believe he should go to kansas. i believe they have 2 underrated and great players coming in, in conner frankamp and wayne selden. plus they will have nadir tharpee. idk much else about who would be on that team. but just those 4 guys alone i feel would be a threat.
First of all, let me start by saying by AW will probably go to UK. Just for the sheer fact that when it comes to top talent, no one is close to Calipari on the recruiting trail. However, having said that, I think that AW should heavily consider the Tarheels. If UNC returns everyone (Bullock, McAdoo, and Hairston), and adds Wiggins, that team is a lock for the Final Four, and I do believe Wiggins wants to compete for a national title in his one year in college (which would essentially knock out FSU, who even with Wiggins, couldn't sniff a Final Four).
With UK, I don't see Wiggins wanting to go play with 7-8 other 5* kids who all demand touches, however, as I said before, never count out Calipari for a top flight recruit. However, with an emerging star PG (Marcus Paige) and UNC's up-tempo, free-lance offense, I think Wiggins could really thrive. Plus, he is such a fierce competitor I think the idea of facing Jabari Parker head to head 2x (potentially 3x) a year, plus a match-up with UK on the schedule, it would give him a great chance to go head to head with the best and prove why he is #1. With no inside knowledge, AW seems like the type of kid that would rather beat the best than play with the best (the anti-Lebron).
I personally think it's going to come down to UNC and KU. But then again, that's just a guess, he's played his recruiting process very close to the chest.
Either way, no matter where he decides to matriculate at in the fall, I think we can all agree his potential is absolutely through the roof. I really think he will swiftly join the NBA's young elite (KD, Westbrook, D-Rose...etc) and be an all-star for years to come.
In my little ideal world, being from Charlotte and a UNC alumn, best case scenario is AW picks the heels, heels win the natty, AW gets drafted #1 to the Bobcats--who then change their name back to the Hornets and with Wiggins, MKG, Kemba, and the draft pick this year (Noel? Zeller?) leading the way, become a mainstay in the playoffs.
Forgive me if this has been posted, but just caught wind of AW new senior season mixtape. Truly mind-blowing, top-tier athleticism.

Expected to run Android 4.0 Ice Cream and support 4G LTE, it's difficult to forecast why this particular model is a would-be killer.
I suspect that LG will want to employ a strategy similar to Samsung's if it hopes to have mass commercial success with the D1L. What's more, it likely will need to cozy up with multiple carriers across dozens of countries. Benchmarks have already surfaced that indicate that Verizon has an LG D1L in the pipeline under the model number D1LV.
We saw LG do this to a degree with the original Optimus One line of phones, though that series was never met with the

Nobody will chastise you for tapping your feet along to the contemporary beat from the pop/rock group on stage, and, if the spirit moves you, go ahead and sing along - the lyrics are projected on a large screen.
In a corner, a cross made from industrial chains glints in the morning sun shining through the windows of the former tannery, now converted to artists' studios and rock band rehearsal spaces.
About 50 people turned out for the first service of Mercy Hill's "inaugural gathering" on Sunday, April 29, and about 100 more for the second service.
Unique approach to worship
Among them was Rozlyn Russo of Bay View, who was raised in the Roman Catholic Church but now describes herself as more spiritual than religious. Russo said this was her first visit to Mercy Hill. She was attracted by a postcard recently sent to neighbors announcing the launch of the church.
The message of the postcard is simple. For those who are "fed up" with traditional churches, Mercy Hill promises a different approach to Christianity.
"…we don't care what you look like, who you voted for, or even if you're religious," the postcard says. "We're just on a spiritual journey of getting to know God and learning to love each other and our community. Maybe you'd like to come along."
Russo accepted the invitation and was pleased she did.
"I've tried many other churches and felt uncomfortable because everybody was kind of cliquey," she said. "I thought I'd give this a try and it was awesome."
Appeal to young crowd
If the style of Mercy Hill is contemporary, complete with videos and slide shows to accompany the sermon, the Rev. Tommy Orlando said he believes the message of the non-denominational, independent church is fundamentally Christian.
"I think there's a need in the American culture for churches to get back to traditional Christianity," Orlando said. "I'm more interested in being the hand of God extended than being the wing of a political party. And I think that gets to the heart of it."
Orlando, the son of a retired Milwaukee police officer and a public school teacher, was baptized in the Roman Catholic Church and when he was a boy, his family converted to Protestantism.
He holds a degree in pastoral theology from North Central University in Minneapolis, a Pentecostal Bible college operated by the Assemblies of God that prepares students for the ministry.
He said he has been involved in church work for about 14 years, including being pastor of a church in Padua, Italy, and heading up youth ministries in the U.S.
His father, Tom Orlando, said about 200 young people participated in Orlando's last youth ministry.
"I think his style of preaching is what brought young kids in and I think it's what's bringing adults in now," Tom said, noting his son uses personal stories and analogies to illustrate his points.
"It's stuff all of us are involved in," he said. "When you can relate to that, you can relate to the scripture he's referring to."
Name based on God's mercy
On April 29, Tommy, dressed in jeans, an open-collar shirt and jacket, preached from the Book of Hebrews, comparing the new covenant between God and man with President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, using dimes handed out to the congregation at the beginning of the service as a prop. He talked about his personal experiences as a Christian, alternately passionate and low-key.
One of the central points of his message was that Christians should be known "by our love."
He said the name Mercy Hill is a reference to Golgotha, the hill where Jesus was crucified, because "The place where God's mercy was so evident was on that hill."

Laptop vs. Car
Sounds like your wife might be stuck in a bit of a time warp. I don't know if California has graduated licensing but in states that do the inability to drive around with your friends really robs the car of a lot of it's appeal.
"really robs the car of a lot of it’s appeal."
Not for me it wouldn't. I hated being dependent on others, usually parents, for chauffering. If those laws had been in effect when I was 16, it simply would have meant that my friends and I would have all just drive individual cars to wherever we were going.
There are some missing links here. Why does a 13 year old want his own laptop? For what purpose? I would allow him to purchase the computer on the condition that we put enough anti virus protection, spyware, etc, and limited internet use/age appropriate sites. He would also have to purchase additional warranty on his own. After all that, he can do what he pleases and if he loses it and warranty doesn't cover the cost for a new one, he is SOL.
When kids are young, a car or college seem so far away (since in PA you need to be 17+ to really drive much on your own and college is after high school), so it's been our practice to let them spend some savings on things that matter to them now. We have made the kids save for contributions to school trips and summer camp with the amount of their money required somewhat dependent upon how much we value the trip. We will pay more for a trip to Europe than one to Disney World, for example.
We also have two types of savings. One is available for more immediate purchases, like video games. The other is put away for those annual trips. When there is no money in the immediate savings, the video game or purse purchase needs to wait, as we don't advance money for those things.
The immediate savings is also what must be used if they want the designer jeans or sneakers that cost more than the designated amount I am willing to pay. I will cover a certain amount for good running shoes, but not the $150 custom Shox. That extra must come from their immediate savings.
"He would also have to purchase additional warranty on his own."
I would consider myself a failure as a parent if I ever found out that one of my kids ever purchased any sort of "additional warranty."
I am 100% of the school that says kids have to learn early how to be disappointed, to make mistakes in areas that do not involve health and safety, to experience rejection, to have the opportunity to fail - no trophies for participation. But in my years of parenting I have found that monetary losses don't really hit home to kids until they lose a stash of money that they have earned. If the 13 year old's savings account is an accumulation of mowed lawns and shoveled driveways, and not just the grandparent checks and mandatory saving of 20% of his allowance, then I think letting him spend it as he wishes is a reasonable choice - when he wants something else in a year he will just have to go out and earn the money again. But if it is money to which he has no more connection than a bank book, the lesson will not be learned because the money has not yet been associated with any cost to him. The Yoders had a column this week on why cheapskate dad wouldn't replace a dying and inadequate computer, and the key reason was that he wanted to force the teenager to be online only in the same room as his parents. There may be a parental reason to forbid the purchase, but saving for a car or college is not one I would endorse.
LOL Tucker.
We haven't figured out what to do with our kids yet re: spending money. I never had any money of my own that I could spend - all of my birthday gifts etc. went into my savings acct and I never saw it again. My parents would give me some spending money (food, clothes, books etc) when I was in college, then I would call and ask for more when I ran out, but there was never any sort of budget, etc. etc. I couldn't drive until 2 months before HS ended so wouldn't have cared about saving for a car - where I went to college a car was impractical anyway. Then when I had a job in law school, during the summers, that money had to last me for the following school year. My parents then gave me the $$ left over from my school savings accounts when I graduated from law school. It worked out well for me since I am naturally frugal, but would have been a disaster for kids who weren't.
Wow... at the same age, my niece asks for big ticket items (like her laptop) for Christmas and her parents and grandparents comply. It's definitely a sign of the times. When I was 13, we had one family computer that ran Windows 3.1 (actually it may have run DOS). I didn't get my own computer or car until college.
I like the ideas of short term and long term savings. I'd like to employ that in my household, actually. Do your kids have their own checking account with debit card? How has that worked out? What if they overdraft?
Don't rules 8 and 9 sort of contradict each other for this situation?
I'm with Portia. If the kid earned the $, he/she should be able to buy whatever he/she wants with it, as long as it doesn't break a safety or moral rule.
I think its pretty admirable that a 13 y/o saved up that kind of $ for a laptop (if he actually earned it). I'd be proud of my child.
A preteen doesn't need their own laptop. He wants it for suspicious reasons. End of discussion.
But in my years of parenting I have found that monetary losses don’t really hit home to kids until they lose a stash of money that they have earned.
That’s been my experience, also. Allowance money is usually viewed as easy come, easy go.
Forgot to close the quotes:

GSL,
When you were 13, a family computer that ran Windows 3.1 or DOS was likely a much bigger expense than the $400 laptop your niece was given. Now if we're talking Macbook or something, then you've got a point.
My parents were very generous, and my brother and I were never all that interested in frivolously spending money anyway. So we drove the family cars, my parents paid all the insurance, and gave us credit cards for gas and other expenses like clothes.
We worked alot during the summers because we wanted the independent feeling of earning some of our own spending money. I remember how angry I was one day when I learned that overtime didn't kick in until 80 hours over two weeks instead of the 40 in one, as I'd been calculating.
Sometimes, kids can just be easy.
Do your kids have their own checking account with debit card? How has that worked out? What if they overdraft?
This worked out well for us, but be SURE to waive the overdraft feature.
To GSL: We had bank accounts for the kids (passbook savings) but closed them about a year ago, as the 0.1% interest rate was a joke. Now we keep the accounts at home. Our 15 year old has a debit card that she can use when shopping but it does not stay in her possession unless needed. Although she's really responsible, she's not driving yet so she doesn't need it often. I would rather not have it in school where the chance of loss is reasonably high.
What are the rest of you doing about credit cards for teens? I am thinking that I will co-sign for one when my kids start driving so they have it in case of emergency. I think we have done enough financial education that they will be responsible. And I will definitely monitor the spending (trust but verify).
I apologize if this gets long...
Our kids have the privilege of failing financially. The set up: beginning at age 4 each got/gets an allowance = $1 for each year of age each week. (Now that oldest DS is approaching 16, that model may need to change) So a 5yo gets $5/week. This is divided:
10% church & charity (DSs go to parochial school and there is always a collection for something or other; they can participate this way)
30% each to 'immediate', 'waiting', 'bank account'. Immediate is for baseball cards, stuff to eat at the ballgame, ice cream truck, etc. The only limits are around the 'will it ruin dinner?' or 'how much ice cream have you had today'? (Even then, sometimes the lesson of eating too much junk food in one day is another important lesson). Waiting is for a new video game or sporting good that DW & I do not want to fund/or we will go half with the kid on. Bank account is at the real bank and really is non-touchable until they are (much) older.
On top of that, birthday/other gift $$ is free-spend, as is money earned from jobs. What we do is encourage the kids to actually deposit their earning in the bank and track how much of the money in the bank is spendable (this is rather than having separate accounts at the bank). So when the oldest wants the $110 Oakley sunglasses, he can get them with the money he has earned. When he loses them or they break, life lesson.
The 2 oldest have cell phones and have (unwisely IMHO) downloaded stuff that actually cost $$. Rather than taking their phones away, we just put them on the easy payment plan where everything but charity and bank acct was confiscated as weekly payment with the threat that any more of that would result in losing the phone. They hated the easy payment plan, since they had no walking around $$, so they reformed.
It's our system; not perfect, but it seems to work pretty well for us and the kids do understand it. The best part is when we go to the mall or ballgame, they know to bring their own money (we remind them when they are young and do set a limit on how much they can bring) and the bank of Dad&Mom is closed. They don't even bother asking now. (Sometimes it really is parents' treat, and we will tell them what that includes so if they want extra it's on them).
I really like these rules and I try to follow most of them. But I still think that whatever a parent does, some kids will just naturally be chomping at the bit to earn their own money and some will lay back and make do with the bare minimum.
My older son is 10. I used to give him $5 a week for his allowance, but stopped because he didn't care about the money. All his needs and some of his wants are provided by us. The money went to savings, and held no value for him. We will re-start allowance next year, when he gets to middle school and has more stuff to spend the money on (ie. movies with friends, cell phone, etc).
We have never bought an extended warranty for anything, except for laptops. My reasoning was that my work laptop that spent a lot of time on the road had frequent issues that the company IT department handled. The family laptop being shared by 2 teenagers, and the one that went off to college would get at least as much physical wear and tear, and a 1-year warranty wasn't enough. The extra warranty has been a great investment. For all other items, I consider extended warranty one-half step better than buying scratch-off lottery tickets.
For kid spending - We allow just about anything that isn't overly dangerous or immoral. DD spends her money on clothes and movies, DS buys clothes when the one's he's wearing fall apart in the wash - the money is saved or goes to music and hobbies. The main issue for me is the one the OP mentioned - let them make spending decisions now and live with them to prepare them for the real world.
We give our 5 year old $1/week, and he can spend it or save it as he pleases. He also earns extra dollars here and there by doing things around the house with DH or me (like yard work). His general pattern is to save up about $20, then blow it all at Target. But he's also learned to bring his wallet with him on general errand running, so that he can buy himself a little treat here and there.
If he were 13 and wanted to spend $800 on a laptop, I'd let him, so long as he understood there were still rules to follow in terms of computer/on-line use, and that buying the laptop means buying the laptop, not buying freedom from Mom and Dad's rules about the laptop.
I think having a computer of one's own at 13 - nearly in high school - is probably appropriate (I did 12 years ago) and a reasonable thing for the kid to want. Sure, he might be planning to keep his instant-messaging more private, but I don't think his reasons are necessarily "suspicious" as one commenter posted above.
Given that, I think there's more of a financial lesson to be learned/taught here. An $800 laptop? Really? Why don't you help him shop for a good deal? My most recent laptop purchase was a $500-600 Acer that I bought on sale for $330 18 or so months ago and it is performing very well. This also seems like a good compromise between your goals and your wife's.
Another good lesson to teach kids might be not to deplete your savings completely - sort of like introducing the concept of an emergency fund. I don't know what the right benchmark is - 4 weeks of allowance, $100, something like that - just in case something unexpected comes up (money for a gift for a friend who breaks a leg?). I can't say I love the idea of saving up for a big ticket item and spending down to $0 as soon as that threshold is met. My friends who have $50,000 in the bank and then go find the most house they can get with a $50,000 downpayment seemed to have missed this lesson somewhere along the way.
A preteen doesn’t need their own laptop. He wants it for suspicious reasons. End of discussion.
You mean you think the kid is a terrorist or he wants to look at pictures of nekkit ladies. The former would scare me. The latter would be expected as normal.
I’m guessing a woman wrote the “End of Discussion” comment. Yep that is piggish of me to say, but bear with me. It’s kind of like when two kids get into a fight.
Women typically are quick to say something like, “I don’t care who started it. You shouldn’t be fighting.” because that’s the way things ought to be despite reality.
Whereas a man, wants to know “Which one of you little $h!+’s threw the first punch?” because it’s important to know which person escalated the confrontation into violence and what provoked it.
There is no End of Discussion with children once they hit their teenage years. The kid has a legitimate question and continuing to treat him like a child is just going to cause him to clam up and not come to you when something serious happens.
I can understand frustration at having to justify yourself to 13 year old, but be happy the kid has half a brain and asked a very smart question. Is it his money or isn’t it? This may be a hard pill to swallow, but there comes a point when ‘because I said so’ just doesn’t cut it anymore. Be honest with your kids and tell them why you don’t want them spending money on certain items. Yes, it may lead into more taboo topics like pictures of nekkit ladies, but it’s better to address these touchy subjects before they are forced to light in the form a very large problem.
As far as the kid buying his first car, I can only imagine the shock and horror that would be expressed over what my parents did. I wasn’t allowed to get a driver’s license till I was 18…the humanity of it all.
They explained to me how their insurance policy worked and were very honest about how the cost would sky-rocket. They also explained that school came first and working to pay for a car and car insurance would be more detrimental. Then they...gasp…worked with me on figuring out a solution.
I could work a part time job, but I was not allowed to make purchases that resulted in financial obligation. In return they did assist me financially from time to time during my teenage years. My friends worked night and day to buy, repair and maintain their cars while their grades suffered. I worked during the summers and had enough money to pay for my friend’s gas and my entertainment for a year. I always had a ride and my friends always had a full tank of gas.
By the way, several of the 15 rules are explicitly for the parents, not the kids. That makes sense. When we took our puppy to obedience training, the whole family went, and the trainers explained that the real reason for the class was to train the owners. If the owners behave appropriately, the dogs will figure out what they need to do to fit in and do it. Same with most parenting issues - if the parents do their job (which IMHO includes letting kids make dumb decisions) the kids will figure out their part.
Tucker,
I'm a horrible parent,
And, and, and hair would grow on his palms and he'd go blind! Blind I say!
When I was growing up, I had a "college savings account", but the intent was not to pay for college itself, but for things I might want to do while in college. My parents never required me to contribute to it, but any $$ I put in it, they matched. The only rule was that I couldn't withdraw until college. The match was hugely motivating for me, and I funneled most of my babysitting money to that account. By the time I went I had enough saved up to spend a summer living (cheaply) in D.C., another summer month backpacking in Europe (but staying in $10 youth hostels!), and enough left over for a tiny, tiny cushion when I graduated and was looking for a job. We'll try this with our kids, and I hope it motivates them as well.
I'm a woman but my DH always says "end of discussion" to our daughter. Maybe because he is saying it to our daughter that she understand better... its an interesting point however.
I think far more important than any little games and rules you devise for your kids' money is how they perceive your behavior and attitudes about your money. (That being said, I like Upstate's games and rules).
And what's particularly hazardous for many of us on here is that we did much of our material sacrificing early on, before they were born, and this is what allows us to enjoy certain luxuries. In our case, we'll have our mortgage paid off well before our kids could have much concept of what a mortgage is. So I think the most important thing is to try to be as open as possible with them about money, sharing what you have learned and what you might have done differently. When I was around 12 or 13, my Dad gave me a tutorial on Quicken, and he showed me his income, his investments, the bills, etc. Sometimes he would have me pay the bills. Having grown up with this level of disclosure, I just can't grasp the idea that so many parents have of "It's none of your business."
Giving a kid $5 per week to spend on candy is great, but when he gets a little older there's alot more to be gained by bringing him in on the family's entire financial picture.
I plan to do the same thing at the right time, but my only concern is the kids' willingness to maintain the same level of discretion that my wife and I do (unlike what I share on this blog, anonymously).
I agree that no 13-year old needs an $800 laptop. Let him buy a laptop with his "own" money, but $800 is not justifiable unless he's starting his own business.
If he insist on the $800 version, I would require him to provide a written proposal to support that purchase. When I confiscated by 16 year old's computer for flagrant over-use, he presented me with a four-page handwritten "manifesto" outlining why he deserved to get it back.
I was very impressed, but he didn't get it back until the week was up anyhow.
I've been wondering where you were!
"I'm a horrible parent", I disagree with your gender analysis. Seems to me mamas often try to figure out why the kid's misbehaving whereas dads say to cut out the whining. Or maybe it's different from family to family and we're all individuals.
As for the money thing, I've been wanting to start an allowance since last summer, but one of my son's first misbehaviors was stealing 20 Euros from my wallet and bought a toy just a couple days before the allowance was to begin, so I said I'd post-pone the allowance for several weeks, until he had essentially paid back the money he'd taken. We still haven't gotten to the allowance. His other misbehaviors pretty much stopped in their tracks when we got back to the US (although he still backtalks) but the money thing goes on and on...
I agree very much with the principle that chores and good grades are expected, and will not be paid for.
I just can’t grasp the idea that so many parents have of “It’s none of your business.”
If your parents had indulged their passion for houses in 2006 rather than 1976 they might not have been so willing to share their financial picture.
Houston,
I missed you as well!
Allboys, are you serious? Of course no 13 y/o "needs" an $800 laptop. DBF and I just bought a $1200 laptop that we certainly don't need. The point is, when you earn your own money, you can spend it on what ever you want, whether its baseball cards you don't need or a college degree you don't need.
Tucker, I think It's a lot to expect a child to be discreet when it comes to family finances. Consider how much completely inappropriate extremely personal information that most kids share without a second thought on Facebook. And these are teenagers.
My middle son is 16, and very savvy about many things. He asked me last night how much I would be making if I were still practicing law, and was stunned when I told him the number. He would have been even more stunned to know that his dad makes that much now. Even the most sophisticated teenager has difficulty grasping the nuances of income, taxes, expenses, investments, etc. All they can remember is that Really Big Number.
A son,
"indulged their passion for houses in 2006 rather than 1976"
It's possible. They were passionate, but never stupid, so I think even then they could say, "Here, take a look at this. We thought it would be a good investment, but it's not looking that way. This is why it's important to..."
I agree with your premise, though, that the "none of your business" mentality is more often than not masking some serious shame or regret.
Interesting article about the Maine vacation house. In the main article they complain that there's only about one week per summer where all the kids and grandkids are together up there; which is just a little misleading because the slideshow captions mention the couple themselves spend about 2.5 months per year there, during the summers. That's basically the entire summer in Maine, so I'm not quite sure what the problem is. Just saying it's "too big" because it has to be heated and gardened raises an eyebrow for me. Maybe they just need the cash.
I think our discussion the other day hit on all the potential mistakes the article mentions.
GaMom: Too much work. 1Q10 was a b*tch. I'm happy to be back. : )
Allboys,
Don't you think it would benefit your son if you taught him all the things you say he has no idea about? If not now, when and where do you expect him to learn this stuff?
Right now he's thinking about what sort of careers he might be interested in, if he wants to be the kind of kid who "is good at math," and therefore what sort of top classes he may or may not pursue or work extra hard in. He's going to be deciding in the next summer or two what internships to go after, then what colleges to look at, what major to select, and on and on.
One of the recurring themes on this board is "Nobody ever told me about careers/money/etc."
Providence, your DBF is an adult, presumably with his own income AND living expenses to meet.
In most cases, I don't think that kids should be given or allowed to purchase such high-end items. If you have the $800 laptop at 13, where do you go from there? You go to the next level, and the child is deprived of the valuable experience of delayed gratification.
Always? No. when they are still young and impressionable ....maybe a little but only if its used as a teaching moment... we are venturing into "allowance land" starting April 1. DS is 8. He started by asking to earn $1 for every 100%, after assuring him that that plan would drive me to bankruptcy (he a bright kid), I decided if he is looking for ways to earn money, he is old enough to start learning how to manage it....
Allboys,
"If you have the $800 laptop at 13, where do you go from there? You go to the next level, and the child is deprived of the valuable experience of delayed gratification."
You know, I wonder about this thing all the time, but not so much in the laptop sense. I own a (slightly) smaller house than the one I grew up in, and I'm still thrilled with it. So I don't think it has to always hold true.
Tucker, believe me, we talk about this all of the time. Indeed, DS is obsessed with figuring out which careers lead to the most remuneration. He wants a BMW and a really nice rifle and a wine cellar and a gourmet kitchen. He is a very gifted student who will be able to do pretty much whatever he wants, and we've talked about careers in law, business, academics, etc. -- how much education is required, what the job competition is like, what the starting salaries are, the time demands, impact on work/family choices, etc.
But it's funny about teenagers. They LOOK like adults, and they're really good at computer stuff, but it does take them awhile to figure out how grownup life works. My son was very surprised to discover that our community in northern Virginia had a median household income that is more than twice the national average. To him, it just seemed "normal." After nearly two years of living in an area with a much lower socioeconomic profile, he's finally starting to get it.
"You know, I wonder about this thing all the time, but not so much in the laptop sense. I own a (slightly) smaller house than the one I grew up in, and I’m still thrilled with it."
But is it bigger and nicer than your starter house?
well, it's the first place I've owned, so I guess it is my starter house. But it's certainly bigger and nicer than our previous rentals.
We're a technology-geekfamily, and got my 11 yr old a laptop for Christmas. We needed a second, because they both occasionally need them for school, but we really like having the kids in the room with us. The desktop computer is upstairs in an open area, but I'm rarely up there. With the laptops, they both are on them in the living room where I can keep an eye on what's going on and talk to them at the same time. At 11, he doesn't "need" one, but this is one of the ways he likes to spend his free time, and I don't think it's morally superior or inferior to other things he could be doing. He is not allowed to take it to his room, and my 16 yr old never really attempts to take the other one out of the living room either. I don't see why all the outrage around a laptop for a 13 yr old when computers are so fundamental today, but again, we're a fairly techno-geeky family.
"first place I’ve owned"
When that mortgage is paid off you can say it is "owned". The computer at $800 is "owned".
first place to which I've held title, albeit with a mortgagor's lien
I don’t think that kids should be given or allowed to purchase such high-end items.
On what planet is $800 a high end laptop? A $2,300 macbook pro might be hing end - but $800 that's pretty average for a non-netbook.
"When that mortgage is paid off you can say it is “owned”. The computer at $800 is “owned”."
No, when that mortgage is paid off you are still renting the property from the government. It's called property taxes. Don't pay and the landlord boots you out.
The laptop, yes, you own. But the software you don't.
My 5th grader wants a laptop. She has a lot of reports., so she would definitely use it for school I certainly don't believe in just giving her one. I told her that she could have one if she gets all A's this year and she learns to type correctly (a minimum of 20 wpm). We even bought her a fun computer program to teach her how to type. So far she has not shown much interest in learning how to type properly, even though I remind her periodically. I think that it is good idea to reward kids for meeting their goals.
Tucker - my niece's laptop cost almost $1000 and she already had a perfectly good desktop (hand-me-down, but suited her needs well). She also received some high-priced ipod that year. At 13 I would have never dreamed of asking for or purchasing a big ticket item. This kid wants to spend his own money and my niece believes the finer things in life are "free" and supplied for by her family.
IMHO I can't see why a 13 year old needs his own computer. I can see wanting one for high school if he plans on taking notes on it during class. Then he should get a smaller mini notebook, which aren't nearly that expensive. Sure you may have to save everything to a thumb drive, but it's transportable to your home computer. Then again, this kid may be the next Bill Gates, and his parents may see this as a stepping stone to being a millionaire.
I could be wrong, but it seems that the kid in the OP thinks that $800 is nothing. Too me, $800 is a lot. I just put $200 into fixing my computer rather than shelling out $800 for a new laptop. Then again, I have other expenses that need to be met. Did the kid earn this money? Does he know how many hours he had to work? Or does he just want to keep up with the Joneses?
Sorry, Tucker. The bank holds the title and owns the house until the loan is paid off.
Your name may be on it as "owner," but try selling the title without paying the loan and see what happens. You can sell the house, but the title will not transfer until the real owner is paid.
You are a mere caretaker. Sorry for the pain.
Tucker,
I agree with your premise, though, that the “none of your business” mentality is more often than not masking some serious shame or regret.
On the other hand we have people like Allboys who believe that crying poormouth and pretending to have less money than they do will impart for sort of moral lesson to their children. Or others we use the excuse "we can't afford it" because it's easier than getting into the real reasons.
And, and, and hair would grow on his palms and he’d go blind! Blind I say!
HAHAHA!!!! That is awesome!
I don’t see an overabundance of hairy handed squinty eyed young men walking around.
“I’m a horrible parent”, I disagree with your gender analysis
That’s okay. It’s strictly my opinion based on observation. It doesn’t hold true in all cases and I accept that.
However I do have my own gripe with gender analysis as well and now I’m going to get out my soap box.
Boys between the ages of 5-17 are almost twice as likely girls to be diagnosed with Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Learning Disabilities .
Have you seen the subjective criteria used to diagnose a child with ADHD:
What’s worse is that ADHD seems to be an American epidemic considering that American children consume up 80% of the entire world’s ADHD medication. That medication is mainly comprised of stimulants.
Were talking about the same junk that truck drivers take to stay awake and keep their focus on the road. Instead of calling it speed, we call it Ritalin, Concerta, Dexedrine, Adderall, Metadate, Strattera, or Focalin.
Heck some of the names of these drugs, which are nothing but word play, should be informative enough.
Concerta – Concentration, Adderall – ADDerall, Strattera – Strategy, Focalin – Focus
So I do have a gripe with gender bias, but its because I don’t want to see a slew of 16 year old boys burnt out with a fried brain and have a heart condition by the time their 35.
For the most part in the United States parents do not raise their sons to imagine growing up to become quiet demure princesses who play dress up.
Imagine for a moment if Tom Sawyer were a real boy and alive today. That boy would be catatonic from all the ‘medication’ they’d poor down his throat to help him behave.
"my niece believes the finer things in life are “free” and supplied for by her family."
It sounds like she's correct. :)
I understand what you're saying. I agree, some parents do their kids a huge disservice. My only point earlier was that it's one thing to play games with your kids about what hoops they have to jump through to get whatever kind of laptop you think is fitting. But it's another, I think, to let them see exactly why Mom is able to replace her old minivan with a new Lexus, what (small) portion of that purchase represents the necessity of transportation and what portion represents a want that you're choosing to indulge, etc.
I think kids are alot more capable than they're given credit for. I'm quite certain Allboys' son is more than capable of understanding at least the basics of the income tax ladder, the importance of investments, risk vs. reward, etc.
My son asked for a laptop as well, because his friend got one. I told him that he has free use of our laptop and desktop (iMac), which are more expensive, faster, and better than anything he'll be able to afford on his own. Why pay for something when you can use it for free? We'll get him a laptop eventually, but there's no need for him to have one now.
call me a troll,
It's funny, because normally I'M the one making your argument about "you don't own anything." So, I'll let it go.
"Imagine for a moment if Tom Sawyer were a real boy and alive today. That boy would be catatonic from all the ‘medication’ they’d poor down his throat to help him behave."
But if Injun Joe had caught up to them in that cave and killed him and Huck, you might think it's better if he had been medicated.
A Son, my husband once treated a boy for an eye condition and the boy asked, in all seriousness, if his extracurricular activities could have exacerbated his eye disease. The kid (I think he was an early teenager) was convinced he had caused himself harm and was extremely relieved when my husband explained how genitalia and eyesight are generally not correlated.
It's never to early to teach children the value of money. My son recently learned that there are consequences to your actions. After telling him you don't put your retainer in a napkin b/c it might be thrown out came true. He put his retainer in a napkin and I'm sure his after school provider threw it out thinking it was garbage. So he had to pay us to help defray the cost, his ortho has a deal if you make cookies for us we'll deduct $50 which he helped me bake. Then I was volunteering to help with a chairity run registration and he came with me to help out.
SoJeff, where can I order a poster of your "rules"?
A son made part of my point for me. An $800 laptop is pretty low end in my opinion. But regarding delayed gratification - if the 13 y/o earned the funds themselves, worked hard and then saved up $800... that to me is a pretty good showing of dedication to the purchase. Writing an essay after that seems pretty silly.
Isn't it irrelevant for this discussion to argue about whether a 13 year old needs an $800 laptop, or anything else? The point is that the kid wants to spend money that he has been told is his. Whether that's for a laptop, a guitar, or a lawnmower to earn more money with is not the point. The point is whether the money is his to spend, and whether it is "good parenting" to let him spend it that way, even if the parents would make different choices.
"if the 13 y/o earned the funds themselves, worked hard and then saved up $800… that to me is a pretty good showing of dedication to the purchase"
You could always teach your kids a real lesson about life and set up some sort of progressive taxation system for their earnings, with the proceeds going toward "college savings," and that could make it really tough to get that $800 laptop. This would work even better if you have more than one child. If one earns alot of money, then take more of his and give it to the kid who plays PS3 all summer.
Re: the point that a 13-yr old needs a laptop of "their own". I think most kids would agree with Houston's point that if there is one available to you, why spend your own money? It may be that the kid in the article did not have a computer available to him at the times he needed it, or with the ability to do the things he wants to do. (An older model won't run some newer software, etc). He's taking steps to solve the problem himself.
I am not a techie. But anyone can get a pretty well reviewed laptop at BestBuy including Office 2007, a mouse and tax for less than $600. If one of my 2 older kids had earned the $$ to afford that, he could get it. Usage subject to parental control and scrutiny, but I am not so naive as to believe that they wouldn't find workarounds to get to all the sites they really want to go to in about 15 minutes!
Area Mom - I think it DOES matter what the $800 is spent on. Ultimately, I'm with you - it's their money and if it's something dumb, well so be it. But I think it's very reasonable to think about where the $800 is going and see if there are any appropriate parenting actions to take (short of downright refusing) if it seems like it might be going somewhere stupid, or if there's a way to get a decent product for half that price, etc.
I am not so naive as to believe that they wouldn’t find workarounds to get to all the sites they really want to go to in about 15 minutes!
If my kids couldn't figure a way to hack around whatever technology I used to try and stop them I'd be soooo disappointed.
So if Joey wants to spend the money on high-end clothes because of peer pressure instead, would you let him? The point is, a junior high student does not need the computer and wants it for recreational use.
If you let him and it gets stolen, its his loss. He doesn't get a new one. If he buys the clothes and they are ruined with stains thats his fault and he doesn't get new high end clothes.
If he has the money to buy another computer, or new high end clothes that was ruined/stolen - do you let him?
A Son: I agree completely.
Tucker, your comment at 10:53 reminded me of this...
Area Mom nailed it - the point is not what he's buying, the point is whether the choice is his in the first place. There will always be outliers/exceptions, but general answer would be yes, he could spend that money on whatever he wanted.
Otherwise, what's the lesson? That you'd better not save up, because then Mom will monitor your spending? Better to fritter it away in $15 and $20 amounts that she won't notice and control? That doesn't seem like a good lesson.
That should read "MY general answer would be yes..."
Off the 100 laptops on Best Buy's website listed under their "Everyday Use" laptop category (which does NOT include netbooks), only 21 are $800 or more. There are many in the $300-400 range.
In my opinion, $800 is not a reasonable amount for a 13 year old to spend on a laptop. A $400 laptop should get him through high school, and senior year he can get his $1000 college model.
For whatever it's worth, my oldest child is 12 (followed by 9 and 4-y.o. siblings) and they all got a laptop to share for Christmas this past year. It cost in the neighborhood of $600 and was their "big" present - along with a few stocking stuffers. My 12 and 9 year old kids need to use the computer at least 3 or 4 nights a week for assignments. My husband and I need ours for work purposes - esp. my husband, who often travels out of town with his.
Tom Sawyer may have been a hellion on his own time, but he sat still in church and behaved better in school than today's ADHD diagnosed child. He loved to read, too. In fact, some of his most outrageous stunts were inspired by the blood-and-thunder escapades of his fictional heroes.
I bought my first car with $800 I earned working a min. wage job. Who knows what $800 will buy when my kids are 13!
Funny. This conversation of $800 not being a big deal for a 13 year old to spend on a laptop is for a specific class or income bracket crowd..
When DD wants to make a larger purchase with her own earned money, I point out the cheaper alternatives and how much $$ she'd have left over to do other things if she chooses that route. Giving her some specific examples of things she might apply the rest of the money to gets her wheels turning, and has gradually taught her to think about opportunity cost on her own. At one point she wanted a designer bag, which would have wiped out all of her babysitting earnings. I told her how sometimes you can find really cool things at thrift and consignment stores. After some initial skepticism she came along to check out a Goodwill and found a purse with the appropriate designer pedigree for $15. The bag was in good shape, and she was really excited to think about how much $$ she still had left over.
A laptop is a little different, but some companies make refurbished ones available on their shopping sites.
Not all kids will think this way, but for some it might work. For us, it has been a way to have ongoing conversations about her spending plans, rather than just saying no.
I would let my kid get the laptop if he had saved the money. I always had jobs, starting from about 12 and would have been infuriated if my parents had dictated what I was able to buy with that money after I had been responsible and saved it. For me, earning money was about being able to buy what I wanted as a teenager. My parents honestly never gave me spending money, even in college. They paid tuition and whatever money I earned over the summer was to cover books, going out, meals out and sorority dues.
In my opinion, $800 is not a reasonable amount for a 13 year old to spend on a laptop.
It's his money.... If he wanted to spend it on a hooker and an 8-ball of blow I'd have a problem. But, a laptop? Seriously - you're gonna be that controlling? Well, I guess everyone knows that being controlling can never backfire.
."
Yes, because we all know how wisely the great majority of low-income people spend their money.
Nearly third of children globally are couch potatoes.
not sure where the leap to ADD came from, but it seems to prove what I said earlier--we are all individuals and our behaviors cannot be predicted by the social role people of our sex/gender are expected to play. Besides seeing lots of parents who go straight against your analysis, I could point to me being ADD. I'm sure I'd be on Ritalin if I were a kid these days. Just knowing what's in someone's drawers simply does not enable you to make that kind of diagnosis either.
Agree with Tucker on low income family - if the child of a low income family had managed to stash away $800 and wanted to spend it on a laptop, I think the two most likely scenarios are (1) parents need to "borrow" it from kid for essentials; or (2) parents don't spend time thinking about what kid does with money, or to the extent they do, don't get involved and kid buys laptop. I think the scenario where the parents have a very reasonable discussion about what smarter uses for that money might be is less likely. I'm certainly not saying there aren't low-income people out there with financial savvy or strong parenting skills - just that I think situations (1) and (2) would be much more likely.
um, kaleberg, the truth is that Tom Sawyer is a fictional character. He never read anything.
A Son, if the argument is "why not? It's his money?", then why not let him spend it on a hooker? He might learn more -- including the consequences of poor purchasing decisions -- having perhaps enjoyed the sex and then enjoyed dealing with the consequences of VD, than getting to plays games and IM with friends in the privacy of his own room.
Depends on the kid. If the kid is known to make a lot of poor purchasing decisions in the first place then why let him buy a computer? If he is a responsible kid with a good foundation then he deserves to buy it. Don't understand why we need 80 comments about it. Its very simple.
Y'all are going to think I'm nuts, but I'm considering getting a netbook, primarily for my 7-yr-old to use. He goes mostly to pretty good websites, mixed in with Lego powerminers and Tom & Jerry on Youtube. I'm glad for the learning on "good" sites, and see the other as a harmless way to kill some time after school when he's low-energy and crabby anyway. Until now he's done these things on my MacBook Pro, but after he threw up on the last one (skyping with reassuring grandperants while I cleaned up the bathroom floor), the insurance company took away the rider for computers. I'll use the new machine for household things, like online banking & bill payments, and I won't tell him it's his, but if we have another accident, I'd rather it be on a machine that costs $250 and has no serious data, not on the $2000 machine I use for my work.
As for telling kids about finance--I'm for it!! My dad did a great job in the stock market and real estate starting in the early 70s, but never wanted any of us kids to know anything about it, so none of us has the first clue about investments. Financial planning and saving for rainy days aren't a strong suit for any of us either. As much as they did for us, if he'd have taught us that and someone would have gotten us used to cleaning, I think we'd all be grateful today.
Dickering about whether $800 spent on a laptop is too expensive seems kind of pointless -- if the kid is responsible when it comes to money and using/caring for a laptop, and the parent and the kid think its fine -- whatever the amount -- seems to me that's the point. Additionally, part of learning about how to spend wisely is to occassionally not do so ie buying a laptop when a netbook could have done the job for 1/4 of the cost or, alternatively, spending $800 when the kid should really have spent $1200 but didn't do the right amount of research.
11:31: That's where I'd be concerned, too. I suppose you could argue that reading a book is physically sendentary, but the way kids just space out on the internet freaks me out.
!!! !!!! !!
"killing some time after school" .... ..
What happened to letting the kids play in the yard or read a book, or imaginary play? At 7 years old, getting too comfortable sitting in front of the TV or computer is teaching them sedentary bad habits. Read that article on yahoo's homepage. Why do they need so much constant stimulation? Tell him to pick up a freakin book, learn to play an instrument, or do some chores!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm taking notes for consideration of these issues when DD gets older, but she just turned 3 last week so I'm not concerned about big spending yet. For those of us with younger kids, what do the rest of you recommend for age at which to begin allowance and chores? Should the two always be tied together? I'm thinking some things are expected for the minimum allowance (put away toys) while others would be considered extra "paid work" (pulling weeds).
"getting too comfortable sitting in front of the TV or computer is teaching them sedentary bad habits. Read that article on yahoo’s homepage"
Classic.
Oh and A son,
Check out today's House of the Day in Bridgehampton. Maybe I'll put in a low-ball :)
Honestly, I don't get this other class of people that can't just build something and enjoy it, but always have to sell and start over. "We're ready to start the creative process again."
GaMom,
Otherwise, what’s the lesson? That you’d better not save up, because then Mom will monitor your spending? Better to fritter it away in $15 and $20 amounts that she won’t notice and control? That doesn’t seem like a good lesson.
She wouldn't be the first parent to teach that lesson.
I think there is a difference between money the child has worked to earn and money simply given as a gift. For me, at least, money as a gift or even allowance money given for normal chores around the house didn't seem to bear any connection to anything I did or had any control over. The concept of getting more money was just "Ok, I get $X in allowance, will save $Y of that, so after Z weeks I'll have as much money as I did before I bought this thing I wanted." Extreme financial secrecy on the part of my parents, to the point where the only thing I knew was roughly how much they bought and sold houses for when we moved, and that only because I saw the real estate listings, didn't help matters.
Er yes, Call Me a Troll, I realize that. My point is that Tom Sawyer, who was brought into the discussion by an earlier poster, represents a society's expectation of middle class young male behavior. In Mark Twain's time - and this would hold true for at least 100 years into the future - a middle class boy was expected to be able to sit still and behave fairly well under circumstances such as church, school, and Sabbath dinner. He was also expected to be physically active, daring, and mischievous. In contrast to our own time, a boy was not regarded as an outlier if he liked to read fiction like the Count of Monte Cristo or Treasure Island.
Today we expect both too much and too little from our boys. We don't let them get enough physical activity or take enough risks, but we believe that they are incapable of reading anything more demanding than Captain Underpants for pleasure. Every time I hear some pundit insist that the reason boys are falling behind in school is that school has become "increasingly verbal' , I grind my teeth. All those manly little men of yesteryear were reading Dumas and studying Latin in high school. School has become less linguistically demanding, not more.
Again. let me emphasize that I am discussing middle and upper class boys. The Huck Finns did not have the same expectations as the Tom Sawyers.
Sensitive group today on here? Must be a case of the Tuesday blues and stress.
All those manly little men of yesteryear were reading Dumas and studying Latin in high school.
God you're delusional - you mean after those 8 year olds came back from their 12 hours in the factory they read Dumas? I think not.
Kaleberg - you think they did a lot of reading in their spare time?
A son - "Again. let me emphasize that I am discussing middle and upper class boys. The Huck Finns did not have the same expectations as the Tom Sawyers."
Kaleberg,
Woops - launced into my angry rant before getting to the last paragraph. Sorry :-P
SWVA "what do the rest of you recommend for age at which to begin allowance and chores? Should the two always be tied together?"
Age for Allowance: 4 worked for us. They are old enough to count, they can go to the bank and make a deposit (and get a sticker and an lollypop at ours).
Chores: they SHOULD certainly be able to do basic things like putting toys away by age 3. And whatever chores they get, those chores are just payback for a roof over their head, food, clothes, a bed to sleep in, taxi service, etc.
Linking: not in our house. No matter how rotten they have been over the past week, they still get their allowance. They may not be allowed out of the house except for school, but they still get their allowance.
Independent jobs for pay: I outsourced lawn mowing before the kids were born; once they were old enough I gladly started paying them instead of the service. Same goes for car washes, leaf raking, and other times when they help out with bigger projects. Routine cleaning (sweeping, vacuuming, bathrooms, family meal prep and cleanup) is part of being a family.
Apology accepted, A Son.
Thanks, Anonymous, 12:32.
School has become less linguistically demanding, not more.
What is expected of the median child has increased dramatically. Was the median child in 1920 or 1880 even expected to graduate from the 8th grade?
kaleberg,
That's an interesting thought. I wonder if the whole genre of children's books has actually done more harm than good. Sure, The Very Hungry Caterpillar is great for a one year old, but maybe as they get older, we're too complacent and satisfied that they're reading anything at all. Maybe I'd have been better off reading some more serious literature as a kid than 150 variations of the Hardy Boys.
Tucker,
I think we also have some survivor bias - we remember the great men who did great things - the vast majority who never did anything of note have been long forgotten. This causes some people to believe that those in the past were more learned and accomplished than today.
A son,
You and I, and the rest of this board, couldn't care less what happens to the median children, as long as they don't slow our kids down, take too many resources, or commit any crimes too close to our neighborhoods. That's kind of the crux of the NCLB debate the other day--great for THOSE kids, but mine are getting less stimulation and too much drilling.
So it's on that basis that I'm wondering about the whole "what are they actually reading" question that kaleberg mentioned.
'we use the excuse “we can’t afford it” because it’s easier than getting into the real reasons'
I have made it at point to NEVER use the 'we can't afford it' excuse. Most kids here know that Mom is putting the purchase on a credit card (and we pay it off at the end of every month), so the real reason is that I am not going to buy that because I don't value it and don't want to spend my money on it. I have taught them that real reason from the time they were still sitting in the grocery cart.
By freshman year in high school, the kids here are at a significant disadvantage if they don't have their own laptop. When my daughter's project group last year was working together, each kid came with a laptop. They all worked on sections of the multi-media project and emailed or transferred files by flash drive. Rules of use enforced by parents still apply but the laptops were necessary for school. My middle school child often has homework that requires his access to the school website to acquire the information.
This article is a whoot - if anyone has a few spare minutes.
kaleberg's comments are spot on. I think a discussion of boys and school and reading deserves its own thread, so I am not inclined to futher it here. I have been thinking about it a lot since Kristof's column in Sunday NYT. I would also add that most younger and likely "post-feminist" women have no idea about what it was like to grow up a girl prior to the 1970s.
To Tucker re: my niece - you are absolutely correct. They are two different things. Her parents just happen to fall in neither category... They spend way more than they make, rely on my in-laws to bail them out, declare bankruptcy and still rely on my in-laws. They tend to fall into the "keeping up with the Joneses" category more than anything else. I think showing her that her grandparents will bail her out is a huge disservice.
Now, if they didn't have these financial issues, and decided to get her daughter a laptop I probably wouldn't have had an issue. Or if they walked her through the purchase, like your example about trading up the minivan for the Lexus. Hopefully part of the lesson is "these are our monthly payments on the Lexus, and here they are if we purchased a new less expensive car." Then walk her through what she would give up for higher car payments.
I second the literature and school thread! I'm curious to hear what people read at the same age! And I think we have varying ages enough on this board to see an interesting picture.
A son - I read the first page of the article... I wonder if this is a cause for a prenup, even for "poor" people at the beginning of marriage. If you divorce and the other is rich, if you didn't update your prenup, you're outta luck. I wonder if that would save our courts time and money....
Folks, I'd love to chat more, because this thread is getting interesting. However, my state pretty much shut itself down and I have to swim home. Happy rest of Tuesday!
saacnmama: Here's my opinion: If you want to buy your child a computer, I'd buy a cheap laptop over a netbook. It's not much more expensive, and you get more memory and features. Within 2 years, your child will be doing homework on this computer, and having a bit more flexibilty might be helpful. Also, I think there are keyboard protectors that will defend your keyboard from vomit, spilled drinks, etc.
GSL,
No, the moral of the story is don't divorce a soon to be billionaire when he's still a mere millionaire.
Every time I hear some pundit insist that the reason boys are falling behind in school is that school has become “increasingly verbal’ , I grind my teeth.
The men of yesteryear most likely received explicit grammar instruction, not the whole language or “balanced literacy” of today, where students are supposed to learn words by context rather than by phonics and grammar instruction. It turns out that young boys are disadvantaged here because girls are generally better at figuring out word meanings by context. So the 1-2 year literacy lag starts young, and is only exacerbated by other educational practices that hurt boys preferentially. For example, the common requirements to write paragraphs explaining and reflecting on your math problem. So, I would say that schools have become “more verbal” in ways that harm all students, but especially boys.
Like SWVA Mom I am very interested in hearing ideas of allowances/chores, etc. DS is 4 1/2 and has some "jobs" that he does around the house. We have not started an allowance yet.
I don't want to hijack this thread further but before heading off to the hiking trail, let me emphasize, once again, that linguistic expectations have been lowered for the high achievers, not the students on the low end of the socioeconomic/academic scale. As Tucker has pointed out, most of the parents on this forum harbor high expectations and hopes for their sons and daughters. There's nothing wrong with being a manicurist, but I bet few Jugglers see this as an acceptable future for their daughters. The very topic of today's forum, teaching your children how to handle money, implicitly assumes that said children will have money to handle.
A son,
It's absolutely heartwrenching what that family's had to endure. And such wonderful people, too.
Enjoy your hike, Kaleberg.
We have a similar practice as UpstateNYdad. Our 5 year old gets $1/week, but it's not linked to chores or good behavior (though I do have a set policy that when I make a simple request, like go wash your hands because it's supper time, you can either do it or you can pay me a dollar to argue with you about it. He's only had to pay me for one argument).
Daily chores for both our 5 year old and 2, which are just expected for being a good citizen of the family, are feeding the dog, making your bed (I use only a quilt, no top sheet which is too hard for him to straighten) (2 year old is still in a crib, this doesn't apply to him), putting dirty clothes in the basket, and generally picking up toys (though if they have built a lego tower, or started a puzzle, I do not make them put those things away until they're truly finished, which could be 2 or 3 days later.). But there is no sticker chart or reward for these things, it's just expected and part of the daily routine.
Tucker,
It takes balls to complain that your husband works too hard when you're spending $50k a month on clothes.
Moderators - can you consider this an official request for a post on how parents of boys (and girls) supplement their kids' reading education given the lowered linguistic expectations of today's schools?
kaleberg,
linguistic expectations have been lowered for the high achievers
I'd be willing to put the current Newton High/Greenwich High/Winnetka High AP curriculum up against the Choate/Eaton curriculum circa 1910 and say the AP classes have higher linguistic expectations.
Wow, lots of posts. Interested to hear it all because we are on the verge of starting an allowance for my older DS and have been discussing what the rules will be. My family discussed money pretty openly and my parents were extremely frugal. I didn't realize you could just go to the mall on a Saturday and buy stuff "just because" until I was 10 or 11. My parents also pointed out that while many people in our school seemed like they had a lot of money, many of them may not be saving. I never considered us rich growing up but we always had a boat and spent our vacations on the boat in the keys and the bahamas. We just never had guess jeans and fancy purses. We got an allowance that had to be requested at a specific time each week - if you missed the time slot, you got no money.
I know so many young adults whose parents have done a huge disservice in teaching them about money and delayed gratification. Now the parents have no retirements savigns but they still have the country club memberships, drive a porsche and bought their kid the latest louis vuitton purse and an $1000 crib. There is no shame in learning from your mistakes and I question how these people don't see the train wreck coming from their continued bad decisions.
How do you handle the situation when the older child has more money than the younger child so can afford a bigger ice cream? Do you help out the younger child? Force the older child to buy a smaller ice cream? Allow the older child to lend money to the younger child?
Just wondering b/c we buy the mall treats to avoid these arguments. My youngest is 7 and oldest is 13
"I never considered us rich growing up but we always had a boat and spent our vacations on the boat in the keys and the bahamas"
More details on thet boat, please.
I would be willing to let my son buy the laptop provided it was a well thought out and helpful purchase and ground rules were established. I would also like to be involved in the selection process. I would rather he have one large "toy" that he really uses instead of 40 toys collecting dust in his closet. I took back some of the smaller gifts he just received for his fourth birthday and exchanged them for a bicycle. He will get much more use out of the bicycle than the 4 Transformers he received. I was raised by an extremely frugual mom who heavily influenced my purchasing who taught me to always calculate the cost per use. An $800 laptop might last longer than a lesser cost item making it a better value in the long term. Same reason I don't lease cars.
A Son - that is a sad article. She didn't have a very good divorce attorney the first time because her settlement was pretty crappy but she certainly should have moved on with her life to a greater extent. I feel badly for the kids caught in the middle. in Scarsdale, New York and Winnetka, Illinois struggle with university-level academics. Even the students who did everything right in high school—the advanced classes, the good grades—require extensive college remediation
For a long time, used 28 foot boat that the three kids slept on the dining area that converts to sleeping area. Upgraded to a 35 foot and 42 foot later - none new and all financed. My dad is a sucker for good finance deals and now keeps boats leveraged and owned by an LLC to protect him from liability since he has real assets. Now, once he was wealthy, he bought a serious yacht - still used but totally custom-built by a couple going through divorce. But only kept it two years because dad's too cheap to have a captain and the work was too much for a couple approaching 60. By comparison, both DH and I certainly are on better financial footing than either set of parents at the same age. But I conveniently have us living in a landlocked part of the country so a boat is not an option, which helps..
How big was the serious yacht that's too much work for a couple approaching 60? I'm curious for boating reasons, not so much for financial ones.
Now, once he was wealthy, he bought a serious yacht
And where was he when they were giving out parents? I'm your long lost brother - I swear!
So if Joey wants to spend the money on high-end clothes because of peer pressure instead, would you let him?
I hope the person that posted this isn’t a woman…I know I know…I’m a pig
I certainly hope she doesn’t have an engagement ring on her finger either.
I mean if we are going to talk about peer pressure purchases with kids then let’s cut through the cr@p as adults.
Teaching Joey to not waste money on luxury items while teaching Suzy to expect them might cause a bit of a rift between the genders. At the very least; one is going to look at the other as delusional, miserly or wasteful.
The point is, a junior high student does not need the computer and wants it for recreational use. If you let him and it gets stolen, its his loss. He doesn’t get a new one.
I can apply the same rule of thumb to adults regarding an engagement ring. I used this one specifically because there are so many legalities regarding ownership and conditional gift giving. More importantly the engagement ring can be a VERY crucial element in a couple’s relationship and I’d hate for us to pretend otherwise. Let’s face it; this is also a peer pressure purchase that comes with an expected price tag (2 months of the mans salary) and serves no other function than to decorate a lady’s finger.
If he has the money to buy another computer, or new high end clothes that was ruined/stolen - do you let him?
Does a daughter really need the best prom dress or shoes that match her outfits? Does she really need name-brand anything?
Should your daughter settle for a man who doesn’t even consider getting her an engagement ring?
If we’re talking about young men saving money for frivolous items or luxuries then it’s safe to say that this extends well into adulthood.
DISCLAIMER…no this does not apply to everyone.
Whoa, why all the hatred toward engagement rings?
I see there are some posts on writing. I always tried to emulate the Civil War letters. Even as a boy, there was something about the writing style that conveyed despair, hope, love intelligence, compassion and wisdom; all in a very masculine manner. As hokey as it sounds, it was how I always imagine that men of character and renown spoke and wrote. It also made me believe that there is a HUGE difference between a southern accent and a redneck accent, primarily differentiated by the choice of words and content of discussion. Whereas a man may express his point with a quick word and clever wit, it was the slow measured thoughts expressed with eloquence that always appealed to me. It is pride in how one presents himself to others know that let folks know if they are speaking to a man or to a boy.
Because engagement rings are a massive ripoff in terms of actual financial value, and generally at a time when the parties involved have vastly more rewarding uses for that money. But, it's a time-honored custom so people honor it unthinkingly.
Bob,
You'd have been much better off using 25k for an egagement ring vs. buying a home over the last couple of years.
Whoa, why all the hatred toward engagement rings?
Hehehe….It doesn't have to be engagement rings. That just happened to be the peer pressure luxury item that popped into mind. Don’t ask me why, but reading about little boys wasting their savings on laptops, a useful tool, reminded me that men save money to buy engagement rings everyday not because they want them so much as they are expected to buy them. Yes Yes…I know it’s a gift for someone you love, but it’s not like a gift you can replace with something else.
I ran with it...maybe a little excessively I'll admit :-)
Can you think of a better example?
I’m still of the mindset that adults can’t preach to their kids about peer pressure purchases when they themselves do the same thing.
Tucker - 72 foot and 20 foot wide - the main issue is pulling in the lines when docking, which falls to my mom. Usually pretty easy but when you get to a boat of that girth, it is difficult. While they had that boat, my mom literally had the most hugely muscular arms. It also ends up costing a lot more to run - 3,000 gallon fuel tank and boat uses more fuel because it is heavier, dockage fees are higher, etc. This particular boat was a sportsfishing boat and they really don't sportsfish much.
A Son - really, you don't want to be adopted by them. This is the type of person that carries pictures of his possessions in their wallet rather than their kids - a whole curio cabinet that is a monument to self and possessions. Serially unhappy person who thinks he will be happy if he just has x or travels to y. Doesn't believe in friends. Very not nice to his wife. I haven't quite figured out if he is capable of being happy.
"laptops, a useful tool" - KEY PIECE HERE!
Does a 13 year old BOY understand that a computer is a tool? Not a toy? Not free porn?
"I’d be willing to put the current Newton High/Greenwich High/Winnetka High AP curriculum up against the Choate/Eaton curriculum circa 1910 and say the AP classes have higher linguistic expectations."
I remember reading something online a few years ago -- it was a copy of the final exam required by graduates of a public high school in New York, I think, back in the day when most kids didn't get beyond 8th grade. I tried to find it to post it here, but had no luck. As I recall, it required an in-depth knowledge of history, literature, philosophy, and Latin, and there were no multiple choice questions. In any event, it was quite a demanding and comprehensive exam -- nothing like the high-intensity and politically correct memorization required for most of the non-math or science AP exams administered today.
Yeah, that's sizable. I'm a bit confused though, with all you previous posts I was picturing sailboats, and now you say the 72 footer was a sportfisher. Were the previous ones power as well, or sail?
"This is the type of person that carries pictures of his possessions in their wallet rather than their kids "
MiaMama,
Compared to what I had to deal with, he sounds delightful.
2:36 was mine
A Son: you are right! Two years ago, my youngest decided that my engagement and wedding rings really did belong in the bottom of our septic tank and after some effort to get them back we ended up replacing them. DH bought well and, thankfully, we insured well because it was very costly to replace them relative to what he paid for them initially, given the appreciation in the stones..all told a reasonable ROR over all those years for something we both wrote off as an expense.
At Moonjar.com we create tools to help kids learn all about financial independence- making mistakes is very much part of that!!! It is so much better for an 8 year old to spend too much on a bad toy that breaks or even a 13 year old to spend all his money on a lap top than it is for a 25 year old to to make a bigger mistake! The key is to help the children learn from the mistake - notice that now since the $$ is gone there is no money for the other things that he might have done otherwise. Money is all bout the choices we make with it.
Great topic!!
Allboys,
I remember that e-mail forward too. Unfortunately, it was pure hogwash.
I think this what you are referring to:
Snopes states that the exam is real, but says that it is "false" anyway because many subjects were not included, and therefore it wasn't actually any harder than exams today. FWIW
Sounds like something my great aunt would say while playing canasta
"oh that was pure hogwash back in my day of heming shirts and scrubbing clothes at the stream. We didn't have a car so little William would use the donkey to trade our goods for medicine. There was no such thing as the internet or computers and we enjoyed the company of others by telling stories and writing poetry before dark"
hogwash--I think I heard VP Cheney use the term once, and I like it. It's far more colorful and illustrative than BS, either in the latter's proper or abbreviated forms.
Tucker,
That wasn't the test I saw.
Boy just got home from school and is into Lego now, will probably go out and climb the backyard tree soon, and is big into roller skating these days. Still, some days he just wants to veg. My sisters & I used to be allowed 30 min of tv after school, and none of us are what you'd call lazy slobs. I don't think he will be either
He's in 1st grade, has a 5th grade reading level, tests in the 90th percentile for various academic things. Whatever they're worth, those tests suggest I'm not entirely off-track with his intellectual development, and I've always seen outside time in all kinds of weather and physical activity (he loves dance lessons) as important parts--sound mind in a sound body!
I'll save the rest of that for when MBT and Portia's thread on reading comes through.
Does a 13 year old BOY understand that a computer is a tool? Not a toy? Not free porn?
Well I guess that depends on the values that you instill in your son or at the very least the knowledge to delete his internet history everyday.
Still if the idea of “top-shelving” the laptop will prevent your son from seeing an exposed nipple or some other debauchery then maybe just maybe it’s time to talk about the “special” hug that adult have for when they love one another and are in a responsible and meaningful relationship.
Then again you can top shelf that too and let your son learn from television, friends and other inaccurate sources about sex. Hopefully he won’t show up with a little pregnant girlfriend scratching his head asking, “How’d she get pregnant. I stood on my head and she took a shower after every time we had sex.”
Wait…are we talking about sex or laptops? If we’re worried about our sons having sex with laptops then heaven forbid they go to co-ed schools where they may gaze upon young healthy females in their prime and have funny thoughts to boot.
Next we’ll be medicating boys “urges” and giving it some cool acronym name like S.A.D.- Sexual Attention Disorder categorized by boys liking girls curvy bits.
Regarding the Eton/Groton question, A son, surely you jest! That blue blood knew his Latin, Greek, Shakespeare. He could construct a paragaph, speak French tolerably well, likely read German, make an intelliigent pun, appreciate an opera, speak intelligently on history or military strategy, use a word correctly of more than 2 syllables, and had an actual vocabulary and a shared cultural reference that made him a great dinner companion, if not a shining intellectual light. Today's AP student knows a great deal that is not Eurocentric and likely knows more science and math than your straw man, but just as likely is an ignoramus when it comes to foreign languages, great literature, theater and music.
Houston,
Thanks for the suggestion! You'd better believe I have a keyboard protector now, but I'm still leery of what could happen if I let him use my computer for an hour or so every day.
On the then vs. now education discussion: 8th grade graduation tests in the early 20th century were more practical than today, and expected kids to apply their skills by, say, calculating out bushels of grain into wagons or prices. Most PhDs a century ago were not yet 30 years old, in part because dissertations were only around 75 pages and did not cite nearly as many sources as is expected today.
I want a sailboat!!
saacnmama,
Were you on about two weeks ago when I shared the link for the fractional yacht leasing company I found? That's what I want to do in a couple years, when the kids can enjoy it as well. It was maybe $3500 per year and you get to book the boat for a pretty generous number of excursions. There's no financial obligation beyond the year-to-year service, it's not like a timeshare or something.
If you have any idea how many things there are that can go wrong with a boat, and how often they do, it would seem like a great deal.
I think the company was pinnacle.
too many conversations - sailboats, reading criteria, computers, finances, porn and sex? How does anyone juggle their juggle with the juggle?
Portia,
Survivor bias - the ignorant rantings of Lord Stanley Douchebag Eaton '12 have long since been lost to history.
Our 6yo DS gets $5/week allowance to buy things he wants. It is not tied to chores, or school work. We will split the cost of books, and art or engineering supplies. Reading has been an issue this year, so I've relaxed the cost-sharing requirement for books if it's something I think he'll read. (I second the request made to the moderators.) He is definitely an impulse buyer, and then later regrets not being able to buy the bigger thing that he was trying to save his money for. He hasn't learned from it yet. We have to make sure that for anything he gets, he has to go through the act of paying for it himself, rather than reimbursing my credit card purchase.
One thing I've picked up from this thread is that we need to get him to clean up his toys more. While I think there is value in having some things (legos, blocks, trains) out several days so that the imagination games can evolve, we are too lax. I don't know what age I started being required to clean my room before I could watch Saturday morning television, but I was at least as young as 8.
Man oh man. An 8 year old with engineering supplies. This gets more interesting by the minute!
If the laptop situation arose in our household, I think that DS would be able to spend his $ to buy a laptop, but there would be more discussion about cost/functionality tradeoffs between buying something on Craigslist vs. brand new.
I'm married to a 2nd generation engineer, and raising a potential 3rd generation engineer. While the spring cleaning discussion was occurring, we were considering whether we should drive 380 miles to buy a used Thork-lift.
A Son et al.: In my former life as an archivist, I got to read lots of letters and journals from lots of different kids of people: everybody from Senators on down to laborers. The letters from from about 1850-on. If we're dealing in anecdotes, the prose from *all* of those letters, journals, etc. was far, far better on average than prose I read from everyday people today (I'm a family law attorney, so I get to do all kinds of reading and read all kinds of writing, i.e. emails, affidavits, etc.). Now, perhaps those same people of yesteryear were weak in math or geography or whatever, but I do think your run-of-the-mill writing today is pretty low quality in comparison.
As to the highly-educated Eton types, Portia is correct. The curriculum was pretty rigorous and classical: Greek, Latin, all of the great writers, music, etc. Of course, doesn't mean every graduate mastered that and, of course, a classical education leaves much out, but the bar was quite high and graduates of those places spoke a common language. These days, that kind of well-rounded education is pretty rare. I'm reminded of one of the highest-ranking students in my law school class (a Brown graduate) who had never *heard* of John Updike. Not had never read him, had never *heard* of him. I mean, come on.
the prose from *all* of those letters, journals, etc. was far, far better on average than prose I read from everyday people today
Is it possible that those on the left side of the bell curve, in late 19th century America, were illiterate and therefore didn't leave a written record?
A son, are you comparing the lowest gentleman's C from Groton to the top of the AP class at Greenwich High? A more apt comparison is to the present day Fairfield County I banker or surgeon's "alternative learner" son attending John Crunchy Doe Academy. Your original comment referred to curriculum, not academic talent.
I haven't gotten through all the comments but just wanted to jump ahead to say that not only does my 9 year old have a laptop, my 7 year old has her own netbook too. And what's more, I've told my 5 year old that he can have a netbook as soon as his reading is strong enough that he doesn't need to keep asking me to read things to him when he plays a game (Steve the Sheriff, 1 Penguin 100 Cases, that sort of thing). This is partly so they can do school assignments that are web-based (KidBiz, math enrichment, essays) and partly so that I can use my own computer and not always have small people asking when I'll be done so they can play Wandering Willows or watch funny guinea pig videos. So obviously I have a strong personal motive for these purchases.
Pretty soon kids are going to have credit cards and there will be a topic on "how the american express or visa card for your 12 year old stirs up the juggle".
The comments will be how their 12 year old is only allowed to purchase school related items, another parent will explain a limitless card, another parent will allow purchases but each purchase has to be thoroughly explained in writing, another parent will claim poor and ban credit card usage because "when they were a kid they only played with rocks and only purchased items with profits from the lemonade stand...."
Portia,
I'll try and find you the quote from the head of Harvard Admissions circa 1910 - basically it boiled down to his idea that doing well in school was something to be expected of jews and queers - certainly not something to be expected of Harvard men. I'd imagine the people at Groton felt the same way.
"With athletes occupying the apex of the student peckign order, both Christianity and character tended to be overshadowed by "manliness." Ranking lower still was itellect - a quality that was viewed with suspicion as oriented to the self rather than the community. "I'm not sure I like boys who think too much," Peabody once said. "A lot of peopel think of things we could do without."
The quote deals with Endicott Peabody the founder of Groton.
In regards to the New York article, I think the lesson here is do not marry a west village girl who will feel your "superior" when you are on your way up to building an empire. As she never understood or appreciated how the money was made, but always had an open hand for it.
I'm sure he was not a pleaseure everyday, and may have had some shady dealings, but I fail to have sympathy for someone who profited from those dealings and was always going back for more money which she squandered.
If she actually took the money she was given & did great things with it, then I would have some respect for her. And as someone else posted after the article itself, I think she would have made her husbands life miserable no matter if they were rich or poor.
I also surmise that the reason that she did not remarry is either because she did not want to lose the drive to keep bleeding her ex-husband, I think she enjoyed it too much and would have lost that if she got married & would no longer be receiving alimony. Or because any other wealthy man could now see her coming a mile away so that she would not be able to marry someone rich enough to equal the alimony she already had.
To A son comment @4:09 & 4:36: Sounds like the motto espoused by George W Bush and his ilk.
I recently had to explain credit cards to my nephews - 8 and 7. They had an overnight with us a couple weekends ago and spent the better part of an hour pestering DH and I for our credit card numbers. Rude, yes. But even more alarming was that they had no idea that credit cards need to be repaid. I, of course, refused to give them my card, but also made them listen to an hour lecture about money. Last time they ask their favorite Auntie for cash!!
4:41: The flip side is that many wealthy men like to marry women with ambition that doesn't match theirs.
A son,
Touche, though I happen to be a renter and not an owner. Still, a home at least has the prospect of increasing in value.
I'll second Anon 4:41's comments about the unflattering impression of the first wife from the New York article.
CT Anon - tell more. How did they learn to ask that? Do their parents let them charge things unsupervised? My sister once had one-click ordering enabled and her preschooler ordered a pretty dress while she was supposed to be playing another program that was also open but I have never heard of people giving their credit card numbers to kids that age to buy things online. Does anyone else do this?
MiaMama - No. SIL & BIL are pretty strict with cash and don't let them charge anything. My personal opinion is that the problem stems from my SIL & BIL’s overall attitude toward money that they are passing on to their kids. They are in the late 30s, three kids and rely heavily on MIL and FIL to provide what they can’t. MIL acts as a surrogate mother to the kids – she provides daycare for the kids, buys school clothes, pays for lessons & birthday parties, etc…. BIL & SIL are perfectly OK with the arrangement and have no trouble accepting handouts from others. In all the time I’ve known them – they have never offered up cash for any shared activities we do. If we go out to dinner, we pay. If we grab a drink out, we pay. If we decide as a group to go to a museum or show with the kids, we pay. I don’t like the expectation, but it is just the way it has evolved. I'm not sure how to change it at this point. I think the kids pick up on this and expect the same treatment. I'm not sure, though, why they didn't know how a credit card works, but they sure know now.
Back from the trail. I highly recommend The Chosen, an infuriating account of how the Ivy League, led by Harvard, set up quotas to keep talented and hardworking Jews from taking the places that rightfully belonged to the sons of the WASP elite. But A Son is missing the point. Those Jewish boys were a threat because they knew their literature. They knew how to write. They knew their languages. They knew them so well that they outscored their upper crust competition in the Harvard entrance exams. But what you have to remember is that the field of battle was literature, languages, and writing as well as math and science, and the warriors were those very boys who supposedly can't deal with heavy reading.
If you look at the Harvard entrance exams, as well as those used by the Seven Sister schools like Vassar, you can see that they demanded an extensive amount of writing, a thorough knowledge of English and American literature, relative fluency in at least one modern language, and the ability to read Classical Latin. Today, not even the most elite schools demand this level of linguistic ability. This is not necessarily bad as there is more to Heaven and Earth than is dreamt of in Cicero, but let's just remember that somehow, boys managed to deal with Cicero.
The bleeding hearts and closet anti-feminists who bemoan the failure of the schools to address the needs of boys are shortchanging the very kids they claim to be defending. Middle class boys were not falling behind girls when they were forced to read Ceasar, Shakespeare, and Milton. They began to fall behind as the curriculum moved AWAY from extensive, in depth analysis of literature, grammar, and rhetoric. They have fallen further behind as the schools have given up the teaching of foreign languages.
I compared the AP English exam reading list I took years ago to the current AP syllabus. The newer list is shorter and more heavily weighted toward contemporary literature written in the vernacular heard by kids everyday. It's just less demanding, both in quality and quantity. The AP program had to abandon their French Literature exam because too few kids took it.
For a real eye opener, go to the Horace Mann website and check out the reading lists for 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th grade English. They are pathetically short and almost comically weighted toward contemporary female minority authors. (Note: there may be much to learn from obscure female Palestinian American poets, but we don't yet know if they will have the staying power of Jon Donne.)
Kaleberg, I took your suggestion and looked for the Horace Mann reading list -- this is what I found . What's the problem with it? It looks fine to me. A couple of Shakespeare plays per year, Dickens, the Brontes, Fitzgerald, Whitman, Hawthorne, Wilde, Woolf, etc. Am I looking at a different list than what you saw?
Huh? Kaleberg - that seems like a fine list.
Saacnmama...I don't think your nuts...my kids are 7 and 8 and they both have their own desktops...one hand me down from me, and one purchased for the other child. They have all sorts of fun software etc... and have bookmarked for their favorite websites. And they play sports, play piano, do all sorts of other activities etc... but when it gets dark at 4:30, homework is done etc... that is another option. And yes, they read etc... the little one is on 1st grade, and my second grader is reading on a 6th grade level, (currently reading book two of the Potter series).
Differnt strokes for different folks...
The Chosen is one of my favorite books I read growing up. I think I am going to have to re-read it.
We are planning on attending public schools for now but one of the things I like about the local catholic school is their emphasis on a well-rounded curriculum that includes foreign language, drama and the arts for all kids in addition to english, math and history.
What a list, A son, they can't even get "Tinker, Tailor, Solider, Spy" right.
I was reliably assured, though, that the Calculus AP examination was significantly harder 50-60 years ago than it was when I took it nigh a decade and a half ago, including from a classmate who'd found the modern exam even easier than I did.
That Horace Mann list looks fine, but of course it’s unusual. And the problem is more than the reading lists. For one of my son’s summer reading assignments (honors English) in high school, instead of a written book report he had to compile a playlist and CD cover for a grade. That was not too unusual, and this year my middle schooler typically gets to choose between making a poster, a board game, a picture book or a written report for her social studies end of chapter assignments. No wonder they’re not learning how to write!
Kaleberg, who are you calling bleeding heart and closet anti-feminist? I’m not sure to whom you’re referring because, like most of the advocates for educational changes to address the needs of boys, I support a return to a more traditional curriculum heavy on classics, grammar and content. For example, we agree that the lightweight reading lists of today, heavy on contemporary teen-angst, relationship literature, are not helping boys. Nor girls, for that matter.
Do not fall for the summer reading list. Students don't pay any attention to it, and neither do the teachers. Each class at Horace Mann reads only a small number of books. Check the books each class has to buy. For example, in her freshman year Hepzibah read Macbeth, Great Expectations, and Krik? Krak! (minority female author). That was it for longer works. She read a small number of poems, including two by Walt Whitman, one by Frost, and several by contemporary American authors. In her sophomore year she read The Odyssey, Othello, and Their Eyes were Watching God (minority female author), in addition to several contemporary American poets. That was it. In her junior year she read Wuthering heights, Hamlet, Oedipus Rex and Antigone, again with the addition of of several contemporary American poets, in this case, representatives of the Harlem Renaissance. In her senior year her class spent an entire semester on Invisible Man, to the exclusion of any other reading.
Hepzie never read any Jane Austen, George Eliot, Henry James, Mark Twain, Restoration poetry or drama, Keats, Shelley, Byron, Russian literature, French literature (except for one short story by de Maupassant, assigned in eight grade), or any Shakespeare beyond the works cited, with the exception of Midsummer Night's Dream, which her class read in eighth grade, along with Dracula and Frankenstein. I believe that her class read two poems by Wordsworth somewhere in there.
Horace Mann had an extraordinary math curriculum and an excellent science curriculum. They taught writing well. However, their history and literature classes lacked the rigor and challenge that one would expect from a school of this caliber.
Third. That looks like a great summer reading list.
I would disagree that it is "comically weighted towards contemporary female minority authors" as well. Its disingenuous to say at this point in time whether they will have "staying power" when they only relatively recently been given a voice.
Finally, with all of the bashing majors such as English Literature/liberal arts etc... get, on this board in particular, we can't seriously be surprised that the knowledge of literature has decreased.....

no no no...it will slow the website down even more. As silly as it sounds I usually try and type my comments in word, spell check, then cut and paste onto the website.
I always have a blank document up and running for taking notes for phone calls and scratch work. So it's not a big deal for me.
Saw the comments about education. Honest questions
1) Who here thinks that the average school teacher can do his or her job?
2) Who here thinks they can do the average school teacher's job?
I know everyone loves teachers, but these folks are only slightly more educated than the kids they are teaching in some cases. So far the best teachers in public schools are those that had real careers doing something else then became teachers.
Anyone can go back to school and with little effort become a teacher.
kaleberg - if at all possible, would you please find another placeholder name for your daughter/niece/friend to whom you refer as Hepzibah or Hepzie? That was my daughters name, no kidding, who died many years ago, we called her Hephzie for short, and it causes me actual pain every time I see it used in this fashion. Thank you.
I love my sons' school. They read Homer, Plato, St. Augustine, Locke, Thomas Aquinas, Jane Austen, T.S. Eliot, Marx, Aristotle, Dostoevsky, Dickens, Hegel, Rousseau, Shakespeare, and Dante. There are no trendy diversity readings. And everyone takes math through multivariable calculus.
Allboys - sorry you think diversity is merely "trendy". Adding the voices and experience of others, especially those who were forceably silenced, really takes nothing away from the writers you've listed. I love my son's school as well. although he isn't yet in the upper school, they read all of those folks as well as Walker, DuBois, Morrison, Wright, Baldwin, and Marquez. A well rounded education provides for exposure to a variety of view points and teaches a child/person to think critically, examining the perspectives of others around them, not dismissing the experiences of any writer not white or been dead for several hundred years. While I agree much about human nature remains the same, a great deal has changed, and we do a disservice to our children when we act as though it hasn't.
Sort of reminds me of a comment I heard about Scalia being a strict constructionist of the Constitution..."Well, then who exactly is the Commander in Chief of the Air Force?"
Kaleberg - I'm not sure Zora Neale Hurston is the best example of an "minority female" author used to decry diversity - the book has been around for about 70 years, so it's probably had enough analysis for people to know if it's worth reading. And I also like Edwidge Danticat, so while I get your point about it being a new book, I'm not sure that it's a terrible one to read in school.
Allboys - whom do you consider to be "trendy diversity" authors? From your response it sounds like entire genres would go unlearned by your children. I read all those authors in my (average PA public) high school, as well as Toni Morrison, Zora Neale Hurston, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, etc. Well, I might not have read Hegel (I don't remember). I adore Jane Austen, but she's a glorified romance novelist.
As long as we're comparing academic expectations at different times and places, here's the site offering released sample questions showing what sort of material Hawaii's public school kids are tested on for grade levels 3 through 10:
Well, you all have certainly given me quite a reading list of great works on which to focus my future commuting-time audiobooks. Geez, there are so many I don't recognize, I'd better get cracking.
Couldn't find the summer reading list for my daughter's current school online, but just looked up the list for our public school. For juniors, in addition to memoirs by both Obama and McCain, and a number of other books, there are two selections by John Grisham. I'm somewhat surprised that he make the list twice, and that there are very few "classics" on the list.
Here is another request for a topic on how you bring academic interests into everyday life, either with boys or girls or both.
Tucker, I missed your earlier ref to the yachting co. Thanks for repeating it. My current plan is to take boat lessons with the Coast Guard and a local sailing organization (we moved to Tampa from Germany) and then build up more and more experience. Thus far all I have to go on is my dad's 14-ft sailboat when I was growing up and a summer as a lifeguard where teaching people to sail sunfish and giving swimming tests in 50-degree water were all in my responsibility.
Probably won't surprize anyone, but I fully support expanding literature requirements far beyond the dead white guys' canon.
saacnmama,
Most very experienced sailors (not that I'm one of them) will tell you that familiarity sailing as small a boat as possible is the best training for handling the bigger ones. The smaller ones allow you to gain an instinctive feel for all the elements and forces in a way that no 35-footer ever will.
I am laughing at the idea of Morrison or Hurston being "trendy diversity" authors. They ARE the canon, people.
To Honolulu mother
This is way off topic but I'm looking to take a trip to Maui. Part of my trip means going from Maui (Kahului) to the Big island (Kona).
I'm taking Hawaiian Air and was wondering if you knew how they were about keeping their flight schedules. I’m booked my flight kind of close with a tour I’m doing for Mauna Kea Summit. I’m supposed to arrive in Kona for 12pm and be at the pick-up point for 3pm.
What have you heard about Hawaiian Air for inter-island travel and is there a better way to get from island to island? From what I understand the Super Ferry is closed. Thanks :-)
Will anyone be reading Morrison 50 years from now?
Or Maya Angelou?
The canon includes literature that stands the test of time, not works chosen because their author satisfies some demographic niche.
We need 200 comments, just wanted to even out the number
Anonymous @ 9:31
I would absolutely take the bet that people will be reading Morrison/Angelou/baldwin etc... in 50 years. From a purely cynical perspective, since it is really what you're getting at, there will be more brown people in the world, and likely the US will be a much more even ratio, and they will want to read about experiences that more closely mirror their own, and that shaped their parents etc... From a more rational perspective, the only people who are really afraid of learning about others are those who need to feel superior. Because, for example, an African American woman born in the deeply segregated South in the early part of the 20th century who not only survived but thrived, grew and became successful can't possibly have a more compelling story to tell than Jane Austen is really not that hard to imagine. I love Austen...and I love Walker as well...
I have to say that supposed left wing and right wing posters like kaleberg and allboys agree on the thought that only old departed white man's literature is worthy of being called a classic/canon does not surprise me. This is why I am cynical people. Even left wing people are still bound by their preconceived notion of race. Case in point, when kaleberg thinks that german/russian cuisine (shudder) is one of the best in world, eve ahead of American while completely ignoring asian/south asian cuisine.
Although I have not read the so called minority authors that some of the posters have referred to, if Jane Austen's works can be considered classics ( and I really do love her works), then why not these authors? As someone put it, Austen is a glorified romance novelist after all. I have read and loved "when things fall apart" and that can certainly be considered a classic. How about translations of works from china, india and other countries that have rich literary traditions?
Lets get out of own microcosm. We live in a colorful world of people of different shades from fair to black. But above all, each place brings its own rich cultural nuance to its literary works and including them in your to read list will do you much good that just sticking to so called classics written by dead white men.
Well, Morrison's "Beloved" won the Pulitzer 22 years ago and it's still a relevant, important book (not b/c Morrison is black, but b/c she's among her generation's most brilliant writers). Hurston's books are a lot older and still relevant. I don't quite see your point about standing the test of time.
"they will want to read about experiences that more closely mirror their own, and that shaped their parents etc… "
But that's the point. Great literature is suppose to transcend race and gender classifications. You don't have to be a Russian man to appreciate Crime and Punishment. You don't have to be an upper-class British woman to enjoy Pride and Prejudice. But many of the works on various english lit syllabi and high school summer reading lists are clearly aimed at having one from Column A (female), one from Column B (oppressed minority), one from Column C (female oppressed minority), and one from Column D (someone the students can "identify" with).
My favorite english class ever (and it is my least favorite subject) was my 9th grade class where you had the option to just read books from the list and you had to answer two obscure questions in a quiz at the end of the week to prove you read it. I think I read 45 books that year - some of it was repeats like Great Gatsby and Mark Twain and some it caused me to branch out to new authors. I don't understand why Gatsby is read so often....to me it does not have any meaning and I would rather read Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Zora Neale Hurston any day. And yet I read Gatsby every year for 3-4 years in a row. The other book I think is not exceptional and over used is The Outsiders.
I think most of my truly wonderful english teachers would be attorneys if they were going to college today.
Anonymous @ 9:41 - but the discussion wasn't about reading for enjoyment, it was about reading materials for the intellectual experience. I love Jennifer Weiner books for their enjoyment, but I don't think they are appropriate for an english literature class. to be clear, I posted the quote you reference as the cynincal perspective, but there is a non-cynical perspective to the issue. In the books listed above, there is almost no representation that is non-white, except in subserviant roles and usually under-developed characters. without making any judgement as to the deliberatenes of this or not, it remains a fact. Why is it that when wwoman, or people of color want to see themselves realistically portrayed or represented, in the spectrum of their existence, that is perceived as a bad thing. or somehow diminishing the current perspectives available? Perhaps the reason their are selections from columns A-D is because the teacher/administration etc... recognize that just as you don't have to be a Russian man to appreciate Crime and Punishment, you don't have to be a Haitian girl to appreciate Krik Krak or a slave or even the descendant of a slave to appreciate Beloved etc... Any mother who loves her children will see some of herself in Sethe etc...
"A son wrote:?
"Why is it that when wwoman, or people of color want to see themselves realistically portrayed or represented, in the spectrum of their existence, that is perceived as a bad thing. or somehow diminishing the current perspectives available?"
Because, in many cases, the books written by these authors are added to lists BECAUSE of their gender or race, not necessarily because the book represents a significant contribution to the canon on its own merits?
The Outsiders is a perfect example of a book that will vanish from the reading lists in the next 20 years.
"The Outsiders is a perfect example of a book that will vanish from the reading lists in the next 20 years."
The Outsiders isn't some trendy new book. It's almost 45 years old, for God's sake - it's more than stood the test of time. No, it's not Pulitzer material but it is a book that, for whatever reason, is beloved by pre-teens and teenagers. It's culturally important. Ditto the work of Paul Zindel, Judy Blume, Steven King, etc. I don't think these are books that should be assigned because they're easy, pleasurable reads that don't need any instruction to go with it (unlike, say, Jane Austen or Dickens). That they're easy to read doesn't mean they should be stuffed in the dustbin of history, however.
I love fine literature as much as the next person, but I will be happy as a clam if my children elect to read in their spare time. Assigning kids a Donne/Tolstoy/Joyce-only diet could alienate them from reading for pleasure for life.
?"
Judging from the sloppy spelling and questionable grammar of many of the posters, among them the two posted above, I think the argument that reading comprehension has gotten more challenging is laughable.
Notwithstanding the old joke that HAL stands for Hawaiian Always Late, it's actually got very solid on-time arrival stats. And in my own experience as well, Hawaiian's been reliable and I can assume it'll get in when it's supposed to when planning flight time versus appointment time. The more likely delay factor for you would be driving time -- where is the pickup spot for your Mauna Kea tour? And are you supposed to be checking in to a hotel somewhere first?
"The Outsiders isn’t some trendy new book. It’s almost 45 years old, for God’s sake - it’s more than stood the test of time."
45 years is not exactly "the test of time." This silly book is still on reading lists because the aging baby boomers who come up with these lists are still enamored with its trendiness. Get back to me in another 20 years. Or 50.
Stay golden, Pony Boy.
The definitions are silly. Its like antique furniture from the 60's, really? That old piece of formica cra*??
What about the bible? Now there is an oldie but goodie!
4:03: Fine. Enjoy re-reading the Odyssey.
I grew up in the town where Outsiders was written, went to that drive-in, hung out at the river, and knew all the guys in the soc-greaser rumble in the movie version. So I loved when my daughter had to read that book, but alas, she never loved it like I did. I will say I was very surprised to find it as assigned reading.
The pick up point is at Lanihau Center (Buns in the Sun) a little after 3pm. My flight is scheduled to depart Kahului at 12:00 and arrive in Kona at 12:30.
I’m staying at the Kona Seaside, which is right next to the pick up point.
I’m very much looking forward to my trip. It’s something I’ve wanted to do since I was a kid and I figured turning 30 was a good enough reason to do it :-)
What about the bible? Now there is an oldie but goodie!
Do you really want to go down this path?
Then again, maybe it's not the book so much as the folks who claim to have read it.
So figure about an hour to get your rental and get to Kailua where your hotel is given the typical traffic in that area -- traffic can be bad between the airport and Kailua, but it doesn't sound like you'll be at a peak time and anyway I've never found it nearly as bad as the Honolulu traffic I deal with every day. That still leaves you an hour and a half, which should be plenty of time to check in and get to your pick-up point, even if you're delayed a little longer than expected somewhere along the line. Enjoy your Mauna Kea visit! I hope you're not prone to altitude sickness, but if you are just remember that it'll pass soon after you come back down the mountain.
It does put my mind at ease hearing you provide some first hand insight. I already promised myself that if something did go wrong on this trip, then I will just have to go again.
Thanks for the encouragement Honolulu mother :-)
Letting your children fail is one of the things in my opinion that we must do in order to let them learn the most. Children learn better when they fail. We, as parents can then educate our children about what they have done and how to not repeat this later on. This is the real test, to not repeat a disaster. If my son decides to blow all his money on a laptop, then I will give him reasons why he should not do it, but if he still decides to blow all his money, then he will learn the results of that decision later. We must teach our children how to be better financially to enable a more prosperous future.
If we went in to get Al Qaeda, and our operations seem to be only against Afghans. We are at war with Al Qaeda where ever it goes we should after them, if we did not consider sovereignty of Afghanistan when Taliban ONLY harbored Al’ Qaeda- we should not consider Pakistan’s sovereignty over the autonomous Pashtun highlands even though we have evidence the Pakistani ISI/Army/Air force helped Al Qaeda with weapon storage, travel, safe havens, and intel (aside from the fact military establishment had advance knowledge and hand in the 911 tragedy). Pakistani establishment can pin point terrorists to it location and is able to rid Pakistan of terrorists in tribal areas within 60 days. The occasional and timed capture of high profile terrorists is part of double game policy to fool us and milk us. Sadly the war on terror has become a war on Afghanistan/Afghans, why are we not going after Al Qaeda..
Hello,
I just visited the site and I wondered ifyou have an iphone app? I think that If you offered an iPhone app, you could get your content or info about your products/services to a captive audience and take advantage of the mobile explosion. I build out iPhone/android apps from web content inexpensively, and some apps I've done have had upwards of 100,000 downloads. The ability to be ON a persons mobile device gives you direct access to them and can be invaluable. Not llike email where you are one in a sea of millions. This can be done very inexpensively. People are at the computer a lot but they carry their phone 24-7
If you are interested I can give you an idea what I can do and a quick quote.

The hunt will be closed at 8 p.m. Friday in Zones 2 and 4, both of which are in far northeast Wisconsin. The agency reported that as of Thursday, hunters had killed 18 wolves in Zone 2, where the quota is 20 animals, and four wolves in Zone 4, where the quota is five wolves.
Kurt Thiede, DNR Lands Division administrator, said the agency initiated the closure process in the two zones prior to the quotas being reached because it anticipates an increase in the number of wolves being killed during the gun deer season, which begins Saturday at dawn.
Hunting continues in the state's four other zones, but Thiede said the agency is keeping a close eye on Zone 1 in northwest Wisconsin and in Zone 5 in central Wisconsin and urged hunters planning to hunt in those zones to check with the agency before heading to the field. The agency is announcing closures through news releases and on the agency's website at dnr.wi.gov. Also, hunters who want to double-check on whether a particular zone is open can call 1-855-299-9653.
The zones were established to allow the agency to track the progress of the hunt and regulate the number of wolves killed in particular areas of the state. Quotas were set higher in areas where there have been more problems with wolves killing livestock.
Statewide, hunters had killed 77 wolves as of Thursday. The statewide quota is 116 wolves.
"Wisconsin population studies, Wydeven said, have shown that 9 percent to 19 percent of the state's wolves are killed illegally each year, 10 percent are killed in depredation control programs, and 3 percent to 4 percent are killed by vehicles."
I figure that the wolf haters are doin' just fine, thank you very much.
Up to nearly 20% of the state's wolves killed illegally - before the legal hunt/trap?
and some scientists say that the hunt may INCREASE depredation by wolves, by upsetting their "family values" social structure. Maybe humans will make their OWN situation worse, out of fear and hatred.
"I think people are going to look back at this and it will have become a textbook example of how not to hold a hunt," David said.
Not that the same things happens when we invade other countries of humans or anything...like for their oil, or copper, or bananas, or strategic location in the world...

I adore the botanical! Sleek, yet organic. Would be great for an elegant dubbed party or a quiet breakfast with the hubby.

Obeisance to the perfect Marpa.
I am the Yogi who perceives the Ultimate Truth.
In the Origin of the Unborn, I first gain assurance;
On the Path of Non-extinction, slowly
I perfect my pwer;
With meainingful symbols and words
Flowing from my great compassion,
I now sing this song
From the absolute realm of Dharma Essence.
Because your sinful Karma has created
Dense blindness and impenetrable obstruction,
You cannot understand the meaning
Of Ultimate Truth.
Listen, therefore, to the Expedient Truth.
In their spotless, ancient Sutras,
All the Buddhas in the past, repeatedly
Admonished with the eternal Truth of Karma —
That every sentient being is one’s kinsman.
This is eternal Truth which never fails.
Listen closely to the teaching of Compassion.
I, the Yogi who developed by his practices,
Know that outer hindrances are but a shadow-show,
And the phantasmal world
A magic play of mind unborn.
By looking inward into the mind is seen
Mind-nature — without substance, intrinsically void.
Through meditation in solitude, the grace
Of the Succession Gurus and the teaching
Of the great Naropa are attained.
The inner truth of the Buddha
Should be the object of meditation.
By the gracious instruction of my Guru,
Is the abstruse inner meaning of Tantra understood.
Through the practice of Arising and
Perfecting Yoga,
Is the Vital Power engendered
And the inner reason for the microcosm realized.
Thus in the outer world I do not fear
The illusory obstacles.
To the Great Divine Lineage I belong,
With innumberable yogis great as all Space.
When in one’s own mind one ponders
On the original state of Mind,
Illusory thoughts of themselves dissolve
Into the Realm of Dharmadhatu.
Neither afflicter nor afflicted can be seen.
Exhaustive study of the Sutras
Teaches us no more than this.

From stereotypical depictions of transsexuals on talk shows to the buff gay men of the Real World, television continues to shape the manner in which American culture understands, oppresses, and embraces members of the LGBT community. This course will probe the complex relationship that television has to the production of sexuality and its reception by viewing audiences. Mediating Queerness evolves in three significant manners during the semester. First, it examines competing theories of sexuality and visibility, concentrating on various perspectives of mediated identity. Second, it focuses specifically on how television is used as a form of disciplining sexual minorities. Finally, the class emphasizes how media can be used productively, in the service of queer identities and the freedoms that they advocate.

I wrote this month's column online. Normally I use Microsoft Word or OpenOffice, but the hard drive on my main laptop computer crashed and though all my document files are backed up, it will take some time to reinstall my applications. Before installing Microsoft Office 2007, and because I am on deadline, I thought I would try to write this column using online office tools. While I was at it, I figured, why not write about Google's online office tools themselves?
The first surprise is the many Save options under the File menu, including an option to save as HTML, which reveals the fact that under the hood this is a WYSIWYG HTML editor. You can also save in Word, OpenOffice, or PDF documents. Saving as HTML actually saves as XHTML. This means it is also XML, and Google might someday become a leader in structured XML authoring. (Pleasant surprise two: The HTML code created by Google Documents is wonderfully free of the mass of worthless tags in HTML files generated by Microsoft Word.)
Google Documents has a strong revision history, noting changes made by different contributors. I can invite my editor to collaborate online, at which point she can see how my column has evolved. With a click she can revert to earlier versions.
On the down side, Google Documents can count words in a document as a whole, but can't count words in selected paragraphs. It insists on counting everything, including outtake text that I've decided to leave out of the final version of my column, URLs for links in the online version, or any other extraneous material.
Google Spreadsheets was adequate for simple jobs, but lacking the powerful math functions of Excel. There are many other efforts to create web-based spreadsheet services, and even complete office suites. Important spreadsheets are EditGrid (developed in Hong Kong by Team and Concepts, but recently moved to servers in North America), iRows (shut down on New Year's Eve of 2006 when its two founders were hired by Google), ThinkFree (a Korean tool that uses a Java applet to provide more powerful functions), Dan Bricklin's wikiCalc (written in Perl by the inventor of VisiCalc, the first PC-based spreadsheet ever), and Zoho Sheet, part of the Zoho Office Suite, perhaps the most ambitiously comprehensive of the new web-application packages.
Google's new initiative, Google Apps for Your Domain, which will likely change the software strategy in many organizations, includes several other web applications including Gmail, Google Talk (Instant Messaging), Google Calendar, and Google Page Creator. Page Creator can be used by small organizations to create websites, which of course are hosted by Google. Talk and Calendar provide great support for collaborative efforts in organizations with more than one physical location.
My favorite Google App is the custom version of Gmail. My personal Gmail account has always been better than my ISP email at blocking spam. Now I have a beta Google App account that uses my domain name (instead of gmail.com) but runs on Google's servers. When you send email to editor@cmsreview.com, my mail exchange records point to the Gmail IP address.
An individual's Google Apps () are unified with a common entry point called a Google Start Page, which is a mini-portal with Reuters news, financial information from CNN, weather reports, sticky notes, and surprisingly, no Google ads. Instead, ads show up on individual apps. I found the ads on my Gmail page quite interesting as they were matched to the content of my email traffic. All these beta tests show that Google is working its way toward a huge suite with capabilities that go beyond what those suites that are limited to the desktop can offer. Will Microsoft get serious about online collaboration before Google eats its lunch in the web-enabled market?
As we go to press with this column, Google has announced Google Apps, including a Premier edition that will cost $50 per year after April 30. I am surprised that with all their smarts they didn't come up with a more powerful and less techy name, at least something obvious like… Google Office. I am still mailing Word docs to my editor, but now they are just backup copies of my online Google Docs, which she can share online. Will she? Stay tuned.Web sites just to a single mobile site rather than the full range of mobile equivalents;
Using video that plays on PCs but not mobile devices, for example by relying on Adobe Systems' Flash Player;
And showing mobile users an error page instead of the PC-optimized page in cases where there's no mobile-optimized site.
The search-results incentive is a powerful one that Google can offer, especially as mobile search increases in importance. In its effort to offer search results that satisfy users rather than frustrate them, it's also taken measures such as emphasizing page-load speeds..
Here we are back again with out basic butterfly and some particles. This time we're going to aim for having our butterfly on each particle, but we'd like to have our butterfly animating with a different wing position on each particle. So let's see what we can do about that. The first thing that we've to do is we have to select a wing. We're going to have to go into Animate > Create Animation Snapshot. I know I have 40 frames of animation on each wing.
I'm going to do it Increment of 2. So I am going to end up with 20 wings here. Go ahead and hit Apply and there my 20 new little wings. So then I can see them in my Outliner and in my Outliner they are called snapshotGroup1 and I can select them all, which I will do. I am going to open up my Layer Editor. I'm going to go Layers > Create Empty Layer. I'm going to Add Selected Objects to that. So if I want to I don't have to look at them.
Here they are and I am going to now open up in my Dynamic section, my Particles > Instancer (Replacement) window again. This time I want my Cycle to be Sequential. I'm going to make sure I have transform_1 through 20 on there. They're in there. I'm going to call my object instance for butterParticleShape and the Cycle is going to start on Particle ID. Go by Age. I'm going to hit Apply.
Now let's see where we've got. Look at that, a wing on every particle and they are each in a different position. Start them flapping and they are all flapping away, okay. I don't want to look at them anymore. At least I don't to look at their instance, the snapshots. Not look at that. I'm going to select this other wing right here and in the Animation section, I'm going to go Animate > Create Animation Snapshot.
Same settings as I had before. I'm going to hit Snapshot, there they are. I can go into my close up Animation snapshot1. Open up snapshot2Group. That's them. Select all of those guys. Make a new layer for them. I'm going to add those to them so I don't have to look at them if I don't want to. Open up my Particle Instancer window. I have it up on my shelf here. I am going to now hit Apply.
And low and behold, I have two wings on my butterflies. Look at that. My butterflies can move. Now I am noticing that they are gray. I'm not seeing the texture on them. So I'm going to go into Hypershade and I'm going to assign the same shader to my instanced objects, Assign Material To Selection and probably therefore, let's select all of these guys and Assign Material To Selection.
So now my butterflies all over have that same object on them. There they are and I don't have to look at those instance snapshot wings right there and I don't even want to like at that center butterfly that was the start of all this. Get rid of that one too. So I just have this little butterfly flock right here flying away. Now I might want to add a force to it. So to do that I pick in the Outliner, I'm going to go pick the particle itself that these guys are instanced to. Let's go into the Dynamics. My Fields, I'm going to just pick Uniform. Uniform Options. Let's make it like 2.
I do believe I would like it to go kind of in the Z maybe. Let's see the direction on that. Z direction, I'll make that 1, make that 0, let's apply in the Z axis, Apply and let's see what goes on here. So there are my particles are moving my butterflies and that little flock quite along. Each particle has a butterfly with a different wing position on it as they fly.
So this is kind of a very simple scene I've done that you can make wonderful animations and apply them to particles and fly your little flocks along..Energy Efficiency:

With California signing a landmark greenhouse gas emissions reduction mandate, the debate over whether a national mandate should be implemented continues. During today's OnPoint California Energy Commissioner Art Rosenfeld discusses the need for more federal action in the transportation sector. He explains why it is not economic for California to be entirely self-sufficient in providing its residents with electricity.

While 73 per cent of corporate board members feel their boards are diverse, the reality is that women are significantly less likely than men to serve on corporate boards. In fact, most board members oppose the development and adoption of a formal diversity policy.
Pamela Jeffery, Founder of the Canadian Board Diversity Council (CBDC), says it is time for Canada's board directors to speed up the pace of change. "Directors whose boards have re-defined diversity believe they make better board decisions as a result of this diversity," Jeffery explains. "That's because important, diverse perspectives on customers, international markets and stakeholders that were once missing are now being represented. This helps avoid groupthink and leads to better discussion and an improved ability for directors to carry out their director responsibilities and increase shareholder value."
The Second Annual Report Card examines the representation of women on the boards of Canada's Top 100 charities and Canada's 500 largest corporations as measured by assets in five sectors: utilities; finance and insurance; retail trade; manufacturing; and mining, quarrying, oil and gas. The Founding and Corporate Members of the CBDC, 46 leading Canadian organizations, initiated the project to encourage greater diversity within the boardrooms of the country.
"Organizations with diverse boards are often better at innovation and decision making, which can enhance their competitiveness," says Anne Golden, President and CEO, The Conference Board of Canada, a sponsor of the Second Annual Report Card.
Based on the results, the CBDC has issued a call to action to ensure Corporate Canada reflects the diversity of the broader Canadian population. "It will take courage and enlightened leadership to change the composition of Canada's boards," Jeffery says. "With the large number of directors retiring over the next five years, now is the time for action."
The Council calls on boards to replace at least one of every three retiring directors with a director of a diverse background, and Nominating/Governance Committees to consider three board-ready diverse candidates for each open seat.
Key findings of the survey include:
- Women hold the greatest percentage of corporate board seats (1 in 5) in the utilities; finance and insurance; and retail trade sectors. Discouragingly, only 9.7 per cent of women, or 1 in 10, hold board seats in the manufacturing sector. Only 1 in 15 board seats (or 6.6 per cent) in mining, oil and gas sectors are held by women.
- An overwhelming majority of male and female board members say board diversity is an important issue. Still, 59 per cent of corporate board members continue to oppose the development or adoption of a formal diversity policy.
- Charity board members tend to value diversity more than corporate board members (61 per cent versus 47 per cent) with women representing 40 per cent of board seats at Canada's largest 100 charities. Still, 48 per cent of charity board members do not support a formal diversity policy.
- The CBDC's first-ever review of age and language skills reveals 73 per cent of board members learned English as their first language. Board members bring a significant number of years of experience to their boards: 42 per cent are 60-years-old or older.
- Two thirds of Top 500 corporate board members have international business experience with a significantly larger portion of males (61 per cent of males versus 41 per cent of females) with international experience.
"Studies have consistently shown that a diverse team - which includes both visible differences such as gender and ethnicity, as well invisible difference, such as diversity of thought and education - can have significant impact on both the top and bottom lines of an organization. Having a diverse board is just as important as having a diverse staff. In fact, it's the key to success," says Michael Bach, Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at KPMG LLP, a sponsor of the Second Annual Report Card.
The Report Card presents the findings of a survey of nearly 400 directors in Canada's largest corporations and top charities. The research was conducted in partnership with KPMG, The Conference Board of Canada and The Beedie School of Business.
The CBDC will undertake its next corporate director survey of Canada's Top 500 organizations in the spring of 2012 and report on the progress made in the 24 months since the Council's first Report Card which reported on Canada's Top 500 organizations in 2010.
The 2011 Annual Report Card is available at:
Survey Methodology
The Conference Board of Canada undertook the survey on behalf of The Canadian Board Diversity Council. The survey was distributed in July 2011 to 1,733 Charity Board Chairs and Directors and 2,444 Corporate Board Chairs and Directors. An individual serving as a director of two boards received two surveys. The survey was completed by 218 charity board members and 164 Top 500 corporate board members, for a total of 382 people. No individual companies or board members were identified. Results of the survey are accurate within +/-4.92 per cent at a 95 per cent confidence level.
About the Canadian Board Diversity Council
The Canadian Board Diversity Council (CBDC) is the leading Canadian organization advancing diversity on Canada's boards. The Council's vision is to improve the diversity of Canada's corporate boards by increasing the representation of women, visible minorities, Aboriginal Peoples, including First Nations, Inuit and Métis, persons with disabilities and members of the LGBT community over the next five years.
URL:I lay in my bedroom with my iPod glued to my ears...It was not
easy being who I was, not in the least bit easy...I was always
having to hide, "No one can EVER find out who I am" I whisper to
myself... "My ears, my tail, my claws, my teeth, everything...no
one will ever understand"
My parents were out of town, and my babysitter was hopelessly old and confused...she thought I was a large house cat, "Heh" I scoffed, "Ironic" and then I fell asleep, dreams filled with worry and doubt.
When I finally woke up it was the next day, Saturday, I groan and flip out of bed landing lightly on my feet, it wasn't so bad all the time, I could flatten my ears down and cover them with my hair, the teeth weren't to big a problem, the claws...well lets just say no one can ever catch me without nail clippers in my pocket, its just the darn tail...I end up wrapping it around my waist like a belt, "Oh my god, I look like such a dork...who wears big round fuzzy belts?" but I never mind it and decide to take a walk, I need to stretch my legs.
I was walking downtown and bumped into someones back, "OH! Sorry!" and I quickly dodge them and continue walking, "Oh man" I say to myself "I was really zoned out." Someone grabbed my shoulder, immediately my instincts kick in and I spin around grabbing the persons wrist and nailing them to the ground, my heart rate accelerated increasingly in order to give enough energy to finish a fight, but I get a good look at the person, since our faces are practically inches apart, I quickly scan the face of my attacker...he was a guy about my age, with brown messy hair curling seemingly randomly, he was incredible attractive,
"Wow" he said, "Ummmm....you dropped this when I bumped into you" and with his free hand he held up a pair of nail clippers.
"OH!" I blush deep crimson and quickly grab the clippers and hiding them in my pocket "Thanks." I jumped up and nervously pat down my curious ears, the guy stood up and rubbed his red inflamed wrist
"Ow" he simple said I didn't think it possible but I blushed some more.
"Oh I'm sorry! You scared me is all...." he chuckled
"Well I'll be sure to never do that again...my names Will"
"Oh" my feeling uncomfortable, Ive never really socialized this much...embarrassing..."My name's Kate." Will smiled,
"Thats a pretty name, but I think you're much prettier." I cover my face to hide the huge kitty fanged smile
"No one's ever said that before" I think to myself, "Ummmm" I say, hands still plastered to my face "Thank you very much...but I really need to go" I turn to leave and WHAM! Straight into a lamppost I let out a small squeak and pray that Will didn't see that, but I heard a chuckle and knew he did, without turning back to look at him I uncovered my face and ran back home as fast as I could "See Kate?!? See what happens when you try to be normal?!" I scold myself all the way back home and fell on my bed exhausted and crying, turning up the radio I fell asleep again to the sound of music...--Her Diamonds falling down, cuz i can't help her kno-o-ow~
Waking up was horrible, my eyes where dry and crusty from crying, and my tail was left wrapped in my jeans and it hurt A LOT, I took a refreshing shower and dried off, then I put on some new clothes and walked out the front door..."This time I'll be much more aware"...and I cringed remembering the other day, finally I came to the park, old people walked their dogs here, most stopped to growl at me as their owners apologized and pulled them away. That was pretty much it, but no one was there today. I sat on the bench and sighed
"This is so boring" I muttered, leading my head fall backwards as I watched the clouds, my stiff tail attempting to flick around. Suddenly, I heard footsteps and turned around to see a couple guys dragging a little kid into the park and beating him up, "Hey!" I shout "STOP!" The guys turn and look at me, a smirk on their ugly faces, they start to stride over to me, "Damn they have bats" I think to myself, wide eyed. I kept focused on them as the little kid ran off to another boy. I hadn't even realized it had been Will. I heard the faint muttering of the two boys as I backed slowly up.
"Haiden! are you OK?" Will grabbed his little brother and embraced him, "I'm fine Will, just a couple scrapes. She's the one that's in trouble" He pointed over to me "She distracted those guys and told them to leave me alone. They have bats Will, and they could really hurt her!" Will face turned pale "That girl..." he whispered "Thats...Kate"
Meanwhile, I was almost oblivious to the boys, having still not realized who it was and more focused on the guys coming at me with bats. I gave a low hiss as I glanced over to see if the boys had fled, I didn't see them, so I let myself go. My heartbeat quickened, my ears flipped up, my tail angrily whipped the air behind me, my fingers cracked as I clenched and unclenched my fist, I bared my teeth and let out a hideous snarl
"Get back!" I ordered the guys, but they just stared at me, then a look of disgust came over their faces
"Oh my god" one of them said, "That thing is disgusting!"
"So? Kinda cute, I thinks, besides we've raped worst than that" he licked his lips and took a step towards me.
"that THING is disgusting" Those words hurt...they always did...but I turned the hurt right back around and turned it into raw fury, I screamed, jumping at the closest man, claws raking his face ripping his cheek wide open, the man fell to his knees howling in pain, I stared at him in horror and then looked at my bloody hand..."Did...did I really just do that?" I whisper just then a bat met my skull, and I fell to the ground holding my head and receiving blows to the stomach and back, it was true that I was strong, but those bats still leave giant bruises, all of a sudden the deathly blows stopped and I opened my eyes just a bit, there was Will, and that kid, both of them had the guy's bats in their hands and were waving them madly. Will's bat hit one of the guys in the head, and being a human, the guy fell to the ground in a faint, the third guy met the same fate, and once the chaos was finally over, Will ran over to me and picked me up in his arms, my head still hurt and I felt a extremely dizzy. "he's so warm" I mumbled, not realizing it was loud enough for Will to hear, and I passed out...
I woke up to an icepack on my head, "Whaddappin?" I mumbled, I was laying on my back, and didn't recognize the house I was in, I tried to sit up but realized that Will's arms were wrapped around me, "Oh" I said softly, he looked like he was asleep. "Oh" I said again "He's so cute, especially when he's asleep..." I smile bashfully "I wonder what it's like to kiss someone?" I wonder out loud, "His lips look very soft..." I say softly then I quickly shake my head "Oh no no I'm being silly." Thats when I realize that every bit of my true self is showing, ears, teeth, tail, claws, EVERYTHING "Oh no." I say, starting to panic "He knows! I gotta get out of here!" I try to twist out of his arms but they tighten,
"Don't go" he whispers, eyes still closed "I really like you." he mutters "And do you still want to kiss me?" I gasp
"YOU WERE AWAKE?!" he finally opened his eyes and chuckled,
"Yes I was, you're not upset are I?" I was speechless "You can't tell anyone!" I burst "NOBODY! Understand me? They call me a freak, they think I'm disgusting and" I twisted out of his grip "I bet you are no different. You think I'm a monster too." Will's face turned serious, as he held tighter.
"You're no monster Kate, you saved my brother, you're a sweet person, you're beautiful, I would NEVER call you a monster. I will beat down anyone who tries to mess with my kitten" My eyes get big in shock
"Y...your kitten?" I whisper.
"Yes" he whispered "My sweet little Kitty, you're an amazing girl Kate. I may not know you well, yet, though I will change that, I'm sure you deserve to feel normal if you really want to. I can help you. I love you very much already Kate." he pulled me close and pressed his lips against mine "Will you be my kitten, Kate?"
I blush so hard that they had to create a new shade of red, "I will be your kitten" I whisper "If you will love me the way all kittens should be loved."
"I promise" Will said, as I fell asleep in his arms again. Too exhausted...feeling too safe to want to leave yet.

Add to reading listRight now, I don't think I have the words to properly convey what it was like to launch Seven Spoons the book. My book. Please bear with me, as I try.
The launch happened in stages. Last night, some of my nearest and dearest gathered at Ben McNally Books in Toronto. (If you've never been, please go. It is an utterly charming space, straight out of Harry Potter in the best way, all wood and warm lighting. And Ben is even better.) I had to make a speech. I did so with my sons and nephews nearby — they stole the show. And, even though I had the distinct sensation of my windpipe vibrating while I spoke, looking out onto that room of people, shaking or not, I felt exceptionally lucky.
We had cheese from St. Lawrence Market with pickled strawberries, charcuterie, and chocolate chip cookies. There were a few rolls of Instax film (evidence, here), and bubbles and oysters around the corner to end the night with Nikole, Michael, and Julia. There again, that lucky feeling.
Today was a blur; interviews and tastings, and a lot of excitement. A highlight was when some readers took time out of their day to come and say hello. It is because of all of your that I have this opportunity in the first place. So, to share this day with you feels right.
Very quickly, there's something else to share — a recipe from the book, and the one I may crave the most. It's my Vietnamese Coffee Ice Cream, swirled with espresso caramel and topped with candied cacao nibs. It is no secret that I love ice cream. I announced the book with one, so launching it with another lines up nicely. I'm also quite a fan of coffee. Thus, putting them together was inevitable, and condensed milk in the mixture sealed the deal. I describe it in detail below.
For now I'll sign off, with gratitude. Here's to you, with ice cream.
By the by, a few people and places have written about Seven Spoons. If you'd like to read their thoughts, here they are:
- I spent a day cooking with Chris Nutall-Smith, talking about the book, butter tarts, and inspiration, while sipping on some Palomas. It was a good time. (The Globe and Mail)
- Deb declared the Mushrooms and Greens on Toast a "one-pan miracle" and I don't think I could hope for higher praise. (Smitten Kitchen)
- Heidi makes the case for green smoothies, with my Default Smoothie with kale, pineapple, and nut butter to make her point. (101 Cookbooks)
- Sara, a person I consider an expert on Huevos Rancheros, gave her stamp of approval to my Huevos a la Plaza de Mercado, and I couldn't be more chuffed. (Sprouted Kitchen)
- I was so happy to once again appear on Design*Sponge's "In the Kitchen With ..." series, this time with my Esquites and Yellow Tomato Gazpacho. Sincere thanks to Grace and Kristina. (Design*Sponge)
- Food52 asked me to write about the inspiration behind the book, and I was honoured to oblige. (Food52)
- Epicurious calls my Chicken with a Punchy relish a knockout, in a pun I appreciate. (Epicurious)
- Ashley made the Roast Chicken with a Punchy Relish, and used lentils as the base. Brilliant. (Not Without Salt)
- Shauna and Danny prepared a gluten-free feast from the book, including their adaptation of the Bee-stung Fried Chicken, and naan. (Gluten-free Girl and the Chef)
- Olga made the Lentil Kofta Curry, and some thoughtful words about community. (Sassy Radish)
- Julie's Bee-Stung Fried Chicken (+ her fritters!) look brilliant. (Dinner with Julie)
- ... and Julie invited me to her other site to talk music and dinner parties.As an aside, have you seen the documentary It Might Get Loud? I found it fascinating. (Rolling Spoon)
- Vy posted a detailed and thoughtful look at a whole collection of recipes. (Beyond Sweet and Savoury)
- Shelley also discussed the book as a whole, and then featured the Fattoush with Fava Beans and Labneh. (Cookbooks 365)
- My publishers invited some new-to-me bloggers to the launch last night, and I am so glad they did! Nikki and Christine were firecrackers. So fun. (Nikki the Knack and Padfoot's Library)
VIETNAMESE COFFEE ICE CREAM
Indians make something they call espresso, which I've talked about before, but it’s unlike any espresso you’d see in Italy; it’s actually closer to a Greek frappé, a bold brew of instant coffee whipped with an enthusiastic amount of sugar, and then combined with hot water and milk. The slurry magically blends, then splits, with a layer of thick foam above a rich, creamy elixir below.
I’ve been a longtime fan of that coffee, so when I was first introduced the Vietnamese version, a drink with very much the same uncompromising intensity, the same weighty, toasted, caramel flavor, this time tempered with sweetened condensed milk, I was lost. When I decided to freeze it, well then things got even better.
This is my full-stop favorite ice cream, both to make, and to eat. It is brazenly prepared without a traditional custard base, which isn’t missed in the least, and skipping that step makes it quick work to pull together. A voluptuous mix of evaporated milks and cream gets infused with ground coffee, then chilled, churned and swirled with caramel. Easy peasy, that's that, and you’re left with an ice cream worthy of any and all accolades. Have a spoon at the ready.
Makes about 1 quart
Ingredients
- 1 (14-ounce/400g) tin evaporated milk
- 1 (14-ounce/400g) tin sweetened condensed milk
- 1 cup heavy (35%) cream
- 2 ounce (57 g) coffee beans, ground, see note
- Seeds scraped from 1 vanilla bean, or 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- A good pinch of salt
To Serve or Swirl
- Espresso caramel and/or Candied Cocao Nibs, recipes follow
Method
Combine all the ice cream ingredients in a medium saucepan set over medium heat. Cook, whisking often, until the mixture begins to steam. Remove from the heat and leave to steep for 20 minutes.
Using a fine-meshed sieve, or a standard sieve lined with cheesecloth or a coffee filter, strain the mixture into a bowl. Cover and chill for 3 hours, but preferably overnight. Freeze the base according to your ice cream maker’s manufacturer’s directions.
Spoon 1/3 of the ice cream into a storage container. Smooth the top, and pour over a few tablespoons of caramel in long stripes. With the tip of a knife, lightly swirl the caramel into the ice cream. Layer in half of the remaining ice cream, and repeat the layers two more times, ending with a drizzle of caramel. There will be caramel left over. Set this aside. Cover the ice cream and freeze for at least 6 hours.
Serve as is, or in a sugar cone, or scattered with candied cacao nibs. Then, dive in.
Note: The coffee beans should be medium ground. Café Du Monde French Roast Chicory is the traditional choice for the hot preparation that inspired this cold one. For a milder, rounded flavor, use 2 tablespoons of instant espresso powder or 3 tablespoons instant coffee powder instead of ground beans.
Chocolate fudge can take the place of the caramel.
Masala Chai variation: Replace the coffee with 2 tablespoons black tea such as Darjeeling, a short cinnamon stick, 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger and 1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom and 3 peppercorns. Omit the espresso in the caramel, or omit the swirl entirely.
ESPRESSO CARAMEL
Makes about 2/3 cup
Ingredients
- 1/2 cup (106 g) dark brown sugar, packed
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons corn syrup
- 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) heavy cream
- 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon finely-ground espresso beans or espresso powder
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Method
In a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high, heat the brown sugar, corn syrup, butter and salt, stirring until the butter is melted. Pour in heavy cream and espresso beans. Bring to a boil, whisking until smooth and the sugar is dissolved. Lower the heat and simmer, undisturbed, for 1 minute longer. Remove from the stove and stir in the vanilla. Set aside to cool, stirring occasionally. If making ahead of time, cover and refrigerate until needed, then rewarm gently before using.
Note: Any leftover caramel can be used on pound cake, or plain ice cream, or stirred into a milkshake or warm milk. Those sips can be made all the more warming with a share of whisky.
CANDIED CACAO NIBS
Makes approximately 1/2 cup
Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup (43 g) cacao nibs
- 1/2 teaspoon unsalted butter

Tributes to racing legend Sir Henry Cecil
The racing world is mourning the loss of one of its-all time greats, the trainer Sir Henry Cecil, who's died of cancer at the age of 70.
His career at Newmarket spanned more than 40 years; his list of achievements is remarkable. He trained 25 classic winners and coached the legendary Frankel to 14 straight wins.
But to those who knew him he was far more than a list of achievements, he's been described as one of the most loved people in the sport.

Psych was humming along in its seventh season but the writing seemed to be on the wall for the comedy when it came to Season Eight. Season Seven's episodes were delayed in airing and the eighth season originally had an eight episode run that was extended to ten. The show's creative team seemed to sense they were leaving and the season reflected this, but several weeks after the first episode aired the network made it official, but at least the show went out with a nice and tidy package.
The gang returns for one more bite at the apple, with Shawn (James Roday, The Dukes of Hazzard) and Gus (Dule Hill, The West Wing) still going strong. However, Shawn's girlfriend Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson, Pleasantville) who works with the police department, gets an offer to work in San Francisco and weighs the choice on whether to take it or not. Juliet has the blessing of Carlton Lassiter (Timothy Omundson, Mission: Impossible III), who is now the Chief of Police and moves there. So Shawn starts to wonder about it, consulting with Gus, and even Shawn's father (Corbin Bernsen, Major League) to determine if he should follow Juliet to the city by the bay.
Because the show knew that it was going to be in its last run, some of the lesser players (though ones certainly part of the mythology) reappear. Marlow Viccellio (Kristy Swanson, Buffy the Vampire Slayer) is Lassiter's baby mama and her recurring role goes out on a good note, and longer standing characters like the former chief Karen Vick (Kirsten Nelson, War of the Worlds). Heck, even Kurt Fuller (Midnight In Paris) who plays Woody the Coroner, gets an episode to show off Fuller's faculties as an actor.
To the credit of Psych, they were able to incorporate guest stars in its last season that either had a chance to appear in a previous episode and return for one last round, or new ones appear that bring smiles to the faces of viewers. The show's first episode of the season, "Lock, Stock, Smoking Barrels and Burton Guster's Goblet of Fire," was a pleasant mix of the Harry Potter films and the London crime films of Guy Ritchie, and includes an appearance from Vinnie Jones (of Lock, Stock fame) to boot as Shawn and Gus go to London. In another episode that the opening credits stress happened in 2006, "Remake, A.K.A. Cloudy…With a Chance of Improvement," past guests Alan Ruck, Ralph Macchio and Ray Wise (among others) reprise general roles that they had in prior seasons. Pierre Desperaux (Cary Elwes) appears in "Lock, Stock" one last time also.
The series finale in "The Break-Up" focuses on the relationship that Shawn and Gus have had lo these many years and while the season shows them not completely ready to give it up, Shawn's decision to go to San Francisco forces Gus to assess things. It is funny, it is sweet, and checks off as many boxes that Psych fans could have hoped for, including a random, out of nowhere guest star and a clever nod to another longtime star on a USA Network comedy, and is one of the more pleasing finales to a comedy in recent memory.
Ultimately, that Psych managed to wrap things up in the way they did was a testament to the easy going, light hearted nature of it. There were some slight signs that it overstayed its welcome perhaps, but it went out in the best possible way and gave everyone involved a chance to say goodbye as well. One had the sense while watching Psych was that it was an enjoyable place to work and this sense of fun came through during it, and to do so while entertaining folks in the process for as long as they were able to is a credit to those involved with it. Catch ya on the flip side, Psych.
Ten episodes spread over three discs when it comes to the final season of Psych, all presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen, all looking fine. Film grain is evident during viewing at times, and colors look natural and accurate without excessive saturation. The source material is pristine and there were no moments of artifacts or blocking that I could discern that detracted from the image, and there was no edge enhancement or noticeable tweaking done to the image in the mastering process, it looks as good as one would expect.
Dolby Digital 5.1 surround for all episodes with the results being pleasing. Dialogue is consistent and requires little compensation, and while directional effects and channel panning are scant, there are fleeting moments of low-end engagement (such as a food truck hitting a police car) that surprise, albeit pleasantly. Considering that Psych is a comedy its moments are displayed pretty much as anticipated.
The final season of Psych has enough extras to satiate devotees. Creator/show runner Steve Franks, executive producers Chris Henze and Kelly Kulchak return for "podcasts" that serve as episode specific commentaries, but one can glean early on that these are somewhat lackluster and are only entertaining when guests appear on them. Some of the guests are dry and the tracks reflect this (such as the ones with writers Todd Harthan and Carlos Jacott). There is some recall of what unfolded on the episode being watched, but otherwise these are a bunch of folks involved in a particular installment watching this and sharing some inside jokes with some occasional information sprinkled in. Andy Berman (one of the executive producers) does bring the funny on his appearances, and Hill and Roday appear as well, talk about the show, and point out some trivia to boot. The podcasts appear on eight of the ten episodes of the season.
Deleted scenes also appear on six of the show's ten episodes (8:18) and there is a music video on "Was It Something I Said?" where Hill turns in a James Brown impression of sorts and is kind of funny (3:19). The bulk of the extras are on the third disc, starting with the musical episode of Psych (1:27:11) which in and of itself is fine, albeit after seeing a swath of shows do the same thing, feels a tad tiring. There is an extended scene for the episode (1:36) and a behind the scenes look at same (5:02) where we see Franks work with the cast and interview them between takes. There is also a podcast with Franks, Henze, Kulchak, Roday, Lawson & Adam Cohen, who was responsible for the music in the episode. From there, the other extras are not bad. "I Know, You Know, That I'm No Good With Goodbyes" (13:05) includes interviews with the cast and crew on why the production is so fun to work on, and why it has lasted as long as it has. The favorite moments and guest stars are shared by the stars, along with a quick look at "A Nightmare on State Street," the zombie episode in Season Eight. A gag reel (5:24) provides the usual chuckles for the show and montages of the various dancing, ‘suck it's, lip smacks and title mash-ups round things out (6:57).
For fans of Psych, casual or harder core, one could find little fault in how Shawn, Gus and company went out in their eighth and final season, as the notoriously fan-friendly show tried to include every possible goodbye that could be mustered (Gustered?). Technically, the show remained solid to consume, and from a bonus material perspective delivered as much as it could (though the quality of content may be another matter). Definitely worth checking out if you strayed away from it, with an eye towards buying, just so you could say goodbye.Best late-night dessert
Where can I get the best dessert with a date on a Thursday night after 11:30pm?
We'll go anywhere within Manhattan, but we won't get there until 11:30pm earliest.
Price is no issue. Romantic ambiance is a plus, good cocktail is a plus, but we are most concerned with the desserts haha.
Thanks so much!
Most of the dessert bars or restaurants with interesting dessert programs will have closed by then (p*ong closes at midnight on Thursdays, Chikalicious 10:45pm, Tailor at 11:30pm, etc.).
I think your best bet is the Dessert Studio at Michel Cluizel which closes at midnight on Thursdays. It's located inside the ABC Carpet and Home Store but at night you can enter via Lucy's on 18th Street. They close at midnight. Web site:
Kyotofu is open until 1:30 according to zagat
Balthazar open until 1am according to website
Blur Ribbon Bakery only open till midnight but the bar open until 2am has a few desserts
Not too much open that late on a thursday

Box Office
Toy Story 3 did the massive business that everybody anticipated. The second animated sequel in the fifteen year old franchise should score a massive $111 million over the weekend. The Disney/Pixar film has the added bonus of showing on 3D screens, but it should also enjoy strong legs and play quite well into the summer.
The Karate Kid is kicking serious butt at the box office. The Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan film should have a weekend take of just under $29 million. By the time alarm clocks go off on Monday morning the film should have accumulated $111 million.
The A-Team will rescue about $13 million over the weekend giving the big screen adaptation of the 80s show a modest $49 million.
The Russell Brand comedy Get Him To The Greek was fourth after laughing up another $5.7 million worth of green. The film has scored just under $50 million in total.
Shrek 4 took an expected hit from Toy Story during the weekend. The ogre tale has upped its cume to $223 after grossing only $5.5 over the weekend.
Debuting in a disastrous sixth place was Warner Bros.’ Jonah Hex. The Josh Brolin/Megan Fox film managed a terrible $5.2 million. The DC adaptation is a serious misfire for the water tower studio as it’s trying to figure out what to do with its stable of comic book characters. Is it too late for Megan Fox to beg for her Transformers role back? Apparently so.
Killers took in $5 million on its third week for upping its total to nearly $40 million.
Prince of Persia hit $80 million, Maramaduke has barked up $28 million and Carrie, Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte have managed to get Sex and the City 2 up to $90 million.
Movie News
1. Miley Cyrus is attached to star in Wake for Paramount Pictures and MTV Films.
The film is an adaptation of the young-adult novel by Lisa McMann.
According to The Hollywood Reporter:
.”
Everyone needs a franchise – even aging tween-stars.
Source: THR
2. According to rumors on the “tinter-web” Louis Leterrier is attached to a film titled Gravity. Regular Screen Ranters should know that this isn’t the same project that with Alfonso Cuarón and Robert Downey Jr. This project is something else, and I’m guessing the title will change once the Downey Jr. film starts shooting in a few months.
According to Pajiba:
“Gravity is being described as a disaster film in the vein of The Day After Tomorrow meets Taken. It’s about a father who has to search for his lost child as the world stops spinning and Earth begins to lose its gravity.”
I can’t even attempt to be witty about this. It’s just… insane.
3. Speaking of Robert Downey Jr., it seems like the star is about to turn his hand to producing and directing. Downey and his wife Susan have formed their own Warner Bros. based production company called Team Downey.
The first film that they intend to bring to the big screen is Yucatan.
Yucatan was originally being developed by Hollywood legend Steve McQueen before his death. Over 1, 700 pages of notes and storyboards were discovered in a trunk belonging to McQueen after his death.
McQueen’s son Chad will also produce the film.
Team Downey is also on the lookout for directing projects for Downey.
4. Someone out there must read a lot of scripts (or at the very least treatments) for Sam Worthington. It seems that every-other day the Avatar star is attached to a new film.
This time Worthington is being courted by his Terminator Salvation director McG to star alongside Chris Pine and Reese Witherspoon in the romantic action comedy This Means War.
The film follows the fallout of two best friends (who are spies) when they both fall for the same woman.
I assume that laughs and other assorted hijinks ensue.
Worthing is far from a lock as he has about a gazillion other projects with his name pencilled on.
Also:
- Have you been looking forward to director Scott Stewart’s Priest opening in August? If you are there’s some bad news here.
That’s it for now. See you at the movies.
that McQueen project looks very interesting…
Yes GO Toy Story!!!! So toy story got moré than shrek,Right?!?
It made more than Shrek 1 ,2, 4 but not 3.
What?!? Toy story deserved moré!!!!!
LMAO @ Jonah Hex!!
Come on, did anyone actually think that movie was going to be good seeing those trailers?? I mean, Megan Fox sounds like she’s choking everytime she tries to talk, and the rest just looks mediocre. Cheesy to the nth degree…
LOL..why was that made??
Jonah Hex … or as it shall one day be remembered … the movie that paved the way for Megan Fox into the porn industry.
Y,is she naked in Jonah hex?!?
No (not that I know of anyway) but her Hollywood days, IMO, may be past her.
Haha,yeah she might be pressured into being a porn star,perhaps shes good in that lol!
I couldn’t believe how bad Jonah Hex was. The only saving grace was that I didn’t pay to see it.
I mentioned to my sons (32 & 34) that the only thing Megan Fox would be successful at is porn. Of course they totally agreed, the little perverts! 😎
Toy Story 3 was the definite winner; a great animated tale. And I also got right (for the first time) that Karate Kid would be second (the movie isn’t as bad as people think it is).
Im not even gonna see Jonah Hex,it aint my cup of tea. Toy Story was FANTASTIC! Im going to see Karate kid soon,I saw 15 minutes of it cause i saw it during my break(i work at the movies) si im gonna see the whole thing:)
I can just see the end of Gravity now.
The world is literally turned up side down but at least Father and Son are reunited .
Megan Fox just finished a film with Mickey Rourke.
Given Rourkes recent success the film could be at least a modest hit
It might keep Megans career going a bit longer.
the film could be at least a modest hit
Only if his character kills Fox’s character in the most horrible way possible. 😎
So the earth is stopping it’s rotation in Gravity? Does Kal-El have something to do with that?
And silly me always thought that mass created gravity, not the rotation. Dag nabbit, lol.
Coming to a Cinemax late night channel soon: Megan Fox in the “Bikini Carwash Company 2011.”

Have a Great.ly Mother’s Day!
Tuesday, May 5th, 2015
Every year, Dave asks me what I want for Mother’s Day. Every year I respond, “Nothing.” And it’s true. Mostly. But this year, I’ve been thinking about it and have come up with a list.
This one-of-a-kind Leather Silhouette Cuff by artist Vana Chuff is gorgeous. (pictured above)
As are these gold earrings by Chen Fuchs Jewelry
I’m a sucker for gorgeous books
And I’m not at all embarrassed to admit I’d love a “grown-up, take everywhere, security blanket”
How about you? What’s on your list this year?
Oh and big PS!!! Now through Thursday, May 7 I’m donating my profits from my great.ly shop (which is where you can find all of lovely lovely items above) to the Baltimore Community Foundation’s for Rebuilding Baltimore! Love you, Baltimore.

Classic Play Shop + Society6
Thursday, August 7th, 2014
For more than a year now, I’ve been dabbling in illustration. I’ve doodled since I was a kid and briefly, very briefly, entertained the idea that one day I’d be an artist. Dave has long encouraged my artistic pursuits. He said I should be bold and add hand lettering and drawings on Classic Play.
Eventually, I listened to him. You know, after a year or so. That’s how married couples roll. Or at least, how we do. We’re both stubborn firstborns so maybe that’s it.
So I broke out a tablet I won from Bing at Alt Summit NYC (thanks Bing!) that sat in my closet all sad and lonely. I plugged it, opened up illustrator and added my first doodle. I really, really loved it. Since then I’ve created logos, hand lettered goodness and doodles here and there.
Last night, I set up a Society6 shop and uploaded my first illustration. Now you can get happy prints, posters, mugs, teeshirts and onesies. You can even get a happy shower curtain. No lie.
It’s awesome seeing something I drew come to life. It feels surreal, and I love it. So pick up a tote, shirt, print, mug, or even a duvet cover (crazy but true) and get happy!

1 Jenean Morrison | 2 Cynthia Treen | 3 Ellie Bradley | 4 Cheeky Monkey Home | 5 Joanne Stone
Three cheers for independent makers who #makegood!

Quotes
Thursday, January 17th, 2013
A few weeks back, Dave, the kids and I went down to DC to check out two exhibits our friends had designed. One of them was the food exhibit, featuring Julia Child’s kitchen.
I loved looking at everything Julia had in her kitchen—from the pegboard walls to the magnets she kept on the fridge. But there was one thing in particular I lingered over, her bookshelf. What did she think was important enough to keep on the shelves in the heart of her home? There were many books, but the one that caught my eye was sandwiched between Joy of Cooking and How to Clean Everything—Barlett’s Familiar Quotations.
Ah, a kindred spirit. Even more so than I previously thought.
I’ve come clean about my geeky love for quotes. How about you? Do you collect quotes? Do you have a favorite?
psst: I may be a tad obsessed with them.

With this awesome collection Celina of Petit à Petit and Family created for the concept store Mini Bulles. It’s cute and yet edgy, isn’t it? Makes me wish my kids were a bit smaller. I could see my two rocking those hoodies.
ps. Do you remember Celina from her interview? It’s one of my favorites.

Home | Hanging Family Photos
Thursday, September 27th, 2012
Dave taught you how to take better family pictures. Now, let’s chat about how to hang all those super awesome photos you’ve taken. Actually first, let’s talk about a little decorating we’ve been doing around chez Cooper.
Last year, we started a redecorating project to get the house reflecting more of who we are now at this moment in our lives. We painted over youthful colors. We sold pieces of furniture too big for our rooms to fund the purchases of new, smaller scale pieces. We de-cluttered and reclaimed. The change has been a breath of fresh air.
We still have a long way to go—there are still rooms to paint; our wood floors, which we were hoping to refinish 10 years ago, are still… well, as writer friend of mine recently said about her own floors, they have soul.
But the one thing that really made the rooms feel more “us” was finally hanging our family photos. A couple weekends ago, we finished the process. Want to see what we did?
Here are the three different ways we showcased family photos in our home: (more…)

Scenes from Summer Vacation

The family and I recently took a week-long vacation to North Carolina’s Outer Banks. Initially, I had hoped for a more adventurous vacation, but when I started looking at airfare, Dave and I agreed a trip to the beach made more sense. At the time, I was a bit sullen thinking it wasn’t going to be a very exciting trip. Goes to show how little I know.

Y E S, FINALLY! Long live Cybernetika – the best psy/dnb artist who walked this earth!
For fans of DnB and Psybreaks, rejoice!! Cybernetica is back, and ready to rumble in this gloriously incredible collection! (Shakes head furiously while putting headphones on, preparing for the upcoming sonic assault.)
I must admit I blindly voted 5 stars. ;) Cybernetika? Can’t be wrong.
My heart stopped for a moment when seeing this on the front page. HERE WE GO, HUH?
Perfect ;) BUT the “Image 2.png” says : released in 9014…and I thought we have 2014
mindblowing!
I have waited eagerly for a new Cybernetika release for years now…the time has finally come.
This is an outstanding, brilliant and in one word, EPIC release. I Love it already at first listen :-)) And the storyline is really interesting, I’d love to watch a movie based on that plot :-)
YESSSSS! This made my day, I’ve been waiting for this for a very long time. After releasing an album each year I was frightened for a bit when nothing came in 2012 and 2013, but then I heard you are working on the new album and here it is! Can’t wait to hear it!
P.S.: what happened with the album that you were supposedly produce together with Xenofish?
@Sancara
That’s just Cybernetika’s style mate. Same was written on Scyte of Orion’s cover too. Look at the description provided by Basilisk: “far-future science fiction storytelling”.
@Sancara: We have 2014, Cybernetika doesn’t. ;)
massive, 5 stars
great artwork as well
Downloading right now..
I am really excited about this, can’t wait to listen to it!
Yeah yeah your music is pure genius, but your cover to o.O
what is reality? ;)
Smoking HOT!
You have got to me kidding me….This is the epitome of the word EPIC!
Great!!!
woohoo, was waiting for this!
Cybernetika has infected the humans with this amazing vibration
I thoroughly enjoy your work very much bro
great! thx a lot for sharing.
Excellent work as always. Really love the deep scifi sounds and the unrelenting tempo. Stellar release. Get this now!
coolcoolcool!
quality!
As always, pure class!
Well… first impression is that it seems a little too colorful for my taste…
Simply outstanding. And free. Free! This album is better than 99% of commercial releases, and it’s just given to the people. A gift.
Eric S, this entire site is a gift in itself. I donate because the content offered here is much better than most commercial releases; while many artists start here and then go on to sign contracts. I feel like I am stealing at times, when the albums and music are, as you said, so free. Enjoy what you find in here; Cybernetika won’t be the last.
Beautiful, gnarly, dusty, dark, alien piece of of music from start to finish. Exquisitely arranged and very well produced. Best d&b Cybernetika yet hands down.
WOW!!!
Like the Deus Ex samples in second track;) What are the others from?
@b42: Mass Effect and System Shock 2. And yes, Deus Ex samples are magnificent. Especially: “We have grown, but there is still much to be done. Many that live in darkness that must be shown the way. For it is the dawning of a new day.” And the melody that starts immediately after JC/Helios speech is just melting my brain. I think Neuronal Interface and Bio-Magnetic Tunnel Transport are the brightest-shining gems of this album.
I recomment Deus Ex and System Shock 2 to everyone here. They are pure art. Btw, don’t forget to check out the track called “Hydroponics”, if you haven’t already. It’s inspired by System Shock soundtrack. It can be found on Atropos album, by Cybernetika of course.
Loving another great release!!!!
ive always been a fan of anything they released and this is nothing short of their previous work. fantastic tracks!
wow perfect
I have always enjoyed Cybernetika. I thought that he vanished after Colossus, but this new album….this man…made my day.
Well done again Cybernetika. Your albums are the reason I first came into contact with Ektoplazm and you always seem to be raising the bar. Thanks for sharing your hard work with us!
Amazing release, great sound! <3
This is some seriously heavy stuff again !! Fasten your seat belts !
Masterwork 5/5
Track 7 is a proper brainwash. I do love it!
YAY another Cybernetika!! Been anxiously awaiting this!
Gran pagina
This is another fine musical work by Cybernetika :)
Lush, dark melodies throughout the whole album that will make you feel like an explorer of space itself ^^
My favorite track from this album is #5: Bio-Magnetic Tunnel Transport <3
Namaste
Fantastic. Thanks!
Great! Thanks.
been waiting for this… soooooooooooooo excited. cant wait to finish downloading…this guy is a genius :::D
Oh, yes. Good to see Cybernetika has released new (good, of course) stuff.
After giving this a listen I have to say it blew me away!! So powerful, so dark, and way awesome. I love the psychedelic elements in the psy breaks and drum & bass. Rating this a 5 definitely. A good release!
man, this is a stunning multi dimensional album. big thankyou
Thanks man :)
yes!!!very good.full power به جرات ميتونم بگم يكي از بهترين البوم هاي موجود در اين سايته
Альбом хороший, приятно слушается. Но однообразный, иногда утомляет.
Album is good, it’s nice to listen to. But monotonous, sometimes tiring.
Wow, this is probably the best release on Ektoplazm. Insanely good – concentrated sci-fi.
Such excellent sound waves from Cybernetika as always! I love how some tracks twists away like Neuronal Interface. Don’t know how i could pick a fav out of these tracks, they are all rly good.
5/5
First of all: thank you Cybernetika & Ektoplazm !! I thought it could not get any better after The Scythe Of Orion, but then came Colossus. And now this … I just love the atmosphere, the story, the whole thing. Keep on going …. please :)
Again, uuuunbelievable good, dark, powerful energy from the future.
Yeahyeahyeah!!! Thank you so much :)
Thank you for being back Cybernetika, your music rocks, as always ^^
amazing
Just blow my mind booommmmmmmm thanks for realise
Pretty cool stuff as usual ^^ It’s not really up there with his best (i.e. Atropos and Colossus), but I’ll still take a Cybernetika album over most other productions in the genre any frikin time.
IMO this is closer to Atropos than colossus in terms of soundscape
Amazing stuff!!
Awesome. Just awesome.
Thank you.
Wow – this is beautiful album – Love it – new favorite
thx cybernetika, you’re brilliant!
To be honest: I am dissapointed with this release. The production and sounddesign is really beautiful, as always! But — and it’s in my eyes a huge BUT: The mastering is awful. It massively overcompressed and totaly devoid of any room to breathe. The soundstage feels crowded and cramped into center. Average short-term loudness fluctuations is even below 1 LU. Sad, especially when compared to e.g. the outstanding work on Atropos (Hydroponics! Conquest!).
Maybe release a mixdown / re-mastered edition sometime?
Love & best wishes
Sim.
Not the best sound design, but the feel and creativity is awesome. Love it.
Hmm… I have to revise the comment on mastering. The sample player’s output sounds like it should… maybe my mp3 decoding chain is borked. I’ll try the WAVs.
Ok, with the WAVs I still see e.g. on Distress Beacon peaks up to +0.8 dbFS on an oversampling true peak meter. Pleeeease do not partake in the loudness race to the bottom! Get it remastered! Your listeners’ fatigued ears will thank you…
This man is a beast.
This is Pure Future ;)
Yeah,i’m hearing and imaginating the future of human you wanna show,brillant.
OHH yeah!!! Good to see you back!!!
Friggin epic to say the least!
Beautiful release. I have downloaded this masterpiece right after it came out but now I am listening to it again and I felt I have to write this comment. In fact I wasn’t satisfied the first time I listened to it. It took me two more times and I liked it. (Probably I had a bad day and my mood was bad back then.)
I don’t have all the releases from Cybernetika. I like the recent albums more because there is more Breakbeat, Sound-Design, BASS and awesome leads in it. I like the atmosphere a lot when rude bass and dirty drums clash against nice pads. Therefore I don’t like Darkpsy so much as I did a couple of months ago. I like more happy psytrance with rude roots now.
I can’t even say which track is the best on this album because first I liked “Monolithic” a lot but now it is “Constellations”.
This is really a great piece of music and sound design. Go get it!
Was loooking foward to it! …. :D
…AWESOME!!! is it for real?? – anticipating very much to finish my download and listen!!! what a present!! thank you very much!!
when i lisen Colosus.i was blowed. but solar nexus is more than blowing. Cybernetika is most skilled in this. epic all time.
Awesome Sounddesign, the Mastering is horrible though.
awesome album, I liked it a lot
It’s a BOMB!
seriously, stop that cybernetika.
stop being so awesome or ill die
Wow! This is seriously awesome!
Get the hell out of here, Denton!
The genetically modified humans kept this album to remind them there was still intelligent life on earth when they left!
Release is awesome!
Last track is mindblowing!
Finally! :D
Is it Tali from Mass Effect that I am hearing in Monolithic? :o
This is just outstanding! You can’t mistake his style. Precious release.
Far out sounds, and pretty awesome short story. I think we’re along the same lines. I too am a producer of Psy Music, hopefully to be on this site soon. It is easier to create music than to make a movie, but that’s how I think as well. I see a future, where every audio ep release, is accompanied by video… either original visuals, animation, or a short movie. – Great release.
I have three words that will describe this album. Epic, epic and epic. Well, okay, only one word. But it’s so intense, one of the best dnb releases I ever heard.
HOLY FUCKIN SHIT DUDE, THANK YOU!!!!!
Friken Excellent
Really Awesome :)!!! Thank you
The Outcast Of Deadspace is my favorite, great album again as expected!
fuckin awesome new stuff i really love u dude :DBethany

Essential Information
A certified nurse's aide meets the primary needs of patients who need help with feeding, grooming, dressing and bathing.

- Program Length- 3 credit course
- Other Requirements- Clinical training at a medical facility
Nurse's Aide Certification
A certified nurse's aide assists patients by providing basic care. A high school diploma or GED are not always required, however, placement tests are standard. A nurses's aide certificate program is typically a 3-credit course. Students explore fundamental nursing duties, healthcare ethics and communication skills. . Participants may need professional-level CPR certification. Upon program completion students can take the CNA credentialing exam. Course topics include:

Employment Outlook and Salary Information
According to 2012-2022 projections by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), employment for nurse's aides, orderlies and attendants could increase 21%.

Iowa Law Students May Escape the Dreaded Bar Exam View Count: 516
Summary: The Iowa Supreme Court will decide whether graduates of Drake University Law School and the University of Iowa College of Law will be required to take the state’s bar exam to practice law.
Graduates of Drake University Law School and the University of Iowa College of Law may be in luck. According to RadioIowa.com, the Iowa Supreme Court held a public hearing at 9:00 this morning on changes that would make it easier for alumni of the two schools to practice law in Iowa.
Steve Davis, court communications officer, stated that a Blue Ribbon Committee from the Iowa State Bar Association recommended the change. “Currently, after they graduate from Drake University Law School and the University of Iowa College of Law, they are required to successfully complete the Iowa bar examination. Under this recommendation, they would no longer have to do that,” he explained.
The testimony of 24 people was to be presented this morning, including law school deans, district court judges, and the Iowa Attorney General. All were expected to comment on the change.
Prior to the hearing, the court received written comments on the proposed change. “There’s actually 152 written comments made, so the court’s going to have a lot of information to make the decision,” Davis added. A decision will be made by the justices after the hearing. Though they will meet and discuss the new practice rule, there’s no strict deadline to have a decision finalized. The comments and the proposal are both posted at.

Just about anywhere else in the country you go, largemouth bass are the most popular freshwater fish.
I would not care to argue about the relative merits of any sport fish because I love them all.
So I will just offer some reasons largemouth bass are so popular elsewhere.
Largemouth bass are widespread, with a native range extending from the Gulf of Mexico north to the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River, and from the Atlantic Coast west to Minnesota and mid-Texas.
They have been spread by man into waters around the world, and into most, if not all, states. In good habitat, which is extensive, the species tends to be abundant.
Widespread and abundant are a combination that makes it possible to be very popular.
Add to that a willingness to strike artificial lures, including on the surface, they fight with good power and often jump, and they get a lot of good press.
A huge industry has been built around them, an industry that aggressively encourages people to fish for largemouth bass.
These factors complete the package that makes the largemouth bass the most popular freshwater sport fish in the U.S.
In our area are several good-to-excellent largemouth bass lakes, of which Presque Isle Bay rates near the top.
The only thing that prevents Presque Isle Bay from rating at the pinnacle of area largemouth bass lakes is what seems to be a top-end size that is probably at least a couple pounds smaller than a few other lakes, or ponds.
Some of the best largemouth bass fishing in our region -- and elsewhere -- can be found in ponds such as those found on some state game lands, which are managed for waterfowl habitat.
Because of the way largemouth bass fishing has evolved, no lake that limits boats to some specific horsepower will get popular because bass boats cannot be used.
Regardless of the popular image of largemouth bass fishing, it is more than possible to enjoy good largemouth bass fishing from shore. It is quite possible that the best way to fish for largemouth bass is from a small boat with a motor of modest size.
I have a 14-foot aluminum jon boat that is used for largemouth fishing.
Its size allows it to be rowed with ease, pushed by a smaller electric motor, or skipped across the surface by a 9.9-horsepower motor.
The 7.5-horsepower motor I used on it for several years had plenty of power to get it quickly on plane carrying two adults and all fishing gear, which includes a large battery. Bottom line, I can use it to fish for largemouth bass on just about any lake, except the larger lakes on windy days.
Rating the local largemouth bass lakes and ponds is virtually impossible since fish populations fluctuate significantly, and habitat changes through numerous factors. Just get a roadmap and pick a local lake. Odds are good that it is a good place to fish for largemouth bass.
You can be very successful at fishing for largemouth bass by mastering just a few tactics, enough to cover virtually any situation. One of my friends who does very well at largemouth bass fishing uses only one lure, a pork frog on a weedless hook. He will add a sinker if need be.
First, learn to use plastic worms. Don't make this any more difficult than necessary.
There is no need to learn to use a level-wind casting reel to cast plastic worms.
I prefer a spinning outfit, a one-piece rod with the reel taped to the cork handle that is so sensitive I can feel a bass coming 10 yards before it gets to my lure.
I use 12-pound-test line, which is heavy enough to haul most bass through the weeds.
What limits many anglers' success with plastic worms is impatience.
Give the worm plenty of time to do its underwater dance. When you cast a worm, leave the bail open until the worm reaches bottom, then close the bail with your fingers. Wait several seconds before moving the worm. Move it by lifting the rod tip, then let it drop on slack line. Wait several seconds again. Repeat this until the worm is retrieved all of the way, or past the cover.
Spend some time watching plastic worms underwater. Doing this accomplishes three big things.
You will see how most soft worms continue to move after reaching bottom, typically a slow, spiraling dance.
This will give you the patience you need, since you know what the worm is doing. And maybe most importantly, it will give you confidence, which will result in fishing more intently and with persistence.
With no weight, a plastic worm can be fished on the surface, through thick slop. Add whatever weight needed to fish any depth.
Nothing can be more versatile or simple.

At that time, the production of a weekly newspaper was very labor intensive. To an extent, newsgathering was a luxury for many small newspapers because of the time it took to physically produce a weekly edition. In that era, many small town newspapers existed off of the news that came into their building from correspondents and others. Original newsgathering was not done as much as it is today in many small towns. There was even a lack of time to do much outside advertising sales.
This museum shows how a weekly newspaper was produced in that era and how the production process from setting type to printing was done. This process gave the rural weekly newspaper industry very firm blue-collar roots as it was craft oriented. Only with the later advent of offset printing did the industry shift into a more white-collar environment.
The Georgia Weekly Newspaper Museum is owned by Mainstreet Newspapers, Inc. of Jefferson, Ga. The firm publishes a small group of weekly newspapers in Northeast Georgia, including the local Banks County News which shares office space with the museum.
The Georgia Weekly Newspaper Museum is located at
953 Historic Homer Highway
Homer, GA
It is part of the office of the Banks County News, the weekly newspaper for the community. The office is staffed part-time.

No Monarchs Spotted Yet!
(English/Español)
October 15, 2012
Dear Friends:
With wonderful sunny days, the monarch's presence can nearly be smelled. Every afternoon, Jocelyn, Roberto and I check for signs of monarchs arriving to our region. Today, we filled in the graph with our one-week observations for you. No monarchs yet! We expect to see the first butterflies sometime this month, so they must be approaching our region now. We are anxious to see them!!!
A Day in the Life of Jocelyn and Roberto
As described in our last report, Jocelyn and Roberto live at El Cerrito area, this strategic point where monarchs announce their arrival before entering their Sanctuaries. Today I'll tell you about their typical day. Jocelyn and Roberto start the day by getting up at 6:30 in the morning. Although there is an elementary school in their community, they attend school downtown Angangueo, since their mom and dad both work there.
Each morning they get dressed quickly, brush their teeth and wash their hands. Our children usually take a shower in the afternoons, since the bathroom at our homes is usually located outside and some meters away from bedrooms. It would be too cold for them to take a shower so early!!
The typical Mexican breakfast for many children may consist of an egg with some beans accompanied with one or two tortillas, and some milk or tea. However, milk with bread is mostly enough for Joselyn and Roberto, because 7 a.m. is much too early for them to have more.
After a very light breakfast they rush to the main road. A neighbor's car serves as transportation to the few children in the community who go to school downtown. Mom and Dad pay 10 pesos for both Jocelyn and Roberto to ride. School starts at 8:30 a.m. and Jocelyn and Roberto are recognized by teachers as being among the most on-time children at school.
At breaktime, Jocelyn and Roberto are really thirsty and hungry. They enjoy a delicious lunch consisting of a taco filled in with potatoes, which is only 3 pesos, a drink for another three pesos and a candy of equivalent price. All these are prepared and sold by some pupils' mothers themselves. Half an hour-breaktime seems not to be enough for playing and eating!
Classes end at 1:00 pm. These days, when Jocelyn and Roberto return from school we go to search for butterflies. Next week, I'll share more about local life along with any news about the monarchs!

This process still fascinates me,” Joyce says.
Joyce was born and raised in Lufkin, Texas. She completed her bachelor’s degree in Home Economics from Stephen F. Austin State University and then received another bachelor’s degree in Nutrition/Dietetics at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.
After living in the Houston area for almost 30 years and raising her family, Joyce moved to a rural area 5 years ago and joined DaVita as a dietitian.
Joyce enjoys educating her patients in ways that make it fun and memorable. “Most of our patients are indigent, so getting protein foods becomes an issue,” Joyce says. “One of my favorite explanations of protein foods seems to bring delight to many of my patients. My saying is that if it has feathers, fur or fins, it is a better protein choice,” she states.
“I really try to make a difference in patients’ lives,” says Joyce. “Being a dietitian follows the core values and mission of DaVita to me, and I try to live up to that standard daily.” Joyce adds, “The most rewarding aspect of my work is seeing that the patient finally understands what is being explained, and why it is important to follow the renal dietary guidelines. This patient understanding will certainly help their outcomes.”
Eating your renal-safe veggies is a great way to get vitamins and other good nutrients. Joyce shares some of her favorite vegetable recipes from Carrot Pineapple Salad to Zippy Zucchini.

Deacon Speakin’ repeats in the Portland Mile | Horse Racing
Deacon Speakin’ became just the second horse in Portland Mile history to win the race back to back, as he stormed home to an impressive three quarter length victory in the $35,000 Portland Mile on Monday. He joins Tall Ben who won the race in 1971 and 1972 as the only two time winners. Sent off as the 4/1 second choice, Deacon Speakin’ broke from the outside gate under leading jockey Luis Torres.
Deacon Speakin’ sat back in the early going as See Ya Later Slew set a torrid pace of 22.80 for the opening quarter and 46.41 for the half mile. Torres kept Deacon Speakin’ in the clear as they went to the far turn and decided to go outside of the tiring pace setters.
Meanwhile, favored When We Met took the shortest way home, going to the inside and setting up a stretch battle with Deacon Speakin’. Deacon Speakin’ got first run and came into the stretch with the lead and When We Met just couldn’t push past him in the end. The top two finishers were thirteen and a half lengths ahead of Lesson in Deceit who ran on for third. The final time was 1:37.08 for the one mile distance.
Deacon Speakin’ ($10.00) won the 2011 Portland Mile in much the same way as this year’s running, coming from off the pace, and it’s a race his owner and breeder Paul Hagemann had kept his eye on.
“I have pointed towards this race since last year when he won it,” said Hagemann. “He just ran nine days ago down at Golden Gate Fields and I was worried someone might claim him for the $25,000. But they didn’t and I think it set him up well for this race. He came up here and Steve (trainer Steve Fisher) paddocked him twice and schooled him in the gate pretty much each day since he got here a week ago, since he has some problems at the gate.”
Deacon Speakin’ loaded in with a blanket on him as he strode into the gate. He balked at the first attempt, but went right in the second time, something trainer Steve Fisher said he was happy with.
“We wanted to make sure to get him to the paddock and the gate a lot this week,” said Fisher. “We didn’t want to leave any stone unturned with him.”
With the win, Fisher became just the second trainer in track history to win the Portland Mile three times, the other being Jonathan Nance. Fisher won with Deacon Speakin’ in 2011 and now 2012, and also won the race in 2001 with Chinquapin Charlie.
“I really left the trip today up to Luis, as I have full confidence in him,” said Fisher. “He sure seems to like this sand, but from that outside draw we didn’t want to push him to fast to early. Luis let him find his rhythm and it worked out great.”
The win was the seventh career victory for Deacon Speakin’ and pushes his earnings to up over $188,000. Owner Paul Hagemann who bred Deacon Speakin’ spoke about the horse after the race.
“It’s like watching one of your kids or your grandkids succeed,” said Hagemann. “I was there when this horse was born and I’m so proud of him. Steve and Jacqui (Fisher) have just done such a wonderful job with this horse.”

DR.PASHA | March 12, 2007 | Section: Articles | 998 reads
DR.PASHA | March 12, 2007 | Section: Articles | 998 reads
Dr. Pasha
I have often talked about the miraculous deeds of The Unlettered Man – Prophet Muhammad, Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam – God’s peace, blessings, mercy and grace be upon him and upon all the other prophets of God such as Jesus, Moses, Abraham, David and Solomon.
And upon all those other prophets of God in all other cultures, times and places whose names and specific identities we have not been made privy to by God Almighty.
Over and over again, I have shown fairly clearly and convincingly how his whole existence on earth, in fact, every single moment of his life in this world, was then, and continues to be to this day, a full and complete miracle.
This Unlettered Man: Prophet Muhammad, Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam – God’s peace, blessings, mercy and grace be upon him and upon all the other prophets of God.
Of course that is what the Qur’an calls him: Annabiyyul Ummiy – which in the original Arabic language of the Qur’an means exactly that: the Unlettered Prophet.
Guess who else talks about him and calls him that: “Him That Is Not Learned“?
The Bible does.
The Old Testament does.
I wish I had the right reference here with me from the Bible – the Book of Isaiah in the Old Testament, is it? – to give you on this topic.
I think it is Isaiah 29:12. Please go, check it out and see for yourself.
May Allah forgive me if I am wrong and give you the wrong reference from a book that contains references to the noble prophets of God, may God Almighty bless them all! Because I am working from memory.
But the point I am trying to make is this: How much clearer does it get?
Really?
The Bible clearly and openly calls Prophet Muhammad, Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam, “Him That Is Not Learned“?
And the Qur’an calls him: The Unlettered Prophet.
How many people are there who are “Not Learned,” and to whom the angel offered “The Book” saying “Read, I pray thee“?
Mashallah! Alhamdulillah!
All praise and glory be to God Almighty!
Thank you Lord, God, Almighty!
God of Muhammad, Moses, Jesus, Abraham, Noah, David, Solomon and Joseph – may God bless them all!
Hallelujah!
Here is the actual quote I was looking for, and yes, it is the Book of Isaiah in the Old Testament, as I said, and it is Chapter 29, Verse 12:
“And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying Read this,
I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned” (Isaiah: 29:12).
I added the Italics in this quote – they are not there in the original language of the Bible.
But then when you are talking about the Bible, you need to be careful about which version you are reading or referring to. Not infrequently words (and meaning) can change significantly from version to version – and from edition to edition.
Now please go back and read in Surah Al-‘Alaq – chapter 96 of the Qur’an – the word “Iqra’!”
What do you think that word means: “Iqra”!“? It means precisely what the Bible says: “Read,” I pray thee!
And then look up that story in the Hadith in which Prophet Muhammad, Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam, narrates his encounter with the angel, Gabriel (May God bless him), to his wife, May God bless her.
It goes something like this:
“The angel said to me, ‘Read!‘ To which I replied ‘I am not learned.’“
The actual words of the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam, in the original Arabic story of the Hadith are: “Maa ana bi’qaari’.”
I am quoting from memory. May God forgive me if I am wrong!
Literal translation of those words: “I am not a reader.”
Stated differently – in the language of the translators of the Bible: “I am not learned.”
Allahu Akbar!
How much more “proof” do we need or want?
Wake up, people, and smell the miracles of The Unlettered Man – before our nostrils are clogged and before the sense of smell is taken away from us.
And, frankly, before the worms of the grave claim us for a feast. For, that is what most us are: wormfeast, waiting to be devoured by voracious worms in our graves.
That is why I say repeatedly that we need a certain minimum amount of intelligence to be able to see and recognize these Everyday Miracles of The Unlettered Man – and of Islam.
And to be able to see and recognize the miracles galore in the daily lives of even the most ordinary of Muslims even today – such as the Muslims of today are, with all their problems and limitations.
And then, in addition to that, we need also the minimum amount of personal integrity, courage and candor to be able to put aside our differences, and our age-old prejudices and fears, and embrace the truth of what God Almighty makes manifest to our eyes and to our hearts.
Come!
Let us find out more about the miracles of this man whom both the Bible and the Qur’an refer to as the Unlettered Man or Him That Is Not Learned!
END

The White House had been playing coy over the possibility of such a visit, saying it wasn't in the cards as Coakley floated hints in the press that she wanted the president to campaign for her. Former President Bill Clinton and Sen.

Increasingly, both live calls and automated telemarketing calls (“robocalls”) are finding their way into consumers’ homes regardless of whether they are on the federal registry or not.
Consumer watchdogs have noted the increase, as well. David Lazarus of the Los Angeles Times blogged that he has been hearing from numerous people in recent months saying that telemarketers seem to have shrugged off any qualms they may have had about violating the do-not-call list, a.k.a. the National Do Not Call Registry.
While marketers are supposed to check the do-not-call registry every month to make sure they are not calling listed numbers, many robocallers seem to be ignoring the law altogether, confident they won’t be found – they often spoof the number from which they are calling, making them hard to trace – or if they are caught, they believe they are unlikely to be fined.
According to the Federal Trade Commission, monthly complaints about robocalls more than tripled to about 212,000 in April from 65,000 in October 2010. The FTC (News - Alert) notes that not only are these calls violating federal law, more often than not, they are pushing scams.
"These calls are the No. 1 complaint getter, by a wide margin," said Roberto Anguizola, the FTC's assistant director of marketing practices. "Not only are they illegal, but in most cases they're hawking a scam.”
While the FTC hasn’t given up chasing these people, they say the best thing to do when you receive a call is simply hang up. Pressing any buttons to speak with a live agent will only let the company know they’ve got a “live” target on the other end. Informing whoever picks up the call that they are breaking federal law will usually get you a quick hang-up.
In the meantime, prosecuting companies that break the law is a bit like playing whack-a-mole, says the FTC. They target and put out of business one company, and five more pop up in its place.

Taken by: MPhil ACS, Part III
Code: L25
Hours: 16 (8 × two-hour seminar sessions)
Prerequisites: Undergraduate courses on C/C++ and compilers (see also “pre-course reading” below), enough practical C++ to augment a large open-source system (LLVM).
Aims
The module aims to give students practical experience with a state-of-the art compiler architecture used in research and academia. The main focus is on code generation for two categories of language: late-bound dynamic languages and parallel languages.
Syllabus
- Static Single Assignment form and its uses [1 lecture]
- The LLVM intermediate representation and transform pipeline [2 lectures and 2 practicals]
- Strategies for implementing dynamic dispatch and duck typing [2 lectures and 2 practicals]
- Autovectorisation algorithms [1 lecture and 2 practicals]
- Optimisation constraints for GPU and heterogeneous architectures [1 lecture]
- Parallel execution strategies [1 lecture and 2 practicals]
Objectives
On completion of this module, students should:
- Understand the performance characteristics of modern processors
- Be familiar with strategies for optimising dynamic dispatch for languages like JavaScript and Objective-C
- Have experience with algorithms for automatically taking advantage of SIMD, SIMT, and MIMD parallelism
Pre-course reading
Some prior knowlege on the following compiler ideas (e.g. reading the Wikipedia articles on them) is advised:
Coursework
Write a 4,000-word project report in IEEE journal format, including results from an analysis of modern compiler optimisation techniques.
Practical work
Several short exercises implementing and benchmarking simple optimisations.
Design and implement a small set of optimisations for one of the example languages in the course or an existing language such as OpenCL C to generate experimental results. Several project ideas, including some proposed by members of ARM's compiler team, will be available to choose from or students may propose their own for this component.
Assessment
- The 4,000-word project report will be graded (80%).
- The ticked practical work will be reviewed with the student (a short oral) (20%)

Apart from its antihyperglycemic effect, metformin has been believed to have other potential effects, as indicated in two large-scale clinical trials1, 2. Those trials suggested that metformin could significantly decrease the risk of diabetes-related cardiovascular end points and all cause deaths compared with conventional therapies when lowering blood glucose to similar levels. However, the exact mechanism associated with the cardioprotective role of metformin is still elusive.
AMPK is a serine-threonine kinase that acts as an energy sensor in various cell types3. It also plays an important role in cardioprotective effects4, 5. Zhou et al6 demonstrated that metformin could activate AMPK. Recent studies have suggested that metformin could inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis and improve cardiac function through AMPK activation7, 8. Pathological left ventricular hypertrophy is a crucial pathological condition that triggers several serious cardiac events, including arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden death9, 10. However, whether metformin has an inhibitory effect on cardiac hypertrophy has not been elucidated. Thus, we hypothesized that metformin might have a direct antihypertrophic effect via AMPK activation.
In this study, we aim to determine whether metformin inhibits cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload and how metformin exerts its antihypertrophic effect.
The research protocol was designed in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by the National Institutes of Health of the United States of America (NIH Publication No 85–23, revised 1996). All experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Committee for Animal Care and Use of Peking University. Heterozygous AMPKα2 knockout C57BL/6 mice were kindly donated by Professor Benoit VIOLLET (Institute National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale U567, Paris, France) and bred in an specific pathogen free (SPF) environment with a 12 h/12 h light-dark cycle and received standard rodent food. Male AMPKα2−/− mice and wild-type (WT) littermates (10 weeks old) were bred from the heterozygotes.
Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was carried out as previously described11. Briefly, the mice were anesthetized with tribromoethanol (200 mg/kg, ip; Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, USA) and ventilated with a pressure-controlled ventilator (Kent Scientific, CT, USA). A longitudinal cut was made in the proximal portion of the sternum. A 7–0 silk suture was placed around the aorta between the right innominate artery and the left common carotid artery. The suture was tied around a 26-gauge needle and the aorta. After ligation, the needle was promptly removed. The sham procedure was identical, except the aorta was not ligated. Three days after aortic constriction, the mice were injected with metformin (200 mg·kg−1·d−1, sc, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) or saline (as a control) every day for 6 weeks.
After anesthetizing the mice with 1.5% isoflurane (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, New Providence, NJ, USA), we obtained echocardiographic images with a VisualSonics high-resolution Vevo 770 system (VisualSonics, Toronto, ON, Canada). For measurement of the aortic and LV pressure, a 1.4-F micromanometer conductance catheter (SPR-835; Millar Instruments, Houston, TX, USA) was introduced through the right common carotid artery into the ascending aorta and then advanced into the LV as previously described12.
The mice were anesthetized with tribromoethanol, and the hearts were harvested, retrograde-perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, and then embedded in paraffin. Serial 6-μm-thick LV cross sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Morphometric evaluation of the tissue was performed in a blinded fashion using the Leica Q550 IW imaging workstation (Leica Microsystems Imaging Solutions Ltd, Cambridge, UK). The mean myocyte cross-sectional area was calculated by measuring 100 cells in the HE-stained sections.
Total RNA was isolated from the heart tissue with Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Relative quantitation by real-time PCR involved SYBR Green detection of PCR products in real time with the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The PCR used the following primers: atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), 5′-GCCCTGAGTGAGCAGACTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGGAAGCTGTTGCAGCCTA-3′ (reverse); β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC), 5′-ACCTAC CAGACAGAGGAAGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTGCAAAGAGTCCAGGTCTGAG-3′ (reverse); and GAPDH, 5′-TCCTGGTATGACAATGAATACGGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCTTGCTCAGTGTCCTTGCTGG-3′ (reverse). The GAPDH RNA was amplified as a reference standard. The reactions were conducted in triplicate by heating the reactant to 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s.
The heart extracts were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with antibodies against phosphorylated AMPK, acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF2), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Akt/protein kinase B (AKT) and then against the respective total level of each protein (antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology Incorporated, Danvers, MA, USA). The protein bands were visualized with Supersignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). The blots were subsequently reprobed with the antibody eIF5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) to confirm equal loading.
The data are expressed as the means±SEM. Intergroup comparisons were performed using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software Incorporate, La Jolla, CA, USA) with Student's paired two-tailed t-test or two-way ANOVA. For the ANOVA, if a significant variance was found, the Tukey or Bonferroni test was used as the post hoc analysis. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
To determine whether metformin plays a part in cardiac hypertrophy induced by TAC, we treated TAC-operated mice with metformin (200 mg·kg−1·d−1) or saline for 6 weeks after surgery. Echocardiographic data showed no significant difference in the WT mice before sham or TAC operation (data not shown). The mice that received TAC developed cardiac hypertrophy with normal cardiac systolic function 6 weeks after the operation (Figure 1, Table 1). Sustained treatment with metformin decreased the LV posterior wall dimension in diastole (LVPWd) compared with saline-treated hearts (Figure 1A, 1B). The heart weight/tibial length (HW/TL) of the TAC+saline group increased by 26% compared with the sham+saline group (P<0.01; Figure 1C). In contrast, the HW/TL of TAC+metformin group increased by only 11.7% compared with the sham+saline group. It could therefore be calculated that metformin suppressed the TAC-induced increase in HW/TL by 55% (P<0.05; Figure 1C). The cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area also decreased in the metformin-treated group compared with the saline-treated group (P<0.01; Figure 1D, 1E). Echocardiographic and hemodynamic data showed that sustained treatment with metformin did not affect the cardiac systolic function, but mitigated the diastolic function impairment induced by TAC (P<0.05; Table 1). The treatment with metformin did not affect the systolic blood pressure (SBP) or the LV peak systolic pressure (LVSP) (Table 1). Additionally, metformin treatment inhibited the TAC-induced increase in mRNA levels of ANF and β-MHC (Figure 1F, 1G). Taken together, these results indicate that metformin attenuated the development of TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy independent of hemodynamics. Moreover, there was no significant difference in anatomic and functional data (Table 1) between the sham+saline group and the sham+metformin group; therefore, metformin did not affect normal cardiac structure or function.
To investigate whether AMPK was critical for the inhibitory effect of metformin on cardiac hypertrophy, we subjected AMPKα2−/− littermates to pressure overload caused by TAC. Similar to what was observed in WT mice, TAC induced cardiac hypertrophy without deteriorating cardiac systolic function. However, sustained treatment with metformin did not decrease the LVPWd compared with saline-treated hearts (Figure 2A, 2B). The HW/TL did not decrease in the TAC+metformin group compared with the TAC+saline group (Figure 2C, Table 1). The cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area was similar in the TAC+metformin group and the TAC+saline group (Figure 2D, 2E). Echocardiographic and hemodynamic data showed that sustained metformin treatment did not affect cardiac systolic function (Table 1). Contrary to the findings in WT mice, metformin did not improve diastolic function that was impaired by TAC (P>0.05, Table 1). Moreover, metformin treatment in the AMPKα2−/− littermates did not inhibit the TAC-induced increase in mRNA levels of ANF and β-MHC (Figure 2F, 2G). It can therefore be concluded that the inhibitory effect of metformin on cardiac hypertrophy is dependent on AMPK.
We also measured the postoperative level of fasting blood glucose every week for 6 weeks in each group. There was no significant difference in the fasting blood glucose between saline- and metformin-treated mice (data not shown). These results suggest that metformin did not affect the level of fasting blood glucose in nondiabetic mice.
To examine the role of AMPK in the antihypertrophic action of metformin, we assessed the extent of phosphorylated AMPK in WT mouse hearts. There was a significant increase in the phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine residue 172 in the metformin-treated group compared with the saline-treated group (P<0.05; Figure 3). Metformin treatment also increased the amount of phosphorylated acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase (p-ACC), which serves as an indicator of AMPK activity.
Total myocardial AMPKα and phosphorylated AMPKα were significantly decreased in AMPKα2−/− mice, both under control conditions and after TAC, compared with the WT mice (Figure 4). After TAC for 6 weeks, the increase in total AMPKα protein indicated a compensatory increase in AMPKα1 in AMPKα2−/− mice, yet it was unable to compensate for the AMPKα2 deficiency, as demonstrated by significantly lower levels of p-ACC (Figure 4).
LVH is characterized by an increased myocardial cell size in which protein synthesis is a necessary mediator. mTOR, AKT, and eEF2 all play essential roles in the process of protein synthesis and cell growth. Western blot analysis showed a significant increase in phosphorylated mTOR and AKT in the TAC+saline group, but this increase was significantly inhibited in the TAC+metformin group (P<0.05; Figure 5A, 5B). However, the phosphorylation level of eEF2 did not show a significant change in any of the groups (Figure 5).
Next we tested the phosphorylation level of these proteins in AMPKα2−/− mice hearts. Similar to the effect in WT mice, TAC induced a significant increase in phosphorylated mTOR and AKT (P<0.05; Figure 5A, 5C). Interestingly, metformin did not inhibit the TAC-induced increase of phosphorylated mTOR and AKT in AMPKα2−/− mice (Figure 5A, 5C), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of metformin on protein synthesis may rely on AMPK.
This study demonstrated that long-term (6 weeks) administration of metformin, a widely used antidiabetic agent, attenuated pressure-overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy in nondiabetic mice, and the mechanism of this antihypertrophic action was dependent on AMPK activation.
Chan et al13 have shown that metformin inhibits cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by phenylephrine. However, it is still unclear whether metformin has an inhibitory effect on cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and what dose is necessary for this inhibitory effect, if it exists. In this study, we used a cardiac hypertrophy mouse model in which cardiac hypertrophy without systolic dysfunction was induced by treatment with TAC for 6 weeks. Metformin treatment (200 mg·kg−1·d−1) was found to significantly alleviate the cardiac hypertrophy induced by TAC. In the preliminary examination, we also tested metformin at a dosage of 50 mg·kg−1·d−1 in the wild type mice and found that this dosage of metformin had no significant effect on cardiac hypertrophy (date not shown). Although the dose of metformin we used in this study is higher than that used in diabetes patients (10–40 mg/kg), previous reports investigating the anti-diabetic and anti-tumor effects of metformin in the mouse model used a much higher amount of metformin (250–350 mg/kg) due to the difference in drug sensitivity between rodents and humans14, 15, 16. The dosage of 200 mg·kg−1·d−1 that we used in this study was effective on hypertrophy and had no side effect of hypoglycemia. Thus, we believe that the dose of 200 mg·kg−1·d−1 is appropriate.
To demonstrate that metformin has a direct inhibitory effect on cardiac hypertrophy rather than a secondary effect due to lowering pressure overload, we measured the aortic and LV pressure in each group. TAC mice had a marked increase in the SBP and LVSP (P<0.001; Table 1) compared with sham-operated mice. There was no significant difference in the SBP or LVSP (Table 1) between the TAC+saline and the TAC+metformin group. Our study indicated that metformin did not affect pressure overload, and it had a direct inhibitory effect on cardiac hypertrophy. Similarly, a clinical trial also suggested that metformin had only a clinically insignificant effect on blood pressure in non-diabetic hypertensives17.
We previously reported that metformin inhibited cardiac fibrosis in the TAC-mouse model and demonstrated that it inhibited collagen synthesis, likely via inhibition of the TGF-β1-Smad3 signaling pathway18. Some studies have suggested an important role for TGF-β1 in regulating cardiac hypertrophy. Transgenic mice overexpressing TGF-β1 have been shown to develop cardiac hypertrophy19. Conversely, wild-type mice, but not TGF-β1-deficient mice, treated chronically with angiotensin II manifested cardiac hypertrophy20. However, the effect of TGF-β1 signaling on TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy is still not fully understood. Some studies have shown that a change in the TGF-β signaling pathway did not affect TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Kuwahara et al21 found that an anti-TGF-β neutralizing antibody inhibited myocardial fibrosis, but not myocyte hypertrophy. Another study also found that candesartan (an ACE inhibitor) suppressed the induction of TGF-β and fibroblast proliferation in pressure-overloaded hearts, but did not affect myocyte hypertrophy22. In this study, we focused on AMPK signaling cascades, and we did not investigate whether the TGF-β1-Smad3 signaling pathway was involved in the metformin mediated antihypertrophic effect.
Many studies have recently suggested that the cardioprotective mechanism of metformin is mediated by AMPK. Metformin protects the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury through AMPK activation7. Sasaki et al8 demonstrated that metformin inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by H2O2 and prevented the progression of heart failure in dogs with the activation of AMPK. Tian et al23 reported that the activity of AMPK was increased in rat hearts 12 weeks after TAC operation. Zhang et al24 found that AMPKα2 deficiency exacerbated pressure-overload-induced left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction in mice. Those findings indicate that AMPKα2 exerts a cardiac protective effect against ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction triggered by pressure overload. In this study, we found that long-term metformin treatment significantly increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and attenuated cardiac hypertrophy induced by TAC. Interestingly, the antihypertrophic actions of metformin were ablated in AMPKα2−/− mice. These results suggest that the chronic activation of AMPK during the development of cardiac hypertrophy is a critical mechanism that mediates the beneficial actions of metformin.
Although our data demonstrated that AMPKα2 had a cardiac antihypertrophic effect in TAC-operated mice, we did not find a significant increase in the phosphorylation of AMPK in the TAC+saline group compared with the sham+saline group. Previous reports disagree on this issue. Stuck et al25 reported that the phosphorylation of AMPK decreased 30 min after TAC operation, while in the study by Lei et al26, the phosphorylation of AMPK decreased the second week after TAC, followed by a minor increase by the sixth week. In addition, we did not find that a selective deletion of AMPKα2 exacerbated the development of TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy and LV dysfunction. These results were inconsistent with those of Zhang et al24. The reason underlying this discrepancy is not clear; one possible explanation is the degree of aortic constriction by the TAC operation. The wild type mice developed heart failure during the third week after TAC in the work of Zhang et al24. However, in the present study, both AMPKα2−/− and WT mice had normal cardiac systolic function after TAC for 6 weeks. Thus, the degree of aortic constriction in the TAC models in the work of Zhang et al24 was greater than that of ours.
AMPK is an endogenous protective protein. AMPK may have no or a minor effect on cardioprotection when the heart is subjected to a mild stimulus. This concept was confirmed by transgenic mouse models in which the AMPK gene was deleted27 or the dominant mutation gene of AMPK was overexpressed28. These transgenic mice live without abnormalities. AMPK is activated and plays a role in the cardiac protective response to high-intensity stimulation, as demonstrated by many studies5, 29, 30. Thus, we suppose that the induction of AMPK-related cardiac protective activity is significantly related to the stimulus intensity.
Cardiac hypertrophy involves an increase in protein synthesis. To investigate the mechanism for the antihypertrophic effect of metformin, we measured the action of metformin on the signaling pathways that regulate protein synthesis. It was reported that AKT/PKB, an important signaling pathway in regulating protein synthesis, regulates the physiological growth of the heart. Akt1-null mice had a 20% reduction in body size, with a concomitant reduction in heart size. These mice were shown to be defective in exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy31. Sasaki et al8 recently reported that metformin and 5-aminoimidazole 4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) inhibited the increase in AKT that was induced by pacing. In the present study, we found that TAC induced a significant increase in the phosphorylation of AKT, which was inhibited by metformin in an AMPK-dependent manner. Although it was also reported that Akt1-null mice developed an exacerbated cardiac dysfunction in response to TAC31, the decreased phosphorylation of AKT may be involved in the attenuation of hypertrophy.
mTOR can regulate protein synthesis through two pathways. It can activate p70/85 S6 kinase-1 (S6K1) and p54/56 S6K2, which increase ribosomal biosynthesis and protein translation. It also triggers the release of 4E-binding protein-1 from eIF4E; eIF4E can then bind to other initiation factors such as eIF4G, leading to the initiation of translation32. mTOR has been proposed to regulate pathological hypertrophy of the heart. The inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin was found to attenuate pathological cardiac hypertrophy and reverse myocardial dysfunction33. Dowling et al34 recently reported that metformin inhibited mTOR in a TSC2 and LKB1 dependent manner, which in turn decreased protein synthesis and inhibited cancer cell growth. Another study also demonstrated that metformin inhibited the increase in the phosphorylation of p70s6 kinase induced by phenylephrine in vitro13. Similarly, we found that the phosphorylation level of mTOR was significantly increased in the TAC group, but almost reversed to a normal state by 6 weeks of metformin treatment. This effect of metformin was not observed in AMPKα2−/− mice, suggesting that the metformin-induced mTOR inhibition was AMPK-dependent. It has also been reported that mTOR could be activated by AKT35. Although both AKT and mTOR phosphorylation were increased in TAC-operated mice in our study, whether mTOR was activated by AKT in the TAC model needs further study to be validated.
AMPK activation can lead to an increase in eEF2 phosphorylation, which inhibits the translocation step during elongation. Chan et al13 found that metformin and AICAR inhibited the decrease of eEF2 phosphorylation. However, we did not find a significant decrease in eEF2 phosphorylation in TAC-operated mice hearts, and the level of eEF2 phosphorylation was similar in saline- and metformin-treated groups. These data are in agreement with the findings of Zhang et al24. Therefore, eEF2 may not be involved in TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy in mice.
Our findings in the present study demonstrate that long-term administration of metformin attenuates cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload in nondiabetic mice. The antihypertrophic effect of metformin may be dependent on AMPK activation. Long-term metformin treatment could therefore be a potential therapy for patients at risk of developing pathological cardiac hypertrophy.

All of today's events | Staff PicksThe Province of Frosinone confines to north with the Abruzzi (Province of the Aquila), to east with the Molise (Province of Isernia), to south-east with the Campania (Province of Caserta), to south with the Province of Latin and to the west with the Province of Rome.
HISTORY
The first traces go back to the origins of the humanity. In the Museum Preistorico di Pofi in fact the skull of "Argil" (said also the Man of Ceprano is conserved), Homo erectus of approximately 800 mila years ago. Around to the X-ix century a.C., the appropriation of Indo-European populations was looked at. In the WAYS century a.C. the province of Frosinone entered in the orbit of Rome, than of it it made the "Latium Adjectum", that is the "added Lazio". But before taming to the Volsci and the Ernici nearly 300 years passed. Two social wars and two sannitiche wars carried to the populations of the southern Lazio the roman citizenship. From this moment the province of Frosinone will follow the fates of the roman empire and Rome. The separation happened in 1927, year in which comes created the province of Frosinone.
TERRITORY
The province of Frosinone has a areale extension of 3.239 kmq and is formed from 91 common ones. In all the territory three main morphologic units are characterized: the Appennine reliefs give you from the Mounts Simbruini, the Lepini Mounts until the group of the Mainarde Goal; they Goes Latin, wide valliva depression that separates the Appennine and preAppennine complexes. The Appennine relief is a characterized montuoso complex from reliefs with summits that exceed the 2000 meters of height like M. Viglio (2156 m), Peak Deta (2041 m), M. Meta (2241 m). To border with the provinces of Rome and Latina we find the reliefs of the Lepini Mounts, Ausoni and Aurunci. Three distinguished montuosi groups making part of the preappennino Latium but that they represent a homogenous geographic area and very delimited. Between the more imposing summits of the Lepini, Ausoni and the Aurunci we cite: M. High (1416 m), M. Caccume (1095 m), M. Calvilli (1116 m) until the M. Fammera (1184 m) characterized from scoscese cliffs and walls to strapiombo with morphologic unevennesses that exceed the 500 meters.

WASHINGTON, April 6, 1999 Allied air operations in Yugoslavia increased for the second day as pilots pounded fuel depots, Serb command and control facilities, air defense sites and Yugoslavian army and special police units.
NATO airstrikes have destroyed the headquarters of the 3rd Army -- the unit conducting ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. NATO pilots have also attacked brigade headquarters of both the Pristina Corps and the Nis Corps of the 3rd Yugoslav Army.
NATO attacks are starting to degrade Serb President Slobodon Milosevics ability to make war. Rear Adm. Tom Wilson, the Joint Staff director of Intelligence, said NATO forces are stepping up attacks against fuel depots. According to Wilson, about 30 out of 100 fuel depots have been hit.
Wilson said NATO planners have also targeted bridges and roads along the Yugoslav line of communication from Serbia proper to Kosovo. The purpose of these attacks is to choke off supplies to the Serb forces conducting the ethnic cleansing campaign.
Wilson said Serb air defense capabilities have been degraded, but the system is still functional. He said NATO pilots have destroyed half of the Serb fighter force either in the air or on the ground. The air defense system is still a threat, and we continue to attack it, Wilson said.
Command and control capability for air defense, the army and the special police is also being degraded, as is the Serb intelligence capability, Wilson said.
According to Wilson, the Yugoslav army and the special police are losing an increasing number of men, both in the field and in staging areas.
Wilson said the morale of Yugoslav forces is being affected by the bombing campaign. We have anecdotal reports that morale is declining, he said. This is shown in the [bad] response to calls for increased mobilization.
Refugees continue to pour into Albania and Macedonia, officials said. NATO countries have agreed to temporarily take in Kosovar Albanian refugees who are in Macedonia to take some of the pressure off that small country. The first of 20,000 refugees the United States will host are due to fly to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba in the next four days, according to Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon.
Bacon said it would take about 45 days to transport all 20,000 refugees to the Guantanamo base.
Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles F. Wald, the vice director for strategic plans and policy on the Joint Staff, said Sustained Hope -- the U.S. refugee operation -- is already underway. The airlift missions are originating out of Travis Air Force Base, Calif. and Dover AFB, Del.
The majority of the strategic lift is going into Ancona, Italy, where there is a trans-shipment point, Wald said. There, supplies are broken down and placed in C-130s for shipment to Macedonia and Albania. He said more than 100,000 humanitarian daily rations have arrived in Albania in the last few days.
A military assessment team is in place to work with civilian agencies to ensure the food reaches the people who need it. "There is also a tactical airlift control element in Albania that will set up operations in [the capital of] Tirana to help coordinate the airlift into the country, Wald said. Tirana airport is small and the airlift control element will give the airport the facilities it needs to maintain 24-hour operations.Race Still Divides Obama and Clintons
[Guest post by DRJ]
The Politico examines how the Clintons – especially Bill – and Clinton staffers have reacted to allegations of racism traded by the Obama and McCain campaigns. Apparently race is still a sore subject:
.”
In related news, a Lifetime Network poll via the Chicago Sun-Times shows that almost 1-in-5 female Clinton voters support McCain and 10% of women voters remain undecided:
“According to the survey, neither presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama nor Republican presidential nominee John McCain has secured a clear majority of women, who have decided every presidential election since 1968. Obama garnered 49% to McCain’s 38%, and 6% of these women said they were only leaning toward a candidate. With 90 days to go until Election Day, 10% of women are firmly undecided, indicating either candidate has a shot at becoming the next president.

Hillary Clinton’s Legacy
Hillary’s Women Supporters
• While the majority of women who voted for Hillary in the primary are flocking to Obama (76%), nearly one out of five (18%) says they will vote for McCain for president.”
The Lifetime poll is lengthy but it has some interesting results.

LOCATION DETAILS: Leon County Texas, 1930's along the Trinity river about 120 miles from Houston
OBSERVED: This is the second time I have listed this report. Two men Lawyer Henry and another fellow were quail hunting along a fence line near the Trinity River (A swamp, tall old oak, hickory and pecan.) They saw a very large 9' tall brown/black creature burst from the very thick brush carrying a calf. The calf weighed approx 300lbs and this animal had it in its arms running upright. Needless to say they departed the area and sped back to their employer a MR. JW who would like to remain confedential due to his failing health. As dusk approached MR JW, Sherrif, and the hunters returned to the location to find; one dead calf, entrails removed and brush busted up all around. The three dogs MR JW brought would not get out of the car and the concenious opinion was to leave. Not long after this occured MR Lawyer Henry, his family and many neighbors left the area. A couple of their house still stand, although in severe disrepair and grown up with brush. The area is still remote and on private land.
OTHER STORIES: For years the local and the early settlers in this part of texas always talked about a "legend" that would steal hogs and cattle, and ruin your garden.
ENVIRONMENT: Swampy river bottem with numerous stands of pecan trees, very remote. 20 miles from nearest paved road.Via a comment from Ned (Thanks, Ned!) , here is the video of the original Bunmeido Kasutera commercial from the 1960s that I mentioned in my kasutera article [1]:

The highly publicised and much-anticipated musical event dubbed ‘African Union Day Concert’ slated for the Accra International Conference Centre (AICC) in Accra has been postponed from the earlier advertised date of May 25 to later part of June according to the organisers, RAM Media Concepts.
The event, which brings together six of Ghana’s seasoned highlife musicians in an unforgettable musical concert had to be postponed to a later date due to some technical challenges.
Amandzeba Nat Brew, Elivava, Ben Brako, Sherifa Gunu and a host of others music stars have decided to make this year’s AU celebration an unforgettable one by dedicating it to their loyal fans across the country.
It is being organised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration in collaboration with RAM Media Concepts and the Africa Bureau, and is expected to take place later in June this year.
The Coordinator of the event, Augustine Mark of RAM Media Concepts added that the event is expected to bring entertainment to lovers of African music from all walks of life.
Mr Mark hinted that measures have been put in place to bring on the bill some internationally recognised African artistes to complement the show.
He said that ‘the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration and other collaborators are working hard to ensure that the concert remains one of the best musical shows on the country’s entertainment calender.’

I started work on Save the Poor in 2003, and the first draft of An Auction Market for Journal Articles in 2004 (Here's a post discussing it at Marginal Revolution.) Submissions to journals started a few years later. They were accepted in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and published in the same issue of Public Choice by coincidence. Oh happy day!
Just don't say that academics move too fast!
Both articles are currently online and FREE to download (open access, woo hoo!)
Save the poor, shoot some bankers
Abstract: Bilateral or multilateral organizations control about 90% of official overseas development assistance (ODA), much of which is wasted. This note traces aid failure to the daisy chain of principal-agent-beneficiary relationships linking rich donors to aid bureaucrats to poor recipients. Waste results when aid middlemen (un)intentionally misdirect ODA. Waste can be reduced by clarifying domestic goals for ODA, using fewer middlemen with greater intrinsic motivation, empowering recipients, and/or replacing bureaucracy with markets.
An auction market for journal articles (with Jens Prufer). Nonpecuniary income indicates the academic impact of an article — facilitating decisions on tenure and promotion. This auction market does not require more work of editors.
Congrats, David... Long gestation periods aside, good to see your publishing abilities haven't been too adversely affected by your blogging activities!
Purely out of interest - and I have yet to read your paper - do you think a journal auction market might increase your chances of another double?
@stickman -- that Q is not directly addressed in the paper, but it could be the result of a REAL market that we describe in the paper.While there was always a possibility that Jodi Arias could take the stand in her own defense, those following her capital murder trial in Phoenix were stunned Monday afternoon when that possibility came true.
With her hair pulled half-up, clad in khakis, a black t-shirt and glasses, Arias spoke directly to the jury when she answered why she killed her ex-boyfriend, Travis Alexander: “The simple answer is he attacked me and I defended myself.”
During her first day of testimony, Arias recalled her childhood and the alleged physical abuse she claimed she suffered at the hands of her own parents.
That testimony sparked a debate Tuesday morning on “Good Morning America” between HLN’s Nancy Grace and ABC’s Dan Abrams about Arias’ demeanor and credibility on the stand.
“She’s a great liar, but she’s a great witness,” Abrams said.
“You’re under her spell,” Grace fired back.
“A mannequin at Saks Fifth Avenue had more life and feeling,” she added.
The Orlando Sentinel reports laughter broke out in the studio when Abrams responded to Grace’s comment, saying “I am…I could have been her next victim.”
Jodi Arias will be back on the stand Tuesday afternoon. Live coverage of her testimony begins at 12:30 p.m. ET on HLN.
Join the conversation...5. We’re too different.
Have you ever heard someone say their relationship failed because they were just “two different people”? Considering men and women are (gasp) different, it’s a little surprising it takes some people half a marriage to figure that out. If you’ve just discovered your spouse is opposite from you, congratulations! You’re on your way to being fabulously happy! Men and women were not created to mirror each other. It is sad that the differences we come to hate about each other are always the things that attracted us in the first place. The vibrant social butterfly who dazzled you morphs into a creature with snakes coming out of her head who won’t stop talking when you just want to go home. The strong and steady guy who calmed you now drives you mad because you can’t pull a sentence longer than three words out of him in one sitting. The cure for this is remembering in writing why you fell in love and recognizing that your spouse is not your enemy and his/her differences make you stronger, not weaker.
Marrying a polar opposite makes stronger parents. When you have children, and chances are you’ll have more than one since the average American has 3.5 children, each one will be completely different from the last. What would happen if an introvert was born to two extroverts? There would be no one to explain the child’s needs or to defend his rights to his feelings. If a strong-willed child had two compliant parents, the child would run roughshod over the family. Parents need to have opposing strengths in order to relate to their children on all levels. My eldest daughter shares many baffling traits with her father, and without his input, I would not know how to get her out of the house without a meltdown. Suddenly, his inability to roll with the punches, which always got under my craw because I can change plans instantly, became an asset when addressing our child’s needs. He knew instantly what to do, and it was as simple as just giving her ample time to adjust to the plan. This was a solution that never would have come to someone who flies by the seat of her shorts..Issaquah Salmon Days wins three Silver Pinnacle Awards

What proof do you have of this? You don't think last year against the Bruins, one of the more physical teams in the league, was a physical and intense series? Is that because is was round 1? He shined in that series.
I'm not a Kessel fan, but I dont go around bashing players with made up stuff because he no longer wears the Bruins jersey. It's just stupid.
Kels, facts;
1) Lots of posters question his game (even when he was a Bruin)
2) Last picked in the all star game a few years ago.
3) Voted #43 best in the NHL by coaches and GM's
4) His plus minus has only been north of zero only one year in the regular season.
5) His final year as a Bruin most of his goals were scored against non playoff teams, Fluto wrote an article about it.
6) He dissed CJ - the infamous weight room comment, and there were a few incidents with Wilson.
All of these things add up to something, you can't pretend they don't exist.
There are a lot of people who don't like his game and I'm one of them.
a) If he scores 40 goals, then we can call him a 40 goals scorer, but not until then.
b) If he wins a Conn Smythe, we can call him a Conn Smythe winner, but not until then.
c) If he wins a Stanley cup, we can call him a Stanley Cup winner, but not until then.
d) Who scored the GWG in OT v. the Leafs in the playoffs game 7? His name wasn't Kessel, it was Bergeron. When he gets an important clutch goal like that, come back and talk to me about it.
Kessels biggest issue is character.
Facts:
Recchi made the comment about 99% of us want to win a cup and don't think about anything else, who was the 1% he was referring to? Kessel.
Chara getting into a pushing and shoving match with Kessel during practice, what was that all about?
Dissing CJ when CJ said he should be visiting the weight room. What's that say about him?
Getting into a scoring slump and what does he say to the press, "maybe it's time for a change." What's that say about him?- Event

Where to see the eclipse
Where to go to observe the eclipse will depend on the following considerations
Duration of the eclipse
Locate towards the centreline of the shadow path to maximise the eclipse duration. Anywhere on the coast between Wonga Beach and Cairns will experience an eclipse of at least two minutes. In contrast, go closer to the edges of the track to maximise Baily's beads and other transitional effects.
Weather
The eclispe occurs at the start of the North Queensland wet season. There is risk of cloud. Onshore breezes may result in cloud build up coastal.
Outlook
Choose a site with a low eastern horizon as the Sun will be low in the eastern sky and you may be able to see the shadow receding after the eclipse. A beach location would be ideal for this (but don't be caugh by an incoming tide). A low horizon to the west may allow you to see the shadow approaching before the eclipse.
Facilities
You may want to be near where you can obtain facilities such as food, drink and toilets. The local authorities may set up public viewing areas with these facilities for the many expected visitors.
UFC heavyweights Stefan Struve and Travis Browne have verbally agreed to face off at UFC 130 in May.
Heavy.com confirmed the fight booking with a source close to one of the fighters on Thursday afternoon. MMAJunkie.com was the first to report the fight.
UFC 130, while not officially announced by the promotion, is expected to take place May 28 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. It will serve as the UFC’s traditional Memorial Day weekend event.
Struve defeated Sean McCorkle via first-round TKO at UFC 124 last month in Montreal. The win was his second consecutive Octagon victory after a knockout loss to Roy Nelson in March.
Browne made his UFC debut against James McSweeney at the Ultimate Fighter 11 Finale in June. He defeated McSweeney near the end of the first round by TKO, but would go to a draw with Cheick Kongo in his second UFC appearance in October.
The only other bout currently rumored for UFC 130 is a welterweight contest between former top contender Thiago Alves and rising star Rick Story.

-.Before intelligence contractor Edward Snowden leaked information on the government’s dragnet collection of phone call records, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., had tried to alert the public to the program’s existence. Unable to discuss classified operations, for years Wyden had been relegated to issuing vague warnings about the government’s spying programs. “When the American people find out how their government has secretly interpreted the Patriot Act,” Wyden said in May 2011, for example, “they will be stunned and they will be angry.”
But there is speculation that Wyden may not be done dropping hints. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee with knowledge of the National Security Agency’s operations, recently the senator has been talking a lot about tracking people’s locations through their cell phones. The NSA, Wyden has pointed out repeatedly, has the authority to collect location information on Americans' cell phones.
The frequent references to cell phone location data -- coupled with the government’s careful denials of location tracking -- have caused privacy and civil liberties advocates to wonder if the NSA is secretly collecting location information as well.
Since Snowden revealed that the government was collecting, in bulk, so-called metadata on virtually all Americans’ phone calls -- the originating and dialed numbers, time and duration of a call -- government officials have been adamant that the location of the calls is not collected, as they have said many times, “under this program.” But Wyden, along with a fellow critic of the government’s spying operations, Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., continues to press the issue of location tracking..
Julian Sanchez, a privacy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, took the speech as a sign. “Wyden’s constant references to location tracking in this context would be nothing short of bizarre unless he had reason to believe that the governments assurances on this score are misleading, and that there either is or has been some program involving bulk collection of phone records,” Sanchez wrote in a blog post Tuesday.
The speech isn’t the only time Wyden has raised the issue in recent days. Back in June, Wyden and Udall sent a letter to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper with a series of questions regarding the NSA programs, including, “Has the NSA collected or made any plans to collect Americans’ cell-site location data in bulk?” On Friday, Clapper responded that the government is not doing so, nor has it made any plans to do so “under this program.” Clapper added that the authority to collect the data does exist and that the director of the NSA would notify Congress if such a program began. He then directed Wyden and Udall to the classified supplement that accompanied the public letter for further information.
This answer, and whatever was contained in the classified response, did not satisfy Wyden and Udall, who blasted intelligence officials for not being straight with the American public. “This response leaves our question of past plans unanswered,” they said in a joint statement after receiving Clapper’s response. “Their violations of the rules for handling and accessing bulk phone information are more troubling than have been acknowledged and the American people deserve to know more details.” It is “deeply troubling,” they said, that the NSA “claims the authority” to collect cell-site information in bulk.
Even if the government is not now collecting cell phone location data in bulk, as Wyden and Udall are constantly reminding the public, it could do so at any time. The legal authority for the phone data sweep comes from section 215 of the USA Patriot Act, often called the “business records” provision, which authorizes collecting personal records considered relevant to a national security investigation. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the secret body that approves surveillance requests, made this bulk collection possible by reinterpreting the use of the “relevance” standard to justify collecting an essentially infinite amount of information.
Under the government’s authority for collecting phone records, cell-site location data would also be fair game -- a position upheld by a federal appeals court this week, the highest court to rule on this issue. On Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that a history of location information gathered by cell towers can be sought for an investigation without a warrant.
There are lots of ways that cell phones can be used to track location, but the Fifth Circuit was the first circuit court to decide that data retrieved from cell towers rather than, for example, through a phone’s GPS capabilities, is not protected under the Fourth Amendment. Cell phones connect to cell towers in order to make and receive calls, meaning that the phone companies know what cell tower was used for every call on their network and in most cases, what direction in relation to the tower that call came from. Tower data does not give exact location coordinates, but it is a good approximation of location.
The legal theory at issue here is called the third-party doctrine, which stipulates that information shared with a third party, like the phone company, is not protected by a “reasonable expectation of privacy” under the Fourth Amendment. These records can therefore be collected under section 215. The Fifth Circuit did not comment on bulk or ongoing collection, the most controversial features of the program revealed by Snowden. But the decision placed cell-site location data, which the opinion called “clearly a business record,” squarely in the same category of information as the phone metadata already being collected on all Americans by the NSA.
“Whether the intel community was looking to do bulk collection or very targeted acquisition of cell site location records, if the Fifth Circuit had gone the other way, they would not be able to do it pursuant to section 215,” said Mark Eckenwiler, a former Justice Department lawyer who focused on electronic privacy issues and had some involvement in this case.
Eckenwiler noted the swirling speculation around the government’s “fairly careful and narrow denials” about location tracking, including the use of the phrase “under this program” as “peculiarly carefully worded.” Without speculating on what the government might be doing with regards to cell-site location data, “the Fifth Circuit has not closed the door to anything that may be going on that we have not yet learned of,” he said.
Another critic of the NSA's phone collection program, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, has long been concerned with geolocation tracking and has also pushed intelligence officials to explain how they view their authority on gathering location data. During a House Judiciary Hearing in July, government officials assured Chaffetz that “we are not collecting that data, not under [section] 215” and that “we are not collecting that data under this program.” During the same exchange, Chaffetz pressed the witnesses on whether location data is considered metadata or whether it is protected under the Fourth Amendment. “This is an evolving area of the law,” Deputy Attorney General James Cole said in response.
A more accurate answer would be that location information is either constitutionally protected or not depending on how it is obtained. When it comes to cell-site tower information, that data is currently free for the taking.
Of course, section 215 is not the only source of the government's authority on location tracking. It is plausible, privacy advocates note, that if a bulk collection program exists for location data, it could be conducted under section 214, which expanded the government's authority to monitor communications electronically for foreign intelligence operations. “If there were any kind of location tracking -- whatever location tracking is done, is done, in my view, in my guess, outside of [section] 215,” said one privacy advocate who asked not to be named, but expressed skepticism that the government was lying about it's authorities under section 215 specifically.
“If you know who someone called, when they called, where they called from, and how long they talked, you lay bare the personal lives of law-abiding Americans to the scrutiny of government bureaucrats and outside contractors,” Wyden said in his speech last week. “This is particularly true if you’re vacuuming up cell phone location data, essentially turning every American’s cell phone into a tracking device.”There's more than 10,000 Hastings College alumni across the country and around the world.

Flexitions was on site to provide product knowledge during installation.I went on a little adventure this morning.
Our family friends were coming by bakery at 8:30 on their way to the beach, and so I needed to plan my run, breakfast, photography and blogging around visiting with them.
I could have gotten up at 6 to run, but since last night was kind of late, I didn’t care to do that.
Option 2 was to run 3 miles to the bakery, meet + greet, and run back. But I’m stuck on a 4 mile plan and didn’t know how 6 would be in this heat. I was also pretty hungry and ate a few handfuls of Cville Cluster plus a date before I left and wanted to let that digest a bit.
Solution:
- Bike there
- Run there
- Meet + greet
- Photograph
- Eat bread
- Bike home
- Shower
The plan took action! Once I arrived at the bakery, I ran 3.2 miles in the neighborhood and came back soaked!! Everything I touched – from the computer mouse to the computer chair – got wet.
Shortly later, Ransome and his family arrived! They’re on they way from Baltimore to Hilton Head and stopped through for bread + sandwiches (and to see us!) Ransome was a dear friend of my grandfather’s and remains close to our family.
While we were hanging out, our newest bread was coming out of the oven!!
CVILLE CRUNCH!!! Formerly known as Flax Oat Bran. My very very very favorite Great Harvest Bread! It is our doughiest bread and it’s also super crunchy from flax + walnuts. Best bread ever!
Today it lived up to my expectations – hot out of the oven and slathered in vanilla almond butter
Wee bit of coffee on the side and breakfast it was.
[I cannot believe how different blogging with my point n shoot is – the photos look so different!]
I’m in desperate need of a shower and then I have to quickly get myself back to the bakery to work the noontime customer service shift!
{ 59 comments… read them below or add one }
Haha, I went running before work once thinking I wouldn’t get that sweaty- wrong, I sweat like a beast! Luckily I work at a gym, so I could shower
Wow — dedication!
Love that you found a way to integrate your workout. And your friends are such a cute family. Hope you have a great Saturday!
You are so good at planning! I’m biking to work today and bringing a change of clothes and some deodorant- I just can’t avoid sweating and there’s no place for me to shower there!
I literally let out a gasp when you revealed what the new bread was. OH MY GOODNESS! “Best bread ever” times 1000! I really, REALLY need to get my butt down to Cville (and pray that you’re making a fresh batch of that stuff when I do!).
I saw your tweet about logistics – I give you credit for all the figuring you do day to day! My brain would probably explode. Keeps ya young I guess right?!
Keeps her younger –
heehee – sick joke, I know.
You are so good at planning things! Sounds like a very productive morning! Hope you had fun with your family friends, have a fantastic saturday!
I wish I was a expert planner like you haha! that new bread sounds/looks amazing
You really do know how to keep yourself busy to the max huh? Awesome job still getting your exercise in and maintaining all commitments 😀 BTW that bread truly looks like the best bread ever!
You look like you got a bit sunkissed! That bread looks delicious! Reading your blog makes me miss bread. I guess the vanilla almond butter would be Paleo-friendly! I may need to get my hands on some of that!
I’ve noticed w/my point & shoot that the pics always look SO much better/more centered on the camera than they do when I load them onto the computer… I’m not sure if this is my inexperience w/ photography or if its the lack of a ‘view finder’! Still hoping to get a DSLR soon, and hoping my pics will be more centered!!
That bread looks YUMmmmmM!
That sounds like a lot of stressful planning to me.
I think the photos look good!
The pictures still look great. Glad you could get your run in!
i feel like my entire life is planning around meeting people and trying to be as hungry as possible – i even have an acronym for it now AHAP
Who needs a word search or crosswords when your brain is running around like that! Geeze, you go girl! I never know how to fit everything in when I’m in a pinch…. I need to go make my list for today, like go make it now…. Guess I better get going, huh>!
You are one busy lady!
Have a great Saturday
Whats a point n shoot – have you got a new camera?
A point and shoot is a small digital camera that doesn’t have as many features as a big DSLR. I used a point and shoot for my first 2 years of blogging and then upgraded to a pro camera. But I still use my point n shoot when I”m doing rough things like biking or hiking
Do you have an iPhone? I can’t believe how good the camera function is. Point and shoot, phone, etc, etc, etc, all in one.
I have Android and my phone camera is not good at all. I haven’t been all that impressed with iPhone photos compared to DSLRs, but for point n shoot quality they sure are good
Oh, totally. It’s got nothing on the DSLR. But sometimes it’s just soooo nice to carry something light. I alternate between carrying full DSLR equipment (3 lenses +tripod) for my video work and sometimes I just need a vacation from it all. Hence, iPhone.
Ah I have a point n shoot then
The DSLR pictures do look very different, much better!
Ransome’s family is just gorgeous! =)
I still have yet to try Almond Butter. You must think I’m crazy. But, it’s the price tag that keeps me from trying some! lol. I always go into the store and stare at a jar of almond butter…for $6…which would probably only last me 5 days (tops. and thats if my dad doesn’t try it). Then I’d have a new addiction….that costs alot. lol
It is very expensive in the UK too – Kath did a post once where she made her own – that could be cheaper if you ever get a good deal on some bulk almonds?
See this is what is wrong with me, I would have totally said oops no time to workout!!!!
Good for you, Kath! You have to make time to squeeze it all in. Thanks for always reminding us to put ourselves on the calendar!
You’re a rockstar! Happy weekend!
Will you be at the store tomorrow? I will be in town visiting friends and would love to stop by and give you some treats from my Kilwins chocolate shoppe 😀
Unfortunately we’re closed on Sundays!!
Will you be here Monday?
Oh boo! Yes !! I will be sure to swing by on our way out of town 😀
I’m glad I’m not the only one who takes planning very seriously :)..sounds like you nailed it!
I don’t know how you ran outside today, but kudos to you!!
Love that doughy bread! Way to make it work logistically – I find half the battle is not getting overwhelmed giving up.
vanilla almond butter?
i need to branch out and try all of these!
You’re so dedicated! Love it! Enjoy your day
So great you were able to fit everything in!
Way to get your workout in! That bread looks especially delicious:-)
That bread sounds unbelievably DELICIOUS! I want to visit GH Cville stat =]
Hi Kath!
I’m a student at UVa, and I absolutely love y’alls Great Harvest – I’m so excited to try the new bread!!!
We’re sold out today, but come in on Tuesday to try it!
That bread looks incredible! I hate blogging with my point and shoot now that I have a DSLR. The pictures don’t look right!
Wow-jam packed morning! That bread looks awesome!! Has me craving some!
Nice looking family, hope they enjoy the beach.
I never realized that Naturally Nutty butters are based out of my home state! The combination of cinnamon vanilla sun butter & mocha putter is amazing!
I’m glad to see priorities are on you to-do list: eat bread
wowww crazy productive morning! And Ransome is such a cool name~haha, first initial thought.
Have a beautiful day Kath!
I love hearing about your logistics each day and how you work your exercise into it, it’s awesome
What a beautiful family…and that bread looks delish! I only have a point n shoot camera…one of these days I’ll get a top notch camera b/c I just looove the quality of your photos!!
I actually didn’t notice any difference in the pics! The point n shoot ones look great, too.
Doughy? Walnuts? Almond? Crunchy from flax seed?
All those words in the same paragraph?!
Food love x1,000,000.
Darling picture of Ransome and his three girls!
Looks yum!
The Cville Crunch bread sounds great, and I like the fact that it is doughy and has flax and walnuts in it!
Way to work it out!
That’s all you ate for breakfast? Weren’t you hungry?
The bread looks yummy!
great job getting everything done! Sometimes it’s so important to be creative in order to fit in workouts! That bread looks delicious…I wish I could eat gluten!
Wow! You are so good at time management- such an inspiration!
I like the bread name change. Cville crunch sounds way more enticing to me than flax oat bran! It looks delish!
Love the RFYL shirt!! Shout out to charlotte
I swoon, I melt, I long!
Great job on fitting it all in! I find it so hard to plan my workouts around the rest of my life sometimes.Front Runners List: Click here to see list completion progress by climbers that log their climbs using Peakbagger.com.

An Hour with: GTA 2
Posted on Wednesday, April 8 2009 @ 14:00:08 Eastern
Ah this takes me back. I remember many a long night spent playing Grand Theft Auto 2, zipping around the city popping heads open as I went. After just downloading the game from the Rockstar website, I thought I'd document my first adventure with GTA 2 in years. Oh and this is written as I'm playing. I'll play a bit, pause and write. Play more, pause, write and so on. So it's raw. Apart from some spell checking, I'm going to leave this as is. Without further adieu....
So I've started in the first district. Despite it being years since last I played the game, I still know this place like the back of my sweaty, vibrating hand. Horrible, nightmare inducing imagery aside, I really feel a sense of nostalgia here. Grand Theft Auto 2 is perhaps the one game I have played more than any other. I literally spent hundreds of hours playing this over the years. Still, there were things I'd forgotten. The background noise, the hum of the city being one of them. After navigating the main menu and starting the game, I notice the sounds and pause the game. Wonderful little touch I hadn't really paid attention to before. But this time, I intend to soak up every last bit of the game I can, truly experience it. Probably not, I'll just kill loads of people and blow sh*t up.
The game starts with me facing a building with a large, flashing neon sign declaring “Jesus Saves.” Ah, the old save point. We know each other well. In front of this building is a ringing payphone, the most important objects of GTA 1 and 2, now forgotten in the glitz and glamour of the current generation of games. F**k your mobile phones, I want these old pieces of sh*t back, us gamers aren't so lazy that we can't... Heh. Yeah we are.
The phone keeps ringing. With the only other people in the vicinity being a mugger and his unfortunate victim, I walk over to the phone, automatically answering it.
“Hey there, Stranger! Welcome to the Downtown District. Stick around if you wanna learn what's going down...”
“No thanks, I think to myself, I'm a professional at this game.” I walk away from the phone quickly, lest I be pulled into a tutorial. A voice erupts from the phone after me:
“Try life in the big city on your own, ya worthless piece-a-sh*t!”
I think briefly about what a rude f**ker the guy is, before setting off into the thick of it. My adventure begins here, finally, free in the city!
Stealing the nearest car, a B-Type, I make my way to the Zaibatsu quarter of the city. They're always good for a job. It's a telling sign at how rusty I am with the game, that I kill at least ten people on the way here, requiring a quick detour to lose the filth in an alleyway, which in turn results in two more deaths. What stupid motherf**ker actually walks down an alleyway when clearly it could be used as an escape route for a fleeing criminal? Idiots. Finally arriving at the Zaibatsu quarter, I run for their nearest payphone. I stop for a minute and admire the patience of the guy at the end of the phone. I usually hang up after seconds of no answer, this guy can go for ****ing days apparently. Picking up the phone, I'm introduced to a man called Trey Walsh. He informs me of a Zaibatsu traitor, selling info to the cops and wants me to steal a cop car from outside the police station. Fair enough.
I hop back into the B-Type, being sure to pick up some armour and a machine gun along the way and begin my drive to the police station. I try to go more carefully this time and it works. Only three people die! I'm proud of this fact. I am. Screw you.
The police car is taken easily, with no retaliation from the fuzz. The radio chatter is another nice touch I never took the time to appreciate before either. It's oddly calming. As soon as the car door as closed, a call comes in from Trey. He wants me to head to a train station and pick up the snitch. Again, sounds easy enough. I flick on the siren and put the foot down. Actually, I'm really just pressing the arrow key on my keyboard, but you know what I mean. I'm having fun flying through the streets in the cop car, it's empowering in a strange way. So much so in fact, that by the time I've reached the train station, I've decided that I don't like Trey very much. F**k his plan, I'm going to flatten this son of a ***** right here. With a splat and an angry phone call, the mission has been failed. Pfft. Like I need him. I'll just work for the Yakuza instead. And if I kill seven or eight or sixty Zaibatsu pigs along the way, so be it.
After wiping out most of the Zaibatsu I can find, I head to the Yakuza sector and go straight for one of their more difficult jobs. A man called Johnny Zoo is on the other end of a Yakuza payphone I find and he wants me to steal a SWAT van in return for the police taking one of his most prized cars. A fair trade, to be sure. Now where can I find a SWAT van?
...
The answer comes fairly quickly. Why go out and seek a SWAT van, when you can stay put and make a SWAT van come to you? The next few minutes are a blur of frantic slaughter. My trusty machine gun and a rocket launcher I found on top of a crate in the Yakuza J-Lab on my way from the Zaibatsu area are put to good use. After killing pretty much anything on two legs in about a square mile, I'm finally beset upon by a SWAT van. Taking my lovely machine gun and running backwards away from the SWAT team, I decimate them and return to claim my... Johnnies, prize. Entering the SWAT van, I'm asked to drop it off in a garage nearby. Along the way, I become quite fond of my new van. It's always been one of my favourite vehicles in the game. Smashing through police blockades isn't the same without one...
But lo! What is this? Another SWAT van following me? 'Tis good. As I drop the van off in the magic garage which makes the police, even the ones just outside that had been following me, completely forget I had done anything wrong, I make my mind up that I want another SWAT van. So after a spot of killing, I take one. Sure it's on fire, but what's the worst that can happen?
Apparently, getting stuck at a barricade and blown up by pistol fire is the worst. WASTED? F**KING WASTED? I don't think so. Homie don't play that ****. I know of a little secret tucked away in the bottom east corner of the map. A ****ing tank. Lets see the bastards blow this up with their pistols.
The journey to the tank is uneventful. It's what happens after I get the tank that's worth knowing about. I basically make my way around the city blowing everything to sh*t, killing everything in my way and destroying enough cars to make every single ex-girlfriend on the planet happy. Or dead. My spree only comes to an end when I hit the wrong key and exit the tank. Not good. I have every law enforcement officer in the northern hemisphere looking for me and I'm practically naked save for some Molotov cocktails, a pistol, machine gun and a rocket launcher with ten rockets. This'll be interesting. I decide to make my last stand somewhere memorable. So I head back down south to the strip club. What? It's a genuine landmark.
In the ensuing moments, hundreds of lives are lost and my armour is completely depleted, my health rapidly going down too. I'm pretty good at dodging bullets, but even I have my limits. Just as death is banging on the door in anticipation, sticking his pee pee through the letterbox, sliding up and down along the door frame and groaning like the audience during a Jason Friedberg/Aaron Seltzer movie, a funny thing happens. I throw a Molotov cocktail (my second last one) at a police car and jump straight after it. As I jump into a wall, I fall through said wall and under the city. I can now quite literally go anywhere by jumping, but to no avail. I can't get above ground again. As such, my time with GTA 2 has come to an end. Until tomorrow, when I play it again and start a whole new era of death and destruction, laughing as my foes fall to my feet and beg for mercy. I will show none.
And they say violent videogames cause violent thoughts. I turned out fine."2012? Independence Day, The Patriot, 10,000 BC, The Day After Tomorrow, Stargate, Godzilla...That's a lot of destruction, ain't it?
Well, we investigated and here are our official findings...
Redcoat Massacre
Movie: The Patriot
Part of the reason that early-American wars were fought using that idiotic battle strategy we like to call the "Let's All Line Up and Shoot Each Other Maneuver" is that musket accuracy was, quite frankly, for sh*t. Had wars at the time been more mobile affairs or had you opted simply to run around the battlefield like a madman, there's a good chance that a guy with a musket standing 10 feet away may just miss. Which is the reason, historically speaking, that the Gibson Family Ambush early on in The Patriot is essentially the colonial equivalent of The Matrix. While the whole affair is badass indeed, the tremendous accuracy of an adult and two 10 year olds pelting redcoats with musket fire and blind-firing pistols while running from tree to tree -- and hitting every damn one pg 'em -- is fairly ridiculous under scrutiny. It is, however, made up for by the ultra-bloody tomahawk savagery that Mel unleashes on those who killed his family and burnt down his farm.
Cannonball Decapitation
Movie: The Patriot
Throughout cinematic history -- at least until recently -- cannons had always been rather polite, if sizeable, killing tools. Men would load their heavy frame, light a fuse, step back and hold their ears. A few moments later there'd be a subtle roar, the cannon would kick and somewhere at the far end of a large field a small explosion of smoke and earth would plume into the air. Perhaps you'd even see a few distant bodies ragdoll through the aftermath, but despite the overall noise level, big-screen cannonball carnage was generally left to a minimum. Until The Patriot, the Revolutionary War drama in which Emmerich simply could not resist the temptation to show, in graphic detail, how a speeding cannonball, fired toward the camera, could potentially take off the head of a British redcoat. Mind you, those Limey bastards were trying to take our land, but the sheer excessiveness of the image elicited a few too many cheers and laughs for a film about the 18th century.
Mothership Destroyed by Hackers
Movie: Independence Day
It is, at least, some small comfort to know that the same technology that allows college kids to hack my iTunes or steal my identity might one day help to liberate mankind from a race of planet-conquering extra-terrestrials. Programming languages -- or, hell, even languages -- aside, it's good to know that ones and zeros still have the power to bring down city-destroying motherships no matter what planet you're from. Sure, the wireless wasn't that great back in 1996 and so, much like walking up hill to school both ways in the snow, you had to manually fly your virus into the orbital control hub in a stolen alien warplane. That said, thanks to Jeff Goldblum and those Mac Geniuses over at Apple, mankind finally won the day.
Blowing up the White House
Movie: Independence Day
For a house under 24-hour guard by some of the world's most lethal and highly trained agents, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue certainly gets attacked a lot. OK, sure, it's because the White House is the seat of power for all of America, but every time some cinematic villain tries to overtake it, they generally succeed. Commonly, it's some kind of terrorist organization, but every so often, it's aliens. And with Independence Day, Emmerich had the opportunity to do what every political party, depending on the administration, would absolutely love to do: blast our Executive branch into a billion tiny pieces with a super-advanced laser beam.

TopBy Edward Douglas ON May 26, 2012 Sony Pictures has provided ComingSoon.net with three cool making-of featurettes from Barry Sonnenfeld’s Men in Black 3, starring Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin, showing how they did three of the key FX sequences from the sci-fi action movie. Whether you’ve already seen the movie or plan on seeing it over this long holiday weekend, these neat behind-the-scenes videos give you a good idea of how much time and work have been put into the movie’s visual FX. First, we have a sequence in which Will Smith’s Agent J takes on a giant fish-like alien along with his partner K, with commentary by Animation Supervisor Spencer Cook: Next, we have a sequence showing how they put together J’s very literal “Time Jump” that takes him back to the year 1969 in search of K, narrated by Visual FX Supervisors Ken Ralston and Jay Redd: Lastly, we have a sequence on how they did the “Monocyle Chase,” a 1969 sequence where Agent J and Josh Brolin’s younger Agent K chase after an alien perp, again with Jay Redd: Men in Black 3 is now playing in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D theaters. show Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Deck hed goes here and here and herp
EVANSVILLE - Shawn Kohlmeyer told the jury in Ted Mueller Jr.'s murder trial Tuesday that he saw Mueller shoot 23-year-old Cedric Watt last fall.
He was the second person in the Vanderburgh Superior Court trial to say they witnessed Mueller, 22, shoot Watt in the 1000 block of West Delaware Street about 3 a.m. Sept. 17.
Mueller is charged with murder and robbery for Watt's death. Also charged is 23-year-old Christopher Bell.
On Monday, Mueller's sister, Angie Mueller, testified that she, too, was there and saw Mueller shoot Watt. She said it was her van in which she, Mueller, Kohlmeyer, Watt and Christopher Bell drove to the street after picking up Watt in Henderson.
A single gunshot wound through the heart and aorta artery killed Watt almost instantly, said Dr. Elmo Allen Griggs on Tuesday, in testimony about the autopsy he did on Watt.
But Kohlmeyer testified that Watt could have been shot more times had the gun Mueller used not misfired. He told the jury that he saw Mueller stand over Watt's body with the gun but that it just made clicking sounds.
Several times during his testimony, Kohlmeyer broke into tears recalling the events surrounding Watt's death. He took the stand in jail clothes and handcuffs because he had been in jail since last Friday for violating his parole on a 2011 burglary conviction.
Kohlmeyer, 23, said he had only known Watt a few months but that the two were like brothers.
"Do you know how he died?" Deputy Prosecutor Levi Burkett asked him.
"Yes I do," Kohlmeyer said.
"How do you know?" Burkett said.
"Because I seen it," said Kohlmeyer, who went on to say that he saw Mueller shoot Watt.
According to Kohlmeyer, Watt yelled out his name as he fell down. He said that he then ran between houses to his girlfriend's apartment on Fulton Avenue and called police.
Police picked up Kohlmeyer at his girlfriend's apartment a day later and questioned him for nine hours. Initially he didn't tell them anything because he was scared, he said, but eventually he decided to talk.
Before Kohlmeyer took the stand, the jury heard testimony that Watt had obtained a half ounce package of marijuana in Henderson, where he was living. Kohlmeyer later testified that the marijuana was worth about $300.
He said Watt had texted him asking for a ride to Evansville and that after calling around, Ted Mueller and Bell agreed to provide the ride using Angie Mueller's van. Kohlmeyer said that when he called Mueller's phone, Bell answered and asked him if he knew where he could get a gun. Kohlmeyer said he didn't and then arranged the ride with Mueller.
He said they picked up Watt who bought them gas and provided marijuana which they smoked in the van.
In Evansville, they stopped on New York Avenue. Kohlmeyer said he got out with Mueller and Bell, and they met a man he didn't know in an alley. He said Mueller and Bell went into a house with the man. Afterward, they got in the van and drove to another street where Mueller and Bell said Watt might be able to sell some marijuana.
Kohlmeyer said he stayed in the van with Angie Mueller. He said Watt returned to get a digital scale because the buyer wanted to see it weighed out.
"He said something didn't feel right," Kohlmeyer said.
So he advised Watt to forget about the sale, and they asked Mueller and Bell to take them to the apartment where Kohlmeyer's girlfriend lived.
Instead, the van stopped around the corner on Delaware Street. Kohlmeyer said he was walking away when he heard a scuffle behind him and turned to see Watt running away from Mueller.
"Chris said ‘Shoot' and Ted (Mueller) shot," he said, in testimony that matched what Angie Mueller said Monday.
Prosecutors are expected to finish with witnesses today. In court Tuesday, defense attorney Dennis Vowels told Judge Robert Pigman that he intended to call Bell as a witness, as well as another Vanderburgh County Jail inmate, Tim Rice. On Monday, Angie Mueller testified that it was Rice who provided Mueller and Bell with the gun.

You’re trying to find a gift for a food-obsessed friend. Or you’re an experienced baker and you’d like to know which cookbook will take you to the next level.
T. Susan Chang, a regular cookbook reviewer for NPR.org and The Boston Globe, has come out with a cookbook ratings app, dubbed Cookshelf.
The app is easy to use and sorts cookbooks (on a scale of 1-5) by skill level, by the level of recipe innovation, by its gift-giving potential, and by whether it’s a “keeper,” with recipes that you’ll return to as favorites again and again.
For example, Chang gives All About Braising by Molly Stevens a 5 in the “keeper’ category, calling it a “forever” cookbook. Meanwhile, The Unofficial Downton Abbey Cookbook—you can try your hand at Lady Mary’s Crab Canapés—rates only a 1. “Here and gone (trendy and ephemeral”), sniffs Chang.
You can use CookShelf to sort cookbooks numerous ways, from Mother’s Day to Gluten-free. Each entry contains sample recipes, a note on how long the recipe will take, and a description of how readily ingredients can be located at your local supermarket.
Each cookbook rating is preceded by a summary of it’s pros and cons. Chang is a lively and knowledgeable writer and her intros are informative and engaging. If you want more, you can click on Chang’s full reviews in The Boston Globe.
A couple of quibbles with this otherwise outstanding app for both casual cooks and collectors. The design is a bit clunky and it would be useful when you sort through a category to have both the name of author as well as the title listed.

First impressions of Square's "not for playing" sequel to the much-loved RPG classic.May 09, 2004 0 9)One of Raphael Holzdeppe’s first competitions of 2013 was the Indoor Meeting in Karlsruhe, an IAAF Indoor Permit Meeting. The year ended up being his most successful one to date, so the World Pole Vault champion will return to the German city on 1 February with the aim of kick-starting another outstanding season.
At the 2013 edition of the meeting, Holzdeppe finished third behind long-time rivals Renaud Lavillenie and Bjorn Otto. Buoyed by his success in Moscow at the IAAF World Championships, the 24-year-old has already made several changes during his winter training and is keen to achieve his first victory at the first IAAF Indoor Permit meeting of 2014.
“I’ve never jumped so consistently high,” said the Olympic and European bronze medallist of his recent training sessions. “I hope I can take this form through to the indoor season. My goals for the year are to break six metres and of course win the European title.”
This will be Holzdeppe’s fifth appearance at the Indoor Meeting in Karlsruhe. He first competed there as a junior in 2008 and finished fifth. After fourth-place finishes in 2009 and 2010, his third-place finish earlier this year was his best result in Karlsruhe. Now he wants to win.
“I like Karlsruhe very much; I set my indoor PB there,” said Holzdeppe of the 5.82m mark he set at the 2012 German Indoor Championships.
Exciting competitions are also guaranteed in other events in Karlsruhe. Athletes coordinator Alain Blondel revealed this week that in addition to the Pole Vault, the other men’s disciplines will be the Shot Put, 60m Hurdles, 800m, 1500m and 3000m. Women will compete in the Long Jump, 60m, 60m Hurdles, 1500m and 3000m.

I fell in love with Mary Baldwin, and I feel it more deeply each year as the seasons turn. It is clear to me as I meet with alumnae/i far and wide that this is an almost universal response among those who have experienced Mary Baldwin as student, teacher, or staff. Whether on the road celebrating the launch of our Schools of Excellence, meeting one on one with donors, or visiting with those who return to campus for Reunion and other events, I hear many of the same questions over and over again. So, I will devote my column to answering a few of the ones I am asked most often. 2 Summer 2011 PHOTO BY WOODS PIERCE BOARD OF TRUSTEES 2010�11 Margaret E. McDermid '95, chair M. Sue Whitlock '67 vice chair , Aremita R. Watson, secretary Pamela Fox, president What are students like these days? As the profiles on page 9 demonstrate, our students are eager to learn and achieve, work hard to reach their full potential with the guidance of dedicated faculty, and step up to new challenges. Demographically they represent America -- highly diverse in ethnic, religious, and socioeconomic background. Wherever they come from, the Baldwin DNA works its magic on them. By the time they graduate they are well on their way to becoming their best selves, with the poise and confidence to take the lead, the compassion to serve, and the courage to change the world. They inspire me and renew my spirit. our alumnae/i and friends is more important than ever, particularly for the Annual Fund, academic programs, scholarships, and capital projects. Where does my Annual Fund money go, and what difference does it make? A strong Annual Fund supports the college's daily operations and helps the college and its students in every way imaginable, but primarily it provides scholarship assistance based on both merit and need. The Annual Fund allows our students the benefit of an exceptional education. What are the college's core strengths? Our core strengths are what they have been for almost 170 years: academic excellence, entrepreneurial spirit, and the education of the whole person. Since 1842 this institution has been exceptionally good at providing transformative, liberal education that empowers students to build lives of purpose and achievement. Our community attracts faculty dedicated to teaching who create a learning environment both challenging and supportive, where students conduct original research and are imbued with the importance of civic and global engagement. We are innovative in accomplishing our mission, developing and delivering quality programs that are needed by the students of the time. In Rufus Bailey's time, innovation took the form of formal education for girls, a radical idea then. In Mary Julia Baldwin's time, after the triumph of staying open throughout the Civil War, entrepreneurialism is seen in her introduction of university-level training and the vibrant growth the Seminary. More recently, we introduced the Adult Degree Program, unique options like PEG and VWIL within the Residential College, graduate programs, and new majors such as social work that broaden our market while serving our mission. Other strengths include the beauty of our historic campus and our location in vibrant downtown Staunton. Can a women's college survive in the 21st century? I sincerely believe that not only can we survive; we can and we will truly thrive. Recent studies confirm that women's colleges continue to offer unique benefits, even in today's world when women outnumber men on coed campuses nationwide. Mary Baldwin's distinctive historical identity is a priceless asset in the marketplace; if the Residential College were to go coed we would not only lose that but also incur significant expenses. Our adult and graduate programs, of course, have welcomed men from the beginning. Remaining committed to our status as a women's college with regard to the Residential College is both the right thing to do for the sake of our students and a smart business decision. Applications to the Residential College have increased 100 percent in two years. This year we received more than 5,000 applications from 49 states. We are on the map and on the move. And, just wondering ... why is our mascot a squirrel? At the center of Mary Julia Baldwin's family crest is the figure of a squirrel, representing resourcefulness and industry. The acorn and oak leaves in the crest represent strength and potential. In the 1970s or early 1980s our athletic teams began to call themselves the Squirrels in reference to the animal prominent on the college's official seal, which is modeled on the Baldwin crest. The Fighting Squirrels moniker has garnered attention nationally on sports blogs, National Public Radio, Animal Planet, ESPN, in syndicated columns, and even in student newspapers on other campuses. Today, our students joyfully embrace their mascot and absolutely love it when Gladys -- as she is known -- shows up in pearls at athletic and social events. The image on the previous page is our furry friend carved in ice on display at the Schools of Excellence celebration in Charlotte, North Carolina. These events around the country have been an amazing way for alumnae/i, parents, prospective students, and guidance counselors to learn about academic excellence at Mary Baldwin and to meet the ambitious young women who represent our student body. What are the top threats? The recent global recession has been challenging -- more so perhaps for Mary Baldwin than for some other colleges because of our small size and modest endowment. We responded through prudent budget adjustments that put academics and students first. Fortunately, adult and graduate programs can help create economies of scale without losing the personalized approach that is our hallmark. All the indicators and financial ratios show significant improvement over the past two years, and we have carefully integrated financial modeling into our strategic planning to make sure that trend continues as we move forward. We continue to see rising financial need among our students. Finally, some of our beautiful buildings need updating to continue to serve our students well. Phase I of the Pearce Science Center renovation is a big step in the right direction, and we must continue to build momentum. The support of -- Dr. Pamela Fox, president Mary Baldwin College Magazine 3 Major MBCNews Accomplishments ma = major mi = minor c = certificate New Fields of Study Showcase MBC's Finest Mary Baldwin College's newest undergraduate majors combine powerful community resources and the passions of faculty members to give students uncommon opportunities to interact with the world around them. American studies, criminal justice, and Renaissance studies join a list of more than 50 majors and minors offered at MBC and highlight some of the college's latest courses as well as signature programs that have gained international acclaim. ma An American tradition Businessman and educator Keith Folsom wanted to learn more about "who we are and how we got here" as a nation. Becoming one of the college's first American studies majors was a natural decision. "I was interested in a major that would help me be an effective elementary teacher, one that would give me something to excite young children to be better students and citizens, said Folsom, " the co-owner of a Greenville, Virginia, water garden supply business who began substitute teaching a few years ago. At 51, he is working on earning teacher licensure while two of his three children study for their own college degrees. Initially lured by the history courses included in the major -- such as Virginia History and Survey of U.S. History to 1877 -- Folsom is intrigued by the other required courses that will give him a wellrounded picture of the country as a player in the global arena. "I have found learning about human geography to be completely engrossing, Folsom said at " the beginning of spring semester. He plans to earn the American studies degree with a concentration in American studies for educators in hopes of finding a full-time teaching position. There are four other areas of concentration available in American studies: American ethnicity, culture, and race; global America; American public life; and American arts and letters. An interdisciplinary field that focuses on the study of the cultures of the United States, the American studies repertoire includes transnational, global, and comparative perspectives. Catharine O'Connell, vice president for academic affairs and dean of the college, joins faculty members who have backgrounds in economics, communication, history, art, sociology, and political science to teach courses in the program. mi c 4 Summer 2011 ma Learning to `protect and serve' Adult Degree Program student Dominika Seal couldn't be more proud to be the face of Mary Baldwin's new criminal justice major on the college's website. Pictured in uniform on the program home page; Seal is eager to apply what she learns in the classroom to her position as a sheriff's deputy in Page County, Virginia. "The courses I'm taking re-emphasize many things that I encounter day to day. They are opening up a world of information and different angles and providing me with more resources, said Seal, who " drives about an hour and a half twice a week for in-class interaction with other students. In spring semester 2011, Seal was enrolled in 12 credit hours under the criminal justice heading, including Criminology, Police Field Operations, Juvenile Delinquency, and Psychology as a Social Science. In response to the growing demand for skilled criminal justice professionals, the major is designed to familiarize students with the criminal justice system and judicial processes, the challenges communities face, responses to crime, and self-awareness in addition to the "how-to" of crime scene investigation, police procedure, and forensics. The senior internship is an essential part of the curriculum. Community partners such as local police departments, the Office on Youth, and Middle River Regional Jail provide opportunities for hands-on experience throughout the course of study. The new major is an ideal avenue to explore MBC's commitment to community outreach. Students and recent graduates have already had the opportunity to work with sociology professors Daniel Stuhlsatz and Carey Usher to assist a local group dedicated to preventing gang violence. The researchers recently unveiled the first part of a report that will help the Staunton-AugustaWaynesboro (SAW) Coalition determine the best way to intervene and measure progress in its crusade to curb gang activity. Recently retired Waynesboro Police Chief Douglas Davis also serves on the criminal justice faculty, giving students a glimpse of law enforcement from behind the badge.

Criminal justice is available through the College for Women in Staunton and through the Adult Degree Program in Staunton, Roanoke, and Weyers Cave. It is an intense discipline anchored in the liberal arts that reinforces MBC's commitment to preparing graduates to make a difference in the lives of others. ma newsnotes Spinning a New Web Quotes and stories from students, alumnae/i, and faculty are front and center on MBC's new website, launched in fall 2010.

The redesign recently earned an Award of Excellence from the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education. Nurturing Renaissance women and men The renowned Blackfriars Playhouse just two blocks from campus and Mary Baldwin's oneof-a-kind Shakespeare and Performance graduate program have infused Staunton with Renaissance culture. Now MBC undergraduates have the opportunity to study in-depth the era that was defined by groundbreaking discoveries in science, navigation, and art; a dramatic shift in religious thought; and a rediscovery of classical texts and architecture. Dr. Sarah Kennedy, professor of English, led the effort to create the Renaissance studies major and teaches its introductory course, Defining the Renaissance. "Students discover how modern the Renaissance world is, and how much the modern world is defined by the Renaissance, she says. "They find that the very buildings they inhabit are " structured on principles of Renaissance architecture and that their habits of mind are shaped by the thinkers of the Renaissance. What we think about romantic love is a product of the Renaissance; the notion of your `one and only' isn't possible without Renaissance sonneteers. Romantic comedies you love onscreen have the same basic plot that Shakespeare and his contemporaries put on the stage. " The proximity of the Blackfriars allows for special attention to Renaissance drama. Students can immerse themselves in an active, professional theater devoted to performances of that period and learn experientially through conversation with actors and directors, guided tours of the playhouse, and interaction with MBC professors at plays. Renaissance scholars are also encouraged to pair the major with additional courses in history, art history, English, or theatre to prepare for innovative careers in law, teaching, directing, acting, scholarship, editing, and publishing.

Transici�n New Gateway Offers Transition for Latina Students By Brittany Green '11 Taking Care of Health Care After an intense and exhaustive review, the college's undergraduate Health Care Administration program earned its third consecutive recertification by the Association of University Programs in Health Administration (AUPHA). Mural with a Mission Dozens of students commemorated Martin Luther King Day as "a day on, not a day off" by contributing to a community mural at Valley Mission homeless shelter in Staunton. In fall 2011, Mary Baldwin College will introduce a new Leadership Gateway. The new Latino Culture Gateway will serve an increasing number of Hispanic students at MBC, as well as attract students who are interested in learning more about Latino culture. "The Latino Culture Gateway is part of our efforts to recruit, enroll, and serve Latina students at Mary Baldwin College as well as to promote cross-cultural understanding among students of all ethnic backgrounds," said Andrew Modlin, executive director of enrollment management. About 7 percent of MBC students are Latina, with roots in Guatemala, Peru, Mexico, El Salvador, and several other countries. The college unveiled the concept of Leadership Gateways in fall 2009 as part of a comprehensive first-year program to help transition new students into college life and get them quickly involved in the campus community. Of the seven initial gateways, some -- such as the Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership -- were already established programs, and others were more recent ideas, such as Women for Healthy Lifestyles and Spencer Citizens. New gateways will continue to be added in response to higher education admissions trends and MBC initiatives. Led by Associate Professor of Spanish Ivy Arbul� and Assistant Professor of Chemistry Peter Ruiz-Haas, programs connected with the Latino Culture Gateway will address the linguistic, cultural, and social heritage that may make it more difficult for Hispanic students and their families to adapt to life on campus and to communicate effectively with college personnel. Like all of MBC's gateways, the program will serve as an introduction to academics, and participants will be encouraged to enroll in courses such as U.S. Latino Literature and Culture and Spanish language classes. A special section of the introductory course offered to all freshmen, MBC 101: Orientation to College, will be created with Latina students in mind. "I think the Latino Culture Gateway will bring in more diversity and will help bring students together," said Yesenia Ruiz '14, a member of the student club Latinas Unidas. "MBC is diverse, but we can still work to improve it. With this gateway, we can introduce more of our culture to other students, faculty, and staff." Members from the gateway will be encouraged to work with Latinas Unidas to plan MBC's Hispanic Heritage Month and a Hispanic Film Festival. The group will also read a novel by a Latino author, Arbul� said, and cooking or dance classes could also be included, based on students' interests. "The creation of the gateway is important because it is another step forward that Mary Baldwin has taken on its path to becoming an inclusive community," Arbul� said. "We send a strong message with what we describe as one of this college's strengths: its diversity." 6 Summer 2011 PHOTO BY WOODS PIERCE Off the Field, Now Online New athletics blogs offer wellness tips and sports insight for the community beyond the Physical Activities Center.

Fighting Squirrels Embrace NCAA Campaign Mary Baldwin College athletes and coaches have always valued competition in Division III sports, and now they are benefitting from a national campaign that highlights the impact of intercollegiate athletics at smaller colleges and universities. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) recently launched an initiative to celebrate the defining characteristics of Division III (DIII) athletics, where the focus is on nurturing competitive scholarathletes, not securing prime-time television slots or earning big scholarships. Like DIII athletes in nearly 450 schools around the country, MBC competitors work every day to balance their passion for sport with excellence in the classroom and service to the community. "Division III focuses on the term `student-athlete' with the emphasis on `student,'" said softball player Kelsey Still '13. "Academics are so important because DIII athletes are most likely pursuing a career other than professional athletics. " In the NCAA, Division I athletics dominate media coverage and of being a school that puts sportsmanship first and is a living example of fair competition, Still " said. As vice chair of the President's Society, sophomore class treasurer, peer mentor, and a member of the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee, Still exemplifies the well-roundedness promoted by the DIII initiative. Involvement in multiple activities "enhances athletes' Mary Baldwin experience and creates changemakers who will represent our institution when they graduate, " Spalding said. "We hope they recognize that lessons learned on the court, course, and field can be carried over to the challenges of everyday life. " The campaign also reinforces that the spirit of competition is alive and well in DIII -- although teams might not have a national audience for every game. "Competition in Division III is more about love of the game; we are out there giving it our all without the incentive of a scholarship. We work just as hard, Still said. " Mary Baldwin College Magazine 7 MBCNews S U S A N B R I T TO N 1 9 4 7- 2 010 Education Professional Helped Students Reach `Fullest Potential' according to retired Director of Graduate Teacher Education (GTE) Carole Grove. But her brave two-year battle with lung cancer ended October 12, 2010. "Susan was a splendid colleague and determined professional who was devoted to the task of the best possible teachers for our classrooms," said Jim Harrington, GTE director and professor of education. A graduate of James Madison University, Britton began her career in education at Thomas Dixon Elementary School, where she taught for 22 years. During her tenure at Mary Baldwin, she initially served as a teaching partner, heading back to the classroom to educate the next generation of teachers. She worked for several years as assistant director of MAT, where she was intrumental in helping budding educators find field placements and student teaching experiences. Britton formed an enduring bond with Professor Emerita of Psychology Lesley Novack as her first teaching partner. "She had a strong desire to help our students to work to their fullest potentials. Ultimately, she knew this was the `gift' that she could give to the thousands of students who would eventually be taught by the MAT teachers she helped to educate," Novack said. Former student assistant Anna Lauth '09 also lauded Britton's dedication and spirit: "She was an inspirational woman to work with. She always made my day brighter in the education department." Britton was also a devoted member of First Presbyterian Church, where she served as an elder and participated in the Sharing the Faith Women's Circle "I remember how excited she would be when one of our students excelled in student teaching," Novack said. "She understood the power of education, and she was always excited to be part of the process." When Susan Britton passed away at age 62, those who knew her agreed it was just too soon for her to go. Britton had just retired from 18 years of service to Mary Baldwin College, primarily in the Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program. She was getting ready to enjoy being with her family and her tiny companion, Woody, a miniature Daschund, O . A S H TO N T R I C E 1 9 2 0 - 2 010 `Kind and Gentle' Professor Counseled Many "He and my mother were class sponsors, and he was very involved with the student body outside of class. There were no counseling or psychological services on campus at the time, so I remember him fielding evening calls from time to time to help out a student who needed guidance," said his son, Ashton D. Trice. At times, the student-teacher relationship made humorous stories for the younger Trice, who took over his father's role on the psychology faculty when he retired in 1986. The elder Trice, a WWII veteran, was trained as an experimental psychologist, earning his PhD from University of Virginia in 1951, just a few years after he began teaching at MBC. His passion was no less evident at the end of his 37-year tenure than when he was a new faculty member. "I remember Dr. Trice with great fondness [as] a kind and gentle man. As a psychology major, it was a great privilege to work for him as a teaching assistant," wrote Jill Johnson Horton '83 when news of Trice's passing was noted on the Mary Baldwin College Facebook page. Ethel Smeak '53, professor emerita of English, considers herself fortunate to have known Trice as a teacher and as a colleague. He had one of the "nicest smiles I have ever seen on a person. He seemed to be able to handle anything with grace and kindness," she said, noting his compassion in the classroom and his effectiveness as a faculty committee leader. A lifelong advocate for the mentally ill and those with mental disabilities, Trice served as staff psyhologist at Western State Hospital and, later, the DeJarnette Center, and he was a longtime school psychologist for Waynesboro City Schools. He was also a docent at Staunton's Frontier Culture Museum. His other interests included baseball and opera, which melded beautifully on family trips to Cooperstown, New York, to visit the Baseball Hall of Fame and sample opera at a summer festival there. In an era when Mary Baldwin College functioned very much like a close-knit family, Professor Emeritus of Psychology O. Ashton Trice was one of its father figures, its personal counselor, and life coach. Although it had been 25 years since Trice, 90, stood at the front of an MBC classroom, his death on October 11, 2010, was a significant loss for the college community. 8 Summer 2011 MBC ARCHIVES MBC ARCHIVES SpotLight | MBC students shine in national arenas < Victoria Rosborough '12 was accepted to the prestigious undergraduate research program at Yale's Center for Research on Interface Structures and Phenomena (CRISP).

Just a few days later, the Reverend Patricia Hunt, retired MBC chaplain and Clinton's original rescuer, wrote to me, "I so wanted this day never to come, no matter how impossible or irrational that is. Amen. " It was a bit of the magic that was Clinton, the Mary Baldwin College cat, that he seemed to know the human psyche better than most of us. His uncanny way of picking out the one person walking by who needed time with him -- maybe just to listen to that person's troubles or struggles, or to share a secret with the cat who would tell no tales. He also loved to celebrate happy times and be front-and-center for special occasions (especially on Tyson Terrace, where he was known to pounce onto tables to listen to speakers). In every office on his "beat, he jumped on the desks of the " people in need of some calming or caring -- or maybe, sometimes, when he needed a little TLC himself -- the best kind of break from workday commotion. Born sometime in the early 1990s, he was rescued from a local animal shelter by Hunt. The young Clinton stayed in her home only a short time before he discovered the possibilities of being king-of-the-hill, free and independent on the 54-acre campus. Around his 14th year, he lost weight, seemed run down, and was diagnosed with diabetes. Medication and a restricted diet were prescribed, and, much to Clinton's chagrin, we O assume, posters went up around campus asking people not to feed him treats or selections from the Pub menu. Shortly after a harrowing disappearance in summer 2006, it was time for Clinton's semiretirement. He came to live with me by night and by day he was in my office at MBC so we could monitor his insulin stability and his friends could visit. He lived well, and well beyond his initial prognosis of a few months. There was one last great adventure for this free spirit. I moved to California in 2009 and he came, too. I have often wondered what he thought about that long, long car ride and new environment. Somehow, he maintained his cool-cat demeanor. Clinton has earned a place in Mary Baldwin College folklore. His life is recorded for history through the publicity and media coverage he garnered, and his story is part of the time capsule encased in one of the columns on the Student Activities Center balcony.

David Atchley joined the Mary Baldwin College community at a critical time for fundraising for the college. During his tenure as vice president for advancement, special assistant to the president, and vice president of the School of Pharmacy at Presbyterian College, that institution set a record for fundraising. His experience overseeing a successful campaign to fund a renovation of Prebyterian's science facilities gives him valuable background as he leads MBC fundraisers in securing additional donations for an overhaul of Pearce Science Center. "Mary Baldwin has the right ingredients that will converge to meet ambitious goals. It will take everyone to move forward, said Atchley, a " native of Texas who worked for several years at his alma mater, Wofford College, and GTE Corportation (now Verizon) before Presbyterian. An entreprenuer and business leader, he also founded two companies, End2End and Integrated Education Systems, Inc., which provide state-of-the-art public safety solutions. Atchley began meeting MBC alumnae/i, faculty, staff, and trustees long before settling into his office on campus. "MBC has a solid foundation in the traditional undergraduate arena and a strong reputation in the Southeast, " he said. "Those factors, combined with the new efforts to grow and strengthen programs, make the college poised for an era of great momentum.

Geared toward a new, hands-on, research-based approach to undergraduate science education, the building featured laboratories placed adjacent to faculty offices and several spaces designated for independent student experimentation. It was designed to encourage student engagement in addressing real scientific problems. PHOTO BY WOODS PIERCE Ap 39.098 19 That was more than 40 years ago. Chemistry major Anastasia Blake '12 is studying edocrinedisrupting compounds and how they affect the quality of local waterways, an extension of research conducted by Assistant Professor of Chemistry Peter Ruiz-Haas. Mary Baldwin College Magazine 13 T he curricular commitment reflected in the blueprint for Pearce has strengthened, but the building itself has become increasingly outmoded -- scientifically, technologically, and functionally. This can make it challenging to recruit to MBC students interested in science and makes it harder for faculty to establish sustainable research programs appropriate for undergraduates. "Science graduates need to participate in research at the undergraduate level to be competitive for graduate school and careers, said Lydia Petersson, director of spon" sored programs and undergraduate research. "Our senior project requirement gives MBC students an edge by giving each one the opportunity to participate in collaborative research with faculty. That also means, however, that we must have the programs and facilities that can support students in developing meaningful projects. " Stimulus grant, Schools of Excellence spur facility facelift Recent grants and a shift in the college's academic structure will make it possible for the renovation of Pearce Science Center to begin in June -- giving science study at MBC a boost with renewed facilities and new possibilities. Helping to propel Pearce construction is a $1.2 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) that stems from the Federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, part of an estimated $31 billion dedicated to science. The grant is big news for Staunton, too. According to statistics tracked by the governor's office, the grant is one of the largest stimulus sums awarded in the city so far. "The NSF is among the most prestigious science funding agencies on the planet, and we see this grant as confirmation by scientists that our enthusiastic embrace of undergraduate research will put MBC on the map as an exceptionally strong college for preparing women for careers in science, said Associate Professor of Chemistry Karl Zachary. " A $100,000 challenge grant from the Mary Morton Parsons Foundation of Richmond and contributions to date from alumnae/i and friends of Mary Baldwin add another $900,000 to renovation funds. The NSF grant provided the key to stimulating renovation plans just as the college introduced a School of Science -- one of four Schools of Excellence that provided a new academic and co-curricular framework at MBC beginning in fall 2010. Each of the Schools connect theory and practice and includes civic engagement activities, national and international partners, affiliations with service organizations, changemaker jobs and internships, career planning services, and volunteer and alumnae/i connections. "The Schools are part of a movement in higher educa14 Summer 2011 tion toward collaboration across disciplines, said Catharine " O'Connell, vice president for academic affairs and dean of the college. "We're building on our ability to create successful academic connections and, as a result, we'll see even richer examples of cross-disciplinary research, which is extremely important, especially in the world of science. " The grant will cover the first phase of the project, including upgrading approximately 8,875 square feet of the 46,000-square-foot science complex. Reconfigured labs and a new, open, public entranceway will generate the most dramatic visible changes in the building. Just as critical are improvements that will be made to the heating and cooling, electrical, and technological networking systems. Glass walls that allow visitors to see research in progress and displays that highlight student work are part of the plans for the new entrance, according to Director of Facilities Management Brent Douglass. Future contributions will be used to create an inviting new outdoor entrance on the ground floor of Pearce -- where many people enter when attending events in Francis Auditorium. Four new areas for collaborative research highlight the college's distinctive academic strengths in science. The initial renovation will address facilities primarily used in two of these fields: environmental systems monitoring and neuroscience and cellular signaling. Spaces used for behavioral and developmental studies and supramolecular chemistry, molecular recognition, and materials chemistry are slated to be upgraded in future phases of the renovation, which will require additional funding. Pearce's upgrade promises to foster impromptu discussions and demonstrations that take place after class. Associate Professor of Biology Paul Deeble often sees students -- unable to find study areas -- using lab space to work on an assignment related to another class. Students also often crowd around a set of sofas on the third floor, a gathering spot that is centrally located, but limited in space. "Science is almost always collaborative -- whether it is a formal group project in lab or students simply trying to figure out a scientific concept, Deeble said. "We often say " that our students `learn by doing,' and that is facilitated when those students can `learn by doing' in collaboration with their colleagues and professors ... in receptive gathering spaces in the science building. " Students need to be able to gather with easy access to a computer after class or while working in focus groups on their senior projects, he explained. New spaces created by the renovation, along with wireless access, will "help students formulate hypotheses and develop experiments" in shared ways. Also on the agenda is the transformation of Pearce into an environment that nurtures learning for a more diverse student body and fosters collaboration with nearby institutions such CONTINUED ON PAGE 16 RENDERINGS PROVIDED BY GEIER BROWN RENFROW ARCHITECTS PHOTOS BY WOODS PIERCE "We often say that our students `learn by doing,' and that is facilitated when those students can `learn by doing' in collaboration with their colleagues and professors... in receptive spaces in the science building." -- Paul Deeble, associate professor of biology (pictured top left) Mary Baldwin College Magazine 15 CONTINUED FROM PAGE 14 as University of Virginia (UVa), James Madison University, and Washington and Lee University. "Our faculty and students will be better able to develop research programs that will be of interest to potential partners, " Petersson said. She cites Visiting Assistant Professor of Biology Anne Allison as an example. After a postdoctoral fellowship in breast cancer research at UVa, Allison is continuing her relationship with that insitution by involving MBC students in her research there. "That is the kind of thing that will be made easier and more sustainable when faculty-student teams have improved facilities here, Petersson said. Zachary is also confident that "the final " renovation will dramatically improve our ability to expose young women to modern research in environmental chemistry, biochemistry, nanoelectronics, materials chemistry, and fundamental physical chemistry research. " Basic chemistry concepts can still be introduced using equipment such as beakers and flasks, but those fields increasingly depend on sophisticated instrumentation, he explained. Potentiostats, mass spectrometers, atomic absorbance spectrometers, ultra-high vacuum equipment, and more are part of the well-equipped lab facility that Zachary hopes to help create in Pearce. "Just last year, we sent a graduate to the top-rated analytical chemistry graduate program in the country. With renovated facilities, we will be able to do more of that for a larger number of students, he said.

Now, she is ready to get MBC student researchers in on the action. "Memristors are relatively easy to fabricate, so there is the rare opportunity for undergraduates to be involved, from making the devices to testing them, start to finish, said Gergel-Hackett, assistant " professor of physics. "Not much is known yet about what is physically happening within the flexible device, creating the potential for a wealth of discovery and breakthrough research. " Gergel-Hackett has filed for a joint patent on the flexible memristor, giving her students one-of-a-kind access to knowledge and techniques for experimenting with the device. This spring, she began working with a few students who became interested in her research after the presentation she gave when she was interviewing for the position at MBC. The renovation of Pearce and commitment of resources to science study will encourage students' efforts and validate their work, she said. Bendable memristors are made by spinning titanium dioxide onto a thin piece of plastic -- think an overhead projector transparency sheet -- that contains a single electrical contact. A second electrical contact is added on top of the titanium dioxide layer, completing the system. Functioning like a resistor with memory, the memristor has unique electrical characteristics compared to typical electrical components. The pliable version has additional benefits because it can function and retain memory while being repeatedly bent or twisted. "These flexible devices could be used to make tiny, wearable sensors that could be used to inexpensively monitor medical information such as blood pressure, heart rate, and blood sugar levels, " Gergel-Hackett said. PHOTO COURTESY OF NADINE GERGEL -HACKETT Nadine Gergel-Hackett, assistant professor of physics, shows off a flexible memristor. She helped develop the tiny electrical devices while at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The federal physical science research laboratory has helped make advancements to items such as DNA diagnostic "chips," pollution-control technology, smoke detectors, and high-speed dental drills. Mary Baldwin College Magazine 17 PHOTOS BY WOODS PIERCE PHOTO BY WOODS PIERCE "There are multiple collaborative research projects going on in Pearce. Modern science depends heavily on progress enabled by multiple perspectives, and it is a good sign that projects like these are emerging very naturally. " -- Karl Zachary, associate professor of chemistry CONTINUED FROM PAGE 16 sperm counts in humans and animals have been decreasing over the past few decades. " Blake, Alexis St. Claire '12, and Katie Jo Galayda '10 tested water samples with a newly developed yeast estrogen screen and found that synthetic hormone levels tend to be high in streams near agricultural land. With grant funding from the National Institutes of Health, Blake continued gathering data, discerning that EDC levels are higher in winter and that levels rise after heavy rain. She presented those findings at the competitive Mid-Alantic Regional Conference for Undergraduate Scholarship last fall. The undergraduate research experience at MBC is unique in that it positions our researchers as "mini-graduate students, " Ruiz-Haas said. "They get to work on a hands-on research project, go out into the field with my supervision, and use pretty sophisticated [tools]. I hope their work turns into publishable results that they can put on a resum�. At a bigger university, you have to really fight for research opportunities like this, he added. " Long-term research is dependent on the work of multiple students over several years. Being able to contribute to a body of work not only leads to being published, it also prepares students for the kind of independent research required in graduate school, medical school, or in a position at a research laboratory. Seeing students' work is especially rewarding to Ruiz-Haas, who has maintained a research interest in EDCs since he was an undergraduate. The situation is similar for many members of the science faculty as they guide students on work that they have nurtured for years. One example is the work of Abby Turner `09, which "planted the trunk of a tree that now has more branches than I have students to climb, said Zachary. Turner investigated the host" guest properties of the cucurbit[7]uril, or CB[7], molecule, which spawned research and testing of the slightly larger CB[8] molecule's interaction with serotonin by Margie Bivans `10. Bivans brought Deeble's interest and expertise into her project, testing the hypothesis that introducing CB[8] would cause prostate cancer cells to decrease in growth. This academic year, three students continued offshoots of Turner's project -- teaming up with Visiting Assistant Professor of Chemistry Maria Craig to investigate how the DNA-binding protein LL may act -37 as a guest when CB[8] is the host molecule, and looking at how 18 Summer 2011 At the Intersection of Knowledge organicmetallic complexes and other amino acids serve as guests. Their goal is to understand CB interactions with other molecules well enough that scientists can predict what complexes can be formed and what their properties will be. One of the most established ongoing research projects at Mary Baldwin is led by Associate Professor of Psychology Louise Freeman. For several years, student researchers have assisted her in studying the effects of hormones -- specifically sex hormones -- on reproductive behavior and neuroanatomy in mammals. Freeman's research has attracted impressive grant support since she joined the psychology faculty in 2000, helping her establish a colony of small mammals called musk shrews, hire student interns, and upgrade lab equipment. Her most recent three-year grant from the National Institutes of Health totaled $150,000, and in 2009 she received more than $80,000 from the President's stimulus package that is also helping to fund the Pearce renovation. Freeman's students have presented their work at professional meetings in the United States as well as Canada, Portugal, and the Netherlands, and two were recognized with awards from the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology. "The success of the shrew project shows that with the right resources, even the smallest of colleges can claim their own research niche, Freeman said. "We are one of only three " labs in the country with a musk shrew colony and the only one studying hormone-behavior relationships. This opportunity not only gives my students the chance to develop the research skills they can use in graduate or medical school, but also allows them to make original contributions to scientific literature. " The full renovation plan for Pearce Science Center calls for the establishment of four interdisciplinary areas for collaborative research. The first phase of construction includes creating dedicated spaces for Neuroscience and Cellular Signaling and Environmental Systems Monitoring; the remaining areas will be addressed in later phases. The creation of the Supramolecular Chemistry, Molecular Recognition, and Materials Chemistry suite will address the recent interest in expanding faculty-initiated research. Among the renovation plans is the creation of a space designated for independent senior research that will allow for more collaboration between chemists and physicists. Providing centralized cellular and molecular biology work with animal models and human cell lines, the Neuroscience and Cellular Signaling space is designed to support greater interaction among faculty and students. The Behavioral and Developmental Studies center will bring together the study of behavior and development within laboratory settings with work focusing on, among other topics, gender development in children, influences on female college students' expectations for post-graduation work and family lives, and gender differences in emotional empathy expressed toward adversarial groups. Projects in the identification of estrogenic contaminants in water, water pollution monitoring in local * Learn more about MBC's School of Science: Chesapeake Bay tributaries, and changing migratory patterns of tropical birds will be supported by the Environmental Systems Monitoring lab. M A R Y B A L D W I N C O L L E G E EXCELLENCE BUILDING ON IN SCIENCE Digging In With the dramatic renovation of Pearce Science Center set to begin soon, local officials, media, and project leaders joined the Mary Baldwin community April 28 for a symbolic groundbreaking at the site. Planned to coincide with the spring meeting of the MBC Board of Trustees, the public event included remarks from Tradition President Pamela Fox and biology major April Lao `11, tours of the four-story building, and a reception. Construction on Phase I of the Pearce project will start shortly after Commencement on May 22 and will address parts of the first and second floors. Work on the second-floor classroom and adjoining lab is projected to be finished when classes begin in fall 2011. The goal is to complete Phase I -- which includes classrooms, offices, and labs in the first floor Neuroscience and Cellular Signaling suite -- by the start of spring 2012. Two additional phases of the renovation will be scheduled when funding is secured. Mary Baldwin College Magazine 19 Agent Rwandan rights activist leaves leadership post to earn American education By Dawn Medley On the second day of spring semester at Mary Baldwin College, Berra Kabarungi stepped out into the snow to walk to class. Chilly, tangible proof that she was more than 6,000 miles from her home in Rwanda -- and an unmistakable reminder of just how far she had come to begin her latest journey. "I have had many opportunities in my life to reinvent myself because I always try to look at change as opportunity, whether it is welcome or unwelcome at the beginning, said " Kabarungi, removing her quilted coat and mittens inside the Spencer Center for Civic and Global Engagement. "This, she adds, " gesturing to the campus outside the center's wall of windows, "is another new life for me. " Kabarungi -- who is quickly becoming known by her easier-topronounce first name, Berra -- speaks with quiet intensity. Her understanding of English is exceptional, but speaking fluidly is a bit more challenging. You can almost see the phrases flowing through her mind in her native language, Kinyarwanda, before she carefully chooses words in English. She is a skilled communicator; she does not need many words to convey her message. 20 Summer 2011 "When a door for change appears, I am not intimidated by it. I am ready. I prepare myself for the next step, she says, moving her " arm to demonstrate opening a door and using her hands to symbolize forward motion. Former country director in Rwanda for the global women's advocacy organization Women for Women International, Kabarungi was invited to study at MBC on full scholarship as part of the college's growing partnership with Women for Women. She plans to enroll in a wide variety of courses during her four years on campus. She may focus on social work or marketing communication as a major as her studies progress, but she is learning that she will benefit most by keeping her education open-ended. Kabarungi, 46, is joined at her campus residence in Crone House by her husband, Janvier Gakwaya. Gakwaya is a Rwanda native who collected data and compiled statistical reports about people living with HIV for an international nongovernmental organization before starting anew in Staunton with his wife. Although they have been together for many years, the couple are newlyweds who took their vows just three weeks before boarding a plane in Kigali to start their trip to Virginia. They both realize that full immersion in American culture and keeping pace with conversation and coursework in English make this opportunity a challenging one. But Kabarungi also knows that she has thousands of reasons to succeed: the struggling women in war-torn countries who need her to give their lives hope and purpose through programs like those offered by Women for Women International. Return to the Classroom Kabarungi's courseload is intense. The second day of classes takes her straight from Intercultural Communication to Marketing Principles. After a break for lunch, she heads to Introduction to Social Work. Her day will not wrap up until after an 8 p.m. meeting with Changemakers for Women, the MBC student organization that promotes Women for Women International on campus. In the 200-level marketing course, Kabarungi is asked to talk a little about herself during an introductory warm-up activity. At first, she gives the same information PHOTO BY WOODS PIERCE "When a door for change appears, I am not intimidated by it . I am ready. I prepare myself for the next step." as the students before her: name, major (or expected major), a distinctive trait, and what she hopes to learn in the class. But Claire Kent, associate professor of business administration, wants Kabarungi to share more. "Working for Women for Women International has only served to increase my love for women all over the world, Kabarungi " begins. "I see passion in them as agents for change, right from their basic role in the family -- it doesn't always have to be in a huge, worldchanging context. The natural skills we have as women make it possible -- necessary -- for us to advance change in our families, our villages, and our world. " Although Kabarungi has not been a full-time student for nearly 15 years, she slips easily into the academic environment at MBC, listening intently to other students' answers and piping up in class discussions. Kent is excited to lead Kabarungi in one of her first endeavors at Mary Baldwin. She sees her as another person who adds diversity and perspective to the marketing class, which also includes international students from Saudi Arabia, Ireland, South Korea, and Japan. "I'm eager to contribute to her education, but I'm even more intrigued to see how she will contribute to projects and what she will share with other students, Kent " said. "I want to encourage her not to be anxious right now about her direction and the specific courses she should take. I want to see her experiment and experience Mary Baldwin. " If Kabarungi dives into her role as a student as enthusiastically as she embraced her work as country director for Women for Women International, the result will be remarkable, said Karen Sherman, the organization's director of global programs. Sherman, MBC Commencement speaker in 2009 and current member of the college's Board of Trustees, supervised Kabarungi for several years. She said that her personal touches and openness to change left a lasting impression at Women for Women. "Berra is a spiritual person, and her life and work serve as a kind of informal ministry, Sherman said. " Mary Baldwin College Magazine 21 "Her involvement with [Women for Women] graduation ceremonies in the villages was truly inspiring. She planned lively, meaningful ceremonies that truly celebrated the women in our program, and she attended many of the events in person to deliver speeches. She connected so poignantly that the audience was often in tears. " From Refugee to Leader A refugee during her childhood, as an adult Kabarungi was able to help more than 36,000 women rebuild their lives and their communities while working for Women for Women following that country's horrific 1994 genocide. Kabarungi's parents were among thousands of Rwandan Tutsis who left their homes and scattered to neighoring countries in 1959, when tension flared between Hutus and Tutsis -- two dominant ethnic groups that have been at odds for hundreds of years over control of the central African region. Her parents settled in a refugee camp in Uganda for what they thought would be a temporary stay. The ethnic conflict was somewhat resolved in 1962, when Rwanda was designated as a country led by Hutus and Burundi was created as a Tutsi country. But tension between the rival groups simmered barely under the surface, and Kabarungi's family remained displaced in Uganda for safety. "Life in the camp was not easy, because we did not have many basic necessities ... like proper shelter, clean conditions, and access to good drinking water. But my parents did everything they could for us, she said. " Strong, all-encompassing Christian faith sustained Kabarungi's family, which includes seven children. From a young age, Berra, the middle child, had an inquisitive and analytical personality that was encouraged by her parents and her education at Wanyange Girls' School and the Institute of Teacher Education. She earned a degree in English language and literature from the Institute in 1990 and taught at secondary schools in Uganda and Rwanda. Although life as a refugee was uncertain, Kabarungi knows she was fortunate to live outside of Rwanda. Because they were still in exile, her family was spared the manhunts, rape, and murder that terroized thousands of Rwandan families in 1994, when the Tutsi-Hutu conflict exploded again, causing a civil war. "We would have been killed. I have little doubt about that, she says matter-of-factly when asked about the fate of " her family. After the genocide, Kabarungi returned to Rwanda determined to be part of the country's healing and reconciliation process. Before joining Women for Women International in 2003, she worked with the International Rescue Committee, assisting women's cooperatives and associations and serving as a liasion to local government officials. Kabarungi's seven-year tenure with Women for Women was a showcase for her skills as a teacher, collaborator, spiritual leader, and visionary. Her initial position in the organization was as a cashier, but her experience as an educator and leader led her to quickly be called on to help deliver life skills training to women in the field. That was how she met Marie-Claire. "She was in poor health and her family was not doing well -- they were suffering -- when she came to the program, Kabarungi " recalled. The medical services provided by Women for Women allowed Marie-Claire to discover that she was living with HIV. Her husband also had HIV, and she had passed the virus on to one of her children. Rather than a death sentence, the diagnosis was a turning point in Marie-Claire's life, Kabarungi said. "They were able to take medicine to combat the disease, and she found out how to better take care of herself and her family, she explained. Training and " seed money from Women for Women cooperatives helped Marie-Claire buy a few goats and to open a small shop where she sold domestic products and grocery items such as soap, fruit, and drinks. She reinvested her profits wisely, and became a client of a microfinance organization in Rwanda -- a goal that Women for Women has for all of its participants so that they can sustain and grow their businesses. She became a leader in her small village of Ndera and established a primary school. Kabarungi kept in touch with Marie-Claire when she became country director in Rwanda in 2004, and her last update was a good one: Marie-Claire was healthy and continues to receive support from the microfinance group to grow her shop. Kabarungi admits that not all outcomes of those who participate in Women for Women are as positive as MarieClaire's, but there are enough of those stories to demonstrate the transformational power of the organization. "For so many women and their families, it begins with a restoration of hope, she said. "Where they take that is an " individual decision for each of them. " The Rwanda chapter of Women for Women International was officially chartered a few months before Kabarungi was named to its top role. Under her leadership, the program expanded to include direct financial assistance, rights education, vocational skills training, and income-generating opportunities. She spearheaded efforts to improve women's awareness of health and nutrition issues, particularly malaria prevention and treatment. As Sherman noted, Women for Women graduation ceremonies became events that united communities and drew attention from local officials and the media, spreading the organization's mission. In spring 2010, Kabarungi partnered with the Women for Women country director in the Democratic Republic of Congo to organize Join Me on the Bridge -- literally grasping each other's hands on a bridge that connected their two 22 Summer 2011 PHOTO BY WOODS PIERCE PHOTO COURTESY OF WOMEN FOR WOMEN INTERNATIONAL clockwise from top left: Rwanda native Berra Kabarungi, far left, introduced herself as a new Mary Baldwin College student in a marketing course early in spring semester.

The momentum of that singular event sparked symbolic Bridge gatherings in which more than 20,000 people participated around the world -- including several dozen at Mary Baldwin College. Join Me on the Bridge has become one of Women for Women's signature events, and Kabarungi added her enthusiasm to MBC's second annual ceremony in March. "We need political, social, economic change, she said " in coverage of the event in Staunton's newspaper, The News Leader. "We want to see women presidents. We want to see many women governors. With the big number of women participating in decision making ... there are possibilities of women having good access to income, starting big businesses. I know this will bring changes for the world. " Kabarungi's growing extended family returned to Rwanda in the years following the genocide, and she is happy to be able to say that the country is relatively peaceful and prosperous today. Since 1994, leaders have drafted a new constitution and worked steadily to build a decentralized, democratic government where corruption is not tolerated. "The state of affairs is good. The government is nonpartisan and there is some intermarriage between ethnic groups, Kabarungi said. "Things are not perfect, but there " is positive movement on a national level. " An American Community of Support Kabarungi's participation in Join Me on the Bridge was a glimpse of her involvement on campus and in the surrounding community. Just weeks after starting classes, she plucked a paintbush from a pile of supplies to work on a mural at Valley Mission homeless shelter in Staunton, eager to be part of the community service project on Martin Luther King Day. She is a familiar face at Minority Clubs United meetings and at Christ Our Redeemer � African Methodist Episcopal Church in Staunton, and she is beginning work as an intern with the Reverend Andrea Cornett-Scott, associate vice president for student affairs and inclusive community. "Berra is still observing everything and absorbing our personalities, our activities, our language. One thing is already clear, though: She is a deeply compassionate person, said Cornett-Scott. Kabarungi assists Cornett-Scott " in the African-American and Multicultural Affairs Office and is looking forward to being more involved with African Student Kollective (ASK) and other student groups. Michelle Kayosa-Ajayi '14, president of ASK, is enjoying getting to know "Mrs. Berra" -- the name some students use to convey respect for their new classmate. "She is very warm and is always ready to go beyond the casual greeting. She will be a very valued member of the group, she said. " Kabarungi's network while at Mary Baldwin also includes the student group Changemakers for Women and a collection of women from the Staunton area who support the group's activities and mission. Her first week on campus included several meals and meetings with those women, helping Kabarungi feel part of a vibrant community. "She is already enriching our lives, and my children love her, said Staunton resident Kathy Garrison after dinner with " Kabarungi at a local restaurant. "She is used to being very busy, so we hope to fill some of her `downtime.'" Changemakers for Women began in 2007 after several , WOMEN Berra Kabarungi's arrival on campus in January was the latest event in Mary Baldwin College's developing partnership with global women's advocacy organization Women for Women International. Here's a quick look at the college's connections with Women for Women and plans for continuing the collaboration: for WOMEN Connection Karen Sherman, Women for Women executive director for global programs, delivers MBC's Commencement address. Through examples of women she has met through the organization's peace-building social entrepreneurship programs in eight war-torn countries, Sherman illustrates the power of women as agents of change here and abroad. Changemakers for Women presents a check for more than $1,000 to Sherman, who now serves on the Mary Baldwin College Board of Trustees, providing four additional yearlong Women for Women sponsorships. FEB 2009 NOV 2009 JAN 2011 MAY 2009 MBC students attending the Clinton Global InitiativeUniversity (CGIU) conference in Austin are inspired by the life story and work of one panelist in particular -- Zainab Salbi, founder and CEO of Women for Women International. After the conference, MBC students form the organization Changemakers for Women. Changemakers for Women makes its first donation to support a yearlong sponsorship for a woman survivor of war to participate in Women for Women programs. The student group soon receives information about Adolphine Tumusifu M'Bahati -- a woman with six of her own children and four others to care for in the Democratic Republic of Congo -- and how their efforts will help her. OCT 2010 Invited by President Pamela Fox to study at MBC on a four-year scholarship, Berra Kabarungi, former Women for Women country director in Rwanda, arrives on campus and enrolls as a full-time student. 24 Summer 2011 students attended the inaugural meeting of Clinton Global Initiative University (CGIU) in New Orleans. Right away, the group agreed on a commitment to helping at-risk women and girls. CGIU attendees in 2009 were inspired by dialogue between former President Bill Clinton and Women for Women International founder and CEO Zainad Salbi. The mission of Salbi's organization -- empowering women who are victims of war with rehabilitation and education -- gave the group a new focus and a goal: sponsorship of those in Women for Women programs. The student group is continuously fundraising to provide 25 yearlong sponsorships at $314 each over the next three years. One sponsorship was secured in 2009, and students donated funds to sponsor four more women in October 2010. Each student in the organization also makes an individual commitment to service in the Staunton community. As Kabarungi settles into life at MBC, student members of Changemakers for Women, faculty, and staff continue to explore events and programs that will strengthen ties with Women for Women International. Her presence on campus is a tangible example of how those connections can transform one person, and how that person transforms many more. "I feel contentment and wholeness in my life, mainly because of my compassion for women, as leaders and as `mothers' to their nations and the entire world, says " Kabarungi. "I see my time here as time to gain knowledge and learn from other students' experiences. I am confident that I will leave fully equipped to serve women and to contribute to a better world of hope, peace, and progress. " Tradition of Outreach Mary Baldwin College's partnership with Women for Women International is the most recent chapter in a commitment that was inherent in the Seminary's mission from the start: to serve girls and women wherever they are in need. As noted in the summer 2010 issue of The Mary Baldwin College Magazine, two courageous alumnae established schools for young women in Korea and China in the early 19th century, and international mission trips by students and faculty -- some of which later led to the creation of schools -- spanning more than 150 years have introduced women worldwide to the ideals of a Mary Baldwin education. In additon to Asian schools started by Libby Alby Bull, Class of 1893, and 1916 graduate Lily Woods, examples of foreign and domestic outreach abound in Mary Watters' 1942 written history* of the college. One of the most illustrative stories is that of a school set up in the late 1800s in Lavra, Brazil, by former math and Latin teacher Charlotte Kemper. Mary Baldwin Seminary contributed to Kemper's school and followed her work "with interest and pride, " according to Watters. "It is one of the long arms of the Seminary and College reaching out to the world, the " author noted. Other poignant examples are mentioned in Watters' writings about the college's YWCA organization in the 1940s: "Two [other] special aids in education are given annually: one to a student in the Boys' Industrial School, Covington, Virginia; another to a little girl in the American Mission Girls' School, Tanta, Egypt. In 1941, the group also " helped to furnish a day nursery in Staunton for working mothers of under privileged children and funded a new nursery school in the city. "When one attempts to describe or evaluate the contribution of Mary Baldwin alumnae to the world's work, it is possible to give a limited suggestive statement only, Watters wrote. How " significant it is to assert that her observation holds true today? * Find the full text of Watters' The History of Mary Baldwin Members of Changemakers for Women visit Women for Women International headquarters in Washington DC for a day of service.

In her monthly foray into the colonial kitchen, LENI SORENSEN `92 blanches tomatoes, peels parsnips, and dusts apples with cinnamon the way it was done 200 years ago. As African-American research historian and unofficial culinary guru at Thomas Jefferson's home in Charlottesville, Sorensen's work not only delights scores of followers on Monticello's Facebook page, it informs her already vast knowledge of American history. " I've been more and more wearAs ing my `culinary historian' hat, it just occurred to me that we had this wonderful resource of Mary Randolph's The Virginia House-wife, a real window into what the kind of cookery that our cooks here would have been familiar with, " Sorensen said. Randolph, a kinswoman of Thomas Jefferson, "moved through the highest elite circles of her day" between the 1790s and 1810, according to Sorensen. Her work, published by University of South Carolina press, remains the quintessential southern cookbook. Its recipes include ingredients found in Jefferson's garden and techniques that were practiced in his kitchen. Sorensen and others at Monticello who embrace 21st-century methods of communication, launched in September a monthly feature on Facebook in which Sorensen tries out Randolph's recipes in her own kitchen. She documents the preparation of seasonal foods in her home kitchen in Albemarle County with a series of photos and, when necessary, notes. Compote of apples, "scollop tomatas, "ocra, baked winter squash, " " and saut�ed parsnips are among the dishes Monticello has documented on the social networking site. "I make a few little modern notes about either her idiosyncratic spelling or various explanations, Sorensen said. " "I've chosen foodstuffs that are readily available. What's funny about Mary Randolph is that she writes as if she just wrote this yesterday. She writes lucidly, clearly. She might have been a martinet in the kitchen, but she definitely knew the details in the process that she tells you to do. " Sorensen, who is working on the restoration of Mulberry Row -- the "main street" of work life at Monticello -- has always been interested in how food and its preparation reveals a broader picture of history. Before moving to Virginia, Sorensen and her husband spent eight years farming in South Dakota. She was interested in learning how raising her own food, cooking on a wood stove, and butchering her own animals connected her to the way people lived 100 or even 500 years ago. "Cooking is easily dismissed to other things such as politics, she said. " "But it was important. " 40 Summer 2011 S IT LIKE ... to help restore the detention barracks at Angel Island Immigration Station? "It is our responsibility to preserve; for the public, for the visitors who come from all over the world, and, most importantly, for the people who claim this as part of their history, said KATIE M�TRAUX `95 " about her historic preservation work at California's United States Immigration Station at Angel Island State Park. Referred to as the "Ellis Island of the West" and the "Guardian of the Western Gate" for being the site where more than one million immigrants -- primarily from Asia -- were processed between 1910 and 1940, Angel Island underwent a massive restoration and reopened in February 2009, in time for its centennial celebration this year. M�traux has studied the poetry carved in the walls. She has pressed her hand into the unforgiving springs of sleeping cots, stacked three high. After five years of interviewing detainees and their families and searching for and replicating artifacts to recreate an authentic environment, she knows Angel Island's barracks and the stories they harbor inside and out. The intensive project is a prime example of how Metraux's Mary Baldwin studies in cultural anthropology and Asian studies meld in her day-today work as museum curator for California State Parks. "The challenge and the intrigue of this position is in finding a balance between telling people's very personal, emotional stories and creating an accurate historical representation of a place or event, " M�traux said. Intercultural collaboration and conflict resolution are skills she cultivated at Mary Baldwin that come into play daily on the job. M�traux had her first taste of work in the field as an intern at Staunton's Frontier Culture Museum and continued to explore with post-graduation positions at Indian Grinding Rock State Park in California and Pennsylvania's Hopewell Furnace National Park. In 2007 M�traux's work took , her to Jack London's former home, Beauty Ranch, where she was in charge of finding original furnishings and restoring the setting to resemble the years Jack and Charmian London resided there, 1906�16. In addition to continuing the project at Angel Island -- the team is now focusing on restoring the onsite hospital and developing a master education plan for the park -- she is also working with Native American groups, residents in a Chinese fishing village, and people associated with a former Russian fort named Fort Ross to gather information and design exhibits in other state parks. M�traux's recent ventures also connected with the research and teachings of her father, Daniel M�traux, MBC professor of Asian studies since 1983. The Angel Island restoration has an obvious association as a gateway for Asian immigrants, but the elder M�traux made a surprising discovery at Beauty Ranch that linked London to Asia and sparked his interest. "I was startled to see a picture of London in Manchuria surrounded by Japanese soldiers. That led me to research and writing about London's contribution to Asian studies, he said. " "In many ways, I'm just following her lead, M�traux said of " his daughter. * Learn More Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation NON-PROFIT ORG U.S.POSTAGE PAID PERMIT 75 HARRISONBURG, VA STAUNTON, VA 24401 Scan this QR code with your smart phone or visit to view the magazine and find special online extras.Last_0<<

Susan,
My wife and I have prayed for you. In regards to you're not becoming critical, though struggling w fear, I count it as a sign of maturity on your part. If I may be so bold, I have some advice for your situation:
Two things may be going on. First of all, spiritual attacks. I experienced panic attacks in the past. The way the Lord broke them off my life was through prayer at the altar of church. So, I suggest you find a Holy Ghost filled church and go up for prayer. There is power at the altar. The enemy will try and stop you from doing this. But do it! See if there's a revival going on at a church near you and head there.
Second, take care of your health. I read at RITA where you mentioned possible liver problems. If you look online, you'll find a thing called "leaky gut syndrome." It can be related to liver problems. Additionally, food allergies and panic attacks may be connected. One way to know if you have food allergies is to go on a Daniel diet and see if you feel better while on it. Once back on a normal diet, consider what you may want to avoid: caffeine, corn syrup, and lots of other stuff. Do some research on food allergies and what to avoid. A lot of this will be trial and error. If you feel better on the Daniel diet then you have a starting point.
I hope this helps,
God Bless,
JoeThis application is a continuation of Ser. No. 09/202,424 Feb. 19, 1999, now abandoned, which is a 371 of PCT/Fr98/00 582 Mar. 20, 1998.
The present invention relates to the field of slot machines such as jackpot machines and other individual gambling machines of the type found in casinos.
It relates in particular to slot machines in which bets and winnings are recorded with gambling cards. The gambling cards are of the chip card or contactless card type. The gambling cards can be dedicated to this use similarly to telephone cards. They are advantageously bank cards so that sums of money can be transferred directly to the slot machine.
The present application relates to a method and system for monitoring the transfer of value units between a plurality of gambling cards and a plurality of gambling machines, each machine being connected to a gambling card data transcriber able to credit and/or debit value units in the memory of a gambling card.
One general objective of monitoring the transfer of value units between gambling cards and gambling machines is to avoid fraud using such cards.
Management systems for gambling machines equipped with chip card readers designed for managing the gambling machines in relatively enclosed, controlled sites such as casinos are known. These systems are designed for such an environment since they are heavily regulated and controlled, and are unlikely to allow fraud in gambling transactions using chip cards.
Document EP-A-0 360 613 describes for example a system for transferring data between a chip card and a plurality of machines with means for transmitting and storing machine data in the chip card. Such a system makes it possible to list gambling operations with a collecting card that stores a list of gambling operations for accounting or tax purposes.
One drawback of such a system is that it is not possible to monitor all the gambling operations carried out unless all the gambling operations are polled with the collecting card, which is a time-consuming procedure.
Also, due to an increasing public demand, there are plans for setting up gambling machines in sites less protected than casinos such as private gambling rooms or bars, or even private homes such as those of the gamblers.
It is clear that such a dispersion of gambling machines poses substantial problems regarding the security of the transactions involved in gambling operations.
One goal of the invention is to enable gambling machines that operate with chip cards in unprotected sites to be developed.
Another goal of the invention is to reinforce the integrity of gambling machines operating with chip cards.
The invention provides for the gambling machines to be networked with a central processing unit. According to the invention, the central processing unit has a database storing information corresponding to that stored in gambling cards such as information on the gambler, card identification data, and data on the stored value balance in the card. When the card data are checked against the database of the central processing unit, the integrity of such a gambling machine system operating with chip cards or contactless cards can be ensured.
The invention thus provides a secured method for monitoring transfers of value units between a plurality of gambling cards and a plurality of gambling machines, each machine being connected to a transcriber of data onto a gambling card, the machines being connected in a secured network with a central processing unit by means of link means, the method having the following steps, during a gambling operation:
The invention advantageously provides security means enabling the data messages exchanged over the network to be authenticated, namely enabling such messages to be signed.
The invention also provides a secured system for monitoring transfers of value units between a plurality of gambling cards and a plurality of gambling machines, each machine being provided with a transcriber able to debit value units of a gambling card, the machines being connected in a secured network with a central processing unit by link means, whereby a gambling card stores data representing gambling operations conducted, particularly data identifying the card and data representing the balance of the value units debited and/or credited during previous gambling operations, characterized in that the central processing unit has a database that in parallel stores the data representing gambling operations carried out, particularly card identification data and data representing the balances of the value units debited and/or credited during previous gambling operations, and in that the monitoring means check that, for an identified card, the database data and the card data correspond, particularly that the data representing the value unit balance correspond, in order to verify the integrity of the system.
A security module for authenticating data messages can advantageously be provided in the network, in a transcriber, a machine, the central unit, or even network link means.
The invention will be better understood by reading the description and the drawings that follow, provided solely as nonlimiting examples; in the attached drawings:
FIG. 1 shows a secured system for monitoring the transfer of value units between a plurality of gambling cards and a plurality of gambling machines able to implement the invention;
FIG. 2 is a flowchart of data exchange and data verification according to the invention; and
FIG. 3 represents calculation of the authentication certificate by security means according to the invention.
FIG. 1 shows a secured system of gambling machines as proposed by the invention, having one or more gambling machines 200, 200′, 200″, and 200′″,
Such a gambling machine 200, similar to the slot machines found in casinos, has an electronic coin meter 210 that will hereinafter be called data transcriber, which transcribes data onto gambling card CJ.
The card data transcriber 210 is connected to the electronics of machine 200, for example by a serial connector of the RS 485 type. The machine and reader have input-output interfaces designed for this link.
Classically, the machine is equipped with a display 211 informing the gamblers at all times of the balance they have available for playing and the bets placed and winnings made.
Machine 200 in the figures can of course be an electronic coin meter machine exclusively, but also a double coin meter machine, namely a machine that not only has this electronic coin meter but also a coin (or token) meter symbolized by reference 201.
In the case of a double coin meter machine, the gambler is able to play with coins or tokens and receive his winnings solely in the form of coins.
The gambling cards CJ shown in the form of chip cards have an electrically erasable read-only memory, for example an EEPROM memory.
It may be for example a chip card with a microprocessor, a program memory, and a RAM type working memory.
These chip cards can also be unit-loading cards of the rechargeable type. These cards have for this purpose an electrically programmable memory of the abacus type.
In addition, the gambling cards can be contactless cards, where the card has an integrated circuit memory and a microprocessor and an electronic circuit for transmitting data without electrical contact. For example a transponder such as that described in French Patent Application FR 96 16061 can be used.
The construction of gambling machines 200 and their connection to data transcribers transcribing onto gambling cards will not be described in detail here. Construction examples of gambling machines are described for example in French Patent FR 96 10031 the description whereof is incorporated herein by reference.
For monitoring the gambling operations and transactions with the cards, machines 200, 200′, 200″, and 200′″ are networked together with a central processing unit designated 1 in FIG. 1. The machines in the network are connected to central processing unit 1 by link means 123. As shown in FIG. 1, machines 200, 200′, 200″, and 200′″ can also be connected with each other by the network.
Link means 123 in the case of a local area network like that of a casino are constituted by a local link. The local link is for example a serial link of the RS 485 type, a parallel bus connector, an optical fiber, a radio link, or any other transmission means.
In the case of a network linking dispersed gambling rooms, the link means may be transmission channels specific to the network, or telephone lines.
To establish telephone links, the network has modulator-demodulators of the modem type 120, 120′, 120″, and 120′″ interfaced with link means 123 and a gambling machine 200, 200′, 200″, and 200′″, respectively.
Central processing unit 1 is for example a central computer also connected to link means 123 by a modem 101 in order to form part of the network.
FIG. 1 shows link means 123 in the schematic form of an annular line to which gambling machines 200, 200′, 200″, and 200′″ are connected. The machines are hence connected with each other and with central processing unit 1. The link may however assume any equivalent form.
In the case of telephone links, the machines are connected individually with the central processing means, and the machines are not necessarily linked together. Modem 101 of processing means 1 may advantageously have a switchboard with several telephone lines.
The use of telephone links has the advantage of extending the network to the homes of the gamblers. The gambling machines are preferably personal computers 300 and 300′ of the PC type. The machines can thus each be connected to a transcriber that transcribes data onto a gambling card 310 or 310′ preferably having a modem 130 or 130′ for example of the Gemtel type sold by the applicant.
The network used may in particular be an open communication network of the Internet type.
The system and network also have at least one loading terminal shown in FIG. 1 in the form of a cash register 100. Loading terminal 100 in this case has a transcriber 110. Terminal 110 and transcriber 110 are connected to the network through a modem 111 connected to link means 123.
Classically, the chip cards dedicated to gambling are non-reloadable cards like telephone cards, and are produced and loaded only by a central organization.
In one application with non-reloadable cards, database BD of central processing means 1 has initial balances S1, S2, . . . , Sn of values credited in cards CJ1, CJ2, . . . , CJn before they are placed in circulation.
However, according to one advantageous variant, the cards are reloaded with value units by loading terminals.
In practice, such a terminal may be the terminal of a casino cashier. Alternatively, a multitude of loading terminals may be disposed at news-agents or other businesses accessible to the gamblers.
Thus, when a gambler wishes to obtain credit, he hands his gambling card CJ1 to the operator entitled to use terminal 100, who inserts this card into the transcriber part 110 of this terminal 100 and, using the cash register keyboard, enters the credit amount the gambler desires. This amount is transferred to transcriber 110 which then records on chip card CJ1 the significant information corresponding to the credit desired by the gambler.
According to the invention, the reloading terminal can then communicate to central processing unit 1, by means of network link means 123, the data read into the card to be reloaded, particularly its identification number Id and its balance S of value units. The identification number Id of gambling card CJ1 can be checked directly by reloading terminal 100 or by its data transcriber 110 or alternatively by central processing unit 1. The invention thus calls for a step preceding the gambling operations which is to enter, in the database of central processing unit 1 and in the memory of a gambling card CJ1, data representing an initial balance value when the operation preceding the loading of card CJ1 is carried out.
According to the first alternative, as shown in FIG. 2, the reloading terminal or its transcriber T has secret identification keys Kt1, Kt2, . . . , Ktn of all the gambling cards CJ1, CJ2, . . . , CJn in circulation. These secret keys are preferably stored in a security module MS1 which has a memory and calculating unit; the stored data are not accessible from the outside. Terminal 100 then checks that the identification Id1 of chip card CJ1 is correct using the corresponding key Kt1, applying an authentication or encryption algorithm according to known methods.
According to the second alternative, this card authentication is carried out by the central processing unit 1, the identification numbers Id1, Id2, . . . , Idn and corresponding authentication keys Kt1, Kt2, . . . , Ktn being stored in database BD of the central processing unit or preferably in a security module MS0 similar to MS1. This second alterative has the advantage of preventing the secret authentication keys from being disseminated.
The invention also provides for an exchange of data between the terminal and the central processing unit of data stored in the database of central processing unit 1. Preferably, this data exchange is accompanied by an authentication certificate. A security protocol for transmitting such certificates will be described below. This protocol advantageously prevents a spurious machine in the network from falsely crediting the database. Terminal T can thus communicate balance S of the values previously debited or credited on gambling card CJ1 to the central processing unit 1. After authenticating identification number Id1 of the card or the certificate accompanying the balance data, one can thus check that the balance S entered in the memory of gambling card CJ1 indeed corresponds to the balance S1 stored in database BD. If the check is positive, the central processing unit 1 sends an approval signal so that card CJ1 can be reloaded by the terminal and transcriber T. If the check is negative, an alert procedure or signal can be put into effect at central processing unit 1 or at the loading terminal. In a network of casino slot machines for example, the cashier can be alerted by the loading terminal to find out the reason for such a malfunction. In a more extensive network, card CJ1 can be swallowed by transcriber T of the terminal so that the malfunction can be investigated.
In addition, the database or memory of gambling cards CJ may also contain information on the gambler, for example his age, gambling habits for gambler loyalty applications, awarding free games, etc.
We will now present protocols for monitoring value unit transfers during gambling operations carried out with the method or system according to the invention.
At the start of the gambling operations, the transcriber that transcribes data onto card 210 of the gambling machine reads the identification number in the memory of gambling card CJ1. As stated previously in regard to FIG. 2, this identification number Id is preferably authenticated by a security module MS1 provided in transcriber T. The Id number may be communicated to central processing unit 1 in order to authenticate card CJ1 with identification key Kt1 contained in security module MS0. This identification stage is preferably carried out once for several gambling operations with the same card on the same machine, with the machine or terminal possibly memorizing this identification number Id for the following operations.
With each following gambling operation, the balance S of the value units allocated to the gambler is reviewed following bets placed or winnings made.
According to a first embodiment of the invention, data on the gambling operation carried out are simply communicated to central processing unit 1, particularly the new value unit balance obtained during this gambling operation. Central processing unit 1 can thus store the list of operations carried out in the form of a list of successive credits or debits recorded on card CJ1. This list of operations Op101, Op102, . . . , Op10x is for example recorded in database BD under identification number Id1 of card CJ1 during use.
Entry of balance S1 or operations Op101, Op102, . . . , Op10x in database BD of central processing unit 1 then serves to establish an accounting statement of the operations or a tax verification. Such a history of operations also enables the extent of the fraud to be measured if a forged card is checked.
According to a second embodiment of the invention, there is an additional step of checking that the data stored in card CJ1 and the data in database BD correspond so that the integrity of a system of which such a card CJ1, such a machine 200, network 123, and central processing unit 1 are composed can be checked.
Two types of check can be used: a check of identification number Id or a check of the card balance S.
The check of the identification number Id1 of card CJ1 is run with an identification key Kt1 as seen above. According to this second embodiment, identification number Id is communicated to central unit 1 via the link means of the network. Central unit 1 stores identification keys Kt1, Kt2, . . . , Ktn of cards CJ1, CJ2, . . . , CJn in circulation, in its database BD or preferably in a security module MS0. Security module MS0 thus performs the identification calculations internally.
Also, the check can be made on the value unit balance in card CJ1. In this case, transcriber T reads from the card the data on the value unit balance S and sends the data to central processing unit 1 through network link means 123. Balance S of card CJ1 is then read by comparison to balance S1 indicated in database BD under identification number Id1. If the two balances S and S1 match, the gambling operation is authorized by central processing unit 1.
According to another alterative, the check can be made of the certification of the data exchanged from gambling card CJ1. Standard data encryption algorithms of the DES algorithm type can certify the digital data exchanged between card CJ1, transcriber T, the gambling machine, and central processing unit 1. Encryption and decryption of the certificate accompanying the transmitted data is possible and consistent only if a secret key is used.
The data encryption algorithms of the DES type have complex series of calculations that will not be presented in detail herein.
One example of using DES algorithms will be presented simply considering that the algorithm furnishes an encrypted number called session key K′, from a first given number, called identification key K, and a random number Rnd, according to the example in the formula below:
K′=DES(K, Rnd)
The complexity of the DES algorithms makes it impossible to discover a secret identification key K from session key K′ and random number Rnd.
FIG. 3 shows one example of application of an algorithm DES. It illustrates the means by which the network is secured, particularly the securing of data exchanges effected via the network link means. The gambling card has at least one secret identification key Kt in an inaccessible memory zone. The card microprocessor generates a pseudo-random number Rnd1. From these two numbers Rnd1 and Kt, the DES algorithm used by the microprocessor calculates a session key Kt′.
This session key Kt′ can serve as an authentication certificate and be sent with random number Rnd1 and the data to be certified. However, to make it impossible to discover the keys, the DES algorithm is applied a second time. As can be seen in FIG. 3, the gambling card, the element sending the message to be certified, asks the target element, central unit 1 for example, to supply it with a second random number Rnd2.
The DES algorithm is once more applied to session key Kt′ and second random number Rnd2 by the card microprocessor to calculate a certificate C.
The data message is then sent to the target element accompanied by certificate C and random number Rnd1 both calculated by the card. Thus, the keys used, in particular secret identification key Kt, are not exchanged.
Authentication of the data message is effected by recalculating a certificate C′ from the same data. Central processing unit 1 has secret identification key Kt in its secured module MS0. Secured module MS0 can thus calculate session key Kt′ from identification key Kt and random number Rnd1.
Secured module MS0 still has the random number Rnd2 it previously supplied to the gambling card. From these two numbers, Rnd2 and Kt′, security module MS0 once again calculates a certificate C′, applying the DES algorithm a second time.
By checking that certificate C calculated by the card matches certificate C′ recalculated by its security module, the central unit can authenticate the data message received.
Note that session key Kt′ and certificate C are recalculated with each desired message certification. This prevents a pirate machine in the network from gaining access to the database or card memory by copying a previous certificate.
After making one or more of these checks, central unit 1 sends an approval signal which can be encrypted or encoded. With such an approval signal, the gambler can use his gambling card CJ1, make bets, effect gambling operations, and reload his card with his winnings.
In these first two embodiments, it has been shown that the card has an identification function, whereby its Id number enables central unit 1 or the gambling machine to recognize it and even recognize the gambler in certain client loyalty applications. Moreover, the card has a purse function, as the value unit balance is stored in the card and essentially known by the card, and the balance can be copied into central unit 1 for checking purposes.
According to a third embodiment, the purse function is no longer provided by the card but by the central processing unit itself. In this case the card has no data on the gambler's balance but only identification data such as identification number Id, several authentication keys Kta, Ktb, and Ktc, and possibly information on the gambler. The value unit balance data S1 are then stored only in database Bd of central processing unit 1. This value unit account is located for example in the database under identification number Id1.
In a gambling operation, identification number Id of card CJ1 is sent to central processing unit 1 through link means 123 of the network. The identification number Id can be sent directly by gambling machine 200 or its transcriber 210 if it has been memorized by the machine or its transcriber. Identification number Id can also be read from the card and sent to central processing unit 1 by transcriber 210 with each gambling operation.
After identification number Id has been checked, central processing unit 1 consults database Bd and sends the balance S1 of the value units allocated to card CJ1, to gambling machine 200.
Preferably, the data on the value unit balance are transferred with a certificate according to the data exchange securing protocol presented above.
One advantage of this third embodiment is that the sums bet are stored in central processing unit 1, which prevents any value from being memorized by the gambling cards.
According to this third embodiment, data representing the balance of the debited and/or credited values are stored in the database of the central processing means to prevent fraud from a chip card.
The check, in this third embodiment, is simply a check of the identification number Id of gambling card CJ1 with an identification key Kt1 read in database BD of central processing unit 1 to check the integrity of the card.
With these three embodiments of the invention, the integrity of gambling cards used in gambling machines can advantageously be monitored.
Moreover, by using data exchange securing means, the invention advantageously enables the integrity of a system formed by the gambling cards, the gambling machine network, and the database of the central processing unit to be checked, with the integrity of one of the three system elements, namely a gambling card or the network or the database, being checked with the aid of the other two elements.
The invention thus provides a system able to implement the method according to the invention.
A system of this type has a plurality of gambling machines, each machine being provided with a transcriber able to debit value units of a gambling card, the machines being networked with a central processing unit by link means.
According to the invention, the data representing gambling operations carried out with a chip card in a gambling machine are stored in the gambling card memory and, in parallel, in a database provided in the central processing unit.
The stored data are in particular card identification data and data on the balance or successive balances of value units debited and/or credited with the card.
Monitoring means such as a computer program authenticating the card identification number or comparing balance values stored in the card with those in the database or certifying the data exchanged are provided to check the integrity of the system.
Preferably, to secure the data exchanged over the network, a security module calculates an authentication certificate from secret data stored in the memory of the module and the monitoring means check that the authentication certificate calculated by the security module corresponds to the authentication certificate calculated by the gambling card or by another security module.
Such security modules MS0, MS1 can be disposed in gambling cards CJ1, CJ2, . . . , CJn, or in transcribers 10, 110, 210, 210′, 210″, 210′″, 310, gambling machines 200, 200′, 200″, and 200′″, of central processing unit 1, or even in the link means 123 of the network.
In particular, several security modules or means distributed in the network can be provided.

Late on Friday night, director David Dhawan faced a health scare as he fainted at Bunty Walia and Vanessa Parmar’s wedding party at a popular hotel at Bandra. The filmmaker was apparently chatting with friends Sanjay Dutt and Abhishek Bachchan as he suddenly fainted as Sanjay and Abhishek tried to revive him, and called the ambulance immediately.
The director thankfully became conscious soon and was led by actor Neil Nitin Mukesh and Bunty Walia to the nearby Lilavati hospital, and he seemed in a rather weak state. Tests at the hospital revealed that David suffered from what is known as a “Diabetic coma”, and is currently under observation where his vitals and diet was being monitored, though his condition was said to be stable. His eldest son, director Rohit Dhawan was by his side at the hospital, while the younger Varun Dhawan was on his way from Bangkok where he is currently shooting for a film.

Folks,
Nice post David.
Firstly let me say that Australian soils are old and our arable land is largely dry, so we don’t get the production per hectare that wetter newer soil countries get.
And apologies for the long list however I think it is worth considering this in the global context.
Having said that Australia has had the hedge of the “Paddock” against the “Quarry” throughout it’s entire modern history. This is a Discretionary (Boom) v Non Discretionary (Bust) play at a macro real economy national level.

Yes debt is less useful as money because it is only a claim on it. It has more risks attached like default and it is less wideley accepted as a medium. You could see it as a derivative of money I suppose.
Dave Lawson
Are you in a position to update the blog on progress being made with Minsky? Is it possible to set out a timetable for the development of the various elements planned to extend the model.
How is funding going?
Also what would need to to done to test possible policy adjustments such as public QE?
It is clear Australia is heading down the same path as UK and US with cuts in interest rates trying to keep the assets bubbles inflated until we reach ZIRP then the money will be injected into the banks to keep them afloat rather than reducing the private debt burden directly.
Lyonwiss:“Money/cash is a reliable store of value, if the government backing it is responsible. Otherwise, one has to fall back on gold and silver, which also measure trust in governments. The US government has been suppressing the USD gold price to mute the market’s signal of distrust.”
Why should anyone expect gold or silver or any other metal for that matter to be a store of value? Was gold a store of value in the 90s?
How exactly is the US government suppressing the gold price?
Just a few observations.
Capitalism versus socialism is a false duality. Some actual dualities are RE-distribution versus Distribution, the Oligarchy versus the Polis and the will to power versus the will to freedom. And then there’s the real duality so far as the basic psychology of both individuals and systems are concerned, vice versus virtue.
Read many of Randall Wray’s articles over on credit write downs. He’s a really bright and thorough researcher and its pleasant just to read what he says. The one thing however that IMO trips him (and nearly everyone else) up is his solutions are derivative, they just don’t penetrate deeply enough or don’t recognize what the true opposing ideas, forces, intentions or psychologies actually are.
One last actual duality comes to mind and its correlatives:
Status quo versus change, the latter of which breaks down into deep versus shallow and actual versus apparent.
@ Mikeh 1980 May 7, 2012 at 4:34 pm
Gold, silver, platinum, rare earths, land etc. all have intrinsic value, due to their utility. That their relative values fluctuate over time does not alter the fact of their real values, which are inherently more stable because of constraints to production.
The excuse for central banks to manipulate the gold price is to manage inflation expectation, which has been going on at least since the 90s. The following minutes of the Fed meeting in 1993 is just one of many examples:
Note the comment by Angell on p.32–33 on the importance of the gold price for the Fed. Note the comment by Greenspan on p.40:
.”
Later on p.50, Greenspan said: “For psychology, I think we ought to get Governor Phillips to dump her bracelet on the gold market at some point!”
A more recent (2005) conversation between Ron Paul and Greenspan on gold price manipulation here:
There is a lot of evidence of gold price manipulation over time. These days, investment banks such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are probably heavily involved, particularly through derivatives, which are unregulated and hide a lot of the transactions. Zero Hedge provides a recent example from trading data:
Lyonwiss
I asked you about US government suppressing the gold price. I couldn’t give a rats about Goldman or JPMorgan. I am only interested in what evidence exists of US government suppressing the gold price.
As for gold being a store of value — to me gold, like any commodity, has uncertain value. If I buy some today it may well have lost value — as it has in the past — when I want to use it to purchase goods and services in the future. To put it another way why would anyone want to “fall back” on gold or silver?
The argument has usefully moved on to how banks evaluate their portfolio and adjust the liquidity of that portfolio.
We are on to very tobinesque terrain — the ideas that so influenced Godley and current post-kenysian ideas about endogenous money (and if you arnt interested in that you wouldn’t be on this website).
There is a very interesting discussion on this and the extent to which individual banks (as opposed to banks in aggregate) can expand money relating to Tobins ideas on the blogosphere at the moment between Daniel Neilson Inet Money View and the very Hawtrian David Glasner at Uneasy money
I had previously thought that Tobins ideas on endogenous money were something of a bridge between ‘old’ exogenous ideas about money and modern circuitist theories — as they had a residue of loanable funds theories. I was very influenced in this view by Rochon’s magisterial survey Credit, Money, and Production
This blog exchange however has me thinking that Tobin was on to something, Glasner:-
while banks are making new loans, the public is also repaying old loans, and whether the total quantity of deposits is increasing or decreasing depends on whether banks create new deposits as they make new loans faster than the public is paying back its loans to the banks. [this is a very Hawtryian point from his verbal model of today what Steve calls the credit accelerator] And how fast the banks are creating new deposits depends on the economic incentives for creating deposits reflected in the structure of yields on alternative assets and liabilities, and on the costs banks expect to incur in financing their creation of deposits. If banks expect that the public will hold additional deposits, it will be more profitable to create additional deposits than if the banks have to borrow reserves in order to meet an increased deficit in interbank clearings. The quantity of loans being made and the quantity of deposits being created are the result of the interaction of economic decisions being made by banks and the public reflected in the entire spectrum of yields on the full range of assets and liabilities purchased and sold by banks.
Money (bank deposits) may have special features, but the decision-making process that determines the amount of money in existence at any moment of time is not essentially different from the process by which the amount of other financial instruments created by other financial other intermediaries is determined.. If the market in total is leaning towards leveraging or deleveraging and this sends rate of profit signals so the flow of capital will shape the investment decisions of banks, even though this may be harming the potential profitability of other sectors. If deleveraging increases the profitability of banks then equity will be attracted to the banking sector from other parts of the economy and the enhanced equity should eventually lead to an increase in borrowing as it expands the borrowing power of banks. Of course like for every firm this analysis only holds true as far as the firm (here bank) staves off bankruptcy.
Alainton
.”
The act of investment in an asset (new loan) is a wilful decision to create money theres no separation because banks create money when they lend.
It doesnt matter what the market signals are really as they are up for interpretation(ask a bunch of bankers how they see the economy some will say we are on the verge of a bull market others on the verge of deflation). Banks drive business cycles by expanding the supply of commercial bank money when they create new loans. If banks feel positive they will expand lending and create a new upswing and vice versa. The economic system is dependant on the subjective expectations or intentions of profit oriented banks which adjust the money supply through their lending decisions. The banking system drives the economy.
”
I do wonder whether the ‘thin air’ thing is pejorative and hinders correct analysis.
Banks expand their balance sheets. Other businesses expand their balance sheets as well.
Is there really that much difference between the analysis of a bank asset and its return and the analysis of any other intellectual property asset and its return?
The creation process seems pretty similar to me — call something an asset and convince others it has value.
@Dannyb2b
Way too subjectivist for my liking.
Do a % of bankers all subjectively get up one morning and say hey were going to expand credit today and that explains the credit/business cycle?
Questions — why are bankers expectation on profits net positive or negative?
Why does capital net flow towards or away from financial intermediaries as opposed to the productive sector of the economy?
If a bank has greater or lesser expectations on profits than other banks and this increases or decreases it profitability what market signals does that send to other banks?
This is not to say that individual loan decisions arnt important, but such agency is set within the structure of the capitalist economy where capital is always seeking the best out-turn.
Alainton
“why are bankers expectation on profits net positive or negative?”
Banks historically have been beset by herd mentality. They see a market appreciate (dotcom, housing, etc..) and they begin to expand lending into that sector more and more creating bubbles and driving new unstable upswings.
“If a bank has greater or lesser expectations on profits than other banks and this increases or decreases its profitability what market signals does that send to other banks?”
Doesnt matter what the signal is much of the time. What matters is how it is interpreted. If the herd start seeing the future in a positive light for whatever reason they will expand new lending and start a new upswing.
“Why does capital net flow towards or away from financial intermediaries as opposed to the productive sector of the economy?”
Capital flows to financial intrnediaries due to interest, loan repayments to a large extent.
“but such agency is set within the structure of the capitalist economy where capital is always seeking the best out-turn.”
And what is the evidence for ‘best’? Why not ‘good enough’?
@ Mikeh1980 May 7, 2012 at 7:41 pm
You said: “I asked you about US government suppressing the gold price. I couldn’t give a rats about Goldman or JPMorgan. I am only interested in what evidence exists of US government suppressing the gold price.”
Governments’ transactions directly in gold are well-known and transparent. But the US government (and others) may also deal indirectly through brokers, such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, because price manipulation (unlawful) to manage inflation expectations has to be done covertly. You obviously are not aware of the “revolving door” in the people connecting the government and the financial sector, helping operational confidentialty, in the name of maintaining market confidence (among other things). Some of the evidence are suggested in the links I provided.
You have a very emotional reaction to gold. In some countries or in some stressed situations, gold may be the only currency accepted to settle transactions. A day may yet come when the USD may not be widely accepted, outside the US, to settle transactions. I have 5 to 10 percent of my wealth in gold for “insurance” against government corruption and incompetence. Clearly, there is no need for this otherwise, as I’m not a “gold bug” speculator.
@NeilW
‘And what is the evidence for ‘best’? Why not ‘good enough’?’
Because CEOs that aim at that target get fired, as do soccer managers, and investors get wiped out in the long run as there investments no longer act as a store of value in real terms.
Hilferding — who put it more simply than Marx
’the individual capitalist can only survive if he strives continually not simply to keep pace with his competitors, but to outstrip them; and he can do this only if he succeeds in raising his profit above the average, thus achieving an extra profit…This result is assured by the competition of capitals for spheres of investment, by the constant influx of capital into those spheres with above average rates of profit, and by its withdrawal from those spheres where the rate of profit is below average. ’
@Danny2B
‘Banks historically have been beset by herd mentality’
Of course but that is a systemic phenomenon not one explainable by strong methodological individualism/reductionism
‘Capital flows to financial intermediaries due to interest, loan repayments to a large extent.’
The interest has to be competitive with the rate of profit in the productive economy, if it is much lower then it would be irrational for anyone to invest in finance capital. If the rate of profit in the productive economy is lower over any considerable period profits will fall due to lack of investment and then profits in finance capital will fall.
“Of course but that is a systemic phenomenon not one explainable by strong methodological individualism/reductionism”
So you agree with me now? The systemic phenomenon is manifesting itself because of an imbalance. This imbalance is that some private profit oriented entities create money and some don’t. Too few entities (the ones creating the money) making decisions for an entire economy means poor allocation of resources because of a limited capacity to analyze and manage the environment effectively.
A balanced system is one where all entities operate on a level field and a greater number of entities are involved in the lending and investment process. More minds at work equals better decisions.
“Because CEOs that aim at that target get fired, as do soccer managers, and investors get wiped out in the long run as there investments no longer act as a store of value in real terms.”
No they don’t.
The vast majority of businesses are run on a good enough basis doing just enough to avoid boats being rocked.
Australian cities are well represented among the “world’s most expensive cities” according to this analysis:
@NeilW
The vast majority of businesses are SMEs or other privately held firms without shareholders and only they can afford to survive at below average profit rates for any considerable length of time, and not if they are debtors as they will then need to pay a competitive interest rate (again Hilferding was good on how different rules on profit rates apply to different segments of the economy).
Why should anyone rationally invest in a firm that makes significantly below average profit rates, unless the rate of profit is higher than the rate of inflation, as the value of the investment will erode over time, it would be better investing on bonds or keeping it in the bank.
@Lyonwiss
This began when I found your claim that the US government was suppressing the gold price astounding and sought evidence from you. You’ve made some wild assertions but nothing close to being evidence. You’ve referenced a tin foil hat blog, claimed I am unaware about a revolving door between government and the financial sector, claimed I am emotional about gold and so on. None of this constitutes evidence that the US is suppressing the gold price. It reads as random hand waving intended to obscure a lack of any information to support your emotional beliefs.
Take your information to all the institutions that are long gold so they can initiate a class action against the conspirators suppressing the gold price.
@ Mikeh1980 May 8, 2012 at 9:39 am
Central banks are long gold. They are unlikely to initiate class action against themselves.
@ Mikeh1980 May 8, 2012 at 9:39 am
Also, I find it amazing that you cannot take a hint and find things out for yourself. Who are you that I need to convince you or educate you? What have you brought to the conversation? Nothing, not even a “a tin foil hat blog”. I will stop here.
@Lyonwiss
“Central banks are long gold. They are unlikely to initiate class action against themselves.”
And what of others long gold? Gold ETFs and so on. Don’t you think that if any credible evidence existed of the gold price being suppressed that they would have an interest in that?
“Also, I find it amazing that you cannot take a hint and find things out for yourself. Who are you that I need to convince you or educate you? What have you brought to the conversation? Nothing, not even a “a tin foil hat blog”. I will stop here.”
I came across your astounding claim — it stood out in this conversation amidst a measured debate by others about banks and money — and asked you for evidence. All you do is respond with condescending remarks (but nothing that can support your claim). Now instead of providing evidence to support your assertion you ask me to find things out for myself. Do you expect anyone to take you seriously when you post stuff like this?
@ Mikeh1980 May 8, 2012 at 11:39 am
You have added nothing factual to this conversation. Please terminate.
@Lyonwiss
Your last comment (May 8, 2012 at 12:31 pm) is quite ironic. It was your absence of facts that led me to comment in the first place. i.e. I asked you what evidence, a.k.a. facts, you had to support your assertions about the US government suppressing the gold price.
If this US government action was real rather than in your imagination I’m sure some evidence would have been forthcoming by now — and no doubt gold longs would be up in arms. I agree we should terminate — before the US government get wind of your exposé and send in the black helicopters.Aloha there at Audiko, where it’s possible to use the most popular ringtones for your mobile.

I'm glad to see Ghirahim (altho he was an obvious choice for a boss imo). I'm normally not the type, who's asking for characters, but I really want to see a 3D model for Vaati (preferably in one of his humanoid Minish Cap forms).
I feel like we've really come a LONG way since that first reveal trailer last year, that was kind of ugly - and I doubt anyone will disagree with that. Hyrule Warriors went from "meh" to must-buy and actually "most wanted of 2014" for me. Really love how the game looks and it seems to be packed with content

So lets see the playable characters so far for Hyrule Warriors:

-Zelda
-Impa
-Midna
-Agitha
-Fi
-Ganon/Ganondorf (I believe Ganon was teased in the E3 Trailer)
-Ghirahim
-Lana
-Cia
-Wizro
-Valga
I know the villains in the game will be playable because in both Dynasty and Samurai Warriors, you have always been able to play as any special, non generic warrior. A better example being Warriors Orochi games, where you can unlock and play as Orochi, Da Ji, e.c.t.
If you can't play as any of the villains, then it'll be extremely disappointing as Warriors Games normally have massive rosters, and even with my list, the roster is still small compared to a normal Warriors game. So this list should not really be cut, as these are all the special characters appearing in the game so far.

@hiptanaka Pretty much all of the Warriors games are the same, once you've played one, you've played them all.
Enemies are just there as fodder, the only things that are a bit of a threat are the leaders/bosses, and even then you are still winning by mindlessly mashing buttons.

@yemsols No, the way the creators of this game are following the Zelda franchise pretty loosely, meaning we could see stuff like tornados or using the wind to slow down enemies from this little wonder. Don't doubt them. I'm just shocked that somehow they put Agitha, the bug maniac in this game.

Speaking of bad, anybody else have problems with the Deku leaf in WW HD? Those flowers jumps are a mess. For a game with no jump button Link does a helkuva lot of jumping.

Chubblings said:
@shigulicious Even though this does not necessarily confirm all the villains that I mentioned, it is probable that they will be. As I said before, in past Warriors games, any sort of non-generic special character has been playable. Furthermore, making these characters playable would expand the roster, which so far, is good, but very small. Warriors games have had a history of large rosters. However, it is also possible that they may not be playable, as in the E3 Demo for Hyrule Warriors, while it only lets you pick between Link and Zelda, the character selection has a total of 9 slots (including Link and Zelda). That would mean that 7 out of the 9 characters would have been confirmed. Personally, I'm hoping that the roster I wrote out , is the final roster for the game, as those are all characters who appear in the game.
#40
Chubblings said:
@Emblem Yeah, I'm excited for those three as well. Hyrule Warriors for September 19 (I'm in Europe), Samurai Warriors 4 for October 24. I know Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires will eventually come, but do you know when it'll come, as I don't think it's been announced yet for the West.

Still holding out for reviews but I think the decision will be between buying right away or waiting until it goes on sale. Too much fan service for this fan to ignore it.
@rjejr Flower Jumps. Just remember you can fall straight back down into the flowers as much as you want and take your time to line up.

The only reason Fi should exist in this game is so we can kill her, over, and over, and over, and over, for all the times she annoyed the heck out of us in SS. Ahhh how I hate that character so much.

I really liked Fi...and I never understood why people didn't like her as a character.

AJWolfTill said:
@ikki5
Out of all the timeline mashing that this game is doing, this is the thing you question? Anyways the Wind Waker existed before the events of that game and was presumably an heirloom of the royal family. It makes perfect sense that Zelda could wield it.
Here is a quote
"That Wind Waker you hold was used long ago to conduct us sages when we played our song to call upon the gods. In those days, it was always the king who conducted for us...".
#54
Yorumi said:
@Action51 The very reason people hated navi so much was because she was constantly interrupting you. Fi does exactly that about 10,000 times more often. I swear approaching the forest temple you feel like every time you take one single step she's showing up to spout some sort of useless information that insults the intelligence of a 6 year old.
After a while you realize you've taken 10 steps and spent 3 hours listening to her babble on. Then your arm gets sore from flailing around and you just turn the game off to make her shut up. I thought navi was moderately annoying, after a couple hours in SS I was in the fetal position barely coherently mumbling "please nintendo masters, I'm sorry I ever questioned navi, i'm sorry, i'm sorry, please forgive me and give me navi back."
#55
DiscoGentleman said:
@Shotgunryugan I say that often because most people do have that misconception. It wouldn't be fair to a game that (IMO) looks pretty decent to be shoved into the button mashing category.
There are combos in all the Warriors games, becoming increasingly elaborate in the more recent entries, some give different effects like launching or stunning, which work better on certain enemies. That's some fighting strategy to me. Every mission has a different objective, whether it's defeat a boss, drive an enemy out of a stronghold, save or escort an ally. Maps require some exploration. Some games more than others, like the Samurai games. And being that this is a spinoff title, i'm betting there will be some new things atypical to the warriors games.
I'm just saying this is a series with a lot of depth. This game isn't just about mowing down seemingly endless hordes of stationary enemies, but some people are spreading that misconception, like you were (not trying to insult or start an argument); there are a lot of people here who say they've never played a game in the genre, so I put in my two cents and my experience with the Warriors games.

@rjejr: Yo man, so what exactly is the problem you are having? First, line up where you want to "jump to" at the top center of your screen and when you launch from the flow and just push the stick straight ahead.
#57
NodesforNoids said:
@Chubblings I could rattle off at least 8 more characters that COULD be playable, aren't villains and debunk your theory.
Go, you say? All righty then!
Ruto, Rutela, Darunia, Dangoro (was a boss, but still a Goron with a unique fighting style), the Ordon mayor, Groose, Gaepora (another master swordsman and physically stronger than Link) and Sheikah, a character that doesn't necessarily have to be Zelda and would obviously not play the same as Zelda.
That's knowing Agitha is in the game, so realistically, Saria (summoning animals) could be in the game, Ashei (who wears armor and carries a sword), the Yeti, and the 3 goddesses in their human forms (Din, Nayru and Farore) with an obvious slant towards elemental magic.
At the top end, that's 14 additional playable characters with no villains. Without getting too obscure. In fact, I see no reason why each one of those characters couldn't appear. With the heroes Chubblings and I both listed, the roster would be 21 characters. How many want to be the final roster will be 18-22?

rjejr said:
@Ryno - Mostly I'm just annoyed at how much jumping there is in this game w/o a jump button. I get that Zelda is an adventure game and not a platformer so there's no need for a jump button, but those 6 flowers in a row are a nuisance. Why can't the stupid Deku tree just lift me up to the leaf? Or why can't one of the Koroko go get it and fly it down to me? It's not my friend whos stuck in the woods, the sucker can die for all I care, I'm not jumping into the same 6 flowers over and over again. I should at least be able to lower a rope down from that mid level platform so I don't have to keep doing the 1st 3 over and over again. And then I save it hi up in the middle room in the forbidden Woods, the first big room w/ all the jumping over there. So I make it to the top and call it a day to go cook dinner. Today I start up and I'm back at the beginning of the dungeon. So back up thu all the stupid plants again. Save anywhere ain't worth a dam if I have to restart back at the beginning.
Oh, and aiming w/ the grapling hook sucks too. I get it lined up but before I shoot half the time it moves off so I miss. Maybe my Gamepad stick is screwed up but a lock on for that would be nice.
I'm beginning to think all the hate for this game that was blamed on the graphics was actually meant for the controls. Its a cute game and I'm really into it, but thats DESPITE the horrible controls at almost every turn. Really looking forward to getting off this rock, the game was going great until I got here. Going to take a break this weekend then go start fresh by visiting Tingle, I know he'll cheer me up, he's so...happy.
#85
rjejr said:
@aaronsullivan - "take your time to line up."
As stupid as this sounds, my problem is when to push forward on the stick and for how long. Do I push and hold it before the jump, do I hold it the entire time, due I hit it repeatedly? It seemed to work only randomly no matter what I tried. And all I've basically played my enitre life is open world plaform games, so this shouldnt be a problem for me. I's also weird that te left stick controls the camera while in the flower, why didn't they just keep in on the right? I just don't like the whole flower jumping mechanic 1 bit.

TheDarkNerd said:
Oh my god just look at the Sealed Grounds. SO BEAUTIFUL. And Ghirahim is confirmed! PARTY HARD!!!! :'D
#87
EarthboundBenjy said:
@rjejr
...The left stick never controls your camera. While inside the flower, the left stick changes what direction you're facing. The camera moves during this because otherwise you wouldn't see any change, due to not being able to see Link. Just keep holding forwards when you're facing the direction you want to be spit out. Don't hold a direction if you want Link to land back in the flower to get a better angle. That's really all there is to it.
#88
rjejr said:
@EarthboundBenjy - "Just keep holding forwards"
Yeah, I settled on that, but sometimes he still doesn't go far enough. On the bright side I don't think I've ever once overshot a flower.
#89
EarthboundBenjy said:
@rjejr
Not going far enough? If you're talking about the series of flowers to reach the Deku Leaf on top of the tree, then you should always be able to go far enough to reach the next one. And if you're talking about flowers after that, then just pull out the leaf and glide gently forwards the rest of the way. I don't see "sometimes he doesn't go far enough" as a negative towards the game design, I see it as you not having figured out how to use the tools at your disposal to move around effectively.
#90
rjejr said:
@EarthboundBenjy - "I see it as you not having figured out how to move around effectively."
I'll admit it took some trial and error to get to go where I wanted to, that's not the bad game design, it's having a guy spend so much of his time in a game jumping but not having a jump button, it's just too weird. Every time he gets close to a ledge to jump across I hit the A button for him to jump. It's just weird. He jumps across gaps, onto tables, onto ledges, into plants, out of plants, jump jump jump.
#91
EarthboundBenjy said:
@rjejr
Heh, Link does jump around a lot. But while the A button does have many functions that vary based on your situation, such as talking when near a person, grabbing when near a small object, sidling when near a wall, etc... the A button will never perform a 'jump' action, so it doesn't do anything at all when you press it at a ledge.
I think the fact that you press it when jumping off a ledge sort of makes you subconsciously associate the button press with the action, so you will end up frustrated when pressing it elsewhere doesn't work. If you just let Link leap where he needs to without worrying about the button press, then you'll maybe begin to understand what button presses will make Link do which action in each situation.
If the game required Link to jump, then he would be able to, right? The game can't have areas that require an action that is impossible to perform, after all.
#92
rjejr said:
@EarthboundBenjy - "subconsciously associate the button press with the action"
That was my point. Though my bigger problem is most of the platformers I've played have been on the PS1 and PS2 so I hit B (jump is always X on Playstation) to jump and Link's sword comes out. Having jump be automatic also puts Link on top of a lot of ledges - sometimes falling off the other side - tables and boxes that I prefer he didn't climb onto. For a videogame character it's like the AI has a mind of it's own.
#93
EarthboundBenjy said:
@rjejr
I don't know what to say other than that I think the control setup is fine and does indeed suit the kind of game Wind Waker is. If you have issues with controlling Link, there's nothing more I can really say other than just... try to get the hang of it, or just play a different game. I dunno. I learnt how to control Link fairly quickly, but I suppose it would take different people different amounts of time to get the hang of it.

FRIDAYS @ 10:30pCSTMCC Holds College Reach-Out Awards Ceremony
(Bradenton, Fla., May 29, 2008) - Graduating seniors from area high schools and other students in Manatee Community College's (MCC) College Reach-Out Program (CROP) were honored May 15 at the 10th Annual CROP Awards Ceremony held at MCC Bradenton.
Dr. Sarah H. Pappas, MCC president, gave welcoming remarks, and students were presented with certificates, gift bags, scholarships and special achievement awards. Former CROP and current MCC students D.J. Anneaud and Glendy Lopez shared their insights and experiences as student speakers. Other participants in the ceremony were Kristen L. Anderson, MCC CROP director; Sheila McCants, MCC counselor; and Edmundo Delgado, CROP multicultural specialist.
CROP, a statewide program funded through a grant from the Florida Department of Education and designed to increase the number of students who successfully complete postsecondary education, is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. MCC's school-based program assists targeted students by providing motivational and educational activities to keep them on a college-bound track.
CROP students honored as Students of the Year included Austin Cripe (Booker Middle School), Kadeem Scott (Bayshore High School), Gilberto Parada (Booker High School), Mariela Barrogan (Central High School), Markie Muller (Manatee High School), Shannon Mitchell (Palmetto High School), Antonnet Johnson (Riverview High School) and Jenna Louis-Jeune (Southeast High School).
CROP site coordinators include Gary Clark (Booker Middle School), Lem Andrews and Dalila Vasquez-Morales (Booker High School), Yvette Benton and Christine Keusch (Central High School), Matilda Bediako (Manatee High School), Suzette Holness (Palmetto High School), Connie Hubbard (Riverview High School) and Linda Bogue (Southeast High School).
Sixty-one percent of this year's CROP seniors (25 of 41) have been accepted into the 2008 Summer Bridge Program and will receive scholarships ($800) to attend MCC this summer after their high school graduation. CROP graduates who attend MCC are eligible to receive tuition and book scholarships.In May 2009, the Guardian newspaper (in the UK) featured an article quoting research that concluded that the impact of CCTV on overall crime is "modest" but that it is effective in reducing vehicle crime in car parks. The previous year the Association of Chief Police Officers determined that CCTV was effective in the detection of only 3% of all crime; this could be considered a worry as most police officers (not only in the UK) will tell you that CCTV is more useful in crime detection than in crime prevention.
So, it is necessary to understand what CCTV is and what its capabilities are. The reports that conclude that CCTV has limited effectiveness in preventing and detecting crime may be missing the point. In specific scenarios, such as airports, it is impossible to conceive how such a facility could even function without CCTV deployment on a very large scale. At the end of the day, the efficacy of CCTV comes down to two major issues: the cost of manpower and the limitations of staff – the human factor in aviation terminology.Come!

Time to kick back after a hard week of work - or recover from too much "relaxation" on Friday night. Park the kids, or yourself, in front of the Saturday morning cartoons. Work your way through the Sunday paper. Unwind. Chill.
Nothing puts you in a mellow state of mind better than the one-two punch of sugar and caffeine, courtesy of a box of donuts and a hot cup of coffee. Counter intuitive but true. You see, donuts and coffee, when paired together, slow down your day. Just like milk and cookies, donuts and coffee are designed to be consumed in combination. Nibble a little donut; sip a little coffee.
Happily for St. Louisans, our city is something of a donut Mecca, particularly on the South Side. Hardly a neighborhood goes unserved by a purveyor of fried pastry. And if that weren't enough, the city is blessed with so many local coffee roasters you could try a different company's beans every day for a week and still have more to go. Feast is gonna simplify things for you by doing the leg work. Here are five great coffee and donut picks from around St. Louis. Love that sweet, lazy weekend.

launched in late 1982, there was a lot of chopping and changing
within the group. Bernie Marsden left to set up SOS, and then
Alaska - who later supported Deep Purple at the 1985 Knebworth
Festival. Ian Paice and Neil Murray jumped ship to join Gary Moore's
band for two years of rather ghastly heavy metal.
David
Coverdale managed to retain Jon Lord's services, and also brought
back a supposedly reinvigorated Micky Moody. The new men to add
extra punch to the group were ex-Trapeze guitarist Mel Galley,
ex-Rainbow and MSG drummer Cozy Powell, and - another jazz rock
musician - bassist Colin Hodgkinson, who Coverdale hoped would
add a different slant to the music.
The
band initially toured to promote 'Saints & Sinners', which had
mostly been recorded by the Mk 4 line-up as it was in the process
of disintegrating. Unsurprisingly it ranks as one of Whitesnake's
weakest efforts. The two strongest tracks (by some distance) were
'Here I Go Again' and 'Crying In The Rain' (both of which would
be re-recorded by later incarnations). Nevertheless, Whitesnake's
UK popularity remained undiminished, and the new band's tour was
rounded off with a pyrotechnic headlining appearance at the Donnington
Festival, which adopted a suitably military theme ("Whitesnake
Commandos" t-shirts and press packs). New single 'Guilty Of Love'
was released to coincide, and the band made the 'Slide It In'
album for release in early 1984. Yet again however, by the time
it appeared, the line-up which had recorded it was history.
(photo:
Cozy Powell, Mel Galley, Jon Lord, David Coverdale, Colin Hodgkinson,
Micky Moody)
The band's increasingly heavy,
flash approach lead to Micky Moody leaving for good at the end
of the tour. He was replaced by latter-day Thin Lizzy guitarist
John Sykes, who embodied the style which the band were heading
towards. Colin Hodgkinson had not fitted in as hoped, and was
quickly replaced by the returning Neil Murray.
'Slide
It In' was a chart success in the UK, but came in for hostile
press reaction aimed at the double-entendre drenched lyrics
and titles for which Whitesnake were already infamous (but which
were considered increasingly un PC), as well as the resoundingly
flat production job. That was soon to change when the band's
new US label Geffen demanded that the album be remixed by producer
Keith Olsen. It was possibly the most important decision in
the band's lifetime. The difference was startling. Suddenly
Coverdale had the powerful, dynamic sound which he'd been striving
for over the years. Murray had also taken the opportunity to
re-dub all of the bass, while Sykes managed to replace a proportion
of Moody's work. A strong European tour duly followed, which
ran into trouble in Germany when Mel Galley suffered a serious
arm injury during a moment of high-jinx. It would lead to him
having to leave the band.
The band
continued as a five piece, with the lead instrumentalists enjoying
more space to express themselves on stage within Whitesnake's
dense wall of sound. It was ironic for Jon Lord, who was planning
to leave at the end of the tour. He played his last Whitesnake
show on Swedish TV's 'Mandagsborsen' (April 16th 1984), and
then left to help finalise the Deep Purple Mk 2 reunion. In
keeping with the new, streamlined Whitesnake, it was decided
not to replace him. Keyboards were instead handled by off-stage
player Richard Bailey and for a time Whitesnake were officially
a four piece.
(photo: Mel Galley, Jon Lord, Neil Murray, John Sykes, David
Coverdale, Cozy Powell)
As
the band shed members, their profile in America began to rise
rapidly. The newly remixed and rearranged 'Slide It In' was
gaining airplay (such was the demand it had to be released back
in Europe as a special edition), and armed with MTV-friendly
promo videos and support tours with current US hot-shots Quiet
Riot and then Dio, the American market was opening up fast.
Before recording their
all important new album, another personnel change was made,
when Cozy Powell's suggestion of a four way financial split
within the band fell on stony ground. He played his last Whitesnake
show at the huge 'Rock In Rio' festival in January 1985, before
leaving to become the 'P' in a new 'ELP'.

*'Need
Your Love So Bad' was a non-album b-side just featuring
Coverdale and Lord, but was included as a bonus track
on the original UK cassette release of the album. It
was available in Japan on CD but was bizarrely substituted for a 1987-era version on the 2009 'Slide It In' remaster. The 'Guilty Of Love' / 'Gamber'
single tracks from August 1983 were originally produced
by Eddie Kramer, and then re-mixed for 'Slide It In',
meaning that three separate mixes of each track were released
within a year. #
The two later UK singles from 1984-85 contained US mixes
of the tracks.

Bad-beat poker face a familiar reminder of poker's perilsSeptember 16, 2013 Updated: September 16, 2013 11:32pm
It's always fun when something poker related makes the national social media rounds, even if the televised event pretty much summarizes the cursed life that comes with being a poker player.

Start the conversation >MOMBASA, Kenya, Aug. 29 (Xinhua) -- A newly expanded port berth, as one of two key Vision 2030 flagship projects launched by the Kenyan government in July 2011, reopened in Kenya's port city Mombasa on Wednesday.
Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said at the opening ceremony that the facility should serve the interests of the entire East African region.
"The new Berth 19, with 15 acres of stacking yard, provides additional annual capacity of 200,000 TEU and will significantly improve the port's operational efficiency," said Kenyatta.
The Kenyan government intended to turn the Port of Mombasa into the largest and most business-friendly sea-port on the East African coast, he said.
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan President Paul Kagame also attended the event.
The new berth would speed up the cargo delivery to Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), northern Tanzania, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia, according to Michael Kamau, Kenyan cabinet secretary for transport and infrastructure.
The expansion of Berth 19 was funded by the Kenyan government at 82.15 million U.S. dollars and undertaken by China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC).
Kamau commended CRBC's performance, saying the project was completed two months in advance within budget.
Li Qiang, general manager of CRBC Kenya office, said the project will increase the port throughput by 33 percent, consolidating the leading status of Mombasa as well as Kenya in East Africa.
Kenyan officials said the expansion was the first over the past two decades to meet increasing demands in the East African region. The Kenyan government is also planning to upgrade roads and railway lines to and from Mombasa port.The Essence Festival is known for having some of the most memorable tributes to ever hit the festival scene. Remember when Patti Labelle, Usher, Gerald Levert, Faith Evans, Ashanti, Kelly Price and Ron Isley all paid homage to Luther Vandross in 2003? If not, check that out here.
To commemorate 20 years of the festival, we decided to give artists the opportunity to pitch to us who they would like to tribute and what other artists they would like to assist them in tributing that artist. We will unveil a new Essence Fest Dream Team every Wednesday, so make sure you come back each week to see who your favorite artists consider legendary and worthy of a tribute on the main stage.
First up is Slip-N-Slide Records freshman artist Sebastian Mikael:
The legend would be Sade. I would pick Jhené Aiko - I think she's amazing. I really wanna pick new artists because there are a lot of great new artists coming out. Aloe Blacc, I think he's great too. I would also pick James Fauntleroy. And I love Alicia Keys so I would have to have her in there.Castlevania: Lords of Shadow -- Mirror of Fate

From Chuck’s post on the “Red’s Army.com Hall of Fame“:.
Jester started reading Red’s Army while stationed as a Combat Medic & Staff Sergeant with the 463rd Engineer Battalion of the US Army in Balad, Iraq. It was 2005, and the C’s were in the second year of Doc Rivers’ tenure. Folks like Jester and Tim(FireDoc) could be found ranting and/or raving in the comments section of every post. Jester tells me that the main thing that got him hooked on the site was the no BS approach of founders John & Chuck. They spoke to and for the average Celtics fan, and like Jester, they loved a stiff drink. As the years went on, and Red’s Army began hosting live call-in style shows, Jester would dial them up and introduce himself with his trademark “Good Morning..”-even if it was 10pm on the east coast. Jester’s been here through it all-the ups & downs of the Celtics, a guy starting an entire blog devoted to how much our site sucked and even some of the live chats that we ran:
Jester has also been known to play the occasional joke or two hence the moniker “Jester”. Like the time he called into “Celtics Talk Radio” and impersonated me. When I actually called in for my guest appearance, I had no idea what was going on, and the show’s host found out that he had been talking to a KWAPT impersonator. Nice one Jester:
Jester grew up in Bridgeport, Ohio. Coincidentally, Bridgeport is also the hometown of one of the greatest Celtics of all-time, John “Hondo” Havlicek. Jester has fond memories of watching some of the glory days of Celtics basketball with his father, who was also a big fan. Once a young Jester saw the passion & love that his dad had for the boys from Beantown, he quickly drank the green Kool-Aid himself. He lists Larry Bird’s amazing triple-double against the Blazers in 1992 as the most enjoyable game he and his dad watched together. Bird went off for 49 points, 14 rebounds & 12 assists in Boston’s 152-148 double OT win. It was a duel for the ages, as Portland’s Clyde Drexler (41 pts) and Larry Legend went back & forth hitting one big shot after another.
Jester attended Ohio University Eastern in St. Clairsville, Ohio. He played on the men’s bball team all four years of his stay, and rocked “00” in honor of the great Robert Parish. Despite being a big fan of “The Chief”, Jester says that his all-time fave Celt is Kevin McHale. As for this year’s team, he really likes the nucleus of Rondo, Sully & Avery Bradley. He also likes a lot of what he’s seen from young Kelly Olynyk. We are both in complete agreement that Olynyk needs some muscle. Once he hits those weights, he should do much better against the bigger, stronger guys that he’s encountered over his rookie season in the NBA.
Jester and I wrapped-up our discussion by talking about the future of this team. He feels that this will be a rather quick rebuild. He does not envision Danny & Wyc taking a very long time to bring some talent into town. But in the meantime, he says that if he could get through the 2006-07 disaster, he can get through anything. And I agree. Jester is what you call a die-hard. That term is thrown around quite a bit nowadays, but in his case, it could even be an understatement. This guy absolutely loves the Boston Celtics and will be supporting them until the day that he dies.
I want to send a huge thank you out to Jester for participating in Fan Friday, and also for his unwavering support of Red’s Army for the past 9+ years. You can follow him on Twitter via this link, and he’s always posting his opinions, thoughts & sometimes unintelligible drunken banter in our comments section. Welp, this is it-another year of “Fan Friday” over. Thank you all so much for reading, and GO CELTICS. Have a great spring/summer everyone! -KWAPTPhoto: The Henry Hudson Bridge turns 75By.
The Henry Hudson Bridge under construction. Photographer: Richard Averill Smith, June 19, 1936.
That top photo must have been incorrectly loaded. There is only a tiny square with an “x” inside.
A few minutes later, the photo is now visible.
The Republican policies of the 1920s that caused the first Great Depression fought FDR tooth and nail on every economic remedy to create jobs BUT Congress had enough elected Democrats to get things done despite a lot of very nasty fighting.
Until Americans decide having a President and Congress of different philosophies only causes gridlock and right now, we really don’t need that.
Thank God FDR got all those amazing projects built since there won’t be any new ones anytime soon.
Republicans have no right to call themselves Christians.
Amen to that.
Those Republicans are wily. Even when they have no power they disrupt all yopu great plans. Kind of like the way the Kulaks and “counter revolutionary elements” were always messing up the Soviet grain harvest.
The bridge is unique in the metro area because it’s more like those mountain gorge bridges you see in the more mountainous areas. But like most of Moses’ pre-World War II efforts, it connects to a highway that’s better suited for Sunday drives in the country than it is for daily commutes.
From a transit prospective, the impending change-over to toll-by-photo on the Henry Hudson Bridge will be a major test to see if a similar system would work on the East River bridges. Camera capture of license plates to send toll charges to for non-EZ Pass users is the only way tolling the East River spans will work, since there’s no feasible way to put booths at one end of the Brooklyn, Manhattan Willie B and Queensboro spans.
Eliminating the free crossing option would both give the city and/or the MTA an additional fund stream while at the same time giving drivers more motivation to switch over to mass transit or commuter rail. But we will have to see what the toll collection rate is on the bills sent out, since system won’t work unless the fear of action for non-observance of the law is there.
That the Henry Hudson Bridge is needed as a “test” for this system is so typically MTA. Open road tolling is a proven technology already in use elsewhere. Texas and Ontario have been using it for several years now. Maryland and Quebec have also started using it within the past year, and North Carolina will be bringing it online on their first modern toll road come January.
Forget “let’s see whether it can work”. It can work.
The Illinois Tollway has had high speed open tolling since 2004 or 2005 (iPass/EzPass plus photos). Why the MTA needs to run a test run is a good question.
The Power Broker details the history of this bridge and the West Side Highway construction, and how Moses managed to scrimp, borrow and steal funding for this bridge to get it completed, in addition to engineering a bridge with just two steel arches instead of the traditional three.
Makes me wonder how the rebuilding effort of the Tappan-Zee and Kosciuszko are going to fare.
The caption is slightly incorrect. The rail bridge belonged to the New York Central Railroad not the “Grand Central Railroad”.1-20 of 709 results in Model Trains > Buildings > HO Scale.

Defendant Provided Vehicle Registration Information for Law Enforcement Surveillance Vehicles to Narcotics Trafficker
Earlier today, at the federal courthouse in Central Islip, New York, Roosevelt Green, formerly a Sergeant with the New York City Police Department, was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for making false statements to Drug Enforcement Administration Special Agents during a narcotics investigation. The sentence was imposed by United States District Judge Joseph F. Bianco and announced by Benton J. Campbell, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.
On June 16, 2009, as jury selection was about to commence in his trial, Green pleaded guilty to lying to DEA agents on May 22, 2007. As Green’s guilty plea, indictment, and underlying complaint reveal, he used NYPD computers to obtain vehicle registration information for two DEA surveillance vehicles and provided that information to Frank Wilson, a long-time Wyandanch narcotics trafficker.1 In a May 22, 2007 interview with DEA agents, Green falsely stated that he did not provide the vehicle registration information to Wilson.
In February 2007, the DEA, Suffolk County Police Department (SCPD), Suffolk County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD), and the United States Attorney’s Office commenced a court-authorized wiretap investigation of Wilson’s narcotics trafficking organization, which had been distributing cocaine and “crack” cocaine in Suffolk County for more than a decade. Law enforcement officers intercepted a series of conversations between Green and Wilson, which revealed that Wilson asked Green to check license plates on two vehicles Wilson thought might have been used to follow him. The intercepted conversations further revealed that, while on duty in an NYPD patrol car on March 31, 2007, Green used NYPD computers to obtain vehicle registration information for two vehicles and provided that information to Wilson. Both those vehicles had been used to conduct surveillance of Wilson and his co-conspirators during the wiretap investigation. In a subsequent conversation, Green told Wilson that he wanted a warm-up suit and a pair of sneakers in exchange for the information.
On May 22, 2007, DEA agents and NYPD detectives executed a federal search warrant at Green’s Wyandanch residence. A number of items were seized, including sneakers and other articles of clothing Green admitted receiving from Wilson. At that time, Green told the DEA agents that he had had conversations with Wilson and that he was aware that Wilson was a drug dealer, but denied having obtained vehicle registration information for him.
As a condition of his plea agreement with the government, Green, a 12-year veteran, resigned from the NYPD immediately after his guilty plea on June 16, 2009 and agreed not to seek future employment with any federal, state or local law enforcement agency.
“Law enforcement officers have the responsibility to serve the public and protect their communities. This defendant abused that responsibility and used his position to obtain sensitive information that he provided to a known drug dealer,” stated United States Attorney Campbell. “By doing so, he not only violated his duties as a police officer, but also endangered fellow law enforcement officers and the public through his actions.”
Mr. Campbell thanked the DEA, SCPD, and SCSD for their efforts during this prosecution. Mr. Campbell also thanked the NYPD for its cooperation and assistance during the investigation.
The government’s case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney John J. Durham.
The Defendant:
ROOSEVELT GREEN
Age: 47
_____________________________
1 In May 2007, Wilson and 14 co-defendants were arrested for conspiring to distribute cocaine and “crack” cocaine and were subsequently indicted on narcotics and weapons charges. All 15 defendants have pleaded guilty and have been sentenced or are awaiting sentencing in the Eastern District of New York.
The Department of Justice believes that it is important to keep victims/witnesses of federal crime informed of court proceedings and what services may be available to assist you.UK: Constellation Brands to “clean up” in '09

Closing: 22/05/2015 (about 3 hours)1996 Eagle Talon TSI AWD 2.0L turbo (4g63T) from North America
Summary:
A great car overall if maintenance is kept up
Faults:
Sunroof has been problematic since 3rd year of ownership. Have replaced the entire assembly 3 times. See below for final solution.
Transfer case recall performed at 40K miles.
CD player function was spotty from 40K to 70K miles, when it finally failed completely. Remainder of the stereo still functions.
Water pump at 58K miles. Replaced all belts at the same time.
Ball joints replaced at 75K.
Auto door locks began misbehaving at 90K miles, failed entirely at 100K. This also renders the factory alarm and remote keyless entry inoperable.
Turbo expired at 96K miles. Replaced with a new MHI turbo for a 3rd generation Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, as opposed to rebuilding/replacing the stock Garrett T25.
Surfaces have held up well, no cracks in the dash. Driver's seat has some wear, but is not torn. The driver's door handle/panel attachment point is broken, as well as the window/lock switch supports (I repaired the switch assembly.)
General Comments:
The car handles well stock, and tends toward understeer when pushed, as most AWD cars do. I have installed a set of thicker anti-roll bars, which tightened up the suspension quite a bit. And believe it or not, I am still on the stock struts at 13+ years. They are not worn out.
AWD is great in the snow and ice. With a good set of snow tires, this car can go anywhere.
Performance with the stock turbo is pretty good, and the car has a nice little kick-in-the-pants at low rpms, but the small turbo runs out of steam above about 5K rpms. This is why I replaced the blown stock turbo with the Evolution 3 turbo, as it has a lot more potential for increased power at pretty much any engine speed, while still showing little turbo 'lag'.
Wind noise can be a little annoying, as the windows tend to loosen over time in the guides/tracks. This can be remedied with a little elbow grease, and prevented by NOT closing the doors by pushing on only the glass.
The sunroof, as previously noted, has been a bit of a pain. I finally resorted to hardwiring the motor, bypassing the black box 'brain', and it works now, minus the one-touch open function. I can live with that.
The door lock issue can be fixed with some pretty cheap parts (<$25), but the labor costs to do it are high, as you have to access the inner end of the door lock cylinders to swap a couple of electrical fittings. Getting to them is a huge pain, and even as hands-on as I am with the car, I don't want to attempt this, so I live with the now-manual locks and no alarm.
There are a number of factory recall issues, most importantly the transfer case and front ball joints. Failure of either of these can result in a crash, so make sure that they have been performed before purchasing.
These cars, manufactured jointly by Mitsubishi and Chrysler under the 'Diamond Star Motors' (DSM) name, are great cars, with an overblown reputation of being unreliable. Even highly modified, making 2x the stock amount of horsepower and torque, I would not hesitate to drive my car across the country. Regular maintenance is a MUST on these cars, but doing so will guarantee you years of reliable service. This is my second second-generation Eagle Talon, and I expect to own more of them.
There are a small number of these motors which experience crankshaft thrust bearing failure, aka 'crankwalk', and while that can be an issue, it is certainly not pervasive, and can easily be checked out by a mechanic familiar with these motors. I will stress familiar, as these motors can be picky, and if not rebuilt properly will experience this bearing failure shortly. It typically affects only motors from the 1995-96 model years, but can affect any motor in any vehicle, so don't lose any sleep over it.
By this point (2009), these cars have a reputation of rather easily making a lot of power, and finding one that is not modified is becoming increasingly more difficult. I would personally steer clear of modified cars if searching one out, as there is no telling who performed the work, and how hard the car has been driven in the interim.
There are many online forums dedicated to these (DSM) cars, wherein a lot of information can be found. IMO the best national forum is DSMTuners, but search around for local forums, where you may benefit from a good knowledge base as well.
Would you buy another car from this manufacturer? Yes
Review Date: 7th July, 2009Currently in conflict with JosÃ© Mourinho , the powerful Cameroonian striker Samuel Eto’o is tipped for a transfer to China, but his wage demands remain to be determined.
According to information by Goal , Guangzhou Evergrande has started negotiations to recruit the Chelsea striker. The 33-year-old scorer must leave Stamford Bridge as his lease expires this summer and Marcello Lippi , in command of the Chinese club has made the signing of the striker his priority.
The former Italy coach wants to strengthen his forward line with an attacker who has a strong international pedigree and the player is ready to migrate to China, but his wage demands of â‚¬ 10 million per season remains a quack in the negotiations course.

Redlich asked to sit out budget vote
By Saranac Hale Spencer
GUILDERLAND Supervisor Kenneth Runion, a Democrat on the town board’s three-member majority, has asked that Republican Councilman Warren Redlich recuse himself from the town’s budget process.
“He doesn’t want to answer questions about the budget,” Redlich said yesterday in response to Runion's request, which came in a letter to Redlich dated Sept. 30.
“This letter is in response to your e-mail containing a number of questions concerning the proposed 2009 Town Budget,” begins Runion's letter. “It is my understanding that your law firm still continues to represent clients in the Guilderland Justice Court… As a Town Board member, you have shared responsibility over the town budget and the hiring, firing and discipline of town employees. The town budget is voted on as a whole package. There is no line item vote. As a number of your questions concern the police department and court, I believe you have a conflict of interest which prohibits you from participating in the budget process.”
In August, Runion had sent a memo to town board members detailing the budget schedule and stating, “A change is order.” Since Runion believes that Redlich has a conflict of interest, he did away with the three workshop meetings usually held for the board to discuss the budget, saying Redlich “may have an issue participating in one or more of the department budgets that would be discussed at the workshops.”
Instead, the board received a copy of the proposed budget and then held a special meeting on Sept. 23 where Runion explained it with a PowerPoint presentation.
Before that meeting, Redlich e-mailed several pages of questions regarding the budget to board members and the media. Many of his questions identified the budget line concerned and asked why it went up or down and what caused the change. When asked for answers after the presentation, Runion said that he would respond in writing. Yesterday, Runion said he’d be happy to answer all of Redlich’s questions after The Redlich Law Firm commits to not accepting Guilderland cases.
“I’m not going to cut my income because Ken Runion wants to make a show,” Redlich responded through The Enterprise. His firm, which includes five lawyers, has a screen, he said, so he is in no way involved with the cases his associates are handling in Guilderland.
“That’s just a charade,” Runion said of the screen, maintaining that, if one lawyer in a practice has a conflict of interest, all lawyers in the practice do.
“Ken Runion is not my guide on ethics,” Redlich said, adding with sarcasm, “I don’t think I could sleep at night.”
Soon after Redlich took his seat in January on what had been an all-Democratic town board, town justices Denise Randall and John Bailey both Democrats wrote to Judge Thomas Breslin of the Albany County Court, “Because the Town Board sets the Court’s budget, including the salaries of the Judges, and that of the Police Department, whose officers regularly testify in the attorney’s cases… we perceived a potential conflict of interest.” They go on to reference opinions provided to them by the Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics which suggest that they recuse themselves.
“It should be noted that the People do not allege that Mr. Redlich has behaved improperly at any time,” concludes a Feb. 25 response to the judges’ letter from District Attorney David Soares’s office. “…Mr. Redlich must be disqualified from appearing in his capacity as a defense attorney in Guilderland Town Court… The purpose of disqualifying the lawyer/legislator/town board member is to avoid the public perception that he is misusing his or her influence over the police and courts to benefit his client.”
The cases that Redlich had had before the Guilderland Court when he took office last winter were transferred to the Bethlehem Town Court, Redlich said, which he thought was fair.
The Guilderland Police are still involved in some of those cases, even if the Guilderland town judges aren’t, Runion said, which still constitutes a conflict.
“What’s underlying this,” Redlich answered, is the implication that Redlich would seek retribution towards an officer who testified against his client in one of his firm’s cases. “It’s offensive to suggest I would do that,” he said.
“Those budgets are over 50 percent of the town budget,” Runion said of the police department and court budgets. Later, he reiterated that it isn’t a line-item vote and said, “If you have a conflict on one aspect of a budget, you have a conflict with the whole budget.”
“He set this process up,” Redlich said of Runion’s budget schedule. Now, Redlich said, “He’s manufacturing an excuse not to answer questions.”

“I’ve given up trying to predict when it’s going to be busy or not. When the call comes, we go out,” said Captain Mike Dalcerri.
It was just after 8:00 on Saturday night, and Capt. Dalcerri, a clean-shaven guy with a silvery-gray crew-cut and an encyclopedic knowledge of football trivia, was sitting in an armchair in the lounge area of Santa Barbara Country Fire Department’s Station 17, watching the final minutes of the Stanford-Northwestern game with the rest of A-shift. Station 17 is on Mesa Road, right next door to the UCPD complex behind Harder Stadium on UCSB’s campus. Despite Dalcerri’s lack of predictions, A-shift — Capt. Dalcerri, paramedic Al, student EMT Liam, and firemen/EMTs Fred, Hugh, and Alex — were fully aware they had a busy night ahead of them. Northwestern failed to convert on their last drive, and as Stanford took a knee to run out the clock, the room cleared out, with every man hitting their bunk for about an hour of sleep before the first alarm went off.
Isla Vista’s reputation for alcohol abuse isn’t a secret — and neither are the all-too-often tragic consequences of student behavior. But night after night, weekend after weekend, shifts of firefighters, private paramedic crews with American Medical Response (AMR), and the nurses and doctors on call in the Goleta Valley and Santa Barbara Cottage hospitals do their best to pick up the slack and keep students safe from harm.
A-shift got about 45 minutes of sleep before the first alarm went off — two long pitches, then a four-note descending tone and the crackle of a 9-1-1 dispatcher reading out the call and location. The first call was early, preempting the typical weekend flood that begins at 11:00 or 11:15 p.m., so consistently “you can almost set your watch to it,” according to an off-duty captain relaxing in the lounge before his shift the following morning.
The engine went out and was met on-scene by an AMR ambulance, one of several that cover all calls in the Isla Vista area. Station 17’s two ambulances usually only go to on-campus calls, but all three firefighters on the engine are certified EMTs, and Al, who rode in the back seat with me behind the captain, is a full paramedic. “We’re kinda the ground floor, doing our best to package and support [the patient], but the ultimate goal is to get someone to the hospital,” said Dalcerri. “But we’re still able to do some top-of-the-line medicine.” The first call was routine, with an ETOH — medical shorthand for ethanol intoxication or overdose — patient in the back of an AMR ambulance and on their way to Goleta Valley within about 15 minutes.
The engine drove back, and Fred, who’s on his third 24-hour shift in as many days, reversed the semi-trailer-size vehicle into the garage effortlessly. The men slipped out of their ready-ups, and went straight back to bed. They repeated this process 10 more times over the course of the night.
Other calls weren’t as smooth. The engine’s second trip into I.V. had to go deep, all the way to the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive, and was slowed down by crowds of students, one of whom deliberately stalled the engine, dancing in front of it and blocking its progress. Fred and the captain, up front, spotted a couple of cops and cheered them on as they chased down the obstructing dancer and slapped cuffs on him. “It’s getting really bad — the respect is just gone,” Dalcerri remarked later.
On scene, there was pandemonium. Law enforcement officers responded first, talking to residents of the house that the call came from. The firefighters headed upstairs with their gear and returned in a few minutes, carrying a patient — by which time the cops downstairs had broken up a fight and were trying to make room for the AMR team to get a gurney through.
As the first patient was loaded in the AMR van, Al came downstairs with a second patient, who also went in the ambulance. Friends of one of the patients protested, saying that she didn’t need to go, that she was fine. But it was completely impossible to discern who the original call referred to, and neither patient could pass the firefighters basic tests of mental status — usually simple questions like name, location, and birthday — which Al said is “really what’s going to determine whether we take them to the hospital or not.”
“At that point, we’re bound by law,” Dalcerri said. “We can’t leave anyone alone that can’t care for themselves … they say, ‘Well, she’s gonna get in trouble with her mom.’ Well, she shoulda thought about that before she took 20 shots.” On the street, people were yelling, and two more kids got cuffed when they tried to push past the cops surrounding the ambulance and get to their friend. Dalcerri and the firefighters just walked away. “We usually don’t take that much flak,” he said.
The ambulance ride to Goleta Valley doesn’t take long — depending on how busy the Emergency Department (ED) is, the wait for a bed can be longer. On particularly busy nights, especially during Halloween weekend or “Deltopia” (the latter of which resulted in 75 calls for assistance in a single 12-hour period last April — Engine 17 took 17 calls, and Engine 18 came all the way down from Gaviota to assist), an extra room outside the ED is opened up, where groups of patients can be monitored en masse once the nine regular beds fill up. Though the line of waiting gurneys sometimes stacks up two or three deep at the door, the inpatients eventually find beds. Care for the standard ETOH cases is pretty simple — usually just administering water and monitoring vital signs, including making sure that if patients vomit, they do so in a safe position that keeps the airway clear. “We pride ourselves on being able to take care of the UCSB kids,” said Michael Coombs, a clinical nurse in the ED.
On the streets, a high volume of calls brings engines 11 and 14 — and sometimes even the department’s full-size ladder truck, an ungainly vehicle in I.V.’s crowds — out of their coverage area to cope with the students. “That’s the bummer: All these kids aren’t taxpayers,” Dalcerri said, “so all the people in Goleta are out of service.”
Back in the ED, staff kept an eye on flat-screen monitors mounted on the walls that display patient details and conditions color-coded by severity and urgency. While specific patient statistics, like the number of ETOH cases, are confidential, Goleta Valley’s ED took in 58 and 75 patients September 27 and 28, respectively, the first full weekend UCSB was in session. On last Spring’s “Deltopia” weekend, April 6 and 7, the ED handled 92 and 89 patients, respectively.
“Yep, we’re getting pretty saturated … been like that all day,” said Dr. James Mitchell, the physician in charge for the night. [Note: Reporting at Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital took place one week prior to reporter Jack Crosbie’s ride-along with SBCFD.] It was still before midnight, and the nine ED beds were full, mostly from fresh admits from I.V. Mitchell, a 20-year veteran of Santa Barbara’s Emergency Departments, has the cheerfully sarcastic nonchalance of someone who’s seen everything in front of him before. “This I don’t mind,” he said, referring to his current lineup of mostly ETOH cases.
Later, night supervisor Mary Jo Terrill echoed his sentiment. “It’s only bad when they start spitting and swearing and trying to hit you,” she said. “We have a great staff here, every single person is dedicated and hardworking and even-tempered. They don’t complain; they just keep meeting each patient and getting the job done.”
When asked how she gets through the bad nights, Terrill whispered, “Coca-Cola.” Sometime during the night, a scribe puts a Coke on Dr. Mitchell’s desk. He doesn’t manage to get to it before I leave. On my way out, at just after 12:30 a.m., I saw Coombs holding a bedpan in front of a vomiting patient.
“Don’t leave now!” He said. “You’ll miss all the fun!”
Dude, this is why weed is better. Chill.

I don't want to make fun of the tragic consequences of student -well lets face it stupid behavior, nor criticize the hard work by professionals who save lives. But regarding the response of authorities in IV I've heard of at least one incident where a SB County engine company stayed in bed and faked responding to a call, apparently they started the engine and rolled it out, had someone key the mike and report as if they were responding. All this to avoid what is too often a false alarm where they are called back, why not just stay in your warm bed. They got caught apparently b/c someone else also responded and they were not where they said they were. I heard this story from a County Fire Fighter - whether it is true or not it sheds light on the attitudes and practices in the IV student ghetto.

“That’s the bummer: All these kids aren’t taxpayers,” Dalcerri said, “so all the people in Goleta are out of service.”
Wow, how do these `kids' avoid paying sales tax? Do they get a special card from the County and the State when they move to IV that keeps all businesses from charging them sales tax? Anyone ever seen one of those cards?
And when these `kids' buy gasoline at the pump, do they have a special code that keeps the gasoline tax from being charged? Anyone know the code?
And all those `kids' who live in privately-owned rental housing in IV, how do they avoid covering the property tax of their landlords? Do IV landlords get a special exoneration from the County Assessor? When I look in the data base I never see that, it looks like all the privately-owned rental housing gets taxed just like everywhere in Goleta and Santa Barbara County.
And how do all those `kids' avoid paying income tax? Is there a special box on 540's and 1040's for living in IV? I've never noticed it.
Please tell us Dalcerri. Or Indy, if you ever fact check claims like Dalcerri's.

why can't the operating costs of servicing students be rolled into sbcc and ucsb tuition? as they stated in the article they have to ask ETOH patients a couple questions, why not are you a student at ucsb or sbcc? someone could keep a tally and come up with a rough estimate of costs that could then be added to tuition. a little school spirit, no?

Well Stockies it sounds like the main problem is that the students are receiving services that they are not asking for. Once we deal with that problem we may find that the distribution of funds for various services to various areas of the city and/or county may in fact leave IV behind in the dust.
So IV may have additional costs in law enforcement services, but they may be getting less funding for road repairs, infrastructure improvements and other services that may be provided in greater amounts to other portions of the county/city. Especially if you look at it on a per capita basis since IV has so many people. But if you want to be more fair I guess you could calculate how much taxes are coming from IV and how much are coming from the rest of the area.
But really I see this type of stuff mostly as an exercise in old people complaining about young people. It's a timeless classic.

This book was fascinating in that it weaved several components into a story that evoked emotions. It was hard to put this book down as it raised questions and created suspense that I was hoping to have answered in the upcoming pages. The story opened my eyes, made me self-reflect and exposed me to a new culture that created a deeper understanding of the world around me!

After a long day of training with Mikey and Leo, Red sighed and sat on her bed. Then she began to plan a really soon-to-be-awesome plan. As soon as it was complete, Red grabed her bow and scribbled somthing on a peice of paper. Smiling to herself, she quickly brushed her hair and tail before heading out.<p> Red made sure she passed Leo and Mikey before 'accidently' dropping the paper. But she kept walking and headed towards the surface as if nothing happened. As soon as she was out, she leaped in a tree and hid there quietly, waiting.<p> LATER (yes. JUST later...don't judge.)<p> Mikey was the first to find the note on the ground. He picked it up and sat cross leged, reading to himself. <p> 'Dear Journal,<br> I was really hoping to ask him if we could hang out tonight, but i couldn't get him alone. I really hope he likes me back, but only time will tell. But what if he doesn't? What if he judges me for my feelings? I dare not speak his name in fear of him finding out my secret, so i only hope that in the future...i won't have to. <br> Unknown Date; written by Red.'<p> Mikey's blue eyes lit up with hope. Maybe she was referring to him! This was great! So, with a feather like heart, Mikey went up to the surface to find Red and confess his feelings to her. But unknown to Mikey, Leo had watched from a distance with narrowed eyes. <p>Leo paced in his room, thinking. "Mabye i should follow him and Red to get imformation about her...no. That would end badly. But what was that note he read? If it was meant for me and he went to take my place-" Leo halted and clenched his jaw. With that thought burned into his brain, he ran up to follow Mikey and Red.<p> to be continued...Was this review helpful? Yes NoThank you for your feedback.

Jim Flick: "A Teacher's Teacher"
Golf Digest Teaching Professional Jim Flick worked with his share of stars, but he got as much enjoyment connecting with the average golfer
Jim Flick was a teacher's teacher. For all the years I knew him -- and it was more than 30 -- I never met someone more dedicated to one cause. In Jim's case, that was teaching golf -- not just to tour players, but to anyone who tried holding a golf club. Nothing pleased Jim more than to see an average golfer's weak slice turn into a strong draw. He would rather watch a beginner hit 20 more shots until the ball got airborne than take a break for lunch (and he missed a lot of lunches).

A decree by Sheik Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, posted Monday on official Qatari websites, said he would lead the Olympic effort and named other high-level members of the bid team, including members of the ruling family. Al Thani is also the country's deputy emir.
Also competing for the 2020 Games are Rome, Madrid, Tokyo, Istanbul and Baku, Azerbaijan. Doha is proposing to hold the games in September and October to avoid the blistering summer heat in the Gulf.

almost done paying that off....
and i'm also starving. no food. normally i would use my meal card and eat at the dining facility, but because my unit is on mission (hence being on a weird schedule) we were givin separate rations....
except my paperwork was lost and they're "trying" to fix my issue. so i'm being deducted 300$ every paycheck for "using" the DFAC, dining facility... Dee-Fac.
but i have no meal card.

and then i decided that i'm not the type of guy who will ever get married. i plan on getting my education and a Ph.d and have a good life. i just wish people would just leave me the fuck alone. i know what i'm doing, if there is something that requires my ability, let me do the task in my way.
so then i went and spoke with a psychiatrist and got a mental evalutation, my unit thought i'm depressed/suicidal from the amount of alcohol i drink... turns out i'm a sociopath. meh.
they don't know what do to with me. i've been tested 3 times and evalutated.

Hi,
I see that you have gone on the London and Paris tour last year, we are booked for June this year and i wanted to know seeing that you have gone already, what tips you have, even though yo have gone in winter and we going in summer i don’ t think it woudl have made such a big difference.
We have family staying over in the same hotel the time we are there at the Imperial hotel, because we do not plan on doing all the optionals with the group and prefer doing something with our family. They will only sleep over 2 nights at the hotel, i want to know whether you suggest that we rather stick to doing things with the group instead of going on our own? what did you prefer

With its breathtaking lakeside setting, spectacular sunsets, miles of trails, sweet micro ’hoods, terrific indie shops, fine dining, fabulous schools, plethora of parks and community passion for nature and the arts, Kirkland is easy to love. In summer, especially. When the sun is out, light dances on the water, the sky is bluer, the trees seem greener, and people are everywhere—biking, walking, boating, sipping, dining, shopping, playing, running, swimming. The energy is downright contagious.
Don’t miss: Shop and dine on Park Lane, a quaint, tree-lined street in the heart of downtown. Culturally inclined? Take in a Bollywood film at the rough-around-the-edges Totem Lake Cinema, an art class—with wine served, so you’re like a real artist—at Kirkland Arts Center, and the annual Small Works (11 by 14 inches or smaller) show at Howard/Mandville Gallery. Get your foodie fix by dining on rabbit at Holly Smith’s Cafe Juanita, sampling chef Brian Scheehser’s exceptional farm-to-table menu at Trellis, ordering wild boar tenderloin at the new Kirkland Volterra and a glass of wine and braised pork cheeks at Bin on the Lake. Commune with nature at Juanita Creek. The community’s beloved July 4 parade is a sure bet for family fun.
Go-to for out-of-town guests: Nothing beats an Argosy Kirkland Lake Tour, which provides glimpses of the exposed waterfront sides of fabulous estates (yes, even the Eastside’s most famous resident, Bill Gates).
Famous for: Charming consignment shops loaded with the cast-off cream of Eastside closets. Find gently used designer clothes—Jimmy Choo, Chanel, Kate Spade and Burberry—at Ragamoffyn’s, Absolutely Fabulous and Champagne Taste (425.828.4502).

HYPODERMIC SYRINGE ADAPTER Filed Aug. 21, 1952 INVENTOR Char-Zea Z0 Bruger' BY W47, W
ATTORNEY Patented May 18, 1954 UNITED STATES-1- earsm OFFICE HYPODERMIC SYRINGE ADAPTER Charles W. Bruger, Union City, N. J. Application August 21, 1952, Serial No. 305,540
2 Claims.
This invention relates to syringes and particularly for medicinal syringes of the type in common use. One of the most popular and generally used present day syringes comprises the usual cylinder or medicine container having an adaptable needle at the end and a plunger. These syringes usually have a slight flange in the top but are generally cylindrical in shape and at times are inclined to be slippery and difficult to handle. They have a further disadvantage in letting certain types of medicine, such as penicillin suspension, if a slight delay occurs, congeal very quickly in the needle, thus clogging the needle and requiring a resterilization and another injection. Such a delay may be caused by the slippage of the fingers on the syringe which will cause uneven and jerky administration.
An object of this invention is to provide an adapter which will be of light weight and which will be capable of accommodating syringes of varying sizes but which, at the same time, will provide the administering physician with a comfortable and sure grip of the syringe.
A further object is to provide an adapter which may be placed on the conventional syringe with a minimum of eiiort and which may readily be removed therefrom.
A still further object is to provide a selective adapter which will which will be sure in its application and will thus avoid the possibility of delay with resulting clogging and the necessity of reapplication.
Further objects and advantages of my invention become apparent from the following description and accompanying drawings, in which- Fig. 1 is a perspective view of my adapter applied to a conventional syringe cylinder or medicament container.
Fig. 2 is a detailed view of the finger grip portion of my adapter.
Fig. 3 is a detailed view of the fastening element.
Fig. 4 is a bottom plan view of the elements shown in Fig. 2.
Fig. 5 is a cross-sectional separated.
Referring more particularly to the drawings, the conventional syringe I is provided with a standard needle H, a plunger 12 which passes through the fiange portion l3 and which is provided with a thumb button M. My adapter i is relatively simple and economical in structure and consists basically of two parts, first, a finger grip portion having 2. depending thread and slotan adapter for view of the adapter be less fatiguing to use but ted shank, and, secondly, a fastening element consisting of a threaded nut which engages the threaded shank.
Referring more particularly to the drawings the member I5 is provided with a pair of finger holds or grips ll which are curved on the underside lfi to engage the first and second fingers of a hand. The finger grip portion is provided with a bore through which the syringe may be inserted. It is also provided with a threaded shank I9 which in turn has a plurality of slots 22 and a bevelled lower portion IS.
The threaded nut 29 is adapted to engage the shank i9 and the threads thereon and is bevelled on the inside at M to engage the bevel I8 on the shank and to cause the shank to contract and firmly grip the syringe Iil. The nut 20 is provided with grooves 2! or finger grips to facilitate its use.
The slots 22 in addition to allowing the constriction of the shank I!) also provide full vision when the syringe is completely filled hence the administrator can determine the amount of liquid therein.
In operation the nut 26 is normally left upon the shank 59 but is screwed downwardly to ease the pressure on the shank. When the device is to be used the conventional syringe may be inserted very quickly through the bore 23 and the nut 28 tightened to provide a firm grip. When the syringe is empty or to be resterilized it can be readily removed from the adapter by loosening the nut 29.
It will be appreciated that in view of the flexibility caused by the slots 22, which are preferably four in number, variances in tensions of the syringe is are readily absorbed and a one-size adapter may handle several sizes of syringes.
While I prefer to manufacture my adapter out of a relatively light material it might just as well be made of plastic, hard rubber or any other suitable material.
I claim:
1. A syringe adapting unit comprising a memer having a pair of finger grips, 9, depending shank, a syringe receiving bore extending through said member and said shank, external threads on said shank and a bevelled edge on the end of said shank, a tightening element comprising an internally threaded unit having a bevelled portion to engage the bevelled portion of said shank and to press the interior of said shank against a syringe body in said bore.
2.

Context: The likelihood that adolescents will engage in sexual activity, use contraceptives or become parents is influenced by a range of attitudes and behaviors. These factors may differ for males and females.
Methods: Data on female respondents to the 1979-1992 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the linked 1994 young adult data file on their children provided background information on 959 adolescents who had been born to young mothers. Partial correlation analysis was used to examine the factors related to sexual behavior, contraceptive use and childbirth, controlling for maternal and familial characteristics, in this relatively disadvantaged sample.
Results: Youth who are inclined toward risk-taking and those who have run away from home are more likely than others to be sexually active. For young women, having intercourse at an early age, not using contraceptives and having a child are linked with depression, low self-esteem and little sense of control over their lives. The results for young men are less consistent and often in the opposite direction. Young people who have become parents evidence greater maturity than their childless peers; women are less likely to consume alcohol or to spend time with friends who drink, and men are more likely to participate in socially productive work.
Conclusions: Although sexual behavior is tied to risk-taking in both adolescent males and females, some noticeable psychological differences are evidenced early. Behaviorally, there is room for optimism, in that young parents appear to adopt more mature traits.

Elliott encountered his second termination in three years on Monday, following an abysmal Warriors performance against the Sharks and a sub-standard start to his second year in charge.
Elliott focused on the multitude of `myths' that surround the Warriors, including the suggestion that the club is best left to a born-and-bred Kiwi coach who understands the cultural nuances of their large contingent of Polynesian players.
"That is overstated really, I never felt having an Australian coach is an inhibiting factor. They are a great group of guys,'' Elliott told the Daily Telegraph.
"There's so many myths around the Warriors. One is the one (about Australian coaches), the other one is the talk around the massive Warriors pack.
"It's not a massive pack, it's nowhere near the biggest in the comp. It's a stereotype.
"I don't know where it comes from but South Pacific Islanders and Polynesian players are all through the comp.
"The Warriors have a good representation (of Polynesians) but I think that is simply false. It is based on the thoughts of people who don't understand what really goes on at the club.
"There is always some adaptations you make from club to club, but if someone blindfolded you at the Warriors or another NRL club, you wouldn't know any different.
"That cultural stuff is not an issue.''
Elliott coached the Warriors for 29 games, winning 13 with 16 defeats. The side finished two points outside the playoffs in 11th place last season and have had a mixed start to 2014 with two wins from their opening five games, however the three defeats have all been big loses to unfancied opponents.
The former Canberra coach will now return to Australia as soon as possible and believes he still has a future in the NRL.
"I wouldn't rule out coaching again,'' he.
"I'm handling it OK. In the grown-up world, you have to take this stuff on the chin.
"The decision has been made. It doesn't matter what I think. I'm getting on with the game.''
The official line from the Warriors is that Elliott resigned, but the 49-year old couldn't be drawn on the semantics of the situation. He has been replaced by assistant coach Andrew McFadden until the end of the 2014 season.
"It's not about wording around decisions and it's not about whether you agree or disagree. It's like on the field, the referee makes a call. You can moan about it all you like, but it won't change what happens.
"I really believe from when I started to now, we made significant improvement across the club. I hope Cappy (caretaker Andrew McFadden) gets an opportunity to build on that. He is ready to be a first-grade coach.
"Every coach has a different approach. I will stick my hand up and say I could have done some things better. I won't be selfish or petulant. I have to pick myself up and get ready for the next chapter.''

).A plane crash which killed a man and left his son and father seriously ill in hospital happened after the aircraft lost power, according to an official accident report.
The aircraft struck a tree as it approached Caernarfon airport on May 19, 2013, having suffered a loss of power on approach, possibly from carburettor icing, the report from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said.
It had set off earlier that day from Blackpool Airport, carrying the Nuttall family; John, 61, Iain, 37, and five-year-old Daniel.
Mr Nuttall snr piloted the Piper Cherokee, rented from Fly Blackpool. His son, from Blackburn, was killed in the incident.
The report said: “The investigation did not find any evidence of a failure within the engine but the atmospheric conditions were conducive to carburettor icing.”

"I know that there are a lot of people who may not be as excited as some of us about the process or as excited about the ultimate nominee, so why am I willing to officially endorse him along with most of the other Republican candidates? It's real simple. Governor Romney gets it right on the big issues. President Obama gets it wrong on all of the big issues. That's why we have got to have a different occupant of the White House," Cain said at the event.
In January, after teasing an "unconventional endorsement" in the GOP presidential race, Cain came out in support of "the people," saying it was the beginning of a political revolution.
"My unconventional endorsement is 'The People!" Cain said in a speech in South Carolina. "We the people are still in charge. That's who I'm endorsing. We're going to have to lead this revolution. We have to take our power back. I'm endorsing the people. The people who started this country.".
He explained in an interview on CNN his choice of Gingrich was based, in part, on the candidate's embrace of.
At his event Monday, Cain explained his past endorsements, taking a veiled shot at President Obama's explanation for his change in position of same-sex marriage.
"My endorsement evolved," Cain said. "Early in the process is one thing, but as we converged toward the convention, what we did earlier isn't as relevant. It wasn't a matter of changing my mind."
He added, "Now that the process is winding down, I felt it fitting to offer a formal endorsement because I have been consistent throughout my participation in the process and that is that I would endorse the ultimate nominee.".
Cain ended his bid for the 2012 GOP nomination after battling allegations of an affair and of past sexual harassment episodes, which was alleged to have taken place during his tenure as president of the National Restaurant Association. Cain consistently denied any wrongdoing.

It's the 3rd because NO ONE IS LISTEN to him!
Now I understand why the majority are predicting Pres. Obama will win the election. Endorsements like these ones can not bring victory.
Third is not going to be the charm. The sociorobulky is NOT going to pick you! Go away.
And at the convention he'll have a 4th endorsement: himself.
To paraphrase Mr. Cain (BTW, it was Cain who slew his brother Abel):
Will Rob-money make a good president? Nein, nein, nein!
Does Romney = Bush? Ja, ja, ja!

Don't get carried away. Only black Republicans will be excited. Black Republicans have run against black Democrats in the past, and we know what the results were.
"I know that there are a lot of people who may not be as excited as some of us about the process or as excited about the ultimate nominee, so why am I willing to officially endorse him along with most of the other Republican candidates?"
One could guess being out of the spotlight isn't sitting well with Mr. Cain. Beyond that, who cares? The excitement level of Mitt Romney went from zilch to minus zilch about 5 years ago. Apparently, Mitt Romney lost to Ted Kennedy and John McCain for a reason beyond his control. Lying and double talking isn't what America needs. We've already got a Congress full of liars and double talkers. Adding Romney to the mix isn't going to improve anything. Just the opposite. Dude can't even answer reporters questions without first getting with his team of "advisers" for his talking points. GW left the country in shambles. I suspect Romney would have no problem heading us right back where we were. Indeed, he is looking forward to doing just that.
"ah, duh, Libya . . . right" And The "You don't hav-ta know eva-thang" Priceless, indeed!
He said the border pense needs to be electrified. He is hoping to be Secretary of "The Pense" not Defense...bwa ha ha ha ha...
First the idiot that stole an election and then put us in 2 senseless wars and now a lying known womanizer.... The list of unworthy people just gets longer and longer that endorse Mittens. All of these useless endorsements, yet THIS GUY is afraid of the press. P A T H E T I C. Who in their right mind would vote for him as POTUS. I can't even imagine how he would have been acting had HE been in President Obama's place the night Bin Laden was killed.
Did anyone watch Letterman last night? I like him. He told Brian Williams that President Obama does deserve credit for getting OBL and could the rethugs give him credit for something??
OBAMA 2012!
Wow....the buzzards are circling the wagon now! I have a visual of flies being attracted to pooh. Eeeewwww! Sorry, the GOP makes my IQ drop.
First The People (whoever they are), then Gangrene, and now an endorsement for DemWit Mitt. This just what I've been praying for. Thanks, "Uncle Tom" – LMAO.
OBAMA 2012!
Robmey seems to think that endorsement are a prven means of getting elected and becoming commander and chief. No way in hell will RobMEY get this job as president.
Mitt keep your eyes on long dong silver (Cain) he may steal your wife.
Cain, your the man. Could be secretary of defense, still time to convert, or it will be Glenn beck for DOD.
Conservativess, blame yo self for the reason this country almost fell off the cliff. You voted for Bush twice.

About Melbourne and Victoria
Australia’s second largest city has a delightful Victorian feel, with grand, elegant buildings, fine parks and gardens and a historic tram system that’s been the mainstay of city transport for 100 years.
Melbourne is a cultured and cosmopolitan city, with excellent museums and galleries and world class theatre. There’s a thriving street café scene, superb restaurants and great shopping. Along the Yarra River, the lively Southbank arts and entertainment area makes an ideal place to dine in the evening.
You’ll find plenty to do during the day as well, explore the Botanical Gardens, chill out in Federation Square or visit Captain Cooks Cottage, rebuilt in nearby Fitzroy Gardens. Be sure to visit colourful Queen Victoria Market, and for soap fans, there’s even a ‘Neighbours’ tour.
One tram ride you must take is the 15 minute journey to St Kilda, Melbourne’s beach suburb. Here you can enjoy a dip in Port Phillip Bay, a ride at Luna Fun Park or your choice of coffee along Fitzroy Street, known locally as the ‘cappuccino strip’.
Melbourne’s impressive stadiums also host many of the country’s major sporting events, including the Grand Prix and Australian Open tennis. Accommodation can be limited at these times, so it’s important to book early.
Away from the city, Victoria is the perfect touring destination, with spectacular mountain and coastal scenery, fertile plains and well kept National Parks. Look out for relics of the great Gold Rush that doubled the population of the state in the late 1800's. The town of Ballarat has an excellent living museum where you can still pan for gold.
The Yarra Valley vineyards produce some of Australia’s best wine, whilst further south are the fine sandy beaches of the Mornington Peninsula. Nearby Phillip Island is home to thousands of native fur seals, koalas and the enchanting Fairy Penguins that march up the beach each night to nest in the sand dunes.

USDA Reporting Nationwide Drop In Bovine Inventory
.
USDA Statistician, Joe Morse explains the drop in cattle count saying, “Due to the price of feed combined with the higher price for beef, people just weren’t keeping them around as long so on January 1st you saw lower actual inventory numbers on farms than you would have seen in past years.”
Morse said the increase in the number of sheep count is largely due to an interest in products such as sheep milk and cheese. He said there’s been a steady increase in people consuming goat meat in the state and that’s kept their inventory numbers steady.
Morse said the new figures don’t necessarily signal bad news for the agricultural industry. “If you’re a farmer in beef production then you’re probably having a pretty good year and if you’re into sheep or goat production I think they’ll be able to say that their business is pretty stable,” Morse said. According to the report New York cattle and calves totaled 1.4 million on January 1, 2011, which is a 1% decrease from the previous year’s total. Sheep and lambs total 70,000; an increase of 6%, and the goat inventory count is at 30,000, which is unchanged from 2010 figures.
Nationwide the figures for cattle and calves is at 92.6 million and officials with the USDA say the current count is the lowest numbers since 1958 when it was at 91.2 million heads of cattle and calves. Across the country, sheep and lamb numbers dropped 2% and goat numbers are down 1%.

“We had a working weekend with some fast racing at Washington on Saturday and three really close races against Oregon State today,” said head coach Craig Amerkhanian. “We led in all three races today and were disappointed that we lost two of them, but credit goes to Oregon State for fighting back on us. There was great effort by both teams.”
The Cardinal varsity eight emerged victorious in the final race of the morning. Stanford posted a time of 5:49.49 after leading from start to finish. Oregon State followed the Cardinal across the finish line with a time of 5:51.95.
"Oregon State has the strongest crew they have had since I have been at Stanford and I feel like we have the most talent in our boat in my four years," said senior Austin Hack. "It was a good race and we continue to improve."
This marked the third weekend of racing for Stanford, who is still putting the pieces together. With four freshmen in the varsity eight there has been a learning curve, but the group is starting to figure it out.
"It is a big difference between high school and college rowing," said Hack. "The guys on our team with more experience are trying to bring the other guys along. We are learning to race our race and stay within ourselves."
The JV eight race went to Oregon State by a margin of just 2.1 seconds. Stanford led for the majority of the race, but the Beavers rallied late to overtake them in the final 20 meters.
Stanford fielded a frosh eight in the first race of the day. The group of newcomers squared off against Oregon State’s 3V8. Just like the 2V8, the Cardinal freshmen were overtaken near the finish for the one-second victory. Stanford had a time of 6:06.64, while Oregon State posted a 6:05.61.
The Cardinal will be at home for the first time this season as they host the Stanford Invitational this Friday and Saturday. A full racing schedule will be made available on gostanford.com once finalized.
"It is always a great weekend when we are at home on the course we practice on all the time and see familiar faces," said Hack. "It is also fun to see teams we might not otherwise see."

Specifically, the problem is the practice of overwriting string literals, either explicitly or implicitly. This is NOT portable. PLEASE cease and desist! Finding these errors can be a real pain, it always requires a trip into debugger land, and that can be really time consuming. Citing chapter and verse (kindly provided by Steve Lionel): ANSI Standard Section 3.1.4 "If the program attempts to modify a string literal of either form, the behavior is undefined." Here are some explicit cases, lifted from actual applications. (They have been slightly simplified to better illustrate the problem.) Explicit modification of string literal: static char *bad = "ABCDEF"; /* some intervening code not affecting bad*/ sprintf(bad,"BCDEFG"); This apparently runs on most Unixes, but generates an access violation on VMS when sprintf executes. Both results are allowed by the standard, so don't write code like this!!! Here is one of (many) ways to do it cleanly, just replace static char *bad = "ABCDEF"; with static char bad[6] = "ABCDEF"; The implicit cases are even more of a pain to ferret out, but they go something like this: /* somewhere in a program */ somefunction(name,"string"); .. int somefunction(char *name, char *string); /* some code ...*/ tolower(string); /* more code ...*/ This class of code runs ok on Unix, but gives an access violation on VMS. Again, both results are allowed by the ANSI C standard, so don't do this!!! Since no compiler I'm familiar with can detect these errors at compilation time it falls to the programmer to get the code right. So get it right, ok?

ASACUSA measures microwave transition in antiprotonic helium
Recent months have seen the much-awaited synthesis of cold antihydrogen atoms by two groups working at CERN's Antiproton Decelerator (AD; Amoretti et al.; Gabrielse et al.). The aim of these collaborations is to compare spectral features of hydrogen and antihydrogen as a test of the CPT invariance principle, which states that under certain realistic assumptions about the quantum fields that represent them, matter and antimatter will always behave in the same way. However, it is not just in antihydrogen atoms that CPT symmetry can be tested, as the ASACUSA collaboration is demonstrating.
If CPT violation occurs anywhere in nature, it must be very small, and experimental searches for it have usually been done with kaon beams. These beams are coherent superpositions of particle and antiparticle waves, and since slightly different masses imply slightly different de Broglie wavelengths, a limit of a few parts in 1019 can be placed on any kaon particle and antiparticle mass difference by a detailed study of the interference effects observed in them. However, kaons are mesons, containing both a matter and an antimatter quark, and CPT violation might not show up in conjugate pairs of this kind. Protons (p) and antiprotons (p-) are made only of quarks and antiquarks respectively; hydrogen (H) and antihydrogen (H-) atoms are made only of quarks and leptons, and of antiquarks and antileptons. In such systems, CPT violation at some small but crucially important level can certainly not be excluded with equal rigour.
Although we have no quantum interferometer for the CPT conjugate H-H- pair, we do have powerful laser beams, which we can use to probe its members with extremely high precision. Since no other assumption than CPT invariance need be made in interpreting what happens when one of them is removed from a spectrometer and replaced by the other, the H-H- pair is in many ways the ideal CPT test-bench. However, it is very difficult to produce antihydrogen atoms moving so slowly that they do not drift out of a laser beam before it can stimulate one of their spectroscopic transitions. Solutions to this problem are now evidently in sight, but many difficulties remain before the extreme sensitivity afforded by laser techniques (and indeed necessary for meaningful tests of CPT invariance) can be reached.
ASACUSA's alternative approach involves the much easier task of replacing an electron in an ordinary atom by an antiproton and measuring the spectroscopic frequencies of the resulting "antiprotonic atom". However, we do not have the CPT conjugate "protonic antiatom" with which to compare it, and must calculate its transition frequencies from quantum electrodynamics, assuming the known proton values for the antiproton (and also that the calculations were done properly). In this way, the ASACUSA collaboration has determined the relative charge and mass of the proton-antiproton pair to six parts in 108 (Hori et al.) by laser-stimulating optical-frequency transitions in antiprotonic helium (figure 1) - the only variety of antiprotonic atom known to live long enough to permit such quantum gymnastics (CERN Courier October 2001).
How might we use this atom to investigate the antiproton's magnetic properties? Unknown large-scale fields are sometimes measured by determining the energy required to turn over a magnetic dipole of known strength placed in them. At the atomic scale, this is the basis of classic experiments on magnetic effects like the ground-state hyperfine splitting in hydrogen. Likewise, by measuring the energy of the photon needed to flip the known magnetic dipole of the electron in the unknown magnetic field of the antiproton, we can measure the latter particle's own dipole field.
ASACUSA has now carried out such an electron spin-flip experiment (Widmann et al.), in which two laser beams and a microwave beam were tuned to resonate with the antiprotonic helium atom (see figure 1 for an explanation of this "triple resonance" experiment). Microwave resonance peaks occurred at 12.89596 and 12.92467 GHz, corresponding to electron spin-flips in states of the atom with antiproton spin "up" and "down". These values are consistent with calculated values assuming the proton's orbital magnetic dipole moment for the antiproton, and limit any difference between them to less than six parts in 105. The measured values also depend on the antiproton's spin magnetic moment, but the corresponding limit for this (1.6%) is not yet as good as the value (0.3%) deduced from the fine structure of X-ray spectra in heavy antiprotonic atoms. A precision measurement of this latter quantity will require major improvements in the laser system. Therefore what will probably come next from ASACUSA are even tighter limits on the orbital moment, charge and mass.
The present result has an unusual feature. According to the equation for m-p (see figure 1), what is being measured is mainly the ratio g1p- / g1p of the factors defining the orbital current magnetism relationship for the members of the CPT conjugate pair. However, we have no atoms with orbiting protons in our matter world, and g1p has always implicitly been taken by definition to be equal to 1. Thus while CPT invariance is respected within the six parts in 105 limit given above, we do not know, in the empirical sense, that either g-factor really has the value unity.

The More the City Participates, the Closer They Come to Winning a Maximum $50,000 in Samsung Hope for Children Technology Grants for Edmonton Children
EDMONTON, ALBERTA--(Marketwire - Oct. 12, 2012) -
Editors Note: A photo for this release will be available via Marketwire on the picture wire of The Canadian Press.
Samsung Canada, The Brick and Global Electric Electronic Processing (GEEP) today challenged Edmonton to pitch in to help lose pesky, unwanted e-waste weight. Coinciding.
"E-waste recycling is an important part of our global sustainability efforts and Samsung Hope for Children initiatives in Canada," said Andrew Barrett, VP Marketing for Samsung Canada. "Through the Samsung Passion for E-Recycling Challenge, the more e-waste Edmonton loses, the more Edmonton children gain - up to $50,000 in technology grants."
"Edmonton has been home to The Brick for over 40 years, and we're proud to support an initiative that will do so much good for the community," said Vi (Violet) Konkle, President and CEO of The Brick Group. "I believe the Samsung Passion for E-Recycling Challenge in Edmonton will help contribute to stronger, more sustainable Canadian communities."
Edmonton residents are urged to pitch in by simply dusting off those old electronics hiding in basements, garages and attics and bringing them to a participating Brick store location or local school.
If the participating Brick store locations each reach a collection target of 1 tonne (1,000 kg) of e-waste, four selected community organizations - from YMCA chapters to Boys and Girls Clubs - will share in $20,000 in Samsung Hope for Children technology grants. For each piece of e-waste dropped off, consumers will also receive a coupon for 10 percent off Samsung electronics at The Brick. Participating Brick store locations include:
From October 12-21, Edmonton residents can also experience an interactive Samsung e-waste display at West Edmonton Mall (near the Segway Space, Lower Level).
Passion for E-Recycling School Challenge
The Passion for E-Recycling School Challenge program (Oct. 12-21) was designed to help educate children about this issue and the solution. Almost 30 Edmonton schools will compete to collect the most electronic waste; the three schools that collect the most will share in $30,000 in technology grants, courtesy of Samsung Hope for Children.
Visit for more information on the Samsung Passion for E-Recycling Challenge. Schools will also find free e-waste learning tools, videos and teaching modules available through the site.

Workplace Relations Minister
A parliamentary inquiry previously recommended action against workforce bullying was dealt with swiftly at a federal level, rather than through protracted legal action involving state and territory regulators.
However, two of Australia’s biggest employer groups, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Australian Industry Group, reacted strongly to the proposed policy, saying the changes could not be enforced over state jurisdictions, would encourage “forum shopping" and confusion, and even lead to increased industrial disputes.
Ai Group chief executive
“Workplace bullying is a problem that primarily falls within the jurisdiction of work health and safety laws, which have a strongly preventable focus, not industrial laws," he said.
The amendments to the Fair Work Act will include a new definition of bullying: “Bullying, harassment or victimisation means repeated, unreasonable behaviour directed towards a worker or a group of workers that creates a risk to health and safety."
The proposed legislation recognises that the term bullying does not cover reasonable management practices, including performance management conducted in a reasonable manner.
Mr Shorten said businesses would not be made vulnerable to bullying accusations for simply counselling employees to improve their work.
“It will be in our legislation that the principle we’ll be adopting is that reasonable management practice requiring reasonable performance at work is not bullying," he said.
“Let’s not give up trying to tackle workplace bullying because some people say, ‘oh, it’ll be too hard to prove in certain cases’.
“The truth, I believe, is that there are thousands of people being bullied at work."
Lawyer Sarah Rey, a partner at Justitia, said, “While this is an important development for victims, it will increase the workload for employers.
“We predict that employers can expect to find themselves in the commission more often."

The court on Thursday ordered the federal and state governments to set up a special board that will look after transfers, promotions and disciplinary matters involving civil servants.
Bureaucrats often come under pressure from politicians on key issues and face "victimisation" if they refuse to follow "verbal orders", reports say.
The court said all orders given to civil servants must be in writing "to protect them against wrongful and arbitrary pressure exerted by the administrative superiors, political executive, business and other vested interests", reports the DNA website.
The NDTV website says the court's order will ensure that civil servants will not have "to take verbal orders from their political bosses" and it will "insulate the bureaucracy from victimisation".
The Hindustan Times website says "bureaucrats are often transferred on the whims and fancies of politicians and the court indicated as much when it said deteriorating standards of probity and accountability in bureaucracy were due to political influence".
The Indian Express, however, cautions against the consequences of the order.
"It must remember that the public disillusionment with the system does not arise from corruption alone, but also from ineptitude. It should not end up entrenching inefficiency, by reducing the one force that impels the bureaucracy to accountability - political supervision," the paper says.
Meanwhile, newspapers are warning about a rise in illnesses due to increased pollution levels during the festival of Diwali this weekend.
Those suffering from respiratory and heart problems have been urged to be more cautious as pollution levels rise due to the excessive use of firecrackers during the festive season, reports The Pioneer.
Environmentalist Anumita Roychowdhury says "much more aggressive measures" are needed to deal with the issue of increased pollution during Diwali, reports The Times of India.
Papers also say that Diwali has lost a bit of its sparkle this year due to the struggling economy and skyrocketing prices of food and other commodities.
Traders' associations say people in Delhi are spending less this year on sweets, dry fruits and gifts, reports the Deccan Herald.
Right to reject
Moving on to politics, the Election Commission has asked Congress party vice-president Rahul Gandhi to explain his remark that the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party was indulging in divisive politics in the riot-hit town of Muzaffarnagar in northern India, reports the Hindustan Times.
Terming the remark a violation of the election code of conduct, the commission has sent Mr Gandhi a notice over his speeches in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh states and asked him to respond by 4 November, the paper adds.
Assembly polls will be held in five states, including Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, in November-December this year.
The Election Commission has also approved the design of the None of the Above (Nota) button on electronic voting machines, which is being introduced during the assembly polls in Delhi, the First Post website reports.
The symbol is "a circular depiction with black background with Nota written in white in capital letters in English", it says.
The Nota button is an option for voters who do not want to cast their ballot for any of the candidates, it says.
And finally, Congress party president Sonia Gandhi has been ranked 21st among the world's most powerful people by Forbes magazine, seven spots above Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, reports The Indian Express.

Because She Hoped
Songlines
Parisian pianist Benoît Delbecq and Canadian clarinetist François Houle don’t collaborate very often. Their three Songlines recordings span 14 years, with their previous summit meeting, Dice Thrown, released in 2002. Yet they remain resolutely exploratory on this recent effort. Both musicians have advanced in terms of their arsenals of sounds and their abilities to weave those sounds into a compelling whole.
Delbecq’s artillery is readily perceived, and the studio session affords more opportunities for elaborate, precisely measured preparations than live performance does. In Ellington’s “The Mystery Song,” Delbecq’s accompaniment behind the dirge-like lead from Houle plinks like a gamelan. Later, on Steve Lacy’s “Clichés,” Delbecq opens fire with some strumming under the hood and a marimba prep in the treble, followed by a barrage of woodblocks below. Even on the live recording of “Nancali,” the title tune from their first CD in 1997, we find long stretches where Delbecq doesn’t sound like he’s at a piano at all. We meander out of a Caribbean marimba wail into a more Eastern sitar-like sound, which serves as a perfect launching pad for Houle’s licorice-stick ululations.
Less obvious are Houle’s wonders on clarinet. Besides the hipster’s expected toolkit—the harmonics, wide intervals and proto-Dolphy weirdness of “Pour Pee Wee” (included here in live and studio versions)—Houle is able to creep up to pennywhistle territory in “Binoculars.” More impressive, Houle’s slap-tonguing is so proficient that he is actually producing some of the sounds presumed to be coming from Delbecq’s preps: the tuned rubber pipes sound in “Le Bois Debout” and “Because She Hoped,” plus a share of the marvelous percussion that begins “Ando.” And, remarkably, none of this grows competitive, showy or old.

But Disney recently shared an adorable clip from Lava, the short that was slated to debut in front of The Good Dinosaur—before that movie was delayed from May 2014 to November 2015. As you can see, Lava is the story of a singing Hawaiian volcano, named Uku, who is looking for love.
The name Uku evokes the ukelele—the popular Hawaiian guitar-like instrument that practically scores the state’s sunsets and seduces millions of mainland tourists every year. The late Israel Kamakawiwo’ole’s strummed a uke, and Lava director James Murphy told Yahoo that his short was in part inspired by the singer’s version of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.”“I thought that if I could marry the rich imagery and with the power and emotion of music, then I could really make something cool,” he told the site.
Singer Kuana Torres Kahele provides Uku’s voice, and one-third of the inspiration for the volcano’s face. The other two-thirds: Jackie Gleeson, and the cartoon bulldog in the Looney Tunes short, “Feed the Kitty.”
Lava will play before Inside Out when that feature opens in theaters on June 19.Questions, or comments? We would love to hear from you. Simply give us a call at the store via the phone number below.

Unfortunately Mr.Loftim misses the point. Mr. Bush, whatever his faults or pretension, now or in the past, is a subject for history books--he is not a candidate. Mr. Obama's pretensions, and Mr. Biden's are of the moment--they are candidates. The same applies to Mr. Mccain and Ms Palin. I have issues with a candidate who embelishes or lies or is so inadequate to the task intelelctually, whether it is the number of states we have, a hungry brother in Kenya, a denied grandmother, a former stepfather in Indonesia, or a stolen speech, an inflated resume, wrong-headed policies on major issues of the day, etc., etc. Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden live under those rubrics of reality. Mr. McCain, for all his faults and missteps, and Ms palin, for all of her's do not.That is the substance of my effort, as poor as it may be to accomplish the task, nothing more.

It is good to live in a nation that the absurd has freedom to roam so that the brilliant can find voice. If Mr. Klein's soaring in an ether of superficiality fills the role of the superficial, somewhere we can be sure the "brilliant" finds voice. Such is the nature of the world's most successful democracy. That Mr. Klein is no historian is obvious, but Mr. Klein's lack of ability to differentiate illusion from reality is seriously wanting. Mr. Klein seems to interpret Mr. Obam's rhetorical stumble when off-prompter as an illustration of intellect; his "nuancing" as deep mediatative appraisal of all sides of issues, and his confusing intellectual and biological heritage as reflective of a brave new worldism. I would suggest that this is all the more indiciative of serious intellectual and experiential flaws in the insubstantial creation that has become Mr. Obama. For example, Mr. Obama's admitted dalliance with alcohol and drugs, including hard drugs, may well have had physiological consequences and admits to felonious actions, unless using hard drugs is not a felony where he did so imbibe. This makes Mr. Obama the only Presidential candidate ever to so admit before an election (mr. Clinton "never inhaled." One does not see Mr. Lincoln, that other Illinois politiican, admitting he turned to logs, someone else's trees. Mr. Obama was not sure if he had "visited 57 of our 58 states," a comment ignored by the media. But he was serious; Mr. Obama is always serious and expects us to note that fact. He did not know how many states there are in the lower 48, and might not have been aware of Alaska being a state until Ms Palin became a candidate. One can suppose he knew Hawaii was a state since he was born and lived there. Mr. Obama let us know that we needed "to do away with all forms of carbon," a remarkable statement that left many of us to wonder if this was profound (we are carbon based organisms and perhaps we are to become as ethereal as he seems to believe he is), or if this was another gaff by the Democratic Party leadership. Ms. Pelosi once said she "needed to save the world from oil," and Mr. Reid noted "oil and coal are poisoning us." Mr. Obama's selection of friends, from the "retired terrorists Mr. Ayers and Ms Dorn, the racist and stupidly foolish Reverend Wright and the bizarre reverend Phleger, as well as Mr. Obama's felonious financial and real estate frind in Chicago, speak of a serious lack of judgement. The heroism of growing up a child of an unwed mother and an African father is praised in Mr. Obama's case, but Ms Palin's unwed daughter finds only criticism in the fawning, Obama slant of the popular press, despite the fact that Mr. Obama has ignored his Kenyan brother, apparently living on $1 a month, or his Kenyan grandmother. They do not campaign with him and Muslim ladies with headcoverings are banned from the Obama stage when he speaks, hardly a position of tolerance. Ms Palin's daughter of course will marry the father of her child. At the same age of 17-18, Mr. Obama tells us he was doing alcohol, pot and cocaine. Mr. McCain selected Ms Palin as his running mate, and Mr. Obama selected Mr. Biden. Mr. McCain's brilliant choice (whether intended to be brilliant or not) has unglued the Obama/Biden ticket and sent the ticket into a tailspin. The gaff-prone Mr. Biden's selection (almost as old as Mr. McCaine, an admitted plagerist and a reputation for unending talk) is not a signal that Mr. Obama is up to making presidential choices. Mr. Klein does make us thankful, however, that we all can express our views and takes on history, no matter how sill they may be.
James Jude Simonelli - 9/12/2008
The writer's point is frightening. The fact that it appears to be true in this maddening silly cycle of most serious political times is doubly frightening.
American will get the leadership it deserves, either by the indifference to the facts or adherence to the myths.
As an Obama supporter I have been involved in making phone calls and knocking on doors to solicit votes for Barack Obama for President. Invariably when a devout Republican of racist answers the door it is immediately slammed with the exclamation of some explicative shouted as the door closes.
“Mindless Electorate” comes to mind as a descriptor of such cumulative behavior.
Man (or Woman), Myth and Modernity all seem to go hand in hand in a disregard for the gravity of our current state of the nation AND world.
Frightening, frightening is all I have to repeatedlySund.

Here's the scene from Raleigh (pic from OFA's twitter feed):
.
Projecting based off of demographics and party registration (for example, giving Obama 99% of the votes cast by African American Democrats and giving Romney 96% of the votes cast by White Republicans), President Obama is ahead in NC by something like 271,155 votes to 218,800 votes, which equals a margin of 52,355 total votes. Just so that nobody misunderstands, these vote numbers are estimates, not actual vote totals. For methodological details, see my Day 1 Diary.
In 2008, at this same time in the early voting period, Obama was up by about 203,552 to 148,968 over John McCain, which is a margin of 54,584 total votes. So it appears that Obama is in about the same position as he was in 2008 in terms of vote margin, but turnout among both Democrats and Republicans is a heck of a lot higher.
Of course, this avalanche of early voting is not a unique event occurring only in North Carolina. The same thing is happening across the country, especially in swing states where OFA's unprecedented ground game is deployed, like Iowa, Nevada, Ohio, and Colorado. The only difference is that the data released in NC is more detailed than in other states, so we can see with more clarity how early voting is playing out.
Graphs:
Turnout continues to be up among White Republicans:
But it continues to be the case that it is not up enough to offset the increased Minority and White Dem turnout:
The cumulative vote margin is basically tracking 2008:
But the daily vote margin chart shows that it hasn't been tracking 2008 exactly evenly across time. Obama was a bit behind where he was in 2008 before in person OSEV voting started, but in more recent days (especially Saturday) has been ahead of his 2008 pace:
The cumulative vote percentage chart shows the vote percentages for Obama. Even though higher GOP turnout is being cancelled out by higher Dem turnout in terms of vote margins, the percentages are dragged down a bit:
And the daily vote percentage chart shows the same thing:
Bottom line: If anyone thinks that Obama can't win North Carolina, they would be well advised to take a look at the early voting numbers. It's all about turnout and voting, and who votes wins.

Reggie Bush Gets Trained By Smokin’ Hot Fitness InstructorSo a friend of mine decided to finally upgrade out of the OG Droid and went with a Droid Bionic off of Craigslist after seeing everything I'd done to mine. I told her getting hers tricked out would be easy since I still have all the files and drivers needed to do it on my computer...the only problem is, my computer isn't seeing her device. When plugged in, it IS charging and the PC makes the hardware plugged in and removed sounds twice, then nothing. I enabled USB Debugging on the phone, but still nothing happened. Tried plugging it into my computer in AP Fastboot mode, which on my phone says "USB Transfer" to indicate it's connected, but still nothing. When in the OS (.246), it doesn't ask if I want to change how it's plugged in up in the Notification bar. Oh and I tried a factoray data reset just for good measure. Like I said, I have the proper Motorola drivers, and I know both the cable and the USB ports on the PC are working fine because it works with my own Droid Bionic. I even tried plugging it into 3 other computers and they're not recognizing it either. Has anyone else ever experience an issue like this? After troubleshooting everything else, I'm leaning towards the phone having some sort of damage or defect, but I'm really hoping it's a software issue that can be resolved.

Upcoming lectures, conferences, and more.This invention relates to semiconductor integrated circuits and more particularly to an improvement of the structure of a high speed, large scale semiconductor integrated circuit device.
The conventional signal transmission or conduction in a semiconductor integrated circuit device is carried out with the so-called near end termination in which a termination resistor is connected in the neighbourhood of the output terminal of a circuit of generating the signal, i.e., the termination resistor is connected with the signal generation side terminal of a wiring conductor. This mode of signal transmission increases a propagation delay time in proportion to a square of a wiring conductor length, as is well known. The broken line curve 1 of FIG. 1 illustrates the above-mentioned delay in the signal transmission. The drawing teaches that as the length of the wiring conductor becomes larger, the signal transmission with the near end termination will be very disadvantageous as compared with the signal transmission with the far end termination represented by the broken line curve 2 in which a termination resistor is connected with the receiving side terminal of the wiring conductor. This signal transmission with the far end termination has only been employed in a printed board or the like. The wiring conductor has a resistance r equal to 10 Ω/cm and a capacitance C with respect to the ground equal to 4 pF/cm and undergoes a propagation delay time Td equal to 66 psec/cm for the far end termination.
Moreover, in order to use the far end termination, the resistance of the wiring conductor must be reduced since a large resistance thereof provides a small amplitude of the signal at the receiving end, which leads to the shortage of margin. The solid lines 3 and 4 in FIG. 1 illustrate a high level signal and a low level signal, varying dependent on the wiring conductor length with the far end termination employed. These high and low level signals are generated by an emitter coupled logic circuit. Thus, with the wiring conductor resistance (r) equal to 10 Ω/cm and the termination resistance equal to 50 Ω, the amplitude of the signal at the receiving end of the wiring conductor 10 cm long. is reduced to 1/2 that at the sending end, which is no longer effective for normal operation of the circuit.
One countermeasure of obviating the reduction of the signal amplitude is proposed in Japanese Patent Application Kokai (Laid-Open) No. 59-4231 (laid-open on Jan. 11, 1984 and corresponding to an earlier Japanese Patent Application No. 57-111730 filed June 30, 1982), for example, in which complementary signals are generated and transmitted or conducted to drive a differential circuit so as to provide a signal with an amplitude effectively doubled. FIG. 2 shows an example of an emitter coupled logic circuit on the basis of the above idea. Namely, two complementary signals (OR output signal 5, NOR output signal 6) in the first circuit on the left side are employed to drive the second circuit on the right side. This circuit structure enables the second circuit to normally operate with the voltage between these two signals as large as about several tens of mV.
Conventionally, however, for such a pair of wiring conductors for conducting the complementary signals in the signal transmission, there has been considered such a structure that above a GaAs substrate (not shown) respective wiring conductors 7 and 8 for transmitting or conducting the complementary two signals lie on the same plane in parallel to powering/grounding layers, i.e., common potential level layers 9, as seen from FIGS. 3a and 3b. This structure is disclosed in the paper by Seki et al "General Meeting S3-3 for The Institute of Electronics and Communication Enginners of Japan pp. 2-331 and 2-332", for example. This structure of wiring conductors provides a weak electromagnetic coupling between the pair of wiring conductors 7 and 8, which result in the inconvenience of large crosstalk between the pair of the above wiring conductors 7 and 8 and another pair of wiring conductors adjacent thereto (not shown). For a multi-layer structure, use of the above-mentioned arrangement of the wiring conductor pairs requires that the powering/growing layers 9 be provided by all means for the purpose of preventing the crosstalk between the upper and lower wiring conductor pairs as shown in FIG. 3B, which gives rise to a problem of the increase of the number of layers.
An object of this invention is to provide a semiconductor integrated circuit structure having such a wiring conductor structure as conducting, with suppressed crosstalk, a pair of complementary signals to a predetermined location on a semiconductor IC substrate having an area as large as 1 cm-10 cm square.
In accordance with one of the important aspects of the present invention, at least circuit means for generating a pair of complementary signals is formed in a semiconductor substrate having such a large area as being adapted for a large scale integration, a pair of powering/grounding layers or common potential level layers electrically insulated from the substrate are formed above the substrate with an electrically insulating layer interposed therebetween, a pair of electric conductor pattern layers in electrical connection with the circuit means are formed in the insulating layer, and the pair of conductor patter layers are arranged in a spaced relation with each other, so as to be overlapped with each other in a direction substantially perpendicular to the powering/grounding layers or the substrate and so as to be substantially parallel with the powering/grounding layer or the substrate, whereby the electromagnetic coupling between the conductor pattern layers are made large to reduce the crosstalk with other conductor pattern layers within the insulating layer.

In this drawing, a semiconductor substrate of, e.g., Si or GaAs, including a circuit device 21 for generating a pair of complementary signals, has such a large area as to be adapted for a large scale integration (for example, 1 cm-10 cm square). A pair of powering/grounding layers (common potential level layers) of, e.g., Al, Cu, Ag or Au, are formed above the substrate by, e.g., evaporation or plating technique and patterning by etching and are electrically insulated therefrom through an evaporation film of, e.g., SiO2 or Si3 N4. As will be explained in detail later, an electrically insulating layer is formed between the pair of powering/grounding layers, and a pair of wiring conductor pattern layers 11 and 12 are formed in the insulating layer by process similar to that for the powering/grounding layers. The wiring conductor pattern layers provide for conducting a pair of complementary signals generated from the circuit device 21 to any desired position or point on the structure 20. Resistors 22, 23 and 24 are termination resistances, respectively. Although these resistors are not indispensable to this invention, they are desired to be provided to suppress reflection when a pair of complementary signals are conducted from the signal generating circuit device 21 to a desired point on a large area such as a large scale integrated circuit structure. Namely, the resistors 22 and 23 are of the values equal to the characteristic impedances of the wiring conductor pattern layers 11, 12, respectively, while the resistor 24 is of the value equal to the characteristic impedance between the wiring conductor pattern layers 11 and 12.
FIGS. 5A and 5B are cross sections of a principal structure of wiring in one embodiment of this embodiment, respectively. As seen from the drawings, a powering/grounding layer (common potential level layer) 10 is formed above a substrate (not shown) and electrically insulated therefrom. A wiring conductor pattern layer 11 is formed above the powering/grounding layer 10 through an insulating layer (not shown). Another wiring conductor pattern layer 12 is formed to be overlapped with the wiring conductor pattern layer 11 through the same insulator as the above insulating layer, for example. Another powering/grounding layer 13 is formed above the pattern layer 12 through the same insulator as the above insulating layer, for example. Thus, the wiring conductor pattern layers 11 and 12 are substantially parallel with the substrate or the powering/grounding layers 10 and 13, respectively and overlapped with each other in a direction substantially perpendicular to the substrate or the powering/grounding layers 10 and 13. The wiring structure in this embodiment assures a large area opposed between the wiring conductor patterns 11 and 12, and therefore, provides meritorious effects such that electromagnetic coupling therebetween is large and crosstalk with other wiring conductors adjacent thereto is small. With the respective dimentions of the wiring conductor pattern layers defined as shown in FIG. 5B and the wiring conductor pattern layers formed with values specified in Table 1, for example, the characteristics shown in Table 2 were obtained. Incidentally, as the insulating material among the layers 10-13, a polyimide resin, e.g., PIQ (Polyimide isoindroquinazoline-dione) was used.

In Table 2, the resistances of the termination resistors 22, 23 with respect to ground for the wiring conductor pattern layers 11, 12, and the resistance of the termination resistor 24 connected between the wiring conductor patterns are also indicated. These termination resistors were implemented for the far end termination and effective to suppress reflection of the complementary signals. It is well known that the termination resistances should be equal to the characteristic impedances of the wiring conductor pattern layers 11, 12. The termination resistor between the conductor pattern layers is not requisite, but its provision will enhance the effect of suppression of reflection of the signals. These termination resistors may be constituted with diffusion resistors formed in the substrate.
For comparison of crosstalk between two adjacent pairs of conductor pattern layers in semiconductor integrated circuit structures according to an embodiment of the present invention and the prior art, structures having wiring conductor pattern layers were manufactured in accordance with those illustrated in FIGS. 3A and FIG. 5A. Various dimensions are represented by symbols shown in FIGS. 5C and 5D corresponding to FIGS. 3A and 5A, respectively and took the values as specified in Table 3.
TABLE 3______________________________________ S1 ' 12 μm S2 ' 28 μm t' 4 μm w' 50 μm d' 30 μm b' 44 μm______________________________________
In FIG. 5C, conductor pattern layers 7 and 8 and conductor pattern layers 7' and 8' are paired, respectively each for conducting a pair of complementary signals, while in FIG. 5D, conductor pattern layers 11 and 12 and conductor pattern layers 11' and 12' are paired, respectively, for conducting a pair of complementary signals. The amount of crosstalk to the layer 7' when a pair of complementary signals are conducted through the layers 7 and 8 in FIG. 5C can be deduced from the potential of the layer 7' observed when virtual electric charges are placed on the layers 7 and 8. For example, when virtual electric charges are placed on the layers 7 and 8 such that the voltages of the layers 7 and 8 are +1 V and -1 V, respectively, the potential of the layer 7' is 23 mV. Similarly, in FIG. 5D, when virtual electric charges are placed on the layers 11 and 12 such that the voltages of the layers 11 and 12 are +1 V and -1 V, respectively the potential of the layer 11' is -5 mV, which is almost 1/4 that of the layer 7' in absolute value. This means that crosstalk can be effectively suppressed with the structure according to this invention.
FIG. 6 shows a wiring conductor structure in another embodiment of this invention in which two pairs of wiring conductor patterns perpendicularly or obliquely crossing each other are arranged. As seen from the drawing, above one wiring conductor pattern layer 14 of the first pair, one wiring conductor pattern layer 15 of the second pair is arranged. The other wiring conductor pattern layer 16 of the first pair and the other wiring conductor pattern 17 are in turn placed. Thus, the wiring conductor pattern layers are arranged so as to be substantially parallel with the substrate or powering/grounding layers and as to be overlapped with each other in a direction substantially perpendicular to the substrate or powering/grounding layers. Therefore, throughholes 18 for electrically connecting the two pairs of the wiring pattern conductors have only to be formed at the same position as viewed in a direction perpendicular to the powering/grounding layer, so that the entire number of throughholes can be reduced. This facilitates improvement of the production yield of semiconductor integrated circuit structures and suppress cross-talk with other wiring conductor pattern layers.
The characteristic impedance of the wiring conductor pattern layers should be preferably high for less power consumption. The structure shown in FIG. 5A provides a meritorious effect of a higher characteristic impendance of the wiring conductor pattern layers than the conventional wiring conductors in the structure of FIG. 3B, assuming that the number and sizes of the wiring conductors and the space or the thickness of an insulating layer accommodating the wiring conductors are identical with those in FIGS. 3B and 5A. This is because, when two conductors are arranged one above the other, another powering/grounding layer will have to be provided therebetween according to FIG. 3B structure while no such layer will be necessary in FIG. 5A structure in which the two conductors are paired, and therefore, the distance (b in FIG. 5B) between the two powering/grounding layers can be made relatively large in FIG. 5A structure than in FIG. 3B structure. This embodiment also provides an advantage of easiness of the production process because of the small number of layers.
Referring to FIG. 7, showing another embodiment of this invention in cross section, there is formed in a p-type Si substrate 40 a circuit for generating a pair of complementary signals including a transistor 44, a resistor 47 and others (not shown) by the usual bipolar LSI manufacturing process. The transistor 44 includes an n-type collector region 43, a p-type base region 42 formed in the region 43, a n-type emitter region 41 formed in the region 42. The resistor 44 includes a p-type region 45 formed in an n-type region 46. After formation of necessary electric contacts to the signal generating circuit, a first insulating layer 51 of SiO2 is formed on the substrate 40 by sputtering. There are formed wiring conductors 52 of Al, Al-Si or the like in the first insulating layer 51, thereby constituting a first wiring layer 50. By the use of, e.g., a polyimide resin such as PIQ as a second insulating layer 61 on the first insulating layer 51, pairs of conductor pattern layers 62 and 63, 62' and 63', . . . and a pair of powering/grounding layers 64 and 65 are formed in the second insulating layer 61, thereby constituting a second wiring layer 60. The conductor pattern layers and powering/grounding layers in the second insulating layer 61 may be made of Al, Cu or the like. The conductor pattern layer pairs in the second wiring layer 60 are electrically connected where necessary by through holes 66. Connection pads 70 are formed on the second insulating layer 61 for externally delivering or receiving signals.
The conductors 52 in the first wiring layer 50 have a smaller lateral width than that of the conductor pattern layers 62 and 63 (62' and 63') in the second wiring layer 60, so that more conductors may be formed in the first wiring layer 50 than in the second wiring layer 60. Incidentally, the termination resistors may be formed in the substrate 40 during the above-mentioned usual bipolar LSI manufacturing process.
In this structure, the wiring conductors in the first wiring layer 50 have rather short lengths and are arranged for the near end termination while the conductor pattern layers in the second wiring layer 60 have large lengths and are arranged for the far end termination. That is, near end termination and far end termination are distinctly employed for the small length conductors and the large length conductors. As a result, an additional advantage is provided such that a signal delay time caused by wiring conductors is made smaller as compared with the prior art structure in which the near end termination is employed both for small length wiring conductors and for large length wiring conductors.Streamlines is an informational newsletter for local water supply watershed administrators, planners, land developers, and citizens interested in the protection of North Carolina's drinking water supplies.

Just recently however, they found a way back to this world---well, two of them did anyway – namely Robert Keller, band leader, singer/songwriter and John LoGiudici, guitarist. Spinal Tap inflicted drummers and bass players where left strewn in their path like pixelated Jackson Pollack attempts. All those strange gardening accidents... While former drummers and bassists are no doubt caged in some virtual asylum somewhere, new, spontaneous combustion free recruits were needed here in the real world.
After months of lions, tigers, and bears (oh my!), Auntie Em hooked them up with the drummer and bass player they had been looking for when that tornado hit. Enter 'Ski' on bass and Tymber on drums---completing a powerful and energetic rhythm section supporting the contagious melodies and soulful vocals in songs rife with influences such as Pink Floyd, The Cure, Pearl Jam, Tom Petty and U2. Veteran players all, these guys blend diverse musical backgrounds and come together to create an engaging musical experience --- drawing you into melody and rhythm that is accessible, interesting, compelling and infectious. Just ask Auntie Em!
Now that the path between the two worlds is known to them, the teleport machine has been repaired and The Hodges continue to play all over the Bay Area and continue to perform streaming shows at a variety of venues in the virtual world known as Second Life () often with simulcasts on Radio RK ().

War only accelerated this moves to put more ammunition into a man portable weapon. Josek Vesely created the V-42 and took the basic simple blowback action of a submachine gun, where the rearward movement of the case as propellant gases surged forward behind the bullet, and made it something different.
Instead of trying to tinker with a basic, reliable method of operation, Vesely decided that the magazine design was the thing to conquer. Looking at the image above, you imagine a larger, possibly proprietary caliber round nestled inside the deep magazine. Yet the ejection port, directly above the magazine is narrower. That's because the V-42 fired a standard 9 mm Luger round.
You see, Vesely's magazine was designed as essentially two magazines in one.
The front of the magazine had a stack of 31 rounds of ammunition. Behind it, a second stack of 29 rounds of 9 mm which remained fixed until the front magazine emptied. A simple blocking mechanism then slipped out of the way, allowing the rear magazine to feed ammunition into the chamber.
However, the action wasn't entirely neglected by the Czech's imagination. Instead of a single consistent rate of fire, Vesely came up with the idea of a variable rate of fire by a device in the breach block that changed the number of rounds from 900 to 1,000.
His solution for single or full automatic was also ingenious. He crafted an action where the charging handle was retracted back, setting the machine carbine in semi-automatic mode. Pulling the charging handle rearward and pushing it forward set it in full-auto.
A standard infantry version had a fixed wooden stock. While a paratrooper version could be broken down into three major elements.
Never formally adopted by national or local authorities, the V-42 machine carbine is a testament to the tireless inventiveness and search for the next advancement in small-arms technology.

Butch Cassidy, the last of the great western train-robbers, is born on this day in Beaver, Utah Territory..
For several years, he drifted around the West using the name Roy Parker. Finally, on June 24, 1889, he committed his first serious crime, robbing a bank in Telluride, Colorado, for more than $20,000. As a fugitive, he took to calling himself George Cassidy, a nod to his first partner in crime back in Utah. Wishing to lay low, for a time he worked in a Rock Springs, Wyoming, butcher shop, earning the nickname that would complete one of the most famous criminal aliases in history, “Butch” Cassidy..109 Miles Rd, Columbia, SC 29223

3. Sébastien Bourdais had a phenomenal weekend and deserved it. Watch out for him at Mid-Ohio where he finished fourth last year.
4. Can someone explain how race control can wave the rule stating a driver has to do two green flag laps on each tire compound for Dario Franchitti? Those are the regulations. Forget the fact Franchitti had a tire rube on his first lap but that sets the precedent for future races. The rules are the rules and you cannot wave them willy nilly. Here is the rule, article 14.14.6.6.3.1 verbatim:
A Car must complete two Green Condition laps on each type of tire. The second of which may be completed in pit lane even if the Car is pitted prior to the Start/Finish line. Any Entrant failing to comply with this Rule shall receive a minimum one lap penalty.Nowhere does it say the race director may have the rule for a driver who suffers a flat tire on their first lap with that compound. That is complete ignorance for the rules by race control.
Also, I could be wrong, but aren't lapped cars supposed to be waved on restarts with under twenty laps to go. I could be wrong on that one but I thought I heard it before. Maybe it was suggested but shot down. Article 7.6.1.2. states the race director may choose to move lapped cars on a restart late in a race but doesn't have to.
5. Great day for EJ Viso in fifth, top finishing Andretti Autosport driver, Charlie Kimball get a great sixth place finish with Mike Conway charging up to seventh from twenty-third on the grid just ahead of his teammate Justin Wilson.
6. Marco Andretti gain eight positions to ninth and Alex Tagliani got Canada a top ten making up for the poor day for James Hinchcliffe.
7. Ryan Hunter-Reay is a big hole. Got into Will Power and Takuma Sato late. Killed a good day, now sixty-nine points back. He will need to win at least two or three races to have a shot and need Castroneves to have a few finishes in the 20s.
8. Just when it appeared things were turning around of James Hinchcliffe, they go back to the bottom of the barrel with a stuck throttle.
9. Another good doubleheader. Toronto produced two really good races. As I've said all along, I hope doubleheaders stay.
10. Really good day for Carlos Muñoz who finished seventeenth after only getting seventeen laps during the morning warm-up.
11. Dear God I hope Toronto can stay on the schedule for years to come. 2014 is the final contractual year. 2015 Exhibition Places host the Pan American Games during what is the normal race weekend. I hope it can be kept on the schedule.Top. Right before you get ready confess your undying love for that special girl, let's make sure that you've read the signs correctly. Here is a list that I've compiled around from our office gals on the Top 5 Signs that you are in the friend zone!
She Talks About Her True Love All The Time
Your first tip is that if she talks about other men freely all the time in front of you, sadly, 1st class ticket to the friend zone! If she continually name drops or talks about all the other men in her life. Welcome to the friend zone...get used to it. it's going to be a bumpy ride. I remember as a young naive man, I once thought the girl was just trying to make me jealous... boy, was I wrong.
You invite her out, She accepts ...BUT!
Your next tip that you are in the friend's zone? You finally got the courage to ask her out a gulp in your throat - palms sweaty, quivering voice, She accepts ... you are SO in (or so you think). BUT, she invites her friends along and you think you are a big winner, sadly the truth comes out as she places her friends in between you and her. You think she's just not being rude to her friends, but the real reason? Yep ... welcome to the friend zone!
She Tries To Set You Up With Other Women
I remember during the dating years, this one girl that I wanted to date tried to set me up with another girl. Someone who wasn't even close to a good match to me. I was insulted for a brief moment and couldn't fathom why on earth she was trying to hook me but then I realized .. .she just dropped me into the "Friend Zone"!
The "Infamous" Side Hug
As a guy, there is nothing like getting a hug from that girl you want to make the future "Mrs. YOU" ... until she SIDE hugs you?? That sends an instant message to your brain (and other areas of the body) that thanks BUT no thanks signal. If this happens to you, keep searching!
That Time Of The Month...Forever!
As a young man when you start dating, you have so much to learn about women. I remember asking a girl 'not' appropriate things when I was younger and she responded with " it's that time of the month or I would..sorry". I do realize that "time" does come monthly but it was odd that her cycle was never ending. It took me years to realize that she just wasn't interested in me and I was stuck in the friend zone - forever, and ever, and ever...

Remember when I swooned over the warm options on Bon Bon’s winter menu a few weeks ago? It’s still cold, so I’m still on that kick. And Boots is giving Bon Bon a run for its money. Try the boozy coffee or the boozy tea. Loosen your inhibitions, warm your insides, be well.

Like all former denizens of Bend, Ore., I wrongly feel like I own a piece of the Deschutes Brewery. I’ve probably put some brewer’s kid through college with the amount of the Deschutes I’ve downed in my drinking career, so yeah, my allegiance is strong. And it gets stronger every January when Deschutes unleashes upon the market Red Chair Northwest Pale Ale. If you’re not hip to it, “Northwest Pale Ale” is basically a less hoppy IPA. And if you took Red Chair to the East Coast, they’d probably call it an imperial IPA. Sissies.
How good is it? Uh, well it won the World’s Best Beer distinction at the 2012 World Beer Awards. That do anything for ya?
Red Chair is a delightful beer — the beer I’ll be drinking almost exclusively until Deschutes inexplicably takes it away from us sometime in the spring.

Call me new to the beer game. And even then, I don’t care for the taste of a bitter IPA or the slightly urine-like tang of Bud Light. My tastes lie somewhere in the middle — and yes, I think Blue Moon is delicious (roll your eyes if you will). So when I discovered Session Premium Lager at Morty’s on the South Hill I was extremely pleased with what I was swallowing. It tastes better than Miller High Life and PBR, I swear. There’s no bitter aftertaste and is as smooth as can be. Adding to its cool points, the beer has been made by the independently owned Full Sail Brewing Company out of Hood River, Ore., for decades. For anyone out there who, like me, can only handle the more mild beers, pick up a six-pack of Session in your nearest grocery store booze aisle and enjoy.

I’m a beer-drinker through and through, and while most of the time you’ll see me tipping back something a little crisper and lighter — Belgians, hefeweizens, pilsners, etc. — this winter I’ve been all about the stouts and porters. To be honest, dark brown beers used to scare me. Before I gained a rudimentary beer education, I thought dark = bitterness. (I’m not a big fan of IPAs, by the way.) While I’ve been working my way through the warmer, richer flavors of dark-colored beers this winter, I’ve come across a couple favorites, but the obvious winner of them all is Ninkasi’s Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout. It’s the perfect sipping beer, and with an ABV of 7.2% and the option of single 22-oz. bottles, you can — and should — enjoy its vanilla-y smoothness a little longer.

Since I just turned 21 a few months ago, I’m not exactly well-versed in the world of alcoholic beverages (although I do greatly enjoy a rum and coke or a Bailey’s on the rocks every now and then). I’m more of a juice aficionado. And I can be found sitting at my desk drinking Capri Sun — yes, those cute little pouch drinks from elementary school — on a daily basis. If there is a beverage and the word “juice” can be connected to it in any way, I already love it. I save the Capri Suns for work because they’re portable, but at home, I’m drinking Welch’s white grape peach juice, kiwi strawberry Snapple and Tropicana’s peach orchard punch.
— CLARKE HUMPHREY
For the mornings: This isn’t new, but I’ll confirm what other people have said about coffee from local Manners Roasting Co. — it’s excellent. We picked up a bag of the Acopio Suyatal Nicaragua from Coeur Coffeehouse recently and these gray winters mornings have been a lot more bearable.
For the evenings: Boise-area Sockeye Brewing appeared in our market suddenly a few weeks ago, first on tap and now in cans as well. The hearty, hoppy Dagger Falls IPA is great winter drinking. In other cold-weather drinking, winter warmers can start all blending together by this point in the season, but River City’s Deep Thaw Winter Warmer is one worth seeking out.

Pineapple-orange-banana juice. All the tropical zing of pineapple, all the can’t-rhyme-with-it defiance of orange, all the slapstick appeal of banana, combined into a single beverage. Now, if only Rosauers carried it in the cheaper concentrate form, I would buy it by the gallon.

Quick Take
With great video quality and fun features, it's easy to see past the XR350's three big flaws.
Generally speaking, HD camcorders come in three varieties: camcorders with no storage, camcorders with flash memory and camcorders with hard disk drives. Each has an advantage over the other. HDD camcorders usually offer enough storage for days of footage, but they are bulkier and more expensive than their flash or no-memory counterparts.
In the past, I’ve preferred flash memory to an HDD because HDDs have moving parts that get hot and make noise. Also, drop the camera, break the HDD, and you lose all the footage stored on it. The technology has improved in recent years so heat and noise are almost non-existent, and many cameras have features like Sony’s ?HDD Smart Protection” to prevent any data loss should the HDD fail. Still, I like flash camcorders with their compact size and lower price.
It is with that caveat that I tested out the Sony HDR-XR350V Handycam, a midrange high-definition camcorder sporting a whopping 160GB hard disk drive. I figure if any manufacturer can change my mind about HDD camcorders it’s Sony since I’ve lauded them in the past for their slick Handycam and bloggie devices. Let’s see how well they do to incorporate a cumbersome HDD. And of course I didn’t forget to test the video quality, performance and features too.

Alpha Chi is a national society with membership open to students in the top 10 percent of the junior and senior classes. The Texas Alpha Eta chapter, located on the Wayland campus, added five new members during the ceremony. New inductees included Michelle Bueermann, a senior from Springer, N.M.; Joshua Harris, a junior from Gruver; Robin Marlar, a senior from Plainview; Kevin Schaub, a senior from Pampa; and Ragan Spradling, a senior from Amarillo.
Psi Chi is a national honor society for students of psychology. Membership is open to psychology majors or minors in the top 10 percent of their junior or senior class. The five new members inducted are Andrea Brown, a senior from Amarillo; Chance Perkins, a senior from Hale Center; Dustin Rauch, a senior from Carlsbad, N.M.; Jennifer Sullivan, a senior from Plainview; and Melanie Wieland, a senior from Plainview.
Dr. Perry Collins, assistant professor of psychology, serves as sponsor for both groups.resident of Koramangala and now of HSR Layout, Rekha Dinesh wove magic and enthralled the audience with her richly flawless footwork, enchanting 'mudras', expressive eyes and effortless grace during her solo Bharatanatyam performance-Nrityarpanam -- at ADA Rangamandira a fortnight ago.
Performing arts became Rekha's destiny and her journey began at the age of 8 when the late Smt. Lalitha Dorai of Bangalore initiated her into the formal discipline of Bharatanatyam. After that, she completed her 'Vidwath' examination conducted by Karnataka State Education Board, securing second rank that year.
Since then she has been performing in many programmes, including those organised by the Department of Kannada and Culture, the Sangeetha Nrithya Academy and at the All India Youth Festival held at Dharwad. She has also performed under various banners like the Indian Institute of World Culture, the Malleshwaram Sangeetha Sabha and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations.
Her performance was not limited to the country. During her stay in North America, she worked as an Assistant Art Director at Kalapadma Dance Academy in Chicago, USA, for four years. There she performed at many events and cultural programmes, like Dussehra and Diwali celebrations in 2001 and 2002, organised by ISA in co-ordination with Hindu Heritage Centre and the Indian Association of Peoria at Bradley University, Peoria, USA.
Besides this, she has taken part in the fund-raising event for the erection of the Mahatma Gandhi statue in New Skokie Park in December 2002, in the Spring fest organised by Vokkaligara Parishat of America, Midwest, USA, in 2003; Zee Heritage festival in 2003 in Chicago and other various community programmes during Indian festival, organised by the Indian community in Chicago.
Learning is a continuous process and it is not limited to age. Her insatiable passion for dance has made her a learner forever. For the last four years, she has been continuing her learning under B. Bhanumathi and Sheela Chandrashekar of "Nrityakalamandiram". She has given various performances under their guidance.
"Dance is an art and is a great knowledge. I cannot say I got my inspiration from anyone or anything; it just became my destiny as I was good at it and tremendously interested in it," says Rekha. Not only is she giving performances, but she is also conveying this art form as a dedicated teacher to many aspiring students. She is the founder and Art Director of Benaka Natya Mandir in HSR Layout. This was conceived and founded by her upon requests by a few enthusiastic dance students in Koramangala in 1991.
Later she moved to Chicago and continued teaching there as an Assistant Art Director in Kalapadma Dance Academy. After moving back to India, Rekha continued teaching dance for aspiring students at HSR Layout, conducting weekly classes in classical dance for adults and children.
Benaka Natya Mandir is committed to excellence in dance education and strives to instil and promote values of service, commitment and integrity. The centre has received recognition from the local people and her students have given various performances in and around HSR Layout.
With the encouragement from her husband, blessings from her parents who are residing in Koramangala 4th Block and in-laws and with guidance from her beloved gurus, P. Bhanumathi and Sheela Chandrashekar, Rekha hopes to make a significant contribution to the field of dance through her stage performances and academicReady Made CarePackagesOrdering at Carepackages.com is fast and secure.

Objective: In The Necessity, How this Book is Constructed, the first day should focus on the layout of the book, how it is constructed, and the reasons for its creation. Key terms can be defined such as affirmation, discourse, figure, and image-repertoire. Also, be sure to emphasize the writing style used in the book. As the author notes on page three, "the description of the lover's discourse has been replaced by its simulation" (3). The author wants to "stage an utterance" in the dramatic sense, not provide an analysis.
1) Introduction: Introduce the author, Roland Barthes and the book. Note that this is a portrait of the lover through a series of short chapters (80 in all) that the author calls "figures." These figures stage the lover's inner dialogue with himself and the loved one, who is absent and does not speak in the text.
2) Close reading and small group...

Ask anyone native who has been away from Malta for a while for the top 5 things they miss about this place. Invariably, Maltese bread or ‘hobz biz-zejt’ makes the list.
Trust me. I’ve just become a fan of a Facebook page called ‘Hobz biz-zejt’ that has over 2,500 fans. One of its manifestos seems to be a call for a national ‘Hobz biz-zejt’ day.
The Maltese loaf is part of our heritage, a badge of pride. At a par with pastizzi. And most of us cannot get enough of it, despite resolutions to stick to brown bread in search of a healthier option. Everyone has a favourite hobz biz-zejt recipe. And stories to tell. Maltese expats regularly smuggle it out of Malta. Others try and replicate it back home. We’ve even found a picture of a crib in a Maltese loaf.
For me, the Maltese bread is about walking past a baker’s early on a winter’s morning and suddenly getting intoxicated by the smell of fresh bread coming out of a wood-burning oven. It’s about childhood, picnics, a snack by the sea. You dig a hole in the soft centre and steal the warm pieces before anyone else notices. You watch the butter melt, you cut a door-stopper size and have a swig of beer and talk with your mouth full to your friends. A basket before a fenkata. A van hooting its horn at the end of the alley and you join a throng of old ladies, all wanting their own variations of what’s on offer.. ‘misjura’ or well done.. or ‘naqra nejja’ for someone who doesn’t like her bread too crusty.
In its purest form, the hobz biz-zejt is at its best still warm, doused with olive oil, tomato paste and olives and capers and.. whatever else takes your fancy.. a slice of gbejna.. chunks of tuna.. some basil. Top up with salt and pepper. Eat it raw. Concoct bruschetta versions like the picture. Eat it at home. Go to craftsmen like the guys at Olympic in Mosta who have multiple variations.
The Maltese loaf is up there with the gods of haute cuisine. And you can tell a true Maltese by the sparkle in his eye, when the subject turns to hobz biz-zejt.
And if you still cannot get enough of bread, get down to the Qormi Bread Festival that takes place 12 September and celebrates the town’s history as Malta’s chief milling and bread-making place since the time of the Knights.
[…] off-peak months. Car hire is cheaper than in most of Europe. Snacks can be cheap if you opt for the local hobz (bread filled with a tuna-tomato-caper mix). Or try a beer and pastizzi at a local bar for the […]

Justice Santhosh Hegde is the present Lokayukta Chief of the State of Karnataka and is a person who is well on his way to becoming a role model for the younger generation. The intrinsic values he holds dear in his life and his diligent fight against corruption makes him a person who is worthy of emulation.
Santhosh Hegde was born on June 16th, 1940 in Karkala, Udupi District, Karnataka State. He did his schooling at the St. Aloysius High School, Mangalore and the Madras Christian School, Madras. He completed his Intermediate from St. Joseph's College, Bangalore and his B.Sc., degree from the Central College, Bangalore. He then went on to get a Law degree from the Govt. Law College, Bangalore (presently known as the University Law College, Bangalore). Justice Hegde is married to Mrs. Sharada Hegde, who is herself an M.A., BL. At heart, he is a simple man who loves listening to Ghazals and Hindi music.
Justice Hegde is the son of Late Justice K S Hegde, Former Justice of Supreme Court of India and Former Speaker of Lok Sabha. His Mother, Late Mrs. Meenakshi Hegde, who belonged to Nitte Village. Late K.S. Hegde, was born in Kowdoor Village and had his early education at Karkala and Mangalore, later a degree in Law from the Government Law College, Madras. He Began his legal practice at Karkala in 1936 and later moved to Mangalore, where he was appointed public prosecutor of South Canara district in 1948. He. However, he resigned this office in 1973, in protest against the supersession of senior judges in the appointment of the Chief Justice of India. In 1977, Justice K.S.Hegde was elected to the Lok Sabha and later was appointed Speaker of the Lok Sabha. He held this office till 1980. After a distinguished career, he retired from public life and settled at Nitte, only to relentlessly work for the upliftment and empowerment of the rural people. Justice K.S. Hegde passed away on May 25, 1990.
Justice Santhosh Hegde has been a sportsman throughout his school and university career, which probably explains the deep sense of discipline that has been instilled into his personality and is very evident even today. During his school years, he represented his school team in various games including the Inter-state cricket tournament. He also represented the State of Mysore and University of Mysore in Hockey.
He has held various positions throughout his working career that have brought him prestige and honour. In turn, he has contributed his expertise extensively and the hard work and integrity he has given to every post that he has held, has made it a worthy experience not only for him, but for all those who have worked under him and with him as colleagues.
Description of his posts in brief:
Awards/honors/recognitions:
Conferred with a Honorary Doctorate of Law from the University of Mangalore.Bestowed with the prestigious Vandana Award instituted by the Sri Devi Education trust and Mangalore City Rotaract Club, during the annual day celebrations held on March 8th 2008 at the TMA Pai International Convention Center.
Justice Santhosh Hegde voices his views on corruption and other related matters, in a brief exchange of ideas with Mangalorean.com. M.com: Are you happy with the present powers that the Lokayukta has been endowed with?
Mr. Hegde: No, I cannot say that I am happy.
M.com: Has the Institution of Lokayukta helped in controlling corruption?
Mr. Hegde: To some extent it has.
M.com: What is the quantum of applications that the Lokayukta receives? Is there any overlapping with Karnataka Administrative Tribunal? If yes, would it be advisable to have a unified body having elements of KAT and Lokayukta?
Mr. Hegde: We get applications in dozens per day. There are nearly 22,000 complaints pending (as of March 2008). The Lokayukta is only an investigating agency and KAT is an adjudicatory body. There is no overlapping of jurisdiction. In my opinion, it is not advisable to confer on the Lokayukta the adjudicatory powers because of the principle that one institution should not be the judge jury and the executioner, which is not accepted in Indian jurisprudence.
M.com: How can the younger generation of our society get involved in fighting corruption and aiding good governance.
Mr. Hegde: The younger generation should first determine to be honest and not to encourage corruption. It should be a tool for good governance by refusing to give bribe and by not accepting bribe. It should develop an attitude of satisfaction within their legitimate income. Thus, the younger generation can certainly bring about change in the social attitude towards corruption.
M.com: You have time and again stressed on the importance of a citizens movement in the city. Will such a movement have a legal support from the administration?
Mr. Hegde: The Citizen movement for good governance, which includes Prevention of Corruption, is a must. If the movement becomes strong, legal support will automatically come from administration.
M.com: The Right to information Act - how effective has it been so far in bringing about good governance in the City
Mr. Hegde: The Right to Information Act is of the year 2005 and is becoming very popular amongst the people and has already become a tool in the hands of the people to expose maladministration and in the days to come, it will certainly be a threat to corrupt officers.
M.com: You are a Mangalorean. If one thing you would like or dislike in Mangalore particularly about the social life of Mangalore, what would it be.
Mr. Hegde: Amongst all the people in the State of Karnataka, in my opinion Mangaloreans are the most enlightened. Therefore, they should build a value based society and if that is done, certainly it will be a model and an encouraging factor to the rest of India.
M.com: You are also known for your imposing personality, what would you describe the most important aspect of your personality- Is it the clean public life you have led so far, your penchant for an extremely efficient office or simply because you are Santosh Hegde.
Mr. Hegde: It is a God's gift of developing an attitude of satisfaction with what I have, without desiring for anything more.
M.com: Last but not the least, what is your message to our mangalorean.com readers?
Mr. Hegde: Mangalore is a very fast growing city, both economically and educationally. Therefore, my message to the readers and all Mangaloreans is please protect your culture and city and build a value based society.
Mangalorean.com wishes Justice Santhosh Hegde all the very best in his future endeavors!.

Clark Howard is one of those writers who seems to do everything well. DIRT RICH was a great read. I have read all but one of his novels and they are equally good. His short stories are superb, and his non-fiction books about crime are enthralling. Thanks for bringing some attention to a fantastic writer, Juri.
I'd certainly like to read his other novels. I think I have another one, possibly THE KILLINGS, but I don't know where it is...
I reviewed this for the Orlando Sentinel when it first came out. Great read!
RJR
Oddly enough, I mislaid my copy of DIRT RICH when I was about a hundred pages in, and I need to find it again or buy another...it was pretty impressive up to that point!
Todd: I remember you mentioned you were reading DIRT RICH some years back.Native Seed - Winter 2013

The Arboretum’s Building Committee, chaired by Trustee Alan Visintainer, followed a rigorous vetting process, evaluating eight regional contractors before proposing EDiS for Arboretum Board approval. “We’re very pleased with the selection of EDiS as the construction manager for the new Arboretum Center,” said Visintainer. “EDiS (continued on page 3).

Peterson Wildlife Urban Refuge on the Wilmington Riverfront; renovations and additions to Delaware Museum of History; a 40,000-square-foot renovation of the Mt. Cuba Visitor Center; and the construction of a 44,000-square-foot gallery at Winterthur Museum and Gardens. adkinsarboretum.org Dear Members and Supporters, It is the season for dormancy and hibernation, which is evident on the grounds of the Arboretum. Yet enter the Visitor’s Center, or open this newsletter, and you will quickly realize that the Arboretum is teeming with activity and growth. In this issue of Native Seed, Adult Program Coordinator Ginna Tiernan has arranged an array of programs that will heighten your awareness of nature’s bounty, give you basic skills to be a more confident steward of your property, entertain you, challenge your creative self, and enrich your life. The Arboretum’s popular preschool series continues on Tuesday mornings for 3- to 5-year-olds, with special seasonal programs planned by Youth Program Coordinator Jenny Houghton that always promise some time outdoors, a lesson, a craft, and a snack to pack enough energy in a little one to make the return trip home in good spirits. The annual Art Competition will be on display during February and March. This show will highlight the works of numerous artists all inspired by the region’s landscapes, flora, and fauna. Your New Year’s resolution to put more vim and vigor in your life may inspire you to join runners on April 6 for the annual Arbor Day Run. Runners and walkers come in all sizes and shapes, some racing against their own times and others keeping a steady pace, just grateful to complete the 5K course any way they can. The Arboretum woodland paths are the region’s favorite jogging route. Please join us and help reach your New Year’s resolution goal. We’ll be cheering you on! Running on the heels of the annual Arbor Day Run, the Native Plant Nursery’s 2013 season opens the weekend of April 13-14, with the Members’ Only Day on Friday, April 12. The sale will be held at the Nursery, which will be open to the public throughout the growing season, April through October. Adkins Arboretum offers special insights into the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway (UGRR) by teaching the impact upon and use of nature by freedom seekers. This spring, with grants from the Maryland Humanities Council and the Maryland Historical Trust, the Arboretum will launch a new audio tour about the UGRR as part of the 100-year commemoration of Tubman’s death. See page 8 for the full story. Workshops, lectures, book club, art exhibits, preschool and homeschool programs, Soup ’n Walk, and more are all scheduled in the Arboretum’s one-room schoolhouse, the Visitor’s Center. With only one room to house the Arboretum’s programs, the Visitor’s Center cannot accommodate additional growth. Growing things is the consummate work of an arboretum, and the time is ripe for Adkins Arboretum to grow. On page 1 there is an update for The Campaign to Build a Green Legacy, the plans for expanding the Visitor’s Center to house new programs and better serve our community. In October, the Wilmington, Delawarebased EdiS Company was awarded the contract for construction management of the expansion of the Visitor’s Center, which will be named for W. Flaccus and Ruth B. Stifel, parents of the Campaign’s Honorary Chair, Dr. Peter Stifel. These new green facilities will accommodate growth planned for the next decade, with an art gallery in addition to new classroom and meeting space for large and small groups. How is all of this accomplished? Volunteers! Supporting the Arboretum’s staff is a mighty force of volunteers that helps keep the doors open every day, the paths cleared, the goats tended, the gardens weeded, events arranged, and programs taught and led. One of these volunteers is Barbara Bryan, who creates the artwork for Native Seed. You will learn about Barbara on page 9. She is the Arboretum’s 2012 Volunteer of the Year. For almost a decade, Barbara’s work has graced these pages, helping to make Native Seed an award-winning publication. Which brings me to you, our members, friends, and supporters. Thank you for your participation and contributions.

A Celebration of Natives A Native Garden Tour of Caroline County, May 11, 2013 In May, when the vibrant blue false indigo and subtle pinxter azaleas are in bloom, Adkins Arboretum will host its first Native Garden Tour featuring seven gardens in Caroline County. “A Celebration of Natives” not only will highlight the beauty of these gardens but will emphasize the importance of their role in a bio-diverse landscape. Barbara McClinton, co-chair of the Native Garden Tour Committee, landscape architect, and Arboretum Trustee, comments on the project’s origin and goals, “Visitors often ask how to use native plants or create a native garden. This tour is designed to let you see for yourself how some gardeners have ‘gone native.’ Our gardens range from ‘newly native’ (homeowners who began adding native plants just last year) to ‘long-time native’ (20+ years), and from small properties in town to multi-acre properties that began as farm fields to wooded properties with native enhancements.” GIFTS ARBORETUM DEBUTS SWEET BAY GIFTS The Arboretum gift shop has a new moniker, a new look, and new selections of nature-inspired books and gifts. At Sweet Bay Gifts, you’ll find plenty of books on gardening, including new releases and Adkins Arboretum Book Club titles. The shop stocks the latest line of Winding River jackets, as well as a variety of Brazos walking sticks, made from native trees and crafted in the USA. Check out Paul Aspell’s signature Adkins Arboretum mugs, as well as a brand new selection of Moleskine Passion Journals. As always, Sweet Bay Gifts carries a broad selection of Folkmanis puppets, children’s books, and many unique items that link children with nature. Beautiful gift cards are also available for your favorite gardener. Stop by! This self-guided driving tour features seven gardens plus the Arboretum. Each garden is unique and has its own flair and commitment in its use of natives. “There is something for every gardener on every level on this tour,” says Joanne Healey, co-chair of the garden tour and Arboretum Nursery Manager. “Each one is unique. The tour shows that the use of native plants in any garden plays a major role in our local ecology. These gardens feed wildlife, attract pollinators, provide habitat for animals, and at the same time are an ornamental asset to our outdoor living space. ” January 1. The cost is $15 per person in advance and $25 on the day of the tour. A list of local restaurants will be available for lunch. The Arboretum’s Native Plant Nursery also will be open until 4 p.m. on the day of the tour. For more information, visit adkinsgardentour.org. The garden tour is another facet of the Arboretum’s mission of reaching out to the public through such different channels as the Native Plant Nursery, a generous offering of native trees, shrubs, and perennials, the twice-yearly garden design classes featuring landscape architects (including Barbara McClinton) and other professional designers who offer their expertise in bringing native plants into home gardens, and numerous classes and speakers throughout the year to help those interested in understanding the importance of native plants in the Chesapeake landscape. 4 The Native Garden Tour is Saturday, May 11 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tickets will be available for sale beginning adkinsarboretum.org Sweetbay Magnolia (Magnolia virginiana) Adkins Arboretum’s 2013 Native Tree of the Year By Joanne Healey, Nursery Manager The sweetbay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana), chosen as the Adkins Arboretum 2013 Native Tree of the Year, is a tree from a family with an ancient history going back over 100 million years—back to the time when the Arctic Circle was filled with trees and before bees evolved to pollinate flowering plants. After many geologic periods and the expansion of the ice caps, the magnolias were wiped from the European continent by glaciers. Asia and the Americas were spared, resulting in 219 species in seven genera. The range of the sweetbay magnolia is western Massachusetts, Long Island, and Pennsylvania to Florida and west to Texas. A small, deciduous tree, the sweetbay can grow to 50 feet tall, but 15–30 feet is more the norm. It is a Coastal Plain native and loves the water—wet woods and edges of swamps. It is usually a multi-stemmed plant with a medium to fast rate of growth. The flowers—large, white, and slightly lemon-scented—bloom in May and June, giving way to seedpods with bright red seeds in fall. Magnolias hold little in the way of commercial value. The wood has been used for furniture, broom handles, and utensils. In a horticultural context, the sweetbay is popular not only for its bloom, small size, and tolerance of wet conditions but because it is deer resistant. Additionally, tiger swallowtails (Papilio glaucus) use Magnolia virginiana as a host plant for their caterpillars. The bark and fruit of the sweetbay magnolia have been brewed to make teas for a number of conditions. Soaking the bark in brandy to create a cough medicine was widely practiced. Magnolia bark has also been used as a substitute for quinine in the treatment of malaria. Years ago, the stems and roots were used as a mild diaphoretic to promote sweating, as a laxative, a tonic (an old-time term for “mild stimulant”), and to treat rheumatism and swelling. Many sweetbay magnolias are found on the Arboretum grounds, and you will find all of them near water. The most easily identifiable are the ones in the Visitor’s Center wetland. The sweetbay is a great example of a coastal native, and the Arboretum staff is excited to highlight it in the year to come. In June, artist and painter Lee D’Zmura will hold a series of painting classes focusing on the magnolia flower. Magnolia virginiana will also be highlighted in the eight gardens featured in the Arboretum’s Native Garden Tour on May 11. 5 410.634.2847 From the Bookshelves By Arboretum Librarian and Maryland Master Naturalist Carol Jelich Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children from NatureDeficit Disorder. By Richard Louv. Workman Publishing Company, 2005; updated and expanded 2008. 390 pages. Take that first step with the children in your life. Step outside—or, if the weather is temporarily uninviting, engage them with nature through books such as The Curious Garden, reviewed here by Jenny Houghton, Arboretum Youth Program Coordinator. “I like to play indoors better ’cause that’s where all the electrical outlets are.” This quote from a fourthgrader in San Diego introduces this book, providing a shock for the reader who understands the importance of outside play. For any reader who does not, noted author and journalist Richard Louv offers the research to show how playing, working, and being in the natural environment provides psychological as well as social and physical human benefits. With this book, Louv coined the term “naturedeficit disorder” to underscore the “generational break from nature” that has evolved from a time when children played and explored freely in nature, to now, when their outdoor recreational activities are highly scripted and many prefer to remain inside with electronic games. The expanded edition of this book includes “Notes from the Field: How a Movement is Forming and How You Can Get Involved.” This section provides resources for families and professionals, including books for children and practical activities to engage children with nature. A discussion guide for book clubs is also included. Last Child in the Woods is both pessimistic and hopeful. It demonstrates how, to its detriment, our culture has led children to become disconnected from the natural world. However, the reader is offered ideas for reversing this process, to reconnect children with the wonders and benefits of nature. “There once was a city without gardens or trees or greenery of any kind.” So begins Peter Brown’s magical children’s book, The Curious Garden, in which a city is transformed by a boy who “loved to be outside” in a city where most people spent their time indoors. Inspired by a lonely patch of wildflowers struggling to survive among the tracks of an abandoned railway, Liam begins the greening of his city. Little by little, under Liam’s care, plants creep farther along the railway. As seasons pass, the railway inspires other gardeners, until “Many years later, the entire city had blossomed.” Brimming with bright, detailed illustrations, The Curious Garden invites children to return to its pages again and again. The simple, clear text has a fairytale-like quality, conveying a timeless message of hope for a greener world. The French writer and philosopher Voltaire wrote that “One must cultivate his own garden.” The Curious Garden reminds readers that nature is the real gardener, and the garden is as limitless as a child’s imagination. adkinsarboretum.org 6 Teach, interpret, plant, enjoy! Volunteer Opportunities Maryland Coordinator is not only to facilitate and manage the Arboretum’s volunteers in these activities but also to put a real effort into developing the existing volunteer program to make it as effective as possible. I can guarantee we’ll have a lot of fun in the process! So far, things are off to a great start. I was able to attend my first Soup ’n Walk in October. The event was one of my first opportunities to experience a completely volunteer-run program at the Arboretum. To say the least, it was a wonderful success. From start to finish, it was a highly enjoyable day. In October the Arboretum also welcomed two new volunteers: Judge Anthony, a Maryland Licensed Tree Expert and Master Arborist, of Chestertown, Maryland, and Jordan McNeal, from Hillsboro, Maryland, a student at North Caroline High School working to complete his service learning hours. The staff is happy to have them join the volunteer team and bring their skills and talents to the Arboretum. I am very much looking forward to the coming year at the Arboretum and meeting many new volunteers. If you are interested in volunteering, or have any questions or comments about the current volunteer program, do not hesitate to contact me at 410-634-2847, ext. 29 or kmagaw@adkinsarboretum.org Kelli Magaw Joins Arboretum as Volunteer Maryland Coordinator Hi, my name is Kelli Magaw. Many of you have met me at some point during the past six months while I have been working as the Arboretum’s seasonal intern. As the Arboretum’s intern, I’ve had the privileged opportunity to work with many volunteers and have gained valuable experience in the many aspects of environmental nonprofit work. For those of you I haven’t yet had the chance to meet, let me share a little bit about myself. I am a graduate of East Carolina University, where I received a bachelor’s of science degree in biology with a concentration in ecology and environmental biology. I have lived in Maryland all my life and am passionate about conservation. As my seasonal position was coming to an end last summer, I was looking for a position that would allow me to continue being part of the great work going on at Adkins Arboretum, and I found just that. Recently, I started an exciting new position at the Arboretum as the Volunteer Maryland Coordinator sponsored by the Chesapeake Conservation Corps. For the next 11 months, I will be part of an Americorps program through Volunteer Maryland in which 29 individuals, including myself, are trained across the state to work with various nonprofit organizations to develop their volunteer programs. The Arboretum depends on its group of volunteers to lead visitor programs and interpretative tours, work in the native gardens and greenhouses, as well as staff events and help with fundraising events. My goal as the Volunteer Kelli Magaw, Volunteer Maryland Coordinator, at 410-634-2847, ext. 29 or kmagaw@adkinsarboretum.org. The Arboretum welcomes and gratefully acknowledges its new members.

With grant support from Maryland Humanities Council and Maryland Heritage Area Authority, the Arboretum will produce an. The project will include a self-guided audio tour, developed in concert with historians Anthony Cohen and Dr. Kate Clifford Larson, that will enhance participants’ understanding of the Underground Railroad and demonstrate how nature provided both obstacles and opportunities for freedom seekers. Arboretum docents and volunteers will be trained to interpret nature’s role with the Underground Railroad via guided walks. Participants will be engaged in a blog-based dialogue of the unique connection between the Underground Railroad and nature. Arboretum staff Ginna Tiernan and Robyn Affron and Docent Roger Tilden currently make up the project committee and recently attended a National Association for Interpreters National Conference Workshop on “Stories That Must Be Told: Interpreting African American & Native American History & Culture” to help support the development of the program. Few artifacts and buildings of the Underground Railroad remain. The Eastern Shore landscape fills this historical gap because it is the artifact that remains to evoke this history and provide an important historical context to understand what it meant to travel on the Underground Railroad. Participants will learn about the connection between preserved Chesapeake Bay landscapes and historic conditions and events, as well as the importance of preserving natural landscapes to provide a context for history. The project will be completed by summer 2013. For more information, or to become involved with the project, contact Ginna Tiernan at 410-634-2847, ext. 27 or gtiernan@adkinsarboretum.org. 8 Barbara Bryan volunteer of the year Named 2012 “ Her art has helped to transform Native Seed into an award-winning publication.” ellie altman he issue of Native Seed in your hands would not be possible without Barbara Bryan. Sure, the newsletter would still be in your hands. The articles would be the same. The design and photography would still be beautiful. But it would be missing the subtle yet stunning artwork that brings its content to life and truly makes the Arboretum’s newsletter special. When an issue becomes dated, it is hard to put it in the recycling bin. For the past decade, Barbara’s drawings have helped to elevate Native Seed from a mere newsletter to a treasure that members look forward to receiving in their mailboxes. For her incomparable contributions to the Arboretum and its mission, Barbara was named Volunteer of the Year for 2012. Always fascinated by the natural world, Barbara began creating artwork in first grade. “I had a teacher who came to class one day with wildflowers, and she had all the students pin a flower to their paper and draw it. That’s where it all started for me,” she says. With no formal training, she has pursued her love of art ever since, from painting portraits to drawing plants and animals. “I have always loved the outdoors,” she relates. “And I love to draw from nature. It gives me great pleasure to draw what I see.” Originally from Canada, Barbara moved to the United States as a teenager and became a naturalized citizen. After receiving a degree in education from the University of Virginia, she met her husband, David, in Washington, DC, and they ended up on the Eastern Shore, living first in Centreville and eventually settling in Easton, where Barbara taught first grade at The Country School. Her longtime relationship with the Arboretum has included serving on both the Art Committee and the Board of Trustees, and she expresses appreciation to Executive Director Ellie Altman for providing an outlet for her to use her talent. “I just want to use what I have,” says Barbara. “That’s essentially the key. Ellie has given me the opportunity to do 9 T something that I had always wanted to do, since first grade. I’m delighted that it falls together, and while I love creating art for the newsletter and other publications, I also am gratified that others enjoy it as well.” She relates a story of a complete stranger calling her at home to let her know that she enjoys the drawings she sees in each issue of Native Seed. While Barbara is grateful for the opportunity to share her work, the Arboretum is likewise indebted to her for her vision and talent. Her stunning sketches of a fox or a mouse in a mitten bring to life a series of preschool programs, while a drawing of a tulip poplar flower conveys a magnitude of beauty that words cannot capture. “When Barbara says her volunteer job of painting nature for the Arboretum is her dream job, I am awed that the Arboretum is so blessed by her talents,” says Altman. “Her art has helped to transform Native Seed into an award-winning publication.” Reflecting on her longtime association with the Arboretum, Barbara is delighted that the natural landscape she cherishes is being preserved. “I’ve seen how things have grown and how the Arboretum is aspiring to be better all the time while taking preference to natural things and honoring nature as it is to make it enjoyable for everybody. It’s been wonderful for me to be able to see the growth and change working for good and to see how the Arboretum’s programs and events are keyed to its core purpose. In every aspect, it has been rewarding and very positive. The staff is a great group of people.” Barbara will be honored in January at the Arboretum’s annual Volunteer Appreciation Luncheon. 410.634.2847 Native Plant Lore By Michelle Dolan Lawrence, Arboretum Docent and Maryland Master Naturalist Winter Reveal of the Inner Forest Architecture enough, can slowly accomplish a little bit of photosynthesis. Of course, the loblolly and Virginia pines and the cedars retain their green (“evergreen” is a fitting name for a reason). The pine needles and cedar scales are covered in a waxy coating that helps slow desiccation, shed snow, and resist the damaging effects of freeze cycles. Trying to protect themselves from water loss and cold, the waxy leaves on the magnolia and mountain laurel roll into cigar shapes. The golden leaves of young beech trees are a particular visual treat, though not green in nature. Hanging on through the buffeting winter winds, they glow when the sun hits them just right—the fluttering golden drops can make you stop in your tracks. With each successive snow or rainstorm, the last leaves have been encouraged to fall, the ones on the ground advancing their return to join the soil layer once again. As a reminder that the evergreen loblolly does shed older needles, a dogwood or another mid-forest layer tree will have those needles caught along its branches, appearing for all the world to be decorated in brown tinsel. All of this helps even more with the revealing process, which by March, just before the spring budbursts, seems to lay the different forest layers bare: the newly enriched soil, the green rosettes of the overwintering herbaceous layer, the spider webbing of thin branches of midlayer shrubs and trees, and the high arching tree branches of the canopy trees. Take a walk along the Arboretum paths this winter, feel the winter sun through the branches of a canopy tree, look past the trunks and branches laid bare—can you see the ‘rooms’? Know that same sunlight is working on the spring ephemerals (that will start popping out of the ground very soon) that are taking advantage of the lack of leaf cover, working to create a carpet of wildflowers before the 2x4s and plywood are sheathed in the green roof and walls that make the summer forest a cool retreat. References Winter, An Ecological Handbook by J. Halfpenny and RD Ozanne beautifulbotany.com When I was a kid, one of the neighborhoods I grew up in was still in the build out phase. One of the pastimes my friends and I enjoyed was exploring the framework of the future houses, which at that moment were only 2x4s and plywood—the walls and windows and siding would come later, closing in the house. Walking through the winter forest, I am often reminded of those explorations; the leaves have dropped, revealing the trunks of trees previously hidden, and I can see farther into the woods than when all the summer trappings block the view. That winter reveal is something I look forward to every year. I feel like I am getting a glimpse of something special. The spaces that could, for all intents and purposes, be called rooms, walled by shrubs and tree trunks, are revealed, some of those rooms created by tree fall, others by deer browsing and bedding (they often remodel to fit their desire). Space that didn’t seem to exist during the summer now stretches beyond view; we can see how close some of the Arboretum paths are to each other. Along the paths, some of the plants seem to pop into view, mainly because they are still green. The green seems to glow to the eye weary of the blanket of leaves in monochromatic shades of browns—Euonymous americana, the strawberry bush, has green stems and, if the weather is warm adkinsarboretum.org 10 Mark your calendar! for the sixth annual Magic in the Meadow on Saturday, September 28, 2013!

In a recent letter ostensibly calling attention to the existence of a local youth orchestra, the phrase "Perhaps (Arild) Remmereit should reassess his dream ..." leaves me with many thoughts and impressions. To offer only two:
? How many of us would appreciate such words from a self-appointed authority directed at ourselves?
? "Perhaps you should reassess ... ."
In the instance of this letter, I doubt we're in the presence of a music lover, but rather a hostile critic.

Hi,
Legendary University of Oregon track coach and Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman is indeed a big part of the company's DNA. But the first product bearing the Swoosh was a cleated shoe. There were two reasons for that.
First, Blue Ribbon Sports had a contract with Onitsuka Co., Ltd., which prohibited Blue Ribbon from producing and marketing their own brand of running shoes.
Second, that contract would not expire until 1972. So, instead of waiting until a year to get their own product line rolling, Blue Ribbon chose in 1971 to sell its own branded cleated shoe -- something that was not prohibited in the Onitsuka contract. At least three running shoes -- the Nike Cortez, Nike Obori (rennamed the Nike Boston in 1973) and Nike Marathon -- were the first running shoes bearing the Swoosh, unveiled for retailers at the National Sporting Goods Association show in February 1972 in Chicago.

Les Bleus stormed to victory in their final qualifier last night thanks to goals from Karim Benzema, Thierry Henry and Andre-Pierre Gignac. The result and performance, coupled with Saturday's 5-0 defeat of the Faroe Islands which saw them book their place in the play-offs, will have done much to silence their critics - especially because Les Bleus, who had previously scored only 10 goals in eight games, have rattled in eight in the past two matches.
Domenech is delighted with the mood in the squad. "We scored goals - there were some really good moves, really good periods," he said. "Above all there was a group of 24 players in this match, plus others who weren't there, who showed each time their determination.
"They want to push forward, to wrap up the match, to score - and that's something I like. It's what we're trying to do. Whoever goes on to the pitch, we are all in the same spirit - we want to go to South Africa, and we know what we have to do."
Whoever goes on to the pitch, we are all in the same spirit - we want to go to South Africa, and we know what we have to do.
It is a very different story to last month's double-header when the mood in the camp reached a seemingly all-time low. There were reports of a bust-up between Domenech and his players, while Benzema stunned fans with his admission that he had not really felt like playing against Serbia and had struggled to give his all.
Les Bleus seem to have put that firmly behind them, and Domenech hopes that continues into the playoffs. He added: "The result was positive tonight. But the truth will be in a month. What's important is to keep this dynamic, whichever players are there, to continue in the same vein."
France are likely to be pitted against one of Ukraine, Republic of Ireland, Bosnia-Herzegovina or Slovenia - because they are set to be among the seeded teams, along with Russia, France, Greece and Portugal.
Domenech insists he is unconcerned about Monday's draw. ."

When she said it the second time, I realized I’d been lost in thought.
“Hey, Kristen! How are you?” We were new friends.
On the outside, I had it together. But there was a swirling storm inside. I looked better than I felt.
I was living out my yes to God leading Mercy House. But I was having a hard day. I was tired and overwhelmed. I had more questions than answers and mostly, I felt so alone. I was facing impossibilities and I just wanted to quit.
“How are you?” People ask that question all the time. It’s a greeting, something to fill an awkward pause. But few wait for an answer.
This day, my friend did. She asked and then she waited.
Maybe I was desperate for the waiting. Maybe it was the kind of day where tears just brim. Maybe she really cared.
I believed the last and I decided to tell her exactly how I was doing.
I shared my burden, the struggle, the unknowns. The dark clouds began to clear.
Sometimes healing starts with a question.
I let her in. And she tasted my brokenness. As I wiped my tears and apologized for my awkward answer slash confession, she asked me what I wanted to happen. How did I want God to answer this big question mark in my life?
And so I told her. I confessed a dream I had told few people — a big, impossible dream, a best case scenario answer. I felt silly saying it out loud.
But I also felt bold. Like speaking it meant something.
She listened and then she did something so powerful. She didn’t say, “I’ll pray for you.” She prayed for me. Right there, in a hallway, with people passing by. She grabbed my hands and asked God for the impossible on my behalf.
Nothing changed. But everything was different. I felt like I had let someone in and more importantly, laid the weight of burden down.
That was nearly a year ago.
Last weekend, I saw my friend again for the first time since my hallway blubberfest.
And I got to share the most profound news with her: Just this week, God did the impossible. He answered that big question, the one I was bold enough to ask and she was courageous enough to pray over.
Here’s what happens when we take the time to love each other well:
- We bear one another’s burdens: I felt lighter, better after that hallway experience. My friend helped me give my burden to God that day.
- We are reminded we aren’t alone: Some days just asking and waiting is a gift to someone in need. She couldn’t fix my problem, but when I shared it, I wasn’t alone in it. She reminded me that God was with me by praying to Him for an answer.
- We are invited into the miracles: By letting her into my pain, my need, she got to experience the joy in the miracle.

From My Life as a Man to the blackly comic The Human Stain, Roth made it clear that the sexual and metaphysical politics of a man’s life and identity were his territory. America the big wide-open continent and the sweep of its history were best left to that pointillist John Updike.
But then, in the late ’90s, Roth began a series of novels about the evolution of American culture, beginning with the rupture of the 1960s (American Pastoral), then darting back into the corrosiveness of anti-communism in the 1950s (I Married a Communist), and then leaping ahead to the late ’90s and that period’s reactionary pogroms and the skewering of Bill Clinton (The Human Stain).
The Plot Against America is a literal prequel to these books, beginning as it does in 1940, but, in essence, it’s a hoary coda to that whole project. By linking the jittery fear of Jews being persecuted in America in the 1940s with a presidential election gone awry, Roth delivers a political fable that is likely to send a clear message to Americans as they head to the polls: Be very careful what you wish for.
As was the case in Roth’s Deception and Operation Shylock, this book is narrated by Philip Roth. Like the author, this “Philip” grows up in a working-class section of Newark, N.J., collecting stamps, thinking about baseball, and slipping in an out of the cracks of his family’s edifice. The family unit described here also bears more than a passing resemblance to the family Roth described in his 1988 memoir The Facts. There is an older and more successful brother, Sandy. There’s Bess, Philip’s watchful and loving (and sometimes smothering) Jewish mother. And then there’s his father, Herman, a powerful and impressively righteous father who works in life insurance.
The facts, tone and delivery of this opening section feel so much like a memoir that, once again, Roth has us reading fiction as fact—a nifty trick, especially when we begin feeling that what happens to Philip and his family is real. Roth breaks with reality, though, when he describes how in 1940, at the Republican National Convention, Charles Lindbergh is voted onto the ticket. In a dramatic shift of events, Lindbergh soars into office on a fury of isolationist feeling. He eagerly signs a non-aggression pact with Germany, and begins carrying out policies similar to those of the Nazi party. Jews become very, very afraid.
Political fables of this sort often die under the weight of their earnestness, but Roth never suffers from a lack of self-regard. For every bit of the book that is ominous, nearly finger-wagging or deeply moving, there is something silly and amusing. At one point, Roth overlaps with the creators of South Park by having America declare preemptive war on Canada. In another amusing twist, pioneering gossip columnist Walter Winchell becomes President Lindbergh’s chief opponent.
Although plot twists like this move the novel toward slapstick, Roth continues narrating with the same Jamesian baroqueness that made books like American Pastoral and The Human Stain such rich stews. Like Kafka, Roth understands that maintaining a straight face while he tells us something that is at once terrifying and hilarious puts a reader on a knife’s edge. Not knowing how we’re supposed to feel makes us feel both emotions at once.
Either way, it’s impossible not to think while reading this book that it will be talked about—a lot. And how people read this novel will say much about what Americans think of their country today. If you glance around and it seems like morning in America, chances are Roth’s scenario will seem farfetched, perhaps even un-American. But if you see the seeds of fascism in many of the Bush administration’s policies, then The Plot Against America will scare the bejeesus out of you.

At 15, Ringwald became Hughes’ muse on the strength of her headshot alone; he wrote the lead role in Sixteen Candles with the Tempest actress in mind. She famously followed the film up with starring roles in Hughes’ The Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink. She graduated to more mature roles in The Pick-Up Artist, Fresh Horses, and Betsy’s Wedding, but her movie career never returned to its Hughes-era heights. She fared better on TV, in projects from the Stephen King mini-series The Stand to her mom/grandma role on ABC Family’s The Secret Life of the American Teenager. Now 45, Ringwald has yet to announce any new projects since the five-year run of Secret Life ended in 2013.
Michael Schoeffling (Jake Ryan)
Playing nice-guy dreamboat Jake Ryan was Michael Schoffling’s big break at age 23; he won the part over fellow unknown Viggo Mortensen. Still, after playing similarly soft-spoken hunks in Vision Quest, Slaves of New York, Longtime Companion, Mermaids, and finally 1991’s Wild Hearts Can’t Be Broken, he quit showbiz. He moved to Newfoundland, Pa., married, raised a family, and worked as a carpenter building custom furniture. Now 53, he’s been absent from the screen for 23 years, so we never had to watch Jake Ryan get old.)
The daughter of Oscar-nominated Baby Doll star Carroll Baker, Blanche Baker was already an Emmy-winning TV actress (Holocaust) when she landed at 27 the Sixteen Candles role of Ginny, Samantha’s soon-to-be-married sister. She went on to appear in the movies Raw Deal and The Handmaid’s Tale and on TV in Law & Order and the 2009 HBO movie Taking Chance. Now 57, she stars as a vengeful housewife in the thriller Jersey Justice, debuting on DVD this month.
Paul Dooley (Jim Baker)
Dooley has made a career of playing put-upon dads, from Robert Altman’s A Wedding and Breaking Away to Sixteen Candles, in which he co-starred at age 55. He’s continued to play such roles on film and TV, including Dream On, Waiting for Guffman, The Practice, ER, Desperate Housewives, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Cars (and Cars 2), and Super Fun Night. Now 85, Dooley made his most recent appearance earlier this year on an episode of Parenthood.
Carlin Glynn (Brenda Baker)
Glynn was 39 when she made her Tony-winning Broadway debut in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, a musical co-written by her husband, playwright/director Peter Masterson. Five years later, the 44-year-old played Ringwald’s mother in Sixteen Candles. The following year, she co-starred in The Trip to Bountiful, directed by her husband. Her other films included Gardens of Stone, Judy Berlin, and Whiskey School (her final feature, from 2005). She retired from acting in 2006. Glynn (now 74) and Masterson are the parents of Mary Stuart Masterson, who starred in Hughes’ Some Kind of Wonderful.
Justin Henry (Mike Baker)
For his first performance, as Dustin Hoffman’s son in Kramer vs. Kramer, seven-year-old Henry became the youngest actor ever nominated for an Oscar. He was 12 when he played Ringwald’s bratty brother in Sixteen Candles. He continued to act sporadically during the 1980s in such films as Martin’s Day and Sweet Heart’s Dance. After college, he seldom acted but remained in showbiz, as the founder of the short-life Slamdunk film festival (1998-2003) and as an executive at streaming video site Veoh. Now 42, he appears on screen in the sci-fi/horror feature Reaper, due in theaters later this year.
Edward Andrews (Howard Baker)
By the time 69-year-old Andrews appeared as Samantha’s paternal grandfather, Howard, in Sixteen Candles, he’d had a long and distinguished career as a film and TV character actor, with roles in such films as Tea and Sympathy, Elmer Gantry, The Absent-Minded Professor, Send Me No Flowers, and Tora! Tora! Tora! After Candles, he appeared in one more film, Gremlins, before his death in 1985 at age 70.
Billie Bird (Dorothy Baker)
Bird had a long career in vaudeville and theater before enjoying her film breakthrough as a comic actress in her sixties in The Odd Couple. She was 75 when she played Samantha’s paternal grandmother, Dorothy, in Sixteen Candles. Afterwards, she was a series regular on Benson, appeared in two Police Academy sequels, and acted in the Hughes-scripted comedies Home Alone and Dennis the Menace. Her last film was Pauly Shore’s Jury Duty in 1995. She died in 2002 at age 94.
Gedde Watanabe (Long Duk Dong)
Born Gary Watanabe, the 28-year-old actor was so convincing in his audition (and later, on screen) in the role of hard-partying Chinese exchange student Long Duk Dong that few observers realized he was born and raised in Utah. Watanabe went on to play memorable comic roles in Volunteers, Gung Ho, and Gremlins 2: The New Batch. He showed off a more dramatic side during his six-year stint as a nurse on ER. Now 58, he’s continued to make an impression in such recent films as Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Parental Guidance, and his most recent work, last year’s 47 Ronin.
Carole Cook (Grandma Helen)
A protégée of Lucille Ball’s, comic actress Cook had appeared in such films as The Incredible Mr. Limpet, The Gauntlet, and American Gigolo when, at 59, she got to co-star in Sixteen Candles as the grandma who feels up pubescent granddaughter Samantha. Her movie roles since have included Grandview U.S.A., Lost & Found, and Home on the Range. The 90-year-old’s last acting appearance was a 2006 guest spot on Grey’s Anatomy.
Max Showalter (Grandpa Fred)
Before his turn at 66 as Samantha’s wisecracking maternal grandfather in Sixteen Candles, Showalter had been a movie character actor for four decades in such films as Niagara and Bus Stop (both with Marilyn Monroe) and Elmer Gantry (with future fellow Sixteen Candles grandpa Edward Andrews). In fact, Sixteen Candles was his last appearance. His retirement lasted 16 years until his death at 83 in 2000.
Debbie Pollack (Marlene Lumberjack)
Pollack made her screen debut in Sixteen Candles as Marlene Lumberjack, an Amazon who takes an instant liking to Long Duk Dong. She went on to a recurring role on the soap Santa Barbara and other TV guest roles on such shows as St. Elsewhere, Newhart, and ER. She took a 14-year absence to raise a family and get a stockbroker’s license, but she returned to TV in recent years with guest spots on Criminal Minds (2011) and American Horror Story (also 2011). Her most recent appearance was as a mystery woman during the 2012 series finale of Desperate Housewives.
Liane Curtis (Randy)
Having made her film debut in John Sayles’ Baby, It’s You (1983), Curtis was 18 when she played Ringwald’s pal in Sixteen Candles. It remains her highest profile to date, though she also appeared in such films as Critters 2: The Main Course, Girlfriend From Hell, Queens Logic, and Benny & Joon, as well as TV guest spots on such shows as ER and Sons of Anarchy. Now a music producer, the 48-year-old Curtis will be seen on screen in Body High, a comedy due for release this spring.
John Kapelos (Rudy)
The Sixteen Candles role of bridegroom Rudy was one of 27-year-old Kapelos’ first film roles. He reunited with Hughes (and Anthony Michael Hall) in Weird Science and The Breakfast Club (where he played all-knowing janitor Carl, perhaps his best-known role). Since then, he’s appeared in countless TV shows and movies, including Roxanne, Internal Affairs, Forever Knight, Seinfeld, The West Wing, Legally Blonde, The Dead Zone (which reteamed him with Hall), Queer as Folk, Desperate Housewives, Modern Family, and Justified. Watch for the 57-year-old in August’s action film Underdogs.
John Cusack (Bryce)
His Sixteen Candles role as geek sidekick Bryce was only 17-year-old Cusack’s second film role, but by the following year, he’d graduated to lead in such films as The Sure Thing and Better Off Dead. By the end of the decade, with Say Anything, he became one of his generation’s favorite leading men. He followed that up with such indelible films as The Grifters, Bullets Over Broadway, Grosse Pointe Blank, Being John Malkovich, High Fidelity, and 2012. He spoofed his own ’80s teen stardom in 2010’s Hot Tub Time Machine. Watch for the 47-year-old in several 2014 films, including thriller The Bag Man, David Cronenberg’s Maps to the Stars, and Beach Boy Brian Wilson biopic Love & Mercy.
Joan Cusack (Geek Girl #1)
Sixteen Candles wasn’t the first film that 21-year-old Joan Cusack appeared in alongside her brother John (that would be 1983’s Class), and it was far from the last. As an unnamed geek, Cusack enjoyed a memorable sight gag involving a drinking fountain. She went on to star on the ill-fated 1985-86 season of Saturday Night Live (along with Anthony Michael Hall) before moving on to acclaimed comic roles in such films as Broadcast News, Working Girl (which earned her an Oscar nomination), Addams Family Values, Grosse Pointe Blank (a collaboration with John), In & Out (another Oscar-nominated role), Runaway Bride, Toy Story 2 (and 3), School of Rock, and Chicken Little. The 51-year-old is due later this year in the comedy-drama Welcome to Me.
Jami Gertz (Robin)
Like Ringwald, Gertz was an alumna of the prep-school sitcom The Facts of Life when she landed a role in Sixteen Candles; at 18, she got to play Caroline’s scissor-wielding friend Robin. Gertz went on to star in such iconic ’80s movies as The Lost Boys and Less Than Zero. Despite such prominent films as Twister, Gertz has focused in recent years on TV roles, including long sitcom stints on Still Standing and Entourage. Now 48, she’s a star of the current ABC comedy The Neighbors.If.
That's just the tip of the iceberg; the behemoth under the waves in F.E.A.R. 3 (or F3AR, to use brand-adopted 1337-speak which is apparently all the rage) takes what we know and love about the franchise so far – the tight blend of corridor-based horror shooting and compelling atmosphere and storytelling – and adds a raft of new features to keep thrills high.
When you hire horror legend John Carpenter to advise you on crafting the story and cinematics, you can expect a certain level of intensity. Indeed, F.E.A.R. 3 already has a better sense of coherent storytelling (as far as we've seen) than in previous games.
For a full breakdown on the story, including the introduction of horror writer Steve Niles, who was behind the intense and evocative '30 Days of Night' comic - such is Day 1 Studio's dedication to setting up the atmosphere for, well, fear. Suffice it to say, we're not going to spoil the story for you – but, as outlined in the video interview, it sounds like the third chapter might well wrap up this saga with some fitting closure and answers to all the questions and plot lines that have been building up over the last few years.
As in F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin, there's a big emphasis being placed on the dynamic AI-driven encounters, but this time the stakes have been jacked even further to make for a more compelling co-operative experience. This comes in the form of so-termed 'Divergent Co-op' mode, which is a refreshingly novel but take on the traditional online co-op experience.
Choosing to fill the commando boots of either the original F.E.A.R.'s Paxton Fettel (now a quasi-demonic figure who can phase in and out of our reality and inhabit the bodies of enemies on the fly) or Point Man, the game takes on a refreshing strategic feel. The level we viewed took place across a twisted, burnt out bridge, littered with wrecked, interlinked train cars itching to be blasted through. That's only the first chunk of the seamlessly streaming level – one that's already larger and more intricate than many of those in previous games.
Finally getting to see Fettel's powers in action was an interesting experience. Some way into the Bridge stage – past said bridge, in fact – we were confronted with a burnt out bus and some overturned cars in an open stretch of tarmac. Enemies – in this instance mere gun-toting footsoldiers, but still formidable en masse – began to taking strategic positions in order to drive Fettel and Point Man out of our cover. As they were beginning to flank our position, Fettel lined up one of the gunmen in his pink-hued sites (the screen is literally awash with a subtle pink glow, in line with his physical appearance). Suddenly, as his telekinetic gauge is partially depleted, he took over the body of the assailant and began plugging the other enemies who were still unaware and therefore unprepared. Suddenly, if the enemy essentially refuses to come out from cover, you now have a new strategic option at your advantage.
Teleporting into the body of any other character also has a neat side effect – it's an automatic kill. Essentially, if you just want to bump the guy off, teleport into his body and immediately hop out and into another enemy. In this way, you can chain a couple of kills together and buy some valuable time for your teammate to approach from another angle.Continues

years of her life making a career doing what she loved.
Now Yamaguchi is ready to take a break from the world of figure
skating. The 30-year-old skating icon hopes to devote more time to her
charity work, spend more time with her husband, NHL player Bret
Hedican, and eventually start a family.
This weekend could be the last time Orlando residents get to watch
a live performance of Yamaguchi, one of the headliners in the Stars on
Ice tour visiting TD Waterhouse Centre Saturday.
"It was always my goal to skate professionally," Yamaguchi said. "I
still want to continue skating, but I want to take some time off from
being on the road."
In its 16th consecutive year touring the United States, Stars on
Ice has featured some of the world's top professional
skaters. Saturday's show will include American Olympic champions
Yamaguchi and Tara Lipinski, the 1998 gold medalist, along with 1984
and1988 gold medalist Katarina Witt, and 1998 men's gold medalist Ilia
Kulik.
The newest addition to the Stars on Ice tour is Todd Eldredge, an
elder statesman in amateur figure skating. A former World Champion and
six-time National Champion, Eldredge competed in three Olympic Games,
and retired after finishing sixth this year in Salt Lake City. He
joined the show shortly after the conclusion of the Winter Games.
Yamaguchi has a just few more months of touring before she moves
into the next phase of her life.
She'll no longer have to balance her schedule with that of her
husband Hedican, who recently joined the Carolina Hurricanes after a
trade from the Florida Panthers.
"I don't know if I'll ever come back to such an extensive touring
schedule," she said. "But I'll always keep my options open."- 5

This marinade was great but I think I let the steak in it too many hours. It was almost in the marinade 48 hours because of the snow outside. Thanks Simplemom :) Made for Holiday tag
Nice but would have added some more heat factor ( Franks is not hot enough for us ), tabbasco or homemade would be best. I also would use fresh garlic and onion... A grand base recipe, will use for future.
Wonderful steak marinade!!! I used it on a flank steak and let it marinade for about 6 hours before grilling. I loved this recipe as it uses ingredients that I always have on hand and didn't include any fats!!!! I used the 4 dashes of Franks hot sauce, and would recommend that people who like it spicy might want to use more, but it was perfect for our family. Thanks simplemom for a great recipe!!! Made for spring PAC 2008.
Another Steak MarinadeI recently got an e-mail that was titled the following: Hear YOUR MLB TEAM on XM and get 3 MONTHS FREE - order by 3/31! It said it was from SIRIUS too. Does this mean MLB games will be on SIRIUS this season via the Best of XM package? Or is it just a mass e-mail being sent out that really pertains to XM subscribers and is just from the company in general. The content of the actual e-mail is kind of misleading and confusing as to whether it is coming or not and can be taken either way. I already have the "Best of XM" package on one of my radios so just curious if they got it all straighten out for this season.Welcome to Loom Yoga Center

Reader David Hawthorne shares how this verse is very timely for our community, and reads a portion of a commentary from Blessed Augustine and briefly expounds upon it. The point is: we must make some vow to the Lord, even if it is a "widow's mite", to gain spiritual discipline in our lives.Why Do AC Units Break?

WASHINGTON -- For the first time in 130 years, members of Congress gathered in Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol for a church service.
About 300 members from both sides of the aisle gathered to worship just hours before the House of Representatives voted to pass health care reform.
Rep. Randy Forbes, R-Va., organized the service and delivered a message about trusting God.
"When we look at our Founding Fathers we don't have to ask the question 'I wonder what would have happened if they had trusted God?" Forbes said. "They did. Our question is 'What would have happened had they not trusted God?'"
"And the question we left them with is 100 years from today, 30 years from today what will our children be asking?" he continued. "Will they have to ask the question,'I wonder what would have happened if they had trusted God?' or will they be able to ask the same question that we get to ask: 'I wonder what would have happened had they not trusted God?'"
Church services in the Capitol were common throughout the 19th century. At one point, nearly 2,000 people assembled for church there each Sunday representing the largest Protestant church in the U.S. at the time.
Thomas Jefferson attended a church service in the Capitol just two days after writing his famous "wall of separation between church and state" metaphor in a letter.

Being the only device that has the user connected all the time, its popularity as an advertising platform is increasing at a fast rate. (Read more about it here- Mobile set for extraordinary growth despite ROI challenge, say experts ).
Besides establishing presence on mobile via apps and mobile-related products, brands are also exploring ways in which they can reach out to maximum audience. Digital media technology firm Komli Media, launched a new remarketing demand side platform (RDSP) earlier this year (read here- Komli Media restructures,to focus on remarketing demand side platform). The company has now brought the remarketing platform to mobile. The new offering provides marketers and app developers a solution to re-engage with their users on mobile web and applications in the same manner as web.
Talking to exchange4media, AshwinPuri, VP Remarketing & Mobile, Komli Media shared insights on how mobile is evolving as a platform for advertising.
Tell us about remarketing on mobile.
We launched the Remarketing DSP platform in February this year and it was desktop-focused at that time. Now it supports mobile as well. The idea is to replicate that on mobile. However, that said since the concept works on cookies it’s not very easy to replicate on mobile because cookies don’t work on mobile web.
Remarketing is evolving as a serious strategy on web, how’s it growing on mobile?
It’s early days as of now. If you ask any of the big e-commerce firm, 20 per cent of their transactions are coming from mobile. In next 12-18 months everyone is predicting more than half of their business will come from mobile. This is also why everyone is launching their own apps. In such a scenario marketing on mobile also takes a serious role to play.
How is mobile remarketing different from web? Is it more effective on mobile?
Web has so many different options but on mobile given the form factor it is going to be even more critical. We believe it will be more effective. Through the initial campaigns that we have run, we have seen that users who are browsing on mobile have a lot more purchase intent as compared to browsing on desktop. Click through rate is also more on mobile. Remarketing on mobile will be equal to web if not better.
What are the challenges that you face?
In my view, the whole user experience on mobile needs to be rethought. People are used to looking up things on mobile but not used to buying on mobile. That mindset change needs to happen. Also awareness regarding apps and making sure people download apps since apps are way more secure and easier to use is also needed. These are all challenges.
How is mobile as a whole coming along in terms of spends from marketers?
Spends on mobile have massively increased in last one year. It still is single digit percentage but what has changed is that mobile has become an integral part of what they are doing. Mobile as a standalone value prop is still nascent but it is moving way faster than web particularly for e-commerce, OTAs etc. For other traditional sectors it’s not that big, since in these categories internet is not the purchase channel so it’s not mission critical to go big on mobile.
How many customers are live on the remarketing platform?
More than 25 customers live on the platform and all of them are e-commerce, OTAs, online classifieds, etc. The other vertical that we see scope is traditional app developers. Apart from that BFSI is another sector where we see scope. They have started to see a lot of customer interaction online.
Some key mobile marketing trends that have caught your eye.
Push around applications; most people are getting to apps from mobile browsers,and that is a big trend. Secondly, there is a lot of push around rich media. Everyone is pushing for richer formats on phone.
Thirdly location-based advertising is a big trend and lastly, we see mobile really being pushed by RTB.
While online world took way long to embrace RTB but on mobile 80 to 90 per cent inventory is already on RTB.
How will you imbibe video in remarketing product?
Video is more relevant from a brand advertising point of view. In the near term objectives, video doesn’t quite fit in remarketing. We don’t necessarily in short term see video a part of remarketing since it is majorly used for brand building whereas remarketing is coming out to be more relevant for performance marketing.Last Updated: January 27, 2012
This article appeared in the January 2012 Rural Policy Matters.
Marty Strange, who has headed the Rural School and Community Trust policy program for 15 years, has resigned to return to consulting on rural policy issues and campaigns.
Strange joined the Rural Trust as a member of the Board of Directors in 1995 and was asked to launch the policy program in 1997. He served as a part-time consultant in that assignment until 2000, when he joined the staff as full-time policy director. He will continue with the Trust as a lead consultant, heading the Formula Fairness Campaign and consulting on other policy issues.
Under Strange’s leadership, the Rural Trust policy program has focused on rural education organizing at local and state levels, with priority on rural areas that face the greatest economic and social challenges. For the past three years, however, he has also coordinated the Formula Fairness Campaign, a nationwide effort to reform the formula for distributing federal funds for the education of disadvantaged students.
"Marty's contributions to the Trust have been invaluable," says Doris Terry Williams, Executive Director of the Rural Trust. "We are pleased that we will be able to call about his expertise in his new role as we continue the Trust's important rural policy analysis and advocacy work."
Strange was a co-founder in 1973 of the Center for Rural Affairs, a rural advocacy organization that advocates for family farms and small business. His book, Family Farming: A New Economic Vision, is a leading defense of family farming.
“I’ve worked for rural America my entire career, and 38 years of it with just two organizations, both of which I joined in their infancy,” says Strange. “I want to use my experience in the best way possible, and I think that I can do that best by returning to consulting. I’ve had 15 good years with the Rural Trust, and I’m grateful for the great work this organization does.”

Symbiosis, as captured on film.
sym·bi·o·sis – a relationship between two people or groups that work with and depend on each other
Twin sisters Amber and Ashlie Chavez are a pair for the books. Only in their 20’s, these ladies have established themselves as professional photographers, crafting images for fashion campaigns and magazines and photographing musicians for press kits and album covers. Another amazing fact: they shoot exclusively on film, and have been doing so for over a decade.
During our interview, Amber and Ashlie share that they are a perfect team. “Where one of us lacks, the other excels. A symbiotic relationship.”
It comes as no surprise that their first successful—-and one of their most important—-body of work would be entitled Symbiotic. Symbiotic is a series that delineates their abnormally close relationship as twins and luckily, Amber and Ashlie have given us the honor of featuring images from this series. Their you will find an eerie quality to their closeness, as if they breathe as one, or what others have referred them, as “an inescapable unit.”
See more of their stunning work on amberchavez.com and ashliechavez.com.

The data, covering the 2011-12 school year, was released late last month by the Michigan Department of Education. It is mandated under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.
RELATED: Why educators aren’t surprised only one Kent County district met special ed graduation target
To see your district’s graduation rate, use the searchable database below. It includes data from the three latest reports, covering 2009-10 to 2011-12.
For some schools, a graduation rate is marked "N/A" because the school had 10 or fewer students in the graduation cohort. Some charter schools in the data may also have the "N/A" if the charter school does not offer grades 9-12.

Domaine des Buissonnes Sancerre 2006
and
Sautereau Sancerre Rose 2006
Buissonnes is a family estate in the Loire region of France, situated near the village of Sury en Vaux. The vineyards are located in the limestone rich soils in the valleys near the village. The family has made wines there for many generations.
Our customers love the classic style of the 2006 Domaine des Buisson Sancerre. Imported by the world-renowned Jean Marie DeChamps, the wine is full of the wonderful minerality so common to Sancerre. With pristine fruit flavors and crisp acidity, this white is the perfect accompaniment to shellfish. It is extremely versatile and can be enjoyed on its own as well.
*************************
Domaine Sautereau is a small estate producing high quality Sancerre. It is located in the village of Crezancy, 7 km from the town of Sancerre. The estate has been making wine for 9 generations. Winemaker David Sautereau uses a blend of age-old practices and modern techniques to show the terroir characteristics of Sancerre at their best.
This Rose is made from 100% Pinot Noir, and is the ideal wine for BBQ and outdoor parties. It is an easy-drinking, refreshing rose which is perfect with appetizers, cheese, white meats or seafood.
I don't know about you, but I'm ready for the beautiful, warm weather to arrive - and I'm ready for some great wines to go with it!
Stay ConnectedSalesforce.com on Tuesday announced Chatter Free, a version of its social collaboration software that includes a Facebook-like "invite" feature that enables paying users to invite anyone, even non-Salesforce.com customers, to use Chatter.
Chatter employs familiar social-networking functionality like user profiles, real-time information streams, status updates and file-sharing. Now, when a user accepts a Chatter invite, they will receive a Chatter Free license.
Chatter Free has some limitations compared to other versions of the software, such as Chatter Plus, which allows users to "follow" business data and use custom objects. Salesforce.com is clearly hoping Chatter Free users will want more over time and decide to upgrade.
Some 60,000 of Salesforce.com's roughly 87,000 customers have deployed Chatter since its general release earlier this year, according to the company. However, it's not clear how broad those deployments are.
Chatter Free's invite feature, however, is "going to take Chatter enterprise-wide," Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff said in a statement.
Chatter has made a serious impact on the IT industry, in the view of analyst Denis Pombriant, managing principal of Beagle Research.
"First, it created or certainly solidified a new market niche for collaboration technology. Second, it was another proof point for the robustness of the cloud computing model and [Salesforce.com's Force.com platform] in particular. And finally, it domesticated social media," he said in a recent blog post.
"Chatter avoids many of the pitfalls seen in other social media in part because it is aimed at a population that is expected to use it as a condition of employment, and that appears to be working well from the stories I've seen," Pombriant added. "The result is a proof point for social technology in the enterprise, something that was lacking."Overnight buy omnicef, how to order omnicef online without prescription, where can i purchase omnicef no rx, buy omnicef mastercard in South Australia, omnicef orderd online without prescription, omnicef purchased online without prescription, omnicef buy fedex, order online omnicef without prescription purchase online prescription omnicef without, purchase omnicef paypal without prescription, how to purchase omnicef online without a prescription, buy omnicef mastercard medication cod, purchase rx omnicef without, online omnicef mastercard buy, Purchase omnicef same day, purchase omnicef without prescription

It would feel great if his Orlando Magic beats his former team, the Boston Celtics.
"They're a great team, a great organization that plays extremely hard, and they compete," Davis said. "To get this win, not only for our team, but for myself, would be great because I've always envisioned beating them. I haven't. I came close last year. But I haven't had the chance to beat them yet. It'll feel good."There are numerous ways to break up with your girlfriend. Some are considerate and polite, others will likely leave her in tears. Regardless of any negativity you might feel toward your significant other, it is best to break up as amicably as possible.
The good news is that however you decide to break up with your girlfriend, you are not likely to leave a permanent scar. Some studies suggest that many are able to recover from failed relationships within a matter of weeks, and that stress levels aren't nearly as high as once believed following a breakup.
Still, you should break up with your girlfriend without intentionally hurting her feelings or destroying her self esteem. Remember that women talk to one another, and the way you treat one woman might impact how easily you get your next date.
It's All About You
Break-up conversations are never fun, but you can make it easier on her by turning the tables. Rather than listing all of her flaws, use "I" statements to convey your unhappiness. This is one of the best ways to break up with your girlfriend because she doesn't feel like she's done something wrong.
You might say, "I'm not ready for a serious relationship" or "I need some time for myself." Just stay clear of the age old line, "It's not you, it's me." She's unlikely to believe that, and you'll just make her feel worse about the whole situation. When you break up with your girlfriend, you can avoid anger and depression by talking about how you feel-about the relationship, not about her.
Bring a Doctor's Note
It's doubtful that you've considered a medical opinion when brainstorming ways to break up with your girlfriend, but stranger things have happened. Millions of people see mental health professionals every year, and your relationship might be causing you undue stress. If this is the case, tell your girlfriend the recommendation of your physician.
This doesn't mean that you should blame the breakup entirely on your doctor. However, you can use his or her opinions about your mental health to bolster your position. Say, "My doctor believes that I'm depressed because I'm not happy in this relationship. I agree with him." Then reassure her that she hasn't done anything to deserve your mental state.
Go on the Offensive
If you truly believe that your girlfriend is the reason for all of your relationship troubles, you might want to go on the offensive. This means laying bare all of the things she does that drive you crazy, then making it clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that it's over. This is probably one of the cruelest ways to break up with your girlfriend, but sometimes it is necessary.
For example, if you think that a kind, polite message will not get through, you might not have a choice. Some women (and men, for that matter) are incapable of accepting reason, and will argue a point until both parties are exhausted. You can eliminate the back and forth when you break up with your girlfriend by being straight from the beginning.
Admit Treachery
Although you won't find this breakup advice in most magazines, it is definitely a thorough way to break up with your girlfriend. If you have had an affair or if you've told a lie, admit it to your significant other. If you don't grovel at her feet or admit remorse, she's unlikely to take you back.
Admitting an affair or lie is an indirect way to break up with your girlfriend, but it works. In this case, you avoid emotional scenes for the most part, and she'll probably be the one to utter the words "it's over." Keep in mind that this method will probably hurt her feelings and put a black mark next to your name in her book forever.
Pack Your Bags
Nothing signals a breakup quite like packing everything you own. If you and your significant other share living space, simply pack all of your belongings and set them by the front door. When she gets home, it won't be difficult to infer your intentions. When you break up with your girlfriend this way, though, prepare for some backlash.
When you pack your bags, you send a nonverbal message that will likely lead to a fight. Your best bet in this case is to simply leave, particularly if you and your girlfriend haven't gotten along in some time. Chances are she knew this day was coming, so sever ties immediately and for good.
When It's Over
There are plenty of ways to break up with your girlfriend, but you're the only one who knows what breakup advice will work for you. Just remember that your significant other, regardless of how annoying or clingy or possessive she might be, is a person worthy of your respect.
The best thing you can do is make a clean break and wish her the best. After that, it's time to get on with your life and see what else awaits you in the future.80 Percent of Payday 2's Sales Were Digital
Payday 2 is selling like hotcakes, digitally.
Starbreeze has annoucned that it has sold almost 1.6 million copies of its newly released game, Payday 2 across multiple platforms. The studio states that the bulk of its sales were through digital sales since August. 80 percent of the game's sales were digital.
The game was already in profit even before it was launched due to pre-order volumes, so it's pretty damn impressive that the game has continued to sell since then.
The figures were revealed at a Starbreeze investor note last night.
Our own Lowell Bell reviewed the cooperative crime game last month.

Room smelled slightly of smoke.!
I liked the location and breakfast. The staff was nice. I liked having the coffee maker in the room.
I could not request two beds for two people without getting charged. I had to sleep with my mother in a queen bed. I'm an adult not a child. The heating system. The biggest disappointed; I left some small items, was charged $15 to have them mailed.
It was close to the event that I was attending
There was not a microwave or refrigeration in the room. The room was very small

Weighing in at only 3 ounces (85 grams), the AirHarp Pico is about the size of a pack of cigarettes. It's the smallest, lightest AirHarp we have ever built. Carry it with you everywhere, and you'll never find yourself without a harp again!
Note that the AirHarp Pico is a USB MIDI controller, so you still need a laptop, iPad, iPhone or other computing device to generate the actual sound. Fortunately, the AirHarp Pico is class compliant, meaning it is instantly recognized by virtually all operating systems with no need to install device drivers. It's also powered by the USB port, so there's no need for batteries!
The "hybrid" wood case features a 3D printed synthetic wood base and a laser-cut basswood top. It's the perfect blend of modern technology and classic beauty.
This package includes:

But how much healthier is your bottled water?
As a clinical nutritionist, I work with patients not only with their diet but I also stress the importance of hydration with the healthiest water possible. Excluding the environmental impact of all the plastic bottles, the problems with bottled water are these:
1. It’s estimated that 40% of bottled water is actually tap water. I personally didn’t want to believe this one when I initially heard it. But more and more data has come out citing this, and it does appear to be the case.
2. Bottled water is typically housed in plastic bottles that can be a source of chemical toxins such as BPA and phthalates (pronounced thal-ates). The health problems of these substances are reviewed in the “Living Healthy in a Toxic World” lecture presented by our Clinical Nutrition department, but if you missed it here are some highlights of these two chemicals.
• Bisphenol A or BPA is an estrogen-like chemical that has been linked to learning problems, weakened immune system, early puberty in girls, fertility problems, diabetes, obesity, along with breast and prostate cancer.
• Phthalates make plastics more flexible and they are associated with several hormonal and reproductive problems such as reduced sperm counts, testicle abnormalities and liver cancer.
3. If 40% of bottled water is actually tap water than we are consuming many drugs and toxins that leach into it such as arsenic, aluminum, disinfectant byproducts and prescription drugs.
Fluoride, once thought to be good for our teeth is also found in drinking water in various amounts. While many people now know not to flush their drugs down the toilet, throwing them in the garbage isn’t safe either. It turns out that water drains through landfills and may eventually end up in rivers, the source of drinking water for many states. The combination of drugs that are mixed together in drinking water is frightening.
Whether you get overt symptoms from it or it affects the healthy reproduction of your body’s cells, there is an effect from consuming these trace amount of drugs on a regular basis. Reducing such exposure is something that clinical nutritionists strive to accomplish in our patients.
4. How and where you transport your water is also very important. Glass or steel containers are the best. People who leave their plastic water bottles in their car to get warm from the sun, or on their bicycle, will be drinking water tainted with many chemicals due to heat mobilizing them from the plastic.
5. A note on fluoride: The International Journal of Pediatric Dentistry (September 2001) and a new study in the Journal of the American Dental Association, (October 2010) found that, contrary to what most people have been told, fluoride is actually bad for teeth.
The study found that fluoride intake during a child's first few years of life is significantly associated with fluorosis, damage to the enamel of the teeth creating more risk of tooth decay.
Very recently (January 2011) the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced that they will take another look at the standards and guidelines for fluoride in drinking water due to the increase in dental fluorosis.
On a personal note, I must say that I waited a long time to hear these studies. My children are now 18, 20 and 22 and when they were young, fluoride treatments were “all the rage” with dentists. My intense refusal to use what I considered to be a toxic substance, caused much discussion between myself and our dentist. I’m glad to see that my gut instinct was correct as I have shared this opinion with patients over the years. So what should you do?
1. Get a reverse osmosis water filter for your home. Put it on your kitchen sink and use if for all drinking and cooking water. You can also go to a website called FindaSpring.com where you can find natural springs in your area that are a source of free clean water. I did a quick search myself and was pleasantly surprised to find a spring in Los Gatos, CA.
2. Invest in either glass or steel water containers that you can fill up at home and bring with you for the day. Most of us at HealthNOW do this. The bottles are easy to find and leaving the house with the amount of water you need to consume for the day makes it easier to drink what you need.
The amount of people in our country who are truly dehydrated might shock you. It might also shock you to find out how much better you feel when you’re drinking the right amount of healthy water for your body.
3. Calculate your water needs: your weight divided in half equals the number of ounces of water you need per day. E.g. 128 lb divided by 2 = 64 ounces of water or 8 cups per day.
Consuming adequate amounts of good, clean water is something that each and every one of us needs to do on a daily basis. There is no alternative to this basic life necessity. It’s an unfortunate fact that the water flowing through the pipes in our homes is really not adequate to promote health – quite the contrary. It takes some work to get good water, but I think you’ll find it well worth it.
Here in our Clinical Nutrition department, we are often amazed at what incredible health changes ensue from simple lifestyle changes. Hydration definitely fits into this category. Please do let me know if this was helpful and write to me with any questions you may have. We are here to care for you, your family and friends. Our Destination Clinic treats patients from across the country as well as internationally.

No, he didn't :-) Sean B. Palmer wrote: >Given that the part was originally Oldcastle, it would be strange to >base your claim at all on evidence from the name Falstaff. The part was originally "Oldcastle" because it was based on a historical character. When Shakespeare was forced to change the name, he was free to choose any name - he was not constrained by history (actually, it has been argued that "Fastolf" is open to much the same objections as "Oldcastle".) It is generally accepted that Shakespeare took the name of the cowardly knight from 1 Henry VI. Now, although "Falstaff" [Falstaffe] is a valid 15th and 16th century spelling for "Fastolf" (the historical character represented in 1H6) we have no way of knowing how it was originally spelt - the F1 text of IH6 could well have been retro-edited for consistency. Giorgio Melchiori has argued that Shakespeare substituted the name "Falstaff" in 1H4 because in 1597 he was writing a Garter Day entertainment (later much expanded into the 1600 play "Merry Wives") featuring the character from 1H6, but this time as a comic figure - the name was therefore hastily appropriated. The play of "Fall (or False) Staff" against "Shake Spear" could have happened at any stage, but seems unlikely to be accidental. >Furthermore, it's a leading role which most have presumed would call >for the leading clown, Kemp, though Malone said it was Heminges. It is now generally accepted that Falfaff is not a clown's role - or at least, not "the" clown's role - and that Kemp was more likely to have been Bardolph. Kemp's successor, Robert Armin, was a singer (Feste - whoever played Falstaff also played Sir Toby Belch), and specialised in comic Welshmen (Fluellen, Sir Hugh Evans). I would argue that John Heminges took over Shakespeare's roles. There is some suggestion that Shakespeare played clown-ish roles. >Documentary evidence, then, does weigh against >Shakespeare taking on such a major part himself. Jack Heller also wrote: >Another problem particularly for this idea about Falstaff is >that he appears in three plays, once as the lead character. >Do we ever hear of Shakespeare taking a lead role? Steve Sohmer has argued (persuasively, it seems to me) that Shakespeare played Julius Caesar (as well as Polonius). "The" lead role was usually played by Richard Burbage (Hamlet, Brutus, Prince Hal, Henry V). He presumably played Ford in "Merry Wives" - what did he play in Twelfth Night: Orsino? The idea of Burbage and Shakespeare playing against one another is attractive.

John's questionable business activities may have resulted in his being banished from court (Board of Aldermen) and his application for a coat of Arms refused. Down the final stretch, one could contemplate whether Shakespeare would play a character fashioned after his father..© University of Kent - Contact | Feedback | Legal | FOI | Cookies

Clio Barnard's work is concerned with the relationship between fictional film language and documentary. She has often dislocated sound and image by constructing fictional images around verbatim audio. In her film The Arbor actors lip-synch to the voices of real people, questioning documentary's aspiration to collapse the distance between reality and representation.

Late Night Blogging: The Worlds of Sid and Marty Krofft
John these videos bring back wonderful memories of '70s Saturday mornings from my boyhood.
SGB
I've got a soft spot in my heart for Land of the Lost and to a lesser degree, HR Pufnstuff, Sigmund, and Lost Saucer. Now, I find many of the later Krofft shows are nearly unwatchable but the earlier ones still have a sense of whimsy and charm to them.
I'm also intrigued by the talent that passed through the Krofft studios in the 1970's. Specifically, Gene Warren's FX company provided much of the stop motion animation for Land of the Lost, as well as FX for Man From Atlantis and other shows, Herman Zimmerman who was the set designer for many early Krofft shows (and later to do the same for Star Trek the Next Generation), and Mike Minor who helped design and create so many miniatures for the Kroffts and likewise went onto designing the Trek Phase II series as well as the earlier Trek films.
Amazing talents that were given their first big breaks in the business!Christmas Abuses (or ‘Bah Humbug’)

THE DEFENSE
Q: Hi Anthony. Welcome to Defend Your Ride New York! Where are we and what brings you here?
A: We are in Rockville Center, right by St. Agnes Cathedral. I am running some errands and on my way to pick up an espresso right now. I live pretty close to here, so it’s a good place to get things done.
Q: Do you have a nickname for your car?
A: I call my car Prez, which is short for Impreza, not president. I like to say, I am taking the Prez out, or I’m going out with the Prez.
Q: What features do you like about your car?
A: Having a hatchback is great. I can fit a lot of junk in my trunk, especially with the seats down. I also love how low I can adjust the front seats. They hug you and practically become bucket seats. I need to be comfortable considering I spend a lot of time in my car. Also, the brakes are strong and responsive and have kept me out of many fender benders. What can I say, people drive too slow around here.
Q: Where do you mostly drive?
A: I have a 30 mile commute to work, so five days a week I am in my car at least a couple of hours. I’ve become very close with the Southern State Parkway these days. I don’t mind the commute though, since it’s the only alone time I get.
Q: That’s cool. Is there anything specific that makes your commute more enjoyable?
A: I like to listen to books in the car. It makes the commute go by faster. I also feel like I am being productive with all the time I spend driving. If I am not listening to a book though, I am likely listening to music.
Q: Nice. So I guess you are happy with the radio and sound system?
A: My auxiliary port is key. I love that I can plug in my iPod or phone whenever I want. That makes it very easy to listen to books and tunes. The car also came with a six CD changer, which is often occupied by my Roxy Music collection.
Q: Can you share an interesting story with us involving your car?
A: One winter, I was driving on the Southern State Parkway and two SUVs spun out in front of me. Prez had no problem handling the conditions and cruised right by them. I was able to slow down quick enough in order to avoid contact. I had a greater appreciation of my car that day when I realized the traction is really amazing. At that point, I was sure I made the right choice by getting this car.

In front of proud family and friends, the students talked about their struggles and successes, and why they chose this profession.
“The big thing is the ability to help people and actually see the end result of what I've done to help them,” says Ty LaRiviere.
“I wanted to be trained to truly help people,” says Mary Orr.
While they'll be doing something they love, they also won't have to worry about a job.
Both have job offers.
And that's the case at least locally with nursing students and others who have taken courses and received degrees or certification in the trades like machining, dental hygiene, and diesel technician.
TMCC Job Placement Specialist Nancy Roe says there are other professions that aren't as rosey.
“Administrative professional there is a lot of competition there. A lot of people have experience as an assistant that were laid off. So there's a lot more competition in those areas like business...I.T is also competitive,”says Roe.
They may also be competing against preconceived notions.
A new Economic Policy Institute survey of managers shows a whopping 66% don't believe college grads are ready for the workplace.
They also say resumes are hurting grads before they ever make it in the front door for an interview.
Roe doesn't disagree.
“There is a huge need to learn to sell yourself to an employer,” says Roe.
Job market opportunities will in large part depend upon what major the student graduates.
However, they all will have advanced degrees which means they'll have a better shot at a job, than someone who does not.
The Bureau of Statistics says the unemployment rate for college grads stand at 6.9%.Show Comments

According to the report, “The political action committees (PACs) of these fourteen companies and the PACs of their affiliated trade associations gave $2,187,868 in the 2008 election cycle and the 2010 cycle to date directly to the campaigns of members of the committees of jurisdiction over chemical security legislation.”
After laying out what can be done to protect the safety of Americans near these plants, the report makes some conclusions about the need to address the outsided role corporations have in influencing the policy-making process due to their ability to spend millions of dollars playing the influence game in Washington, D.C.
From the report:
Corporations are heard at a louder volume and more frequently by the members of committees that control policy that directly affects corporate interests. This is an issue that skews our democratic process, and it requires a solution.
So, what’s the solution? Fair Elections:
Finally, in the long term we need truly systemic reform to get money out of politics and stop the rampant spending by corporate interests on campaign contributions. The Fair Elections Now Act (H.R.1826) introduced by Representatives John Larson and Walter Jones, would provide public financing for congressional candidates, thereby empowering voters and putting power to fund elections in the hands of the small donors rather than the corporate special interests.

His first time on a board was a family affair. Beauchemin says, “I visited my grandparents in Pennsylvania for Christmas when I was 12 years old and my cousin Michael asked me if I wanted to try snowboarding with him. We went to the local mountain and ever since then I’ve been hooked on it.”
When he and his family went back to Michigan “we started riding on the weekends, then bought a season pass a couple years later and started riding every day after school,” he adds.
It didn't take him long to contract a passion for slopestyle which lies in creativity and smooth, stylish runs.
With appearances at all the major contests around the globe, it is likely we will soon be seeing his name up on top.
In the off-season, Beauchemin enjoys visiting his friends back in Michigan but stays most of the time at his parent's home in Pennsylvania to wake surf the lake, kicking the soccer ball around or to skate.EXHAUST manifolds, flathead V8, including 60 hp, fresh resurface and ready to bolt on.

On October 6, 2010, Deputy Carter and his K-9, Chase, were dispatched to a reported Breaking and Entering in progress at 4800 Quail Hunt Cr. The victim advised that two black males had come to her front door and knocked on it several times and when she “did not answer it, they went to her back door and kicked it in.” The victim also advised communications that the suspects were coming up the stairs and she was hiding in the upstairs bathroom. As they were walking up the stairs Deputy Carter arrived and the suspects yelled, "The Cops."
Deputy Carter immediately got K-9 Chase out of the patrol vehicle and went to the back door where he observed the two suspects running from the house. Deputy Carter identified himself and told them to stop. The suspects kept running and K-9 Chase was released. Chase apprehended the first suspect and the second suspect immediately stopped and fell to the ground, asking Deputy Carter not to “turn the dog loose on him.”
Deputy Carter's quick response and assistance from K-9 Chase led to the apprehension of the two suspects. They are also suspects in six armed robberies and several Breaking and Entering cases. The victim and her husband were much appreciative and impressed with how the Sheriff's Office handled their very dangerous incident. Congratulations Deputy Car

The Mahakal Temple, housing one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, is the most famous and respected Shiva temple. Other important temples of Ujjain are Harsidhhi (Durga Temple), Chintaman Ganesh, Gadh Kalika, Kaal Bhairav and Magalnath. Since Ujjain is an ancient city, there are many monuments that have survived from the ancient period.
The most spectacular monument is the Kalideh Palace on the outskirts of the Ujjain city. It is a fine example of ancient Indian architecture. The Bhartuhari Gufa is an ancient cave which has some interesting legends associated with it. The observatory at Ujjain is another remarkable example. It was built Raja Jai Singh of Udaipur and put is one of the five such observatories in India and has many ancient astronomical devices.
The most important religious event at Ujjain is the Simhasta Mela (also called the Kumbh Mela). The Simhasta Mela or the Kumbh Mela is held every twelve years in Ujjain. During the Kumbh Mela millions of devotees assemble at Ujjain to have a holy dip in the holy River Shipra. Another yearly event at Ujjain is the Kartik Mela. The Kartik Mela is a fair organized every year in the Hindu month of Kartik (around December) and attracts thousands of people from the nearby areas.New Items up.

So you don't have the one that was already put together anymore? Why are you selling them? Did you use one of these in your project?
I never had an Intelmatic 7" already put together. And no I never used this one in any of my projects.
The truth is my wife is tired of Carputers. She says they are to much trouble for her. So I went with the Alpine 7" Dvd with Nav and Iphone integration.
Oh ok, that was a Lilliput sorry. Have you tried this in direct sunlight? I see a lot of people with mixed reviews on how readable it is. Just not sure if it's worth the extra cost for me lol.
It is just as good in direct sunlight as the optically bonded transflective Liliput from Mo-Co-So. It doesn't have AG though so you do get some glare. But I have some AG 7" films I can add if you want them.

Just when you thought the L.A. Economic Development Corp. had delivered all the bad news we needed to hear about the local economy, now the Chamber of Commerce is weighing in with yet another buzzkill. A study produced for the chamber by Beacon Economics is predicting that the county's unemployment will top out at 13 percent during the next 18 months. Specifically, we're going to lose about 300,000 more jobs before the economy even starts to get to its knees at the end of 2010.
According to today's L.A. Business Journal, the Beacon report also forecasts that the median price of an L.A. home "will bottom out at $234,000 in late 2010." Meanwhile, the Daily Breeze reports that LAX has fallen from being the world's third busiest airport to No. 6 -- behind Paris' Charles de Gaulle. The paper's sources cite the economy (naturally), but also the fact that several small air companies, such as Aer Lingus and Air India, pulled out last year. Is it something we said, or is it because LAX doesn't serve as a hub airport for any airlines?Hi!
Previously, I was making a new website called "justgadgetstuff.wordpress.com" I paid wordpress.com and registered a new domain, "Gadgetaroma.com". The gadgetaroma.com was basically opening the contents of justgadgetstuff.wordpress.com. From that, I was getting a little annoyed because the image address of the pictures was always "justgadgetstuff.wordpress.com/04/08.....", which just never looked nice and felt to the other users as if I was taking images from some other site.
Today, I deleted the justgadgetstuff.wordpress.com and now, I cannot open gadgetaroma.com!
Thankfully, i had backed up(exported) the contents of the justgadgetstuff.wordpress.com and thus can get gadgetaroma.com back to track once I can see the interface
Someone help me! I paid $15 for gadgetaroma.com and I deleted justgadgetstuff.com and now unable to open gadgetaroma.com

There’s no magic handgun (semi-auto or revolver) that will work for everyone in every situation. We all have different requirements, objectives, limitations and overall criteria for selecting a specific model of gun.
In order to find out what matters most to you, I recommend you start by reading our guide to concealed carry handguns, then after defining your requirements, review these specific models as a start to your research.
The guns listed below were chosen based on reliability, price, availability of accessories and the specific models ability to fill a role or meet a defined objective.
Please remember that no gun, no matter how good, will make up for a lack of training. You need to train frequently if you want to be proficient with your firearm.
Ruger LCP with Crimson Trace Laserguard
The Ruger LCP is one of the most widely popular small semi-automatic .380s on the market. It’s extremely reliable and comes in at a lower price point than many of the other “pocket” .380s. The capacity is limited to 6+1, so I recommend you purchase a couple of Ruger 7+1 extended magazines. The LCP is offered both with and without the Crimson Trace Lasergrips.
SCCY CPX-2 with ArmaLaser TR10 laser sight
If you’re looking for a small frame semi-automatic but still want a gun chambered in 9mm, check out the SCCY CPX-2. This little DAO pistol has a capacity of 10+1 and leaves you with plenty of money left to purchase a holster and laser. They also offer a version with a manual thumb safety (CPX-1).
GLOCK G19 Gen4 9mm
The Glock G19 Gen4 shares many similarities with the extremely popular Glock G17 but in a slightly smaller package. The G19 is chambered in 9mm, provides 15+1 capacity and features a 4” barrel. The gun also includes a modular back strap design, allowing it to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The G19 features the standard Glock accessory rail, allowing the addition of a numerous rail mounted laser or lights.
Smith & Wesson Model 642 Revolver
For those looking for a concealed carry revolver, you need not look any further than the S&W Model 642. This J-Frame is one of the most popular revolvers currently in production. Chambered in .38 Special, the 642 has a 5 round capacity and weighs in at 15 oz, unloaded. Since you’ll be limited to 5 rounds, I recommend you invest in a speed loader or speed strip. With practice, this will provide reload speeds that revival a semi-auto.
Springfield Armory XD-s Bi-Tone 45 ACP
Looking for a smaller .45 ACP for concealed carry? The XD-S might just fit the bill. The Springfield Armory XD-S 45 is a slim profile semi-automatic pistol chambered in the powerful .45 ACP. It comes with two interchangeable backstraps, allowing shooters of varying hand sizes to get the perfect grip. The XD-S also features a bright red fiber optic front sight which aids in target acquisition.
Smith & Wesson Model 351 Revolver
Similar to the 642, the S&W Model 351 is a J-Frame revolver. Only this revolver comes chambered in .22 Magnum and offers a 7 round capacity in a slightly lighter package. While I normally recommend a larger caliber for defensive purposes (.380 ACP and above), some individuals have physical limitations and are unable to handle larger calibers. For these individuals, the Model 351 is a good compromise.

Of all the free agents remaining, only three pitchers logged more than 100 innings last year. Here's the latest on all eight starters to pitch as many as 40 innings last year (or what Roy Halladay logs in an average month):
- Braden Looper, 194.2 IP – The Dodgers are interested on a minor league deal and the D'Backs aren't likely to pursue him, despite Brandon Webb's questionable status for Opening Day.
- Jarrod Washburn, 176 IP – The Twins and Mariners seemed to lead the way for Washburn early on, but the Scott Boras client said yesterday that he doesn't expect to return to Seattle. The D'Backs don't appear likely to pursue Washburn and we haven't seen the Orioles connected to him for a month.
- Mike Hampton, 112 IP - He will miss the 2010 season after undergoing rotator cuff surgery.
- John Smoltz, 78 IP – Smoltz hasn't ruled out the Braves, but the Cardinals don't appear to have the money to sign him and the Nationals haven't spoken to him recently. Jon Heyman of SI.com says Smoltz is content to wait for the right deal, which may mean a mid-season signing.
- Bartolo Colon, 62.1 IP - The former Cy Young Award winner wants to pitch, but wasn't publicly linked to any teams this winter.
- Sidney Ponson, 58.2 IP - There has been no reported interest in Ponson this winter.
- Adam Eaton, 49 IP - There has not been interest in Eaton, either.
- Pedro Martinez 44.2 IP – The Phillies have been linked to Pedro throughout the offseason. Pedro may wait to sign in-season, as he did last year.Spanish F1 Grand Prix – Qualifying

What do men want?
That’s a question nobody’s asking, least of all anyone in the Obama campaign. Unless you’re a gay man, or a male union member with a picket sign, Obama’s got nothing for you.
In an administration and campaign built on pandering to a disparate collection of narrow constituencies, men just don’t elicit much attention.
For the environmentalists there’s been green energy boondoggles and opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline.
For the radical feminists and secularists, there’s been Obamacare and the HHS contraceptive mandate.
For the race-baiters, there’s been the Department of Justice’s jihad against voter ID laws, particularly in Texas and South Carolina.
For Hispanics, there’s the promise of immigration amnesty, partially fulfilled last week with its promise to grant amnesty to younger illegal immigrants.
For college students, there have been promises of a free education.
But for ordinary, God-fearing, America-loving men who don’t have mountains of student loan debt, Obama’s got nothing. This is a group he can expect to lose in November.
Obama won female voters by 13 points in 2008. He edged John McCain among men by just one point.
After the Wisconsin recall election, a Rasmussen poll showed men disapprove of Obama’s job performance by 22 points, while women approve by seven points.
The latest WSJ/NBC poll has Obama’s approval/disapproval among men at 44/50. It also showed Obama losing to Romney among men, 49% to 40 percent. POLITICO’s battleground poll of key swing states gives Romney a statistically significant 7-point lead among men.
More than one pundit has dubbed Obama America’s first female president. After all, Obama beat the first serious female presidential candidate in history then defeated a ticket that included only the second female vice presidential candidate.
Obama is clearly more comfortable around the fairer sex. “I like hangin’ out with women. What can I tell you?” Obama said in May as he greeted the women of The View—his fourth appearance on the show.
Later that day at Barnard College, an elite women’s school, he said, “Congress would get a lot more done” if more women were there. He predicted that women are “poised to make this the century where women shape not only their own destiny but the destiny of this nation and of this world.”
Since finally acknowledging his support for same-sex marriage, Obama has gotten the unequivocal support of the gay rights lobby, including millions in campaign contributions. He’s even got “Obama Boy,” a man who’s made an online video telling of his crush on Obama, his “rainbow colored knight.”
None of this will help the president with straight men, however.
There have just been too many fancy events with Hollywood celebrities and deep-pocketed gay and lesbian activists.
There has been too much bowing to foreign kings and too much fruitless “outreach” to foreign dictators.
And there’s been too much self-congratulation on the few things he’s gotten right, such as the bin Laden assassination.
Serving and former U.S. Navy SEALs criticized Obama for taking so much credit for the killing and exploiting it for his re-election campaign.
“The decision was a no brainer,” Ryan Zinke, a former Commander in the U.S. Navy who spent 23 years as a SEAL and led a SEAL Team 6 assault unit, told the U.K.’s Daily Mail. “He is justified in saying it was his decision but the preparation, the sacrifice – it was a broader team effort.”
A serving SEAL Team member said: “Obama wasn’t in the field, at risk, carrying a gun. As president, at every turn he should be thanking the guys who put their lives on the line to do this. ..But the more he tries to take the credit for it, the more the ground operators are saying, ‘Come on, man!’ It really didn’t matter who was president. At the end of the day, they were going to go.”
What do men want? They want fiscal responsibility. They want decisive leadership. They want foreign policy resolve. Most of all, they want jobs. According to one poll, one in four men think the economy is improving. The rest know it’s not.
The unemployment rate among men is higher than among women. It’s well into double digits for Hispanic and black men. The biggest jump in joblessness in May occurred among black men, who saw their unemployment rate soar to 14.2 percent.
First there was the “man-cession,” in which men lost more jobs than women. Then there was the “she-covery,” in which many of the jobs that did come back went to women. Men have been emasculated in the age of Obama.
Men are less likely to graduate from college than women, less likely to vote, and some studies even show that men earn less money than women for equal work in certain professions. And it’s all happening on Obama’s watch.
What do men want? Here’s a better question is: What don’t men want?
The answer: shameless pandering, empty gestures or four more years of Barack Obama.

Valverde grabs Gold with final flourish
Gustavo César (Xacobeo Galacia) throws his hands up as he crosses the line
Gustavo César of Xacobeo-Galicia joined an escape group after just three kilometres and stayed away to the very end. The Spaniard gave his nation its first stage win of this year's Vuelta a Espana, in the second mountain stage of the race. Alejandro Valverde (Caisse d'Epargne) sprinted out of the chasing group of favourites to take third place on the stage, 40 seconds behind the winner. Marco Manzano of Lampre finished second, 21 seconds down.
Valverde's final sprint was also enough to give him the bonus seconds necessary to pass Cadel Evans (Silence-Lotto) for the overall lead. He is now seven seconds ahead of Evans, with Rabobank's Robert Gesink in third, 36 seconds behind the leader.
César was part of an escape group which formed only three kilometres into the stage. For most of the day it looked like the group would stay away to the end, but the final climb ripped both the escape group and the chasers to shreds. César and Manzano were the only members of the early break who managed to stay away at the end, with Davide De La Fuente (Fuji-Servetto) finishing with the top favourites.
There appeared to be some controversy at the end. De La Fuente looked to be a lock-in for third, but seemed to wait and allow his countryman Valverde to take third – and those necessary bonus seconds. Shortly before Valverde sprinted out of the chase group, Gesink moved close to Evans, with the Australian appearing to argue afterwards that he was pushed into the barriers and hindered. Some reports say that Evans retaliated with a headbutt to the young Dutchman.
Ivan Basso of Liquigas was also in that group, losing no time today. Tom Danielson (Garmin-Slipstream), Damiano Cunego (Lampre) and Ezequiel Mosquera (Euskaltel) all finished about half a minute behind the Valverde group, with Fränk Schleck (Saxo Bank) and Samuel Sanchez (Euskaltel-Euskadi) coming in about 17 seconds later.
"I'm very happy," Valverde said after the stage. He was pleased both to have taken over the lead and to be heading into his homeland of Murcia tomorrow in the gold jersey.
He decided to attack in the finale because “tensions were high” and his teammate Vasili Kiryienka reported that “some of the favourites were having difficulties.” With that in mind he sprinted out of the group to take third place, the bonus seconds and the lead. “I did not get the gold jersey by chance, we knew I could get it.”
Cesar called his first Vuelta stage win the most important of his nine-year career. “This is very big.” His experience played a big role in the success, he noted.
The 29-year-old had a bad start to the season with a serious crash, but noted, “The crashes are part of the job, and the bad times pass. When times are good, then they are even better.”
Cesar didn't want to rest on his laurels, though. “The team's goals are not yet 100 percent met, because we still have to fight for Ezequiel Mosquera in the overall ranking.”
How it unfolded
Perhaps the riders were afraid of another mountain stage in the high heat, as the day's break group formed almost immediately. The first riders got off after only three km, and by km 32 it had stabilised itself into a seven-man group. Stijn Devolder (Quick Step), Marco Mazano (Lampre-NGC), David de la Fuente (Fuji-Servetto), Rein Taaramae (Cofidis), Julian Sanchez (Contentpolis-Ampo), Gustavo César (Xacobeo Galacia) and Javier Ramirez (Andalucia Cajasur) built up a lead of just over seven minutes.
It was the first time in this year's Vuelta that Dutch Pro Continental team Vacansoleil had not been represented in an escape group.
Along the way, Carlos Barredo (Quick Step), Laurent Lefevre (Bbox Bouygues Telecom), Allan Davis (Quick Step) and Mikel Gaztanaga Echeverria (Euskaltel) all abandoned the race. The two Quick Step riders were cut down by intestinal problems.
De La Fuente chased mountain ranking points, looking to take the jersey away from David Moncoutié (Cofidis). The Fuji-Servetto rider may have had zero points going into the day, but diligently gathered them at every climb.
Once again, the favourites' teams were willing to let the escapees go. De La Fuente was the best placed of the bunch, and at 13:31 down, he was not a real threat to leader Cadel Evans. Evans' Silence-Lotto team kept an eye on things and led the peloton over the climber's course, which featured barely an inch of flat riding.
In fact, Silence-Lotto could hardly have picked up a better escape group. The seven riders presented no threat to the lead, enabling the Belgian team to take it a little easier on the mountainous stage.
As they all neared the final climb, it looked for a moment as if the peloton was going to pick up its speed and give serious chase. Rabobank and Liquigas gave signs of moving in to help with the lead work, but apparently everyone decided to give themselves a break today.
However, the peloton was luring specators into a false sense of security. As the final climb got serious so did the bunch. Within six km to go, the lead group had fallen apart and the gap shrunk to under two minutes. Caisse d'Epargne led the chase up the brutal final climb.
Taaramae (Cofidis) managed to get away from his companions, finally dropping De La Fuente as all the riders suffered on the 17 to 20 percent gradient of the Alto de Xorret de Cati.
Things weren't helped at all by the team and race cars which had to pull over to the side of the road to let the chasing peloton through. Although, there was barely room as riders rode in single file, weaving their way through.
Evans, Valverde, and Basso stayed in the lead and made their way up the killer climb, catching and passing the remnants of the breakaway. Behind them a few others made their own way up to the tailcoats of the day's early leaders, including Garmin's Tom Danielson and Rabobank's Robert Gesink.
With 3.5 km to go, César and Manzano made their way up to past Taamarae, who by this point was practically standing still after his own day long effort. The Xacobeo rider took off for the final mountain points and kept on alone. Behind him, Manzano was being followed by the three favourites.
Valverde kept up the pressure on his Australian rival, trying his best to get away from the race leader. He fired attack after attack, but was unable to shake Evans.
The final mountain ranking was followed by a short descent, with all the riders going all out on the steep run towards the line. Gesink was able to bridge across and joined Valverde, Evans and Basso in the final bolt for the line.
César went into the final km with a narrow advantage, but it was enough to give him his first ever Vuelta stage win and the first of this year's race by a Spaniard.

Gab Darby is filled with nobility in a future age when nobility has no value. At least none that's officially recognized.
That national deficiency doesn't matter while Darby reigns as a superstar in the Disneyfied America that exists thirty-five years from today. But he tumbles after the president accuses him of treason. The president is lying. Still, Darby must flee for survival. He is tagged by surveillance cams, cornered by a thug lawyer, rescued by his housekeeper, and finally smuggled to a jungle country called Bortinca.
The new country offers a second chance for the fallen idol. But Bortinca is at war with America. Therefore Darby must fight against his former homeland as he strives to reclaim his self-worth. To succeed, he must discover that honor and nobility are personal traits, not just titles attached to celebrity in the United States.
Ad Man in the Games of 2046 is social commentary that shows a future America that has stripped cultural institutions of any high purpose or meaning. Working class people speak a crude dialect that segregates them from the ruling elite. America’s unionized military engages in eco-colonialism. Driving is outlawed, but roads remain crowded.
Within that degenerate world, the novel shows how one person’s fundamental humanity asserts itself above tyrants who would enslave him.
As a school psychologist, Daniel Hectorman has lost all faith and confidence that meddling therapists like himself really help anyone at all.
That's too bad, because Hectorman could use some counseling of his own. His marriage is starved. His job is imperiled. His parents are deep in decline, with his mom shrunk by Alzheimer’s and his father enraged and suicidal. Even Hectorman's doting secretary, Mrs. Tweed, has gone batty.
Then there's this kid. Trevor Winkle is a fourteen-year-old sharpie foisted on Hectorman by a vampy old flame who insists that the boy is his son. Hectorman knows he is not.
But the boy is redeeming. Clever, industrious, unselfish and oddly sedate, he could open a path for Hectorman, if only the psychologist didn't reject Trevor so relentlessly.
Humorous and insightful, The Dropout is a novel about repairing human connections. As characters collide and careen, Daniel Hectorman must recognize that to end his travails he must embrace people he once strenuously neglected. That can begin as casually as conversation over one good meal.Let's see what Kris has to say then
Picture: Kris Jenner - The 40th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards sponsored by CIROC Vodka held at The Beverly Hilton Hotel - Show - Beverly Hills, California,...
Everyone else has had their say on Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s new baby girl – mostly ‘she’s fine etc’ – so now kris jenner is telling everyone about her. She’s fine, is the jist of it. But let’s hear it from Kris.
"Everyone's doing really well at home," Jenner said "The baby's doing great and happy and healthy and it's a really joyful time." See? But it wasn’t long before Jenner started talking about her own life. "I'm giving birth to something July 15," she joked, referencing the series premiere. "It's more of a lifestyle show: health, fitness, fashion, food and pop culture. . . I'm so looking forward to it." Kanye’s been talking to, and as much as he probably doesn’t want to be part of the reality TV world, by proxy to the mother of his first child, he is. “Nobody can tell my girl what to do,” he said of Kim. “She just needed to be given some platforms of information to work from.”
He is, of course, talking about her fashion sense and not her decision to have a baby. Kanye’s been a busy boy. His new album Yeezus, which features the appropriately titles single ‘I Am God’ has been received very well by the critics, with most outlets praising his outspoken, brave approach to rap. This is all well and good, until Jay Z comes out with his new record, Magna Carta Holy Grail.

Prince
was a first-team All-Freshman choice after hitting .401/.492/.618 for
the Cougars in the spring, and he kept up his strong year by hitting
.308 in the WCCBL, good for eighth in the league. Prince wore down a
bit as the season went along due to his combined hitting and pitching
duties, but he still maintained a line-drive approach and above-average
arm. He throws in the upper 80s off the mound, but his speed and bat
help profile him as a potential center or right fielder down the line.
2. Darin Holcomb, 3b, Spokane (Gonzaga)
Managers
loved Holcomb’s bat speed, work ethic and approach at the plate. Short
(listed at 6 feet) and strong (205 pounds), Holcomb was the league’s
top power threat, his six homers doubling his closest competitors’
totals. Defensively, his glove and arm are solid average and he has a
feel for third base.
3. Joey Wong, 2b, Bend (Oregon State)
An
incoming freshman at Oregon State after a standout career at Sprague
High in Salem, Ore., Wong has the footwork and hands to handle either
side of the bag, though he profiles better on the right side. He has a
compact lefthanded swing that helps him make consistent contact, as he
hit .310 and struck out just 12 times in 116 at-bats. He’s an average
runner but doesn’t figure to be a star.
4. Marc Rzepczynski, lhp, Aloha (UC Riverside)
Undrafted
as a college junior, Rzepczynski was one of the league’s most polished
pitchers. His high-80s fastball had some life to it and he showed an
ability to change speeds effectively. He still averaged 4.5 walks/9 IP,
so he must hone his command to have a strong senior season.
5. Eric Sogard, 3b, Bend (Arizona State)
The
league’s batting champion, Sogard impressed managers with his savvy and
steady offensive ability. His bat is his best tool, though he was
consistent at third base this summer. At 5-foot-9, he profiles more as
a utility player or second baseman than at third.
6. D.J. Lidyard, rhp, Wenatchee (Oregon State)
Perhaps
the most dominant pitcher in the league, Lidyard led the WCCBL with 86
strikeouts in 66 innings, thanks to a high-80s fastball and
above-average curveball that was a consistent put-away pitch. He isn’t
afraid to challenge hitters or work inside. After not signing with the
Brewers as a 43rd-round pick, he’s transferring from Lower Columbia
(Wash.) CC to Oregon State, where he’ll compete for a rotation spot.
7. Jorge Reyes, rhp, Moses Lake (Oregon State)
Another
Oregon State signee (From Warden High in Washington) who like Wong got
a taste of college ball, Reyes pitched just 12 innings this summer. In
that time, he showed a loose arm with a lean, lanky body and a
projectable fastball in the 88-91 mph range.
8. Danny Cox, ss, Bend (Washington)
Cox
has good range at shortstop, particularly to his left, and an average
arm that should allow him to stay in the middle of the diamond. Cox hit
just .235 and has to get stronger to be a factor offensively.
9. James Wallace, rhp, Aloha (College of Southern Idaho)
The
Marlins drafted Wallace as a draft-and-follow and hope to see him grow
into his 6-foot-2, 190-pound frame. His upper-80s fastball and
curveball, which he changes speeds on effectively, helped him strike
out 34 in 33 innings in a middle relief role for the Knights. Managers
liked his competitiveness, particularly in that setup capacity.
10. Kyle Paul, c, Kelowna (Missouri State)
A
Canadian who played junior college ball in Texas, Paul is transferring
to Missouri State for his junior season. He showed good strength and
tied for second in the league with three home runs. Drafted in the 41st
round by the Indians, Paul has average arm strength if not a tick above
and should be a solid catch-and-throw catcher down the line with more
polish to his receiving skills.It’s getting hard to keep track of all the various trade negotiations going on right now.
As this blog’s readers may recall, in his State of the Union speech, President Obama announced that the United States would begin trade negotiations with the EU. And no doubt you know that the United States, Canada, and Mexico are part of NAFTA.
But less prominently, the United States, Canada, and Mexico are also part of trade talks among various nations in the Pacific region, called the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). And now Japan has announced that it would like to join these talks.
In addition, Canada and the EU have been negotiating their own trade agreement for several years now.
And just the other day, Japan and the EU started trade talks.
Oh, and Mexico has suggested a broader NAFTA-EU trade deal.
Got all that? It’s OK if you don’t—I’m not sure I do either.
There are some good reasons to use international trade agreements to promote free trade. The world trading system has been very successful in bringing down tariffs and other protectionist barriers over the past few decades. But the recent proliferation of agreements, with sometimes conflicting rules (going beyond just protectionism), may be steering us away from real free trade. Real free trade would lower trade barriers for all countries, not just for some. Hopefully some day trade negotiations can get back to that principle.MSA 2 will contain 3 stack levels addressing low - mid - high device segment, corresponding to JTWI - MSA sub - Full MSA today.
The low segment excludes graphics and adds sensor api since JSR 248. Mid range focuses on TV broadcast, contactless api, UI customization and XML. High end focuses on IMS with JSR 281.
Some jsrs in MSA 2 are "conditionally mandatory" depending on HW support.
Notably, Nokia, as the co-spec lead still hasn't released a full MSA device. The only vendor that has done that is Sony Ericsson with 14 devices.
There are several new players in the expert group, e.g. Ericsson and TeliaSonera.
MIDP 3 will be included in MSA 2 if released on time. The target schedule is to be finalized in Q4 2008. Just a little bit optimistic, if you ask me, since the same applies to MIDP 3.Attachment: 2013-05-23_041741_othermethod.zip
Hi
I've uploaded the files and the contents doesn't load - as before.
I've added my own connection parameters.
This is what I uploaded.
FYI, our username and database name is XXXXX XXXXX
I doubt the error is the connection parameters.
No I cannot.
Is there a simpler way of doing this?
A basic level but maybe more code?
If not, that's ok.
Here's the error:
var validPostCodes = ['2747','2750','2753','2760','2777'];Unknown column 'ls.postcode' in 'field list'At the bottom of the file:
Thanks do that - our instructor has changed the requirements a few times including the column names in the database.
So i sent you the old one.
It is postcodeID .
Please note:
in the local_schools table
it is postcodeID
in the valid_postcodes table
it is postcode
Thanks!
new
Hi you didn't send the new file - cause I don't see any comments as per above.
But I did manage to change mine - this doesn't give any errors now - contents is displayed.
Note - in the png file - 'name' in school_info has also changed to 'Name'
But the select box doesn't come up with anything - once a valid postcode is in.
So now it's a matter of getting the database tables to work together as per the new png file i sent to give me a list of schools.
First, try this one:
If that one doesn't work, try this one:
See, you have to join onto the valid_postcodes table. That is an absolute must.
This is actually a ridiculously simple and basic development task. What is making it so difficult is not seeing the actual table schemas. If I could see those, I would have had this code to you in 10 minutes with no issues.
Please remember to check/reload this form more often. I sent these two files over 30 minutes ago. Again, joining with valid_postcodes is absolutely necessary.
ok but in your query
$schoolQuery = $db->prepare("SELECT DISTINCT s.schoolID, s.Name, vp.postcode " . "FROM school_info s " . "JOIN local_schools ls " . "ON s.schoolID = ls.schoolID " . "JOIN valid_postcode vp " . "ON ls.postcodeID = vp.postcodeID " . "ORDER BY s.Name") or die ($db->error);
Didn't work because vp.postcodeID is meant to be vp.postcode
and valid_postcode is meant to be valid_postcodes
So i changed it to this:
$schoolQuery = $db->prepare("SELECT DISTINCT s.schoolID, s.Name, vp.postcode " . "FROM school_info s " . "JOIN local_schools ls " . "ON s.schoolID = ls.schoolID " . "JOIN valid_postcodes vp " . "ON ls.postcodeID = vp.postcode " . "ORDER BY s.Name") or die ($db->error);
And the page loads, but drop box doesn't work.
This is annoying. :)
Great the selection box works!
Except - not sure if there should be that many schools listed for the one postcode.
Here are the database records for each table.
Test it out!
I tried all the postcodes
2777 - i get 6 schools
and I just noticed 3 are primary schools and 3 are high schools.
So the school_type also needs to be taken into consideration.
All the ones marked 'P' in the table.
Because this needs to be all primary schools only.
Hi yes.
It's all working now.

Now I do understand that racism is not truly dead, just a little more hidden in some cases then previous years. Well after watching this news clip I was truly disgusted in what I was seeing. A father of 3 beautiful daughters and married for over 10 years was accused of primarily kidnapping because the situation looked odd. Check out the video below and see for your self!
Father is Harassed because he has mixed children:
This is truly a sad situation on what happened. Now true enough it was just a security guy, but I am sure this is quite an inconvenience for the couple especially since they have been together for 10 years and have 3 kids together. This could really be something to watch out for and Walmart should really do what they can do to make this situation go away!"My Light Has Gone" is an animated short written and directed by Jason Kummerfeldt. The film will air as part of the 2014 edition of "Fine Cut," KCET's 17th annual festival of student films.
Here, we speak with Jason about how his dreams inspired the concept behind his film.
Jason Kummerfeldt's Bio:
Jason Kummerfeldt was born and raised in Novato, Calif. and ever since he saw "Star Wars" at the young age of four, he knew his passion was telling stories. As he grew up, he experimented in the world of animation and visual effects as a way of unlocking further means to tell a story. Today, Jason resides in Los Angeles and works in Hollywood as a visual effects producer.
Q&A with Jason Kummerfeldt:
Describe how the idea for this film originated.
The idea for this film came from a dream I had a couple years ago. The dream was significantly different, but many symbols and concepts are utilized in the film. I guess I'm more imaginative in my sleep than when I'm awake.
How/When did you decide you wanted to be a filmmaker?
I decided I wanted to be a filmmaker when I first saw "Star Wars" and fell in love with the wonder of storytelling.
What influences have inspired your work?
I think I draw influence from a lot of the paintings and work of some of my favorite artists like Francis Bacon, Jesse Peper, Peter Milton, and Andrew Baines.
Name you top three favorite films.
My top three favorite films are probably "The Prestige," "500 Days of Summer," and "Cinema Paradiso."
What is next for you?
I'm currently writing a feature film so I'd imagine developing that into production will be my next thing.
How can we follow you?

Cabot reached an agreement with state regulators to establish a 44.1 million fund for 19 families whose wells are contaminated. Fiorentino said she will accept the escrow payments while she seeks additional damages in court. Cabot did not accept blame for the contamination in the settlement.
The Environmental Protection Agency is providing fresh water to four families in Dimock, and will test the water in 60 homes to see if residents have been exposed to hazardous substances.
The lawsuit is one of at least 23 lawsuits filed against various drilling companies, including Southwestern Energy Co., and Chesapeake Energy Corp., that allege fracking, which entails blasting chemical laced water into shale formations in the earth to free natural gas deposits, is inherently dangerous and causes, among other problems, pockets of methane to migrate into well water aquifers.
The Dimock case is set to be heard in court in April.DistributionRead full entry

Do you remember a hand-held non-electronic game that contained fifteen movable tiles and sixteen squares? By moving the tiles correctly you could reconstitute a series of numbers. Slide_puzzle is similar but even more challenging. First you load an image, a graphics file such as a jpg file. I didn’t have one readily available so I opened Firefox went to google images and downloaded into the /home/dsl directory the first crayfish image that Google offered me. Then I loaded it into the game which chopped it into little pieces to be reassembled. Left-click on a tile to slide it into the adjacent empty space. Right-click to see the original image. If you are really good you won’t have to take a peek at the original image. It helps if you selected an image that’s easy to reconstitute. I don’t recommend crayfish.

Solitaire is the good-old Klondike solitaire card game. While testing it for this article I won twice in a row and even came close the third time. This is the solitaire that I fondly remember as a kid. Watch out, it’s moderately addictive.
Taipei is a very addictive game in which you try to remove pairs of corresponding tiles. Of course whenever one tile is covered by another tile you must first remove the covering tile. To find out if a tile may be removed right-click on it. If it changes colors it may be removed by clicking on its available partner. The partner tile is usually a copy (9 and 9, Heart and Heart) but any of the direction tiles may be paired with any other direction tile, and any color tile may be paired with any color tile.) The numbers in the lower left hand corner of the screen indicate how many tiles remain and how many tiles are presently removable. In one game I started with 144 and 12. By judiciously removing two tiles I went to 142 and 15. I lost that game, like I lose most of the time. If the rules sound a bit complicated, they are. But you can learn by playing. And you can always press the Backspace key to undo your latest tile removal. The last time I played I was blocked, pressed the Backspace key, and went on to win. Some would say beginner’s luck. The instructions claim that every game can be won. I don’t believe it.
Taiedit lets you modify the game of Taipei. Good luck, this application looks moderately sophisticated.
Thornq is yet another solitaire card game. For more information about this game access their website at .
You may not believe me, but I won this game without knowing how to play it. Beginner’s luck. The point is that Damn Small Linux offers a wide variety of solitaire card games. The final game offered with the system is xtris, a version of Tetris, a game in which you arrange falling blocks. This version offers a few controls including the possibility of playing several games at once. One at a time is more than enough for me.LIGHTNING RETURNS: A Much Anticipated Guided Tour
Final Fantasy XIII has a bit of a hole to dig itself out of, and Lightning Returns is its last ditch effort to close this chapter of Square Enix’s mighty franchise on a good note. The good news is that, from everything we've been shown, it appears to be headed in the right direction, and Square Enix’s latest guided tour trailer just sweetens the pot. Lightning Returns takes X-2’s costume based class system (called garbs here) and ups the customization. Once a garb is chosen (you can pick up to 3 at a time to swap out on the fly, with each giving you different stats and abilities) you can then customize the color scheme on multiple parts of the outfit (similar to Soul Calibur's system, just not as extensive), and that doesn't even count your interchangeable shields and swords, which all have varying stats as well.
In some franchises, having direct control of your protagonist is not such a novel feature, but a good portion of the trailer shows just how much the control has evolved since the initial title in the trilogy. Your previous options were limited to jumping when the game told you to as well as only moving forward and back for the first 40 hours of the game. As long as the control is more precise than FF XIII-2 , consider that a major plus, as that game suffered from some awkward and loose controls, and for the accuracy needed in this title, that cannot be the case here. For naysayers of the turn based combat in previous games, you will be much happier this time around, as every action requires a direct button press, and the temp is much quicker. Elsewhere in the trailer we see most of the cast from the previous games making a return, including Chocolina. While not my favorite character, it is entertaining to see her interact with the very no nonsense Lightning.
For those looking for something different that includes the gorgeous aesthetics of Final Fantasy, Lightning Returns might just be up their alley. Peep the full trailer below for more details, and catch some screens from the game in the gallery above.01_20@ DTSTAMP:20150522T100530Z CATEGORIES:STAGE CONTACT:Robin Axness DESCRIPTION:

Trackback 2Ed Harris: Casting and reloading the .38/.357
Thursday, November 10, 2011 Filed in: Reloading, Ammunition
(Editor's Note: for those who don't know him, C.E. 'Ed' Harris is an engineer who's worked for Ruger and the NRA. Ed is one of the great repositories of technical shooting knowledge in the field; his expertise extends to all areas of shooting, and trust me when I tell you that he can't be stumped. I've tried. Ed has forwarded several articles to publish, and I'm going to start with one of particular interest to me. Look for Ed's articles on Fridays, alternating with the Friday Surprise.)
Today's article is about casting and reloading the .38 Special and .357 Magnum cartridges. Ed has a particular interest in bullet casting and reloading, and this is his primer on the equipment and techniques needed to cast and reload bullets for these great cartridges. He’s stuffed a ton of information into this article, so read carefully! new to bullet casting. I want more production capacity than my single-station press. Please recommend a progressive reloading package for the 38/357 which to include casting equipment & mould. I would appreciate suggestions as to cheap sources for components to load in large quantity.
A: If you intend to cast your own bullets, do not use the same casting pot to render your dirty, gleaned scrap lead into ingots. Instead, get a propane fired turkey cooker or plumber’s burner with round-bottomed, cast iron pot which will hold about 50 pounds or more of melted alloy at a time.
Buy no fewer than six ingot molds; ten are better. Use the propane pot outdoors to render your scrap lead alloy into ingots. Wear coveralls with long sleeves, a floppy hat, gloves and full face shield when you do this!
Automobile wheel weights or indoor range backstop scrap work fine for revolver bullet alloy. Range scrap is more troublesome to deal with, but the jacket material you skim off, after you pull out any steel with a “cow magnet,” is worth more than enough to a scrap dealer to pay for the propane it takes to melt it. With luck you may have a little extra to trade for roll-ends of tin bearing solder, wheel weights, type metal etc.
While many experienced casters prefer to use a dipper, most people find a bottom-pour pot easier to learn with. I use an RCBS 20-lb. bottom pour pot with a pair of molds and handles, alternating between them, by setting each one down after it is filled. It will solidify while I open, dump and refill the other. This provides a consistent mold temperature, necessary to get good castings.
I cast outdoors on a covered, screened in porch to ensure good ventilation, and use an electric hotplate to preheat the molds. This is important, especially in winter. Placing a layer of plain crushed clay kitty litter over the melt helps maintain heat and reduces the need for frequent fluxing.
A pair of double-cavity RCBS or Saeco molds present the best value. Or buy a pair of LBT or Saeco 4-cavity blocks if you want higher production.
For general use in the .38 / .357 lever-actions and revolvers, the Cowboy style rounded flat-nose designs work well if you get a bullet with meplat not less than 1/2 of bullet diameter for hunting purposes. Suitable designs are the RCBS 38-158CM or Saeco #358.
For hunting use a hollow-point bullet is useful. On the Saeco 4-cavity blocks only the center 2 cavities can be modified for hollow-point, because of the way the sprue plate hinge, handle screws and alignment pins are located. This will produce a pair of solids and a pair of hollow-points with each pour.
With double-cavity Saeco and RCBS blocks both cavities may be modified using the inset bar conversion from
You may like one set of blocks modified for hollow point, and use the other to cast solids. Either way you have hunting and practice bullets, which will feed from the lever-action rifle. SWCs may not.
The best sources I have found for buying powder and primers are either Widener's or Graf & Sons. My shooting buddies and I buy primers by the case of 5000 at a time, and powder in 8-lb. kegs. An 8-lb. keg of Bullseye will load 16,000 rounds of .38 Special at 3.5 grains per pop. An 8-lb. keg of #2400 will load 4000 rounds of .357 Magnum at 14 grains per pop.
Graf will let you combine powder and primers in the same shipment under one hazmat fee for up to a 50-lb. box, which gets you 20,000 small pistol primers, a keg of #2400 for magnum loads and a keg of Bullseye for .38 Specials with nothing left over.
You won't get reliable expansion of cast hollow points from a 2 inch snubby unless bullets are cast soft, 8-10 BHN, such as 1:25 tin/lead alloy, or 50-50 wheelweights and plumber's lead, with no more than 2% tin added in in the form of bar solder - and only if needed to get sharp fill out of the bullets.
You want to cast bullets when the mold blocks are hot enough that bullets fill out sharply. Uniform frosting of well-filled bullets is perfectly OK. This fuzzy surface of dentrite arms look under an SEM (scanning electron microscope) like you’re flying low over a pine forest. The porous surface holds tumble-on lubes better.
You don't need to quench-harden bullets up through .38 Special +P. As-cast wheel weights or common range backstop scrap is about 10-12 BHN, and is fine for standard pressure loads up to about 20,000 psi.
Bullets cast from wheel weights and hot enough to be uniformly frosted, when dropped directly from the mold into water to quench, will precipitation harden to about 24-28BHN and which will stand up to 40,000 psi.
Quench solid-nosed bullets for .357 and .44 magnum loads when necessary to prevent leading, but don’t count on quenched hollow-point bullets expanding at all if you do.
To enhance expansion of properly designed hollow-point bullets from a sturdy, short-barreled revolver, such as the Ruger SP101, you may safely use up to 4.0 grs. of Bullseye with a 158-grain hollow-pointed bullet seated not less than 1.40” overall. This approximates +P velocity, vs. a "standard pressure" charge of 3.5 grains, normally used with cowboy bullets crimped normally, or a double-end wadcutter seated out to 1.20” overall.
For approximating the +P+ in .38 Special brass in the Marlin rifle or revolvers designed for .357 magnum, such as Rugers, L-frame and N-frame S&W, you could use 10 grs. of #2400 with the Saeco or RCBS Cowboy slugs, with WSP or Federal 200 primers, seated and crimped in their normal crimp groove. Do NOT use this load in pre-1974 Colts, Charter Arms, K or J-frame S&Ws unless originally chambered for .357 ammunition, because pressure exceeds industry +P standard by about 15%.
For loading .357 Magnums at supersonic velocities in revolvers or for rifles use an alloy not softer than wheel weights, 12BHN. With plain-based bullets you could load 11-12 grs. of #2400 in .357 brass with a 158-gr. cast bullet, the exact charge to be determined by whether you get unburned powder which may jam revolvers if any gets under the extractor, or leading which impairs accuracy.
Using a plain-based bullet without a gas check, keep revolver velocity subsonic, not over about 1080 f.p.s. The same loads will get from 1200-1400 f.p.s. in the Marlin, versus about 1600-1700 from an 18 inch barel for a "maximum .357 load." Keep charges with plain based cast bullets in the Marlin rifle about 10-15% below maximum to avoid impaired accuracy caused by bore leading.
In my experience 10 grs. of #2400 with WSP or Federal 200 primers is the least you can load in .357 brass and get acceptable ballistic uniformity. At 11-12 grains in .357 brass only, you have a very satisfactory "medium velocity" load, a bit lighter than factory, but still heavier than .38 Special +P+.
I feel that gas checked bullets are an unnecessary expense in revolvers, because the GC diameter is usually insufficient to seal the cylinder throats. They also cost about $30 per thousand and will require that you buy an expensive lubricating and sizing machine to put them on. That money will buy a good supply of primers and powder.
Instead, save your money by using plain based bullets, of moderate hardness, cast from cheap scrap allloy such as wheel weights. Keep velocities under 1100 f.p.s. in revolvers, and below 1400 f.p.s. in the rifles.
If you need a magnum load approximating factory velocity, buy a few hundred 158-gr. jacketed soft point bullets for rifle use and use 14 grs. of #2400, which is about 1/2 grain below maximum as published by Speer No. 13 or later. This will give about 1650 fps in the Marlin. Such loads are apparent by their distinct appearance so there is no guessing whether it is “hot” or not.
If you will use your compact revolver a lot for field shooting, consider a double-end wadcutter such as the Saeco #348 for one of your molds. Then pick a Cowboy style flat-nose for rifle use.
Wadcutters can be used for small game hunting in lever-action rifles as a “two-shooter,” inserting a round directly into the chamber, closing the action, and loading only one round at a time into the magazine tube. Each time you fire a shot and work the lever, you can shove a replacement wadcutter past the loading gate. You cannot fill the magazine tube with .38 Special rounds less than 1.4 inches overall, because two at a time will feed out onto the lifter and jam the gun.
Ideally you want bullets to cast of correct diameter so they do not require sizing. Then you can bulk lube with Lee Liquid Alox and use the money you save by not buying a bullet lubricator and sizer to buy powder and primers.
If you really want a progressive loading tool for loading multiple thousands of rounds, get the Dillon RL550B. However, if your requirements are less than 500 rounds a month, I would use a single-station press. If you have not used a progressive reloading machine before, and do not have an experienced mentor within convenient telephone distance, stay with the single-station press you know well.
For plain based revolver ammo there is no advantage to go any harder than about 13 BHN. Commercially cast bullets such as Meister, Lasercast, etc. are made from a 92Pb-6Sb-2Sn alloy, about 16 BHN, harder than necessary for non-magnum loads. They do so because this common commercial “hardball” or “magnum” alloy is widely available in one-ton heat lots, casts well from the automated Magma Engineering machines, and produces “pretty” bullets for marketing purposes, which are not damaged in shipping.
Hard lube which requires a heated lubricating and sizing machine is used for similar marketing purposes, because it is non-sticky, stays in the grooves, doesn't melt in summer heat and goes through progressive loading machines well. But hard lube is less able coat the bore, and unless bullet fit is perfect, may result in bore leading at standard pressures in the .38 Special. Soft alloys and lubes in moderate loads are more trouble-free for the novice.
Commercial cast bullets often lead more than softer home cast ones because the manufacturers size their product to fit the tightest minimum bore and chamber to prevent function problems. Novices who buy them don't know which size is correct. The old folklore of old Lyman manuals to size bullets to groove diameter is incorrect. Bullets should be sized to fit the ball seat of the rifle chamber or revolver cylinder.
If bullets are too hard, undersized, and inadequately lubricated with a hard lube, they will lead. A very common misconception is that cast bullet loads lead because the alloy is too soft. The opposite is usually the case.
An alloy harder than about 12-13 BHN is not going to expand when cast in a hollow-point bullet. Full .357 loads generating over 1400 fps when fired from a rifle may fragment, but not “mushroom.” My advise is to use straight wheel weights or range backstop scrap. Add 1/2 pound of 50-50 bar solder per 20 lb. potful when needed to get good castings.
Bullets of 12 BHN will not expand in standard pressure .38 Special revolver loads, but will somewhat in +P and do just fine when fired in the rifle or .357 or +P+ ..38 Special revolver loads over 1000 fps.
If you want to get expansion at standard pressures in a revolver cut wheel weight alloy 50-50 with soft plumbers lead, adding the same 1/2 pound of 50-50 solder, only if needed to get good castings. This alloy goes 8-10 BHN, does fine in subsonic rifle loads or up to .38 Special +P with 4 grs. of Bullseye in .38 cases, but you may get some leading after firing a dozen rounds of +P loads. Accuracy is OK for hunting purposes.
Brush the bore when done shooting and leave wet with bore cleaner, then just wipe the bore and chambers with a dry patch before shooting.
If reduced to using (free!) mixed head stamp, range pickup brass, tumble clean it in untreated corncob to remove dirt and grit before sizing. After sizing, do the best you can to sort it into batches of like head stamp sharing the same type face, identifying knurls, etc. Separate plated cases from plain.
Learn to identify and keep separate any cases originating from factory loaded wadcutter match ammo. Treat them as if they were gold! Wadcutter brass is identified by either one, or sometimes two knurls or cannelures at the midpoint of the case's length.
Their purpose is to prevent a wadcutter bullet being dropped into a loose-mouthed, powder charged case, from falling below flush with the case mouth. This maintains proper position until the bulleted, charged case reaches the crimping station.
The loading machines used by the ammunition factories full-length profile the case sidewall to fit gently, but tightly against the shank of the soft-swaged, hollow-based wadcutter bullet. It uniformly but lightly crimps the case mouth to remove any flare, imparting only a slight radius at the case mouth to ease loading into the chambers. Its design intent is to avoid at all cost any damage to the fragile, soft- lead bullet, which would impair accuracy.
This is also the principle of the Lee Factory Crimp Die and is why you should buy the Lee carbide die set to the exclusion of all others. The Lee Factory Crimp die does not depend upon case length to determine strength of crimp. It doesn't care whether case mouths are thin or heavy. Individual rounds are profiled full-length so that none will exceed maximum cartridge dimensions. This prevents tolerance stacking of oversized bullets in thick wall cases, which could cause a bulge that will jam your gun.
Cast bullets may be loaded unsized and simply tumbled in Lee Liquid Alox. If bullet sizing is necessary, this is done by compression inside the die, rather than by shear in an expensive, unnecessary lubricating and sizing machine.
Because wadcutter brass has a thinner case wall, intended to gently handle a soft lead bullet, it is work hardened less in assembly, so it will last longer!
Brass used for +P service loads often has a heavy knurl or cannelure closer to the case mouth, which is used to hold the bullet against the primer blast and maintain heavy bullet pull of a thicker case which provides a tight fits necessary for acceptable ballistic uniformity of slower powders. Such brass has a harder final anneal and is more heavily work hardened in assembly, so it may crack after only a few reloads, especially if it has been nickel plated. When obtained as once-fired brass, use this for your "shoot and let fly" combat practice ammo.
If you intend to buy new brass, get plain, unplated, uncannelured cases, from Starline, Winchester or Remington. Plated brass was once used to reduce corrosion of rounds carried in leather looped cartridge belts. Today it is done mostly for marketing appearance, so that old stock does not take on a patina and "look old."
Plated cases will not last long in repeated reloads as plain brass, but some brands fare better than others. Winchester uncannelured, plated cases last longer than similar Remington. Federal +P and +P+ plated brass also seems OK. Sellier & Bellot seems the worst. Reload only once, use it for shoot & let fly, or save for trade to the scrap dealer.

(American Meat Institute)
In a letter this week to President Obama, 67 freshman Republican members of the House of Representatives affirmed their commitment to the swift passage of three pending free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea.
“We stand ready to work with you to ensure that new opportunities are created for our farmers, manufacturers, service providers and workers by passing the three pending free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea within the next six months,” the representatives wrote.
The House members also praised the administration’s goal of doubling U.S. exports by 2014, but to achieve it, the three free trade agreements must be implemented, they wrote.
“Our three pending agreements have languished, while our partners have aggressively pursued negotiations that exclude the U.S. and put American workers at a competitive disadvantage,” the letter noted. “The time has come to put rhetoric into action.”
To view a copy of the full letter, click here:.
To derive estimates on the impact of full implementation of these three free trade agreements on U.S. exports and job creation, AMI in 2010 worked closely with the National Pork Producers Council, Iowa State University, USDA’s ERS, U.S. Meat Export Federation and the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council to conduct a comprehensive impact analysis.
Results of the impact study found that passage of the Korean, Colombian and Panamanian agreements would represent an additional $2.3 billion in exports and the creation of 29,524 new jobs..
Next week, U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk is set to testify on all three agreements before the Senate Finance Committee and the President’s Export Council will hold a public meeting to discuss topics related to the National Export Initiative and the promotion of U.S. exports, jobs and growth.

If the Western Conference had a motto for the postseason, it would probably be "Out with the old, in with the new."
This year is the time for some fresh blood, not blue blood. Gone are the Red Wings, Blackhawks, Canucks and Sharks of the conference, the four teams that have dominated play in recent seasons and, in the case of the Wings and 'Hawks at least, have had postseason playoff success to talk about, especially throughout their storied Original Six pasts.
Instead, we're guaranteed the West will have a Finals participant that has never hoisted the Stanley Cup. Heck, the last time any of the Blues, Kings, Predators and Coyotes ever even reached the Finals was L.A. back in 1993. That was when this foursome picked up its only collective Finals win as the Kings bowed out to the Canadiens four games to one.
Outside of L.A.'s experience, the only other of the quartet that has even seen the Finals was the Blues, who actually made three straight appearances in the franchise's first three seasons of existence from 1968-1970. They were swept in each of those seasons.
So you see, this is new territory for these teams and the NHL really. The league is looking for one of these upstarts to steal the show, join the elites. Because it's looking like none of these are going anywhere for a while (OK, sorry, maybe Phoenix is both literally and figuratively).
These are the new kids on the block sans Donnie Wahlberg and late 80s beats.The Predators have been looking at space on the street for some time, inching closer and closer to cementing their status as a real threat-to-be, an up-and-comer. The up part is gone, they have now come to the part and, they hope, won't leave soon.
The same can be said for the Kings. They have been seen as a team on the rise for a few years that just hadn't put it together yet. Perhaps you were starting to get the feeling that the hype would never be realized as the Kings fought for their playoff lives. Enter Darryl Sutter and L.A. seems to be realizing its potential, knocking off the Presidents' Trophy-winning Canucks in just five games.
St. Louis went from nobody to somebody overnight. Literally. It was the night Ken Hitchcock was named the new head coach. Since then they, like the Kings, realized their potential. The Blues had long been building a nice group of players that just seemed to be underachieving. Sometimes all it takes is the right coach and/or system.
And Phoenix? Well Dave Tippett receives and will continue to receive credit as one of the absolute best coaches in the business. Every season the expectations are as low as dirt and every season his teams seem to defy them.
It all points to what Gary Bettman has been trumpeting for years now, parity. No, I'm sorry, I have to use the league's language here: competitive balance. The underdogs aren't really underdogs any more. This rag-tag group of news Cup contenders in the West? They aren't underdogs. Just because they don't wear one of the iconic sweaters of the sport doesn't mean they don't belong. This is the new reality in the West, these franchises are ready.
But is that a good thing? Doesn't the NHL need some of the big boys? I mean everybody likes to have the empire, the heavy favorite. Stories are just more compelling with a good vs. evil situation.
I say yes. The powers of the West aren't going to disappear, not yet. Pretty soon one of these four is going to join that power group.
We're guaranteed at least a 50 percent chance of a first-time Cup winner this season. In the East one of the final four (Capitals) has never had the honor either. But that's not a team that is new to this stage, new to the national TV broadcast.
In the meantime, if you enjoy the underdog vibe and seeing fresh faces in the conference semifinals, then the West has a treat for you.

When the Grand Mod. 178 was branded Wendl & Lung, it received the best possible reviews and received the Diapason d'or award. Since then the piano has been improved in many ways and is, as the FEURICH Mod. 178, one of our most popular instruments.
Not only does our blind-fold testing of pianos provide objective reviews by our panel of pianists but it can also be the source of some real finds: this is the case for this Wendl & Lung piano. A family-run Viennese company founded in 1910, Wendl & Lung now has its pianos manufactured in China under the supervision of the 4th generation of Wendl & Lung. Right away, our musicians are taken in by the 178. Prisca Benoit finds it “full of possibilities in all registers, well balanced overall, not too powerful but with a good sound, both luminous and velvety”. It is “ideal for soft playing and allows for much subtlety”. Francois Dumont is equally won over and believes he is playing a Steinway! He praises “the refinement of the sound, its round and generous quality with a clear treble, a beautiful middle and velvety bass.” About the action and keyboard, “its firmness and flexibility allow excellent control of the dynamics.” Like Prisca Benoit, he states that the instrument is “not immediately mastered but requires taming before it reveals its distinctive and noble colors.” Regarding the pedals, they also performed well and the “una corda” provides a clear change in the timbre of pianissimo playing. Much attention to detail in the finish of the piano complete the high quality image of this instrument, which moreover amazes by its modest price tag.
Strong points:
Refined sound
Evenness of registers
Dynamic range
Weaker points:
To uncover the wealth of possibilities of the instrument
requires a high level of skill from the pianist.The Vaclav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent: Balloonsby Stephan Haggard | May 12th, 2013 | 07:00 am
In 2012, the Human Rights Foundation created a new prize with a doubly-great title: the Vaclav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent. Why doubly great? Because we always admired Havel and because the idea of “creative dissent” captures so well the difficult, David vs. Goliath nature of resistance to tyrannical regimes. Asia was strongly represented in the inaugural awards, with prizes going to Chinese artist-cum-dissident Ai Weiwei, Burmese democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi, and Saudi Arabian women’s rights activist Manal al-Sharif.
The 2013 prizes have gone to Syrian cartoonist Ali Ferzat, Cuban civil society group the Ladies in White and North Korean democracy activist Park Sang Hak. New Focus International provides a new profile; our posts on the balloons can be found here. Park has faced trouble on both sides of the DMZ. A recent launch effort was broken up by the police, local residents and governments worry about retaliation by the North—which has threatened it—and Park has survived an assassination attempt. The North is apoplectic about the launches, particularly given the way Park’s organization seeks to dethrone the Kim family; one has a picture of Kim Jong Il drinking a huge glass of no-doubt imported red wine.
In short, the award is a reminder of the great messiness of democracies; hats off to Park.

For many reasons, developers and builders in a construction defect lawsuit want to pick their own counsel to defend them. For instance, they have a good working relationship with the counsel, counsel did well in another case or they want to control the overall defense. Commercial general liability policies generally provide that when an insurer accepts a defense under the policy, the insurer then gets to control the defense and choose counsel. There are exceptions where an insurer defends under certain kinds of reservations, such as under Civil Code Section 2860. How about when the insurer does not reserve such rights? A recent unpublished case reminds us that there may be costs to a developer who insists on using its own counsel and careful consideration should be given early in any case about how to avoid or minimize those costs. Travelers Indemnity Company of Connecticut v. Centex Homes, No. 14-0217 (E.D. Cal. May 15, 2014).
The case involved a residential home builder that required its subcontractors to obtain insurance and name the builder as an “additional insured.” The builder was then sued by homeowners who alleged construction defects existed in their homes. The builder tendered the construction defect action to the Travelers Insurance Company, the insurance company of two subcontractors, as an additional insured under their policies. The facts described in the case are a little unclear but the insurance company agreed to defend the builder as an additional insured. Notably, the case references no reservation of rights of any kind being asserted by Travelers. Travelers then indicated it would assert its right to retain counsel of its choosing to represent and defend the builder in the action. The builder refused to accept that counsel and Travelers asserted in a federal court action that the builder breached the insurance agreements because it “has refused or will refuse” to accept the insurance company’s choice of counsel and “is demanding or will demand independent counsel.” Travelers sued for declaratory relief, breach of contract and equitable relief. The builder, Centex Homes, sought to dismiss the entire complaint. But the builder had already fought the same battle with Travelers and lost—it fared no better before this court.
The court considered whether Travelers had sufficiently alleged that the builder had breached its duty to cooperate under the insurance policies by refusing to accept Traveler’s appointed counsel. Travelers alleged that the developer’s “refusal to acknowledge that [the insurance companies have] the right to control the defense and select counsel, its refusal to accept said counsel, and its insistence that [the insurance companies] continue to pay fees and costs of its personal counsel is a breach of its duty to cooperate under the [insurance policies].” The court cited a prior case between the two same parties in which a different court found that the builder had breached its duty to cooperate by refusing to accept Travelers’ selected counsel and found that Travelers had stated claims for declaratory relief and breach of contract against the builder in this case.
The builder therefore risked losing coverage for a defense by Travelers’. The opinion does not explain whether other carriers had an obligation to pay for the builder’s defense in the action. The builder was able to get the claim for equitable reimbursement dismissed because such a claim is premised on a “defend now seek reimbursement later” theory and the case was still ongoing.
The lesson here is that builders who tender claims in construction defect lawsuits as additional insureds under subcontractors’ insurance policies should carefully consider the impact this may have on their ability to select their own counsel and to control their defense. It may have to choose between keeping the counsel it wants or losing the right to have the insurance company on the hook to pay its fees and costs in the case. In this instance, because of the prior case involving the same issue between the same parties, the insurance company, by accepting the tender and agreeing to provide counsel, may have been using the builder’s anticipated reluctance to accept the insurance company’s selected counsel as a tactic to avoid paying its share of the defense costs. If this was the company’s strategy, then tactics such as sending early tenders that demand very prompt acceptance if the company does not consent to using and paying for the current counsel, may help avoid these situations by making the company assert its position before it is prepared to take control of the entire case.$599.99

This summer, I took a class on Flipping the Classroom – the idea is for students to watch videos at home before coming into school (for homework) so we can build on that learning in the classroom. It’s a neat idea, and it is being used in classrooms world-wide. I was very excited about signing up for this course, but I couldn’t help but wonder how I would be able to make it work in OUR classroom. I have noticed, over the past 8 years, that more and more students have access to computers at home. That’s great news! However, I still have yet to teach a class where every student has reliable computer access outside of school. It is the lack of access that makes me hesitant to “require” any type of flipped instruction for homework.
But how could I still use the benefits of flipped instruction with my students?? There are so many useful videos out on the Internet, and in my mind I have already created some amazing ones myself (ha ha). I decided that I would be using a different phrase in our classroom – “Spinning”. We are going to spin our instruction to better meet the needs of students. Thinking of it as “spinning” has freed up my thinking to include new ways of engaging my students. By sharing videos to introduce, teach and reteach concepts, my students will be well on their way to learning to mastery. As a bonus, for those students who do have access at home, they will be able to watch videos there, as well.
So, the journey starts here. Let’s see where this ever-evolving, spinny ride will take us!! Visit the Spinning the Classroom pages at the right ~~>Mummified seals now reveal that communities of microbes in Antarctica can change much faster than previously thought, scientists find.
The results suggest that climate change, and the subsequent alterations to the environment, such as temperature changes, would likely lead to drastic microbial changes as well.
The Dry Valleys of Antarctica are the coldest, driest deserts on Earth, which makes surviving there extraordinarily challenging. This has led to the longstanding belief that life there progresses extremely slowly to make the most of the deserts' scarce resources, with changes in ecosystems taking place over millennia.
To directly test this assumption, researchers analyzed microbes living under a carcass of a seal naturally mummified by the Antarctic cold and aridity. These centuries-old mummies have been seen up to 41 miles (66 kilometers) inland in the Dry Valleys and 5,900 feet (1,800 meters) above sea level; why the seals roamed so far away from the coast to their death remains a mystery, with potential culprits including viruses and bad weather. [Image Gallery: Seals of the World]
The scientists compared the microbes living under a mummified crab-eater seal in one of the Dry Valleys with those living in soils exposed to the open air. They also carried the mummy to a site 490 feet (150 m) away and analyzed how the soil underneath it changed over the course of five years.
The mummy leaked nutrients into the soil and trapped moisture under it that normally would have escaped into the air. The researchers found that after just two summers, the bacterial communities under the mummy's new resting place resembled those at the site where it lay for about 250 years.
"We had not anticipated the communities would respond so quickly," researcher Craig Cary, a microbial ecologist at the University of Waikato in New Zealand, told LiveScience. "Up to this [point], people thought it would have taken tens of years, if not hundreds of years, to see a similar response."
The microbial community that sprouted under the mummy's new resting place consisted of microbes native to that soil. However, what were once minor members of that community became major ones, while what were major members became minor. Overall, microbial diversity underneath the mummy slumped dramatically, most likely due to factors such as the added nutrients and extra moisture aiding some bacteria more than others; in addition, the mummy's body would have blocked sunlight, and hindered any photosynthetic microbes.
The researchers have now moved the mummy back to its original spot to see how the microbial communities alter once more. They plan to investigate microbial diversity in the rest of the Dry Valleys — "microbial diversity is very high there, way higher than one might expect from the extreme conditions there," Cary said. "What drives that?"
The scientists detailed their findings online Feb. 7 in the journal Nature Communications.

But we must also carefully consider how the events in the wake of World Wars I and II have impacted the psychological disposition of the Arab population throughout the Middle East.
Telling the Exodus story without acknowledging the violence against the Caananites is similar to repeating the Zionist myth that Israel was a "land without a people for a people without land."
While I am not planning on transferring to Bard anytime soon, I hope our university will return to its commitment to dialogue and diversity of opinion, and finally restore the Brandeis University-Al-Quds University partnership.
It would be easy to chock up Hillary's maneuver as politics during the beginning of her presidential campaign and call it day. But there's something more to it than that..
People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. Israel may be a troubled member of our family, but certainly not the only one. What about Texas? So what should the US do about Israeli?
Netanyahu's words create a golden opportunity for Barack Obama to radically transform his policy of uncritical support for Israel's ongoing violations of the law..
Though "business as usual" is the path of least resistance on the Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Iranian axes, they are also risky enterprises as the old equilibriums shift.
No one is proposing anarchy -- the no-state solution. Mathematically, that leaves us with the one-state solution. More precisely, it leaves us with many possible one-state solutions, and plenty to discuss.
The damning consequences Netanyahu's new government will inflict on the country are as certain as night following day. Israel, which has been led astray by Netanyahu for so long, is fast approaching a new precipice unlike any other it has faced in years past...
The vulgarity and crudity of Netanyahu and his allies have successfully salvaged the prime minister's career for the time being. Likud's win, however, may turn into a Pyrrhic victory
If Israel's laws and policies existed in the U.S. today, many towns would be legally permitted to deny housing to African Americans because of the color of their skin; Arab and Muslim Americans would be forbidden from marrying and bringing their loved ones to the U.S. if they were born in the Middle East.As the Cleveland School District grapples with a $13.2 million shortfall, the school board faces tough decisions in order to balance the budget while maintaining a high standard of education for our local students. Ultimately, the decisions made will impact our entire community, as the preparation of our region's future leaders and work force is at stake.
Among the possible budget cuts under consideration is the near-elimination of the district's preschool programming. Unfortunately, the short-term financial benefits of such a decision would be far outweighed by the long-term consequences.
Across Ohio, thousands of children enter kindergarten 18 months behind their classmates in academic skills because their preparation for school is unequal to their peers, particularly those from underserved communities. Educators and school districts continue to work tirelessly to arm students with the knowledge they need for the future, but unless we provide young children with a quality pre-school experience, this community remains at risk of not equipping future generations to address the challenges ahead.
This is especially relevant as we compete in a world economy fueled by an increasingly knowledge-based work force. The foundation for these fundamental skills is set in the early school years. Yet America appears ill-prepared, as more than 20 percent of U.S. workers are unable to read at the most basic level or complete simple addition. Ohio high school graduation rates for incoming freshman are at 79 percent, and at 63 percent for Cleveland, where many low-to-moderate-income families have trouble affording preschool without assistance.
A number of studies have proved the value of quality early childhood education, particularly in savings on special education, remedial job training, correctional facilities and other costs that are a drain on economic growth. The returns on a modest investment in high-quality school readiness initiatives -- estimated at as much as $16 in long-term savings for every $1 spent, according to a cost-benefit analysis of the Perry preschool study -- are significant and long lasting. Children entering kindergarten ready to learn are more likely to graduate from high school and move on to postsecondary education. The benefits of a well-educated work force include higher salaries and greater economic stability. Furthermore, if more students finished school and had a better skill set, we may not have the stubborn unemployment rate that plagues our economy.
We encourage civic, nonprofit and business leaders to join us in supporting quality preschool programming in our region. For our part, PNC Bank continues to collaborate with business leaders in this region and across the state to underscore the importance of quality early childhood programming to underprivileged students, and recently extended "Grow Up Great," our bilingual program in school readiness, by $250 million over 10 years to serve more at-risk students.
In Cleveland alone, PNC has already provided approximately $3 million in grants to local partners to help support programs and initiatives that have reached more than 100 pre-school classrooms and 30,000 students. Additionally, hundreds of area preschool educators have received continuing education that prepares them to engage preschoolers in math, science and the arts, with a particular emphasis on closing learning-readiness gaps among underserved children.
We stand behind the leadership of the Cleveland School District as they work to address the budget challenges ahead, and we encourage them to preserve preschool classes offered through the district. All of our local children deserve access to high quality early education that will prepare them for school, and ultimately to succeed in life.

Share Uploaded :: A Play Reading with WineShare TweetThe musical peaks of Johann Sebastian Bach, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Dolly Parton may have come in different centuries, but for one afternoon, the three will share the stage. Well, in the metaphysical sense at least.
Selections from Bach, Mozart and Parton will be performed during “Behold a Star,” the Penn State Behrend Chamber Singers and Concert Choir’s fall concert, which will be held at 4 p.m. Sunday, Nov. 17, at First United Methodist Church of Erie, 7th and Sassafras St.
“While Bach seems to have been quite a serious character and may have reacted with disapproval, I firmly believe that Mozart would giggle with delight if he knew he was sharing a concert program with Dolly,” said Gabrielle Dietrich, choir conductor and director of choral programs at the campus.
The goal of the concert, according to Dietrich, is to pair the classical offerings with the contemporary works to help broaden the musical spectrum for attendees. Classical works will be interwoven with traditional spirituals and contemporary offerings, including “Ave maris stella,” a work of current British composer Cecilia McDowall.
“A lot of people find classical music intimidating or unapproachable, and I also believe that a concert needs to meet audience members where they are, even as it aims to broaden their experiences and offer them something new,” Dietrich said. “So, the Mozart piece we will sing is actually like musical sorbet — short, sweet and a little sentimental — and the Bach chorale we sing is a harmonization of a well-known hymn tune with words translated into English.”
Admission to “Behold a Star” is free and open to the public. For additional information, contact Dietrich at 814-898-6636.

Marketing Communications Coordinator, Penn State Erie, The Behrend CollegeA quick self snap hearted, open-minded, down to earth, sweet, fun, passionate, loving, artistic and an easy going person who enjoys life and love to laugh a lot. If you ask my friends, they will probably also say that I am a smarty pants who is stylish, sexy, cool, generous and have a great sense of humor. I am passionate about music, movies, art and food (although not necessary in that order). I believe everyone should take good care of themselves so i exercise regularly either doing hip hop dancing or weight lifting. I work hard, have a good career and am financially independent which is something that is important to me. To de-stress, I like to cook and paint and I find the creative process very therapeutic, sexy and mind stimulating. One thing I really believe about life is that everything is all about timing.... Now, as for my background, I am fortunate enough to have lived in 3 different countries. Hong Kong where i was born, England where I went to boarding school and finally Los Angeles where I settled. I guess you can say I am kind of international and yes, I still have a very little trace of British accent that sneaks out at times. Intellectual and artistic people with an open mind, a gentle heart, a passion for life, a positive attitude and a great sense of humor who like to laugh and not take themselves too seriously are always interesting.Spoof interviews
The spoof news program called the Daily Show – Global Edition relayed on CNN International in the weekends sometimes brings an interesting light-hearted perspective to current affairs.
One such instance was the spoof interviewer tackling serious issues with the main proponents of their vested agenda.
Gay marriage happens to be one of the hot-button issues in along with abortion rights and stem cell research; however, putting gay marriage on the ballots along with the presidential election in 11 swing states was part of what clinched the second term for Dubbiyew.
The Democrats should have addressed the issue better and had it moved out of focus, but then there are more problems with being labelled a liberal than being a conservative, but then if a coin ever had two sides in, one side always seems to be bigger and wider than the other minor side – go figure!
The question
Anyway, the clincher question in the interview was – Does gay marriage the relationship between you and your wife? – The interviewee did not think that was a serious question.
In my mind, that is probably the most important question on this gay marriage issue and the activism that it entails. Exactly, how does one Adam and Steve couple stop the other Adam from getting on with Eve in another relationship?
In these modern times, whilst procreation is probably now the nominal consummation of a marriage, companionship and partnership seems to have gained ascendancy.
Marriage as it stands
The whole furore about marriage really boils down to having ways of recognising an enduring partnership from which partnership rights by law should and must accrue if there is any justice in this world.
Any long term relationship social, business or nominal should eventually have some sort of acknowledgement, even so it could be legal and made legally binding – marriage in a general sense should be no exception.
Back to the question, if everyone has the right to partner with whomever they desire and the attraction amongst or between sexes leads to some fulfilment, then everyone should have the let to confirm their relationship without a majority trampling over the yearnings of minority.
Other statistics
In this case, the minority is not the group having the highest divorce rates or involved in the abortion fracas, the blame the societal ills of failed and dysfunctional heterosexual partnerships on the advent of alternative partnerships is disingenuous to say the least if not downright dishonest.
The sanctity of marriage is between the primary partners, it is not a communal sectarian diktat to be imposed on everyone and withdrawn from those who happen to be different in their choices which are neither criminal nor offensive to level-headed and reasonable public.
When you are confronted with the gay marriage issue again, just wonder how that business really does impact on your own particular affairs, if it does not, then let sleeping dogs lie. What does not affect your relationship does not affect your relationship, if you can accept that as truth.My sister-in-law Kaori was in Japan for a few months and she bought me back all these cute gifts. From beauty products, to a sushi pen (what!), to an intensive eye care mask, gummi candy and more. Little gifts often get me super happy and excited inside. I always love little trinkets and trying out new things. Japan has a way of taking regular items and making them very Kawaii! Super cute.
In the photo you'll see pastel colored rice, which is ideal for creating cute characters for food art! A Pom Pom Purin mirror and point pads made with Macademia Nut Oil that you can use for your forehead, cheeks, under the eyes, etc. 3 different types of gummi candy. A sushi pen, Japanese mountain coasters. Matcha Green Tea chewy candy (which is delicious). Also TonyMoly intense care eye pads.
The sushi pen is so rad. I believe that's salmon on it.
I'm really excited to try out the TonyMoly Intense Care Eye Mask. I've seen TonyMoly products at Urban Outfitters but I've never tried any of them. I'll make sure to review soon.
I'm not much for food art... I don't think I have the skills haha but I will surely try to make something cute with this rice.
Just thought I'd share some of these with you! So excited to open this stuff up!

The Videonystagmography (VNG) test precisely measures eye movements in order to evaluate the peripheral and central balance systems. Information obtained from the VNG provides diagnostic information about the function of the inner ear and central vestibular systems.
The VNG takes about 90 minutes to perform. For the test, you will be asked to wear goggles that monitor your eye movements.
The test is broken down into three major components:
Rotary Chair Test
The Rotary Chair test is also used to evaluate dizziness/balance problems. The information obtained from the Rotary Chair test supplements the VNG results and helps determine how your inner ear balance system is working.
The Rotary Chair test takes approximately 45 minutes. During the Rotary Chair test, eye movements are precisely measured with goggles while the patient is sitting in a slowly rotating chair in a darkened booth.
A speaker system allows communication with the audiologist outside the booth.
Posturography
Posturography is a test of balance function that assesses the ability to maintain upright posture (standing up right) and proper gait or manner of walking. Posturography testing provides important information about the ability to effectively maintain balance in the variety of conditions encountered in everyday life.
Three separate functions contribute to our sense of balance: somatosensory, vision, and vestibular.
Somatosensory function refers to our ability to stand quietly and maintain balance on a flat, unmoving surface.
We rely on our visual system to help maintain balance when a standing surface is uneven or unreliable.
The internal reference for balance is our vestibular system. We rely on our vestibular system to maintain balance when a surface is uneven or unreliable (somatosensory) and our vision is unreliable due to darkness or other factors.
Posturography assesses each of these systems in order to determine which may be contributing to a sense of imbalance.
The testing takes approximately 30 minutes and is performed by a vestibular therapist. It is a non-invasive and relatively easy test to perform. Wear comfortable, loose fitting clothes and socks. Women should wear pants, and refrain from wearing dresses or skirts.
All participants wear a safety harness during testing, which protects the patient if they lose their balance.
Vestibular-Evoked Myogenic Potential (VEMP)
Although dizziness is common, there are many things that can cause it; sometimes determining the cause can be challenging. A problem in the inner ear may be the cause of the dizziness. The VEMP is a computerized test used to measure portions of the vestibular system that may be related to dizziness.
The test takes about one hour to perform. No preparation is required for this test, except that you may want to avoid wearing turtlenecks or tighter clothing around the neck area, because flat recording electrodes (or wires) are taped to the sternum, forehead, and neck.
These electrodes will measure the response of the vestibular system while loud sounds are presented to the ears through small earplugs.
During the test, you will be asked to lay flat or sit upright on an exam table. You will hear loud sounds through earplugs, and will be asked to raise or turn your head sharply in one direction for about 45 seconds. You may feel a slight strain in the muscles on your neck during the testing, but there is no real discomfort.
If you have severe neck problems that may prevent you from performing the test, please make the audiologist aware. After testing you are free to return to your daily activities.
Learn more about Vestibular Disorders Program.

Optimizing Mobile Email Marketing Amid the “Device Revolution”
March 9, 2012
Contributed by Alison Logan
Here at IQ Solutions, we have wondered, as social media use continues to climb, will we see a decline in the success of email marketing? According to Pew Research, among younger audiences, social networking sites compete with email for users’ time and attention. In addition, Marketing Sherpa’s 2010 Email Marketing Benchmark Report indicated that 70 percent see social media as a serious competitor to email marketing for users’ time and attention.
With this question in mind, we captured some key take-aways from a recent Lyris webinar on revitalizing email marketing efforts in the age of the “Device Revolution” and merged them with some of our own best practices.
Lyris, citing 2011 eMarketer research, reports that 96 percent of Americans own a mobile phone and 44 percent use a smartphone with Internet access. A whopping 45 percent of the time, people use these devices to check their email; however, when they are checking email, they have limited time and phone battery power, and are often distracted.
Based on these facts, we’ve put together some recommendations for your mobile email design.
Design simple templates for small screens.
Although smartphone screen size seems to be increasing with every model release, smartphone screens are much smaller compared with a laptop or netbook, let alone a standard desktop computer. With this in mind, design templates for smart phones that utilize a single column with large buttons and action-oriented, concise messaging.
Use big buttons and white space for easy pressing.
Nothing is worse than navigating a website that hasn’t been optimized for your smartphone. The same can be said for an email. In the past, large buttons have been more about grabbing the user’s attention than anything else. Now, larger buttons are also good for larger hands and fingers—especially because pinching and squeezing your smartphone screen doesn’t always work on some mobile email platforms. So, develop large buttons that are spaced apart from one another, allowing for clear and easy pressing; even if you aren’t using buttons, put ample space between all clickable items. Not only will your templates look nice on someone’s mobile device, but the user might actually click on the links.
Write concise, action-oriented messages.
Let’s be honest. When we’re checking email on our smartphones, we’re often multitasking and therefore distracted. When designing email templates for smartphones, leave out all unnecessary content including both text and images. Doing so will streamline your message and also save on battery usage and loading time. While this has always been a best practice for email marketers, it’s only becoming more important now that more people are using smaller devices for viewing content.
Minimize horizontal scrolling.
Many people use their smartphone to “triage” emails or decide which emails to read later on. Include the most important information and action items “above the fold,” so the user doesn’t have to scroll to find it. Develop smaller headers and make sure the important stuff is close to the top. With that said, don’t worry if you have a lot of content. Vertical scrolling on a mobile device is very easy, and most users tend to expect it. The key is avoiding horizontal scrolling.
Text-only versions are still needed.
Although more people have smartphones, some users may still prefer to receive text-based emails, whether they are on their mobile device or desktop. While mobile devices are getting better at displaying flashy HTML email templates, text-only emails are fast loading and easy to skim through—if you aren’t writing an essay in your copy, which for your subscribers’ sake, you shouldn’t.
Cross-promote email and social media.
Alone, email marketing won’t get you much traction anymore. Social media are here to stay, but that doesn’t mean it’s a replacement for email marketing. While you’re taking the time to examine your email marketing from a mobile perspective, it’s good to remember that social media’s main platform is also mobile. Therefore, don’t be shy about promoting your social media presence in your mobile email templates. And, of course, the same can be said about letting your Twitter followers know that they can get mobile-friendly updates via email as well.
Determine your best send times.
Marketers constantly debate the best times to send emails to subscribers. Naturally, it depends on who your audience is more than anything. Nevertheless, if you’re going completely mobile with your email marketing efforts, think about when your audience tends to use their mobile devices the most. You may find Monday mornings no longer reign as the peak time for open rates.
Never stop learning the latest trends.
Obviously, there is a lot more you can do to optimize your email marketing for the mobile landscape. As mobile devices evolve over time, there certainly will be obstacles to overcome in the future. Regardless, it’s important to learn the trends and look at things from the consumer’s perspective. Take out your mobile device or smartphone and view your email and ask yourself some questions. What do you like? What’s difficult from a usability standpoint? What would make it easier? You may be surprised about what you discover about your own email preferences and habits, which will only provide more insight into your own marketing efforts.

News Tribune editorial
Saturday, October 19, 2013
The partial shutdown of the federal government recently provides all the more reason to appreciate government efficiency.
At the state level, Wednesday’s announcement of this year’s winners of the Governor’s Award for Quality and Productivity provided a timely reminder of using innovation to deliver public services.
Award winners, according to the Office of Administration (OA), must “meet requirements related to effectiveness, responsiveness and efficiency that would serve as a model of excellence for other work teams in state government.”
The three categories and winners are:
• Customer Service: The Statewide Customer Service Team for the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) was honored for developing a new call routing process to respond to Missourians’ and visitors’ questions faster with less time on hold.
• Efficiency/Process Improvement: Another MoDOT group, the Route 5 Shared Four-Lane Highway Team, won in this category for designing an alternative between two- and four-lane roads called shared four-lane highways. OA said: “This unique design provides a cost-effective solution to improve traffic flow, increase safety and reduce driver frustration from slow moving vehicles.”
• Innovation: The Potosi Correction Center Reintegration Unit, Missouri Department of Corrections, was honored in this category. The award recognized the group for creating a new procedure to evaluate inmates who commit crimes while incarcerated and designing programs to reintegrate them into the prison’s general population.
OA noted this year marks the 25th year the award have been presented to recognize “continuous improvement, quality and productivity in Missouri state government.”
We join in congratulating this year’s recipients. These employee groups provide an example and incentive for how government can serve the public with greater convenience and efficiency.

Mom Blogger: Sharon Beesley of NYC Taught Me
“I just put on a TV show for the kids, so we have 24 minutes to talk!” said Sharon Beesley upon picking up her cell phone on an overcast morning. It’s lucky for me that clouds lined the sky, otherwise Beesley surely would have been out and about already—at a museum or other teeming New York City tourist attraction—with her seven-year-old daughter, Ella, and four-year-old twins, Oscar and Owen. On the one hand, Beesley is the definition of a mom blogger (“I’m not going to fool myself into thinking I’m anything else,” she laughs), but she also challenges the label constantly by her sheer level of activity, and the many other ways she spends her hours. We figure she titled her blog NYC Taught Me for a reason, so of course we picked her brain about what she's learned. —Lucie Alig
We’re in awe of how adventurous you are with your kids! What are your tips for taking them out into the city?
Make it selfish. I know that sounds weird, but I honestly just take them to places that I’d want to see anyways. The Guggenheim is a prime example, as it’s not really geared towards kids. In fact, kids 12 and under get in for free, so clearly they don’t anticipate getting much traffic from the younger set. And yet it’s one of my kids’ favorites.
Any other touristy things that your kids enjoy in New York?
I haven’t done the Statue of Liberty yet but my parents are coming out next week, and it seems like a good thing to do with grandparents. But we do the Empire State Building a lot. On the last day of summer last year, we went up to the top of the building as a kind of last hurrah. The boys were about to start school for the first time, so we did it as a final gesture. I hope to make that a tradition—it’s like being on the top of the world before embarking on something new.
I read that you have a habit of taking solo trips. Can you speak to the importance of having alone time as a mom?
I had my kids when I was very young, so I didn’t have that time to be by myself and live alone. Now, whether it’s a run in the park or an overnight trip, I seek opportunities to have time to think and be by myself. The biggest splurge was when I went to visit a friend in Paris, but usually it’s more low-key and spontaneous. When I lived in California, there was a small little hostel in a lighthouse that I used to go to. I think it was $20 a night, and it was totally safe. It was a few minutes away from my house, but I felt worlds away.
We’re all guilty of the New York syndrome of eating out a lot and not cooking enough. Can you speak to the food culture in New York, and how you go about satisfying your brood?
[Laughs.] Yeah, I think all I have in the fridge right now is two eggs and maybe some milk. In New York, you always have the option of avoiding McDonalds and Dominos and other fast food restaurants with horrible ingredients. Everything can be convenient and pretty fresh, so I don’t feel too bad about it!
Do you identify with the “mom blogger” title?
I’m not going to fool myself into thinking I’m anything else but a mom blogger. I love to write, so there’s that. But the worst thing in the world is taking yourself too seriously. Admit what you are and be fine with it.

Asked about the report earlier this week that Mark Wahlberg had become attached, Norrington says "I don't know about that story but I can tell you I'm no longer involved with The Crow." Norrington co-wrote the most recent draft with musician Nick Cave based on an earlier script by another writer.
Norrington went on to say he left due to a new actor coming onboard and demanding a re-write. " he says.
Said actor isn't likely to be Wahlberg as Norrington added "I will say I think Wahlberg could be cool if they take a gritty blue-collar approach. He's a truthful actor.

Technical Abstract:
Mineral content of soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) seed is one measure of seed quality. The effect of maturity on seed mineral content of soybean seed has not been well investigated in the Early Soybean Production System because maturity is generally confounded with genotypic background effects. Therefore, the effects of maturity on seed mineral concentrations were investigated in two sets of near-isogenic soybean lines derived from either ‘Clark’ or ‘Harosoy’ genotypic backgrounds. For Clark isolines, there were significant (P=0.05) positive correlations between maturity and N and Ca (for N, r=0.83 in 2004 and r=0.62 in 2005; for Ca, r=0.59 in 2004 and r=0.89 in 2005). For Harosoy isolines, there were significant (P=0.05) positive correlations between maturity and Ca and B (for Ca, r=0.60 in 2004 and r=0.83 in 2005; for B, r=0.48 in 2004 and r=0.72 in 2005). Genotypic background effect was highly significant (P<0.001) for N, S, Ca, K, Mg, P, and B seed concentrations. Maturity gene (E-gene) effect was highly (P<0.0001) significant for Ca and B. Commonality analysis showed that the contribution of genotypic background and interactions of genotypic background, maturity, and temperature were greater for N, Ca, Mg, P, B, and Zn. The contribution of either maturity or temperature to total mineral concentration depended on the type of nutrient. Results indicated that, depending on the type of nutrient and year, the contribution of genotypic background or maturity on total variation of nutrient concentrations was greater than that of temperature in most cases. Maturity x genotypic background x temperature interactions also had a significant contribution, reflecting the significance of genotype x environment interactions for mineral nutrients. This information may be useful when developing soybean germplasm with higher mineral seed content.50°F

NEC Scholarship Awardees
Naples Equestrian Challenge (NEC) is proud to announce that Sarah Bombard, Christiane Daniel and Christina Lacovino have each been awarded a scholarship for the 2011-2012 academic year. The announcement was formally made on Saturday, May 7, 2011 at a special ceremony during NEC's Kentucky Derby Party at Noodles Italian Café and Sushi Bar in Naples, Florida.
Christiane Daniel and Christina Lacovino both received the "Deb PT Volunteer Scholarship," which recognizes NEC volunteers for their contributions by providing a graduating high school senior with a small scholarship toward future education expenses. This scholarship fund was established at the Community Foundation of Collier County by James Flanagan to honor the extraordinary volunteerism of his sister, physical therapist, Deborah Flanagan-Thornton. "Deb PT," as she is known around NEC, has lovingly volunteered at NEC for many years with commitment and compassion.
The scholarship established by Mr. Flanagan in Deb's name celebrates her dedication to the riders of NEC, as well as the special bond that is formed between volunteer and rider. This special bond makes the time spent at NEC a valuable experience not only for the rider but for the volunteer as well. The effect NEC can have on volunteers was eloquently described by Christina Lacovino:
"As I look back at the past five years and my time spent at Naples Equestrian Challenge, I can genuinely say that I have had countless inspirational and satisfying experiences there. I feel as if words cannot fully express my appreciation for the program and my feelings towards the lives that have been touched. With the help of Naples Equestrian Challenge, I have been able to participate in something much bigger than myself. Their infectious atmosphere gives the feeling of accomplishment and positivity that fills everyone in the process. This is what first inspired me to lend a helping hand in the best way I knew how: through horses. I initially began to volunteer at NEC because of my passion for horses and my desire to surround myself with the large animals. Every week I would come to NEC to sidewalk and lead the horses while assisting the riders with their personal goals. I soon knew every rider's name and his or her specific therapeutic strategies. Week after week, I would walk, talk and connect with the same riders. Before long, I began to realize the strong feelings I had developed with each individual. It seemed that within just a few short weeks I had gained an entirely new family filled with such incredible people. I loved to watch the riders master and develop new skills, and being a part of their success gave me a feeling of hope, satisfaction and rebirth. The riders' own excitement was contagious. The realization that their lives were slowly changing and blossoming allowed me to reexamine my own daily activities. I became a more open and humble person due to my time at Naples Equestrian Challenge. I have realized the necessity of being open-minded and accepting to whatever challenges come about, and with this attitude, I know I can accomplish anything. I still plan to pursue my passion for horses and volunteering in college, and I know that the attitude of NEC will forever be in my heart and always expressed through my actions."
Sarah Bombard received a scholarship from a separate fund at NEC. She is being recognized for her transition from rider to volunteer. Sarah, now 18 years old, began riding at NEC at age 2. The challenges presented by cerebral palsy have not stopped Sarah from reaching for her dreams. She was so dedicated to her therapeutic riding lessons at NEC that she continued to advance in her skills until she "outgrew" NEC and began competing in horseshows against able-bodied riders. Over time, Sarah's love for horses and her skill as an equestrian led her to split a lease for a horse, and today she continues to ride and be responsible for her horse's care. Sarah returned to NEC as a volunteer in 2010. Today she continues to volunteer at NEC as she is preparing for graduation and higher education studies at Key West. She plans to become a marine biologist. Sarah's accomplishments exemplify NEC's mission of improving the lives of individuals with disabilities through therapeutic riding. Sarah is a leader among her peers and serves as a fantastic role model for NEC's riders.
"We are so proud of all three of our scholarship recipients. It is their leadership and the dedication of volunteers of all ages and talents that make NEC's program possible. Without our volunteers, we simply would not be able to operate our program," said Sheryl Soukup, Executive Director of NEC. "Naples Equestrian Challenge is all about helping those with special needs in our community have access to a special kind of therapy. Being on a horse not only helps riders with their physical therapy goals, but it gives them courage, confidence and hope. Special volunteers like Sarah, Christiane and Christina make this possible for over 120 riders each week."
NEC is currently in need of additional volunteers to make a difference in the lives of children and adults with special needs.

Edith Cowan University’s (ECU) Child Health Promotion Research Centre has been awarded a national tender to evaluate the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) Cybersmart Detectives (CSD) online education game.
ECU will be the first organisation to formally evaluate the effectiveness of CSD, which teaches young people how to deal with cyber-safety issues.
The study will address key objectives, including analysing the short-term impact of the game on student cyber-safety awareness, examining the teacher’s role in enforcing cyber-safety and assessing the value of pre and post game lessons in reinforcing cyber-safety messages.
Senior Research Fellow at the Child Health Promotion Research Centre, Dr Julian Dooley, believes evaluation is important in developing effective programs to deal with cyber-bullying.
“The evaluation of this cyber-safety game represents an important step toward the use of evidence informed strategies to promote cyber-safety.
“Using research evidence as a framework to develop cyber-safety strategies is the best approach to develop preventative educational messages and effectively reduce the risks associated with technology,” said Dr Dooley.
The evaluation will also assess the long term effectiveness of the CSD game on educating students about cyber-safety and will extend over a 20-week period.
ECU’s Acting Vice-Chancellor, Professor John Finlay Jones, said the work of the Child Health Promotion Research Centre is of critical importance to students, parents and teachers.
“Securing this tender highlights the great work done by ECU researchers in developing and evaluating effective programs to combat cyber-bullying within our schools.”

Follow ECU News on TwitterThe Wisconsin Badgers get a chance for some sweet revenge when they meet the Michigan State Spartans for the Big Ten Championship on Saturday night.
This is the inaugural conference title game after Nebraska moved over from the Big 12 to bring the Big Ten to an even dozen. It will be played in Indianapolis with Wisconsin representing the Leaders Division and Michigan State the Legends.
Don Best has Wisconsin as somewhat lofty 9½-point favorites, with the total at 54½-points. FOX will broadcast at 8:15 p.m. (ET) from Lucas Oil Stadium with the winner getting a bid to the prestigious Rose Bowl to likely play Oregon.
The BCS No. 15 Badgers (10-2 straight up, 7-4-1 against the spread) were looking like a juggernaut went they strolled into Spartan Stadium on October 22 with a 6-0 SU (5-0-1 ATS) record and ranked No. 4 in the AP and Coaches Poll.
The result was a shocking 37-31 Badgers loss as 7-point favorites that ended on a 44-yard Hail Mary that was almost stopped at the goal line. Wisconsin had previously scored 14 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to tie up the game.
The home team has now won the last seven meetings between the teams (5-2 ATS). The ‘over’ is 3-0 in the last three and 8-1 the last nine. The total in October was 50½-points.
Coach Bret Bielema’s team seemed rattled after the Michigan State loss and even more so after a 33-29 defeat at Ohio State as 7½-point ‘chalk’ the following week. That was also decided on a late Ohio State pass after another Wisky fourth-quarter comeback.
The Badgers saw their national title hopes end after Ohio State and needed to run the table (and get some help) just to make this game. They did respond by winning four straight (2-2 ATS), including a 45-7 home thumping of Penn State last week.
Wisconsin did get its first two road wins in November at Minnesota (42-13) and Illinois (28-17), but is 0-4 ATS away this year. That doesn’t include a neutral site win against Northern Illinois in Chicago in September, 49-7 as 15-point favorites.
The Spartans (10-2 SU, 8-4 ATS) have to feel disrespected as almost double-digit ‘dogs. Not only did they win the first meeting, but they’re ranked higher in the BCS at No. 13.
Note the Don Best Linemakers Poll has been bullish on the Badgers all year and has them ranked No. 7 (118.5). However, that ranking is only 4.8 higher than No. 13 Michigan State (113.7).
Michigan State lost 24-3 at Nebraska after the Wisconsin game, but has rebounded to win four straight. That includes a 31-17 win at Northwestern last Saturday even though it had already clinched the conference title game the week before.
Senior quarterback Kirk Cousins has stepped up the last four games with 260.5 YPG and 10 TDs versus just one interception. The offense as a whole has been better over that span at 38.5 PPG, compared to just 26 PPG over the first eight.
The Spartans do have some offensive weapons with receivers B.J. Cunningham (1,125 yards) and Keshawn Martin (627 yards), plus running backs Le’Veon Bell (794 yards) and Edwin Baker (624 yards).
The offense needs to play very well Saturday as Wisconsin (44.8 YPG, fourth nationally) will certainly put up points in the indoor environment. Russell Wilson (192.9) is the most efficient quarterback in the country and running back Montee Ball is second in rushing yards (1,622) and his 34 total touchdowns are the second-most in NCAA history.
Ball had 115 yards on 18 carries in the first meeting (6.4 per carry). He left for part of the game after a head shot which was a big blow (figuratively and literally) to the Badgers. Backup James White (42 yards, 11 carries) was not nearly as effective against the physical Spartans front seven.
The Badgers have seemed to shore up the special teams the last few weeks. It killed them in the first game against Michigan State with a punt returned for a touchdown and a short field goal blocked.
Wisconsin has a key injury with star center Peter Konz (ankle) doubtful. The offensive line is still very good, but has had to shift players around. MSU will be a challenge up front especially with defensive end William Gholston extra motivated after being suspended during the first contest.
Weather will not be a factor with the retractable roof.Thread

I am using
But I'm wondering which Embassy Console - Science - Emitter Array to use with it.
I am sorta thinking of going with the Plasma infusers, the vessel has 4 consoles and I might actually be able to pull a little bit of damage off with this set up. Also I could use them in pve to potientially pull off acceptable damage with this very heal and tanky build set up, (maybe even be able to heal tank with the right set up).
My questions are: is this build so much on the non damage end that, these wouldn't help enough to make it viable? Also maybe the shield or hull variant are soo good that I should take them instead? Or maybe its all negligible and I should just take whatever fits my playstyle?

Tommy Bolger ran for President of the Students’ Union at the University of Limerick. And he won! His campaign video, produced by Michael Boyle, probably had something to do with his victory. It’s a shot-by-shot parody of the trailer for The Wolf of Wall Street. With his energy and imagination, he'll make a good president. -via UproxxCommunicating through his daughter, Kalpana Murkar, Achrekar said that the retirement should be a happy occasion as Tendulkar had decided to call it a day on his own terms.
“The joy of watching Sachin walk in to bat is always special. I am excited and want to watch his 200th Test. Above all, I am happy he is going out on his own terms. All I want to do is watch him bat one last time,” Achrekar said.
“He has been an integral part of Sachin’s cricketing life and now he wants to watch him play one last time. So, we are planning to take him to the Wankhede Stadium when the match takes place,” Kalpana said.
Achrekar was Tendulkar’s first coach when he was just 11-years-old. He was the individual who helped the young Tendulkar hone his skills in the maidans of Mumbai.Tendulkar has since continued his relationship with the coach, visiting him regularly, and has promised Achrekar that he will visit him before he plays his last match.
“Sachin visited us twice last month, during Ganesh Utsav and Gurupurnima. He has said that he will visit us before he starts his last series,” said Kalpana.
As Sachin readies himself to take a final bow, it is only fitting that he does it in the presence of his original master.Port-au-Prince (pôrt-ə-prĭnsˈ, Fr. pôr-tō-prăNsˈ) . Port-au-Prince is laid out like an amphitheater, with business and commercial quarters along the water and residences on the hills above. The Univ. of Haiti is there.
The city was founded in 1749 by French sugar planters. In 1770, it replaced Cap-Haïtien as capital of the French colony of Saint-Domingue (as Haiti was then known), and in 1804 it became the capital of newly independent Haiti. Port-au-Prince has remained unsanitary and economically backward, however, and has suffered frequently from earthquakes, fires, and civil warfare. In Jan., 2010, a devastating earthquake destroyed or damaged many of the city's buildings, including landmarks such as the National Palace, the National Assembly building, and other government buildings and the cathedral.

FROM THE PUBLISHER | TALK OF THE
TABLE | THE HUM | CALENDAR
Born in Brooklyn, raised
on Long Island, Lou Reed has been an avant-garde force
inX2 rock music for four decades. Lou was punk before punk was
invented, a seminal glam rocker, a guitar noise artist when the
form was commercial suicide, but mostly he's been a straight-ahead
no apologies rock 'n' roller, one whose lyrics have touched on
once taboo topics like the glamour and grit of sex and drugs.
After playing in R&B bands in high school and
taking a stab at college, Lou headed back to NYC in 1963 to try
his hand at Tin Pan Alley-type songwriting for Pickwick Records.
In '64, he wrote a parody of dance records like "The Twist,"
titled "The Ostrich." To promote the song, his employers
put together a band called The Primitives with Reed as front
man. The classically trained John Cale was recruited and when
the two decided to work more together, The Velvet Underground
was born -- you could say alt. rock was born with it.
In songs like "Heroin," "Sweet Jane,"
"All Tomorrow's Parties," "Sister Ray," and
"Venus in Furs," Reed and the VU offered snapshots
of life on the street, a window into a dark world of drug addicts,
party people and hustlers. Lou would go on to a solo career that
blazed new trails: With 1972's Transformer, an album produced
by David Bowie, he crafted a gender-bent glamrock character and
wrote his biggest hit, "Walk on the Wild Side." The
next year he followed with Berlin, an unsentimental song
cycle about sex and drugs in the German city, then a couple of
years later he created Metal Machine Music, a two-record
set of feedback-laden guitar noise that sold few copies, but
is still influencing alt. rock bands like My Bloody Valentine.
What's Lou been up to lately? 2007 will see the
release of the martial arts DVD, Chen Taijiquan Master Ren
GuangYi and Lou Reed, with Lou's teacher offering demonstrations
of Chen-style Taijiquan (Tai Chi) with narration and ambient
electronic background music by Reed.
This December, Lou heads to the land down under
for the premiere of a staged version of Berlin, playing
the music he wrote in the early '70s (and never before performed
publicly), under the direction of New York artist/filmmaker Julian
Schnabel. Among the musicians joining him there are two bass
players: Rob Wasserman and Fernando Saunders. Prior to the Australian
shows, the bassmen are accompanying Reed on a short tour of colleges
on the West Coast, among them HSU, where Lou Reed, Songs and
Noise hits the stage of the Van Duzer Theatre, Saturday,
Nov. 4. Perhaps I'll see you there.
For a taste of cross-cultural dance, make a reservation
for one of three performances by the New World Ballet
when they bring together West African dance with ballet at the
Dancenter in Arcata Nov. 3, 4 and 5 (Sunday's show is a matinee).
Guest artist Alseny Soumah from the National Ballet of
Guinea joined forces with NWB Artistic Director Victor Temple
and the West African Dance Seminar, an NWB dance workshop,
to craft a Cinderella-type dance piece. The ballet dancers will
also perform some of Temple's recent choreography including the
classic "Swan Lake."
You might also want to stop by Muddy's Hot Cup
Thursday, where the NWB hosts a benefit featuring jazz by Auntie
Em and wines from local vintner Robert Goodman.
As you may recall, Auntie Em first came together
as a series of Thursday night jazz sessions at Muddy's led by
bassist Shao Way Wu. Shao Way called me last week to say,
"We're trying to get the jazz thing off the ground there"
again, and that aside from Thursday's benefit, they're playing
on Tuesdays at Muddy's. "Big Pete's is doing jazz on Thursdays,
so we changed nights. It's pretty much straight ahead; basically
me and Susie [Laraine] and whoever else is available. We try
to bring in different players each week. We'd like to invite
more people, but not really for a jam."
Friday at the Hot Cup, an intriguing sounding show:
The Whale Shark, which is the nom de musique of
Eric Pietsch, a whaling captain from Lahaina, Maui, who
sings satirical drunken pirate songs. Yo ho!
Speaking of Susie Laraine, she plays at the Graves
Saturday during Arts Alive! with her Rhumboogie Sax Quartet.
Also playing for Arts Alive!, the gospel/bluegrass band Huckleberry
Flint in the tent in front of the Arkley Center. (I think
they have space heaters there.)
More cross-culti business Saturday at the D St.
Neighborhood Center, a Mattole Salmon Group fundraiser featuring
the local drum/dance troupe, Dun Dun Fare and Afrissippi,
a band from North Mississippi formed by Senegalese songwriter
Guelel Kumba and Eric Deaton, a Mississippi bluesman
who was an apprentice to the late R.L. Burnside. Yes, it's true,
the blues has roots in Africa, and the music they made on an
album called Fulani Journey proves it.
Same night across town at the Arcata Presbyterian
Church it's the annual Harvest Concert by the Arcata
Interfaith Gospel Choir, singing with the A.I.G. Youth
and Teen Choirs.
How 'bout some hip hop? Friday, Nov. 3, Reba of
That's How We Roll presents "Keep The Feel 707,"
an underground hip hop party at Mazzotti's with Abstract Rude
and Tribe Unique up from the Bay along with DJ Artistic
and Deep Rooted 619, plus locals, DJ Itchie Fingaz
and the samba troupe Bloco Firmeza. Says Reba, "We're
bringing back that feel you've been missing: that feel good roots
and kulcha vibe with a b-boy twist -- spinning dope hip hop,
reggae and groovy sh!t all nite in an event much like a house
party where the DJs keep you dancing until closing time."
The Mateel plays host to Homegrown Hip Hop Vol.
2 Saturday night, an all ages show with local or semi-local
luminaries like Subliminal Sabotage, North Coast Underground,
L.C.A., Pyro A-Go-Go, MC 2-Son, Lil Cyc,
and DJs including Selecta Prime, Dj Jiggawatt and
Dj Assasin. Yo, be there with your hands in the air.
For a different take on hip hop, check the show
at the Kate Buchanan Room Saturday night featuring Bay Area Native
American hip hoppers One Struggle fronted by Ras K'dee,
whose mom is from the Pomo Nation while his dad is black. The
show is a benefit for the local organization Sustainable Nations;
Trinidad Goodshield and 7th Generation Rise will
open, and, says organizer PennElys Goodshield, "We're doing
the full Indian taco thing, as well as pies, sweets, etc."
(Showtime 7 p.m.)
Back at Mazzotti's Saturday night, a "Welcome
Home Show" for local reggae stalwarts Massagana back
from a West Coast tour, featuring Ishi Dube, Jah Sun
and Ras Attitude all backed by Massagana.
Looking for some metal? The Boiler Room heats up
Thursday, Nov. 2, with Eldemur Krimm from Portland, Ore.,
and Devil to Play from Indianapolis, Ind. Friday is just
as metallic, but local, with Embryonic Devourment, Locust
Furnace and Truculance banging heads.
Coming up Wednesday, Nov. 8, at the Van Duzer,
the Portland-based 12-piece neo-lounge outfit, Pink Martini,
who describe themselves as "somewhere between a 1930s Cuban
dance orchestra, a classical chamber music ensemble, a Brazilian
marching street band and Japanese film noir." Says P.M.
founder/pianist Thomas M. Lauderdale, "We're kind of like
musical archaeologists, bringing melodies and rhythms from different
parts of the world together to create something which is modern."
Same night at The Jambalaya, it's an alt. rock
evening featuring Vetiver, led by Andy Cabic, who
also often plays with Devendra Banhart (and vice versa). Fresh
from a Euro-tour, the band is making its way up and down the
West Coast with Sub Pop's Eric Johnson (from The Fruitbats);
local alties Strix Vega complete the bill.
And also on Wednesday, Santa Cruz singer/songwriter
Amy Obenski has another go at Humboldt. As you probably
do not recall, Amy had the bad fortune of being booked at Kelly
O'Brien's Pub a few days after they turned the place over to
the folks who turned it into The Red Fox Tavern. "Sorry,
show cancelled."
For the literary set we have dueling book signing
events. At Northtown Books, former Arcata poet laureate John
Ross reads from his latest journalistic masterwork, Zapatistas,
which one can safely assume is about the Mexican revolutionaries
John's been hanging out with for the last few years.
Same night at The Booklegger, Paul Chasman
appears with local raconteur Jeff DeMark, who will offer
a snippet from his latest show, They Ate Everything But Their
Boots. (See this week's Stage Matters for more on DeMark
and TAEBTB.) Paul Chasman is an Oregonian author/guitarist
bringing his one-man show Helluva Deal, and signing copies
of his latest, Book of Bob, as revealed to Paul Chasman,
which I was slightly disappointed to learn, has nothing to do
with "Bob," of the Church of the Subgenius. Chasman's
claim to fame is a series of letters written to President Bush
following the invasion of Iraq under the pen name "Carl
Estrada," offering advice on everything from The Dixie Chicks
to proper use of his flag lapel pin. Curious? You can find them
on the web at thecarlletters.com.
And since we're talking politics, I'll offer a
reminder: Don't forget to vote on Tuesday. And please, only vote
for people you think I might like. OK? We'll celebrate
next week.

Researchers had been studying the process at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where they used thin targets that produced far fewer positrons. The new laser method came about through simulations that showed a thicker target was more effective.
And suddenly lasers and antimatter are again making news. Hui Chen is the Livermore scientist behind this work:
“We’ve detected far more anti-matter than anyone else has ever measured in a laser experiment. We’ve demonstrated the creation of a significant number of positrons using a short-pulse laser.”
Image: Physicist Hui Chen sets up targets for the antimatter experiment at the Jupiter laser facility. Credit: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
What’s happening here is that ionized electrons are interacting with gold nuclei, giving off energy that decays into matter and antimatter. It’s a method that has been studied before at Livermore, using the laboratory’s petawatt laser. An article by physicist Michael Perry explains the interactions that laser achieved, first produced about a decade ago:
The intense beam of Livermore’s Petawatt laser was powerful enough to break up atoms by causing reactions in their nuclei. Accelerated by the laser, electrons traveling at nearly the speed of light collided with nuclei in a gold foil target, producing gamma rays that knocked out some of the neutrons from other gold nuclei and caused the gold to decay into elements such as platinum. Gamma rays also zoomed in on a layer of uranium sitting behind the gold and split uranium nuclei into lighter elements. Before the Petawatt, all of these effects had been solely in the domain of particle accelerators or nuclear reactors.
Accelerated to energies exceeding 100 megaelectronvolts, the electrons in the gold targets produced high-energy x rays. These in turn decayed into pairs of electrons and their antimatter counterparts, positrons, in such large numbers as to possibly generate an electron-positron plasma, never before created in the laboratory. An intense beam of protons also turned up. Not only was the Petawatt the most powerful laser in the world, but, unexpectedly, it also was a powerful ion accelerator.
The petawatt laser was decommissioned in mid-1999. Its original development centered on the study of inertial confinement fusion, in which a pellet of fuel could be ignited through intense laser bombardment. Variations on inertial confinement fusion play interestingly through interstellar propulsion studies, including the massive Daedalus probe designed by the British Interplanetary Society, which would have used deuterium and helium-3 as its fodder for a trip to Barnard’s Star.
But the petawatt laser also opened up the possibility of using a laser to do things particle accelerators had been called upon to do in the past. And now we’ve moved significantly beyond the earlier results — the petawatt experimenters detected roughly 100 antimatter particles compared to Chen’s one million. And note this: Chen’s number refers to particles that were directly detected, a result that produces an overall estimate of 100 billion positrons produced in the entire experiment.
We’ve looked in these pages at the possibility of harvesting naturally forming antimatter found in our own Solar System, even near the Earth, where cosmic ray interactions with the upper atmosphere produce small quantities. And the presence of antimatter near the center of our galaxy has been established, detectable because matter/antimatter annihilation produces gamma rays. The trick has always been that harvesting antimatter — or producing it in accelerators — yields small amounts at great expense. The latest work at least offers hope for more robust laboratory study of a material whose propulsive properties have long attracted interstellar theorists.
Just how significant a step this is remains to be seen, but I note what Peter Beiersdorfer, who works with Chen at Livermore, has to say:
“We’ve entered a new era. Now, that we’ve looked for it, it’s almost like it hit us right on the head. We envision a center for antimatter research, using lasers as cheaper antimatter factories.”
We’ll know more shortly, for Chen is presenting her work at the American Physical Society’s Division of Plasma Physics meeting that runs through Friday this week. A Livermore news release is available. Thanks to Centauri Dreams reader Leith for the heads-up on this work.
He said cheaper anitmatter “Factories” That is a loaded term that implies we have mass prodcution ….
How much do we need to accelerate a small probe of say 1 kg to 0.1c?
We would then have interstellar travel!
David, unfortunately the amounts we’re talking about here are still tiny. I don’t have any figures for something in the 1 kg range, but re a much heavier interstellar probe, Robert Forward calculated that a 1-ton robotic probe moving at one-tenth the speed of light on a scientific mission to Alpha Centauri would require four tons of liquid hydrogen or other propellant, along with some forty pounds of antimatter. A two-stage mission that would decelerate at Alpha Centauri for extended exploration would require 770 pounds of antimatter and 24 tons of liquid hydrogen. Obviously nanotechnology changes the equation as we shrink the payload, but we’re still in needed of ramping up antimatter production by a huge amount.
Would love to know what 100 billion positrons translates to in micrograms, but I’m sure it isn’t much! The AIMStar Oort Cloud probe, designed for a fifty year mission, would use 30-130 micrograms of antimatter itself. Given all that, this is exciting work because it is making laboratory study of antimatter that much easier, leading (let’s hope) to breakthroughs down the road.
10 E-10 microgram.
or you need 10 billion times more for a single microgram.
100 billion positions ~ 10^-10 microgram. This is terrible; I still hope we have enough antimatter around 2050s ( or sooner) to send a small probe to the Centauri system.
From Wikipedia: “The mass of a stationary electron is approximately 9.1 × 10^-31 kilograms”
I.e. 100 billion = 10^11 amounts to only about 9 x 10^-20 kg or 9 x 10^-11 microgram.
Still incredibly little.
just did some rough calculations.
assuming complete annihilation by interacting with an equivalent mass of normal matter, 9×10^-11 kg of positrons would release E = mc^2 = 3.6 x 10^-3 kg m^2 s^-2 (= 3.6×10^-3 N m = 3.6 x 10^-3 J) of energy (half due to the positrons and half due to the normal matter). Using kinetic energy E = mv/2, then v = sqrt(2E/m) and this would be enough to accelerate 1 kg to 0.085 m/s, or 1 microgram to 85 m/s.
This is hardly a useful quantity for propulsion purposes, and I also see several other objections. First, I have neglected: 1) all losses during propulsion (which are unavoidable due to thermodynamics); 2) energy required to contain the positron ‘gas'; 3) energy required to produce the positrons (which will certainly exceed their energy content — more thermodynamics).
My question: If you are thinking about accelerating probes, why go through all the intermediate steps (production, containment, burning), when you have a petawatt laser? 1 PW = 10^15 J/s; in one second, this is 2.8 x 10^17 more than the antimatter equivalent energy produced in the experiment that you described.
This brings me to a ‘peta’ idea of mine: “simply” use the laser to propel the probes.
By the way: “ionized electrons”?!
@Hans Bausewein, @hiro
To be honest I don’t understand whether centauri dreams was the right site for this news. Because space exploration is generally not the priority of particle physicists and though we can speculate on using antimatter for propulsion I am certain we will never have a viable propulsion method based on antimatter. It would be too costly. Other methods such as fusion ramjets, solar sails or breakthrough propulsion physics are more promising.
My point simply is; not to give particle physicists the credit they don’t deserve. If they really were dreamers as have been many people who tirelessly have pushed back the frontiers of space exploration it won’t be in its current state.
Hi Folks;
It would be interesting if the PetaWatt laser could fire say 10 to 1,000 pulses per second for an entire year at Gold Foil in a vacuum. The number of positrons generated would be, I presume, as great as (10 EXP 3)[3.1 x (10 EXP 7)](10 EXP 11) = 3.1 x (10 EXP 21). Although this would still be roughly only 10 EXP -7 grams, it might be enough to tease out any novel behavioral effects of macroscopic quantities of antimatter that are not detectable in microscopic or quantum scale quantities of positrons.
Perhaps some such novel behavioral effects of the positrons could be based on the mirror image qualities of such positrons with respect to that of the electrons.
Even though experiments have shown, if I am not mistaken, that antimatter particles react to gravity in the same manner that normal matter particles do, perhaps in macroscopic quantities at roughly STP conditions, some novel gravatitational effects of antimatter could be revealed.
Any subtle or yet be detected assymetry in the qualities of positrons with respect to electrons might also be accentuated in any such macroscopic quantities of positrons.
I believe a company called Positronics Research, LLC at, is studying the production of stable positronium atoms wherein a positronium atom would consist of a stable bound state of an electron and a positron wherein the seperation of the two particles would be far enough apart so as prevent pair annihilation. A large supply of such fuel could in theory be detonated like nitroglycerin by shocking it or otherwise perturbing it in order to destabilize the fuel.
I can imagine such positronium fuel being an excellent fuel for a pulsed rocket like the Orion Project style craft concept researched in the 50s and 60s.
Even though antimatter production may be limited to a fraction of one gram per year at best in the years to come, perhaps novel effects can be produced in terms of gravitational effects, other novel space time distortion effects, etc., with these very limited supplies of antimatter.
Thanks;
Jim
Jim’s pretty much correct about the mass. The mass of a positron, the same as the electron is 9.1X10^-28 gm, call it 10^-27 gm. So the mass produced would be 3×10^-6 gm, 3 micrograms, per year. Of course these petawatt scale lasers can’t fire as frequently as 1,000 times a second, but it is not too far out of the question they could be scaled up t o produce this much energy that quickly.
Note that this small amount of 3 micrograms is not too very far off the amounts envisioned for a propulsion method using electron-positron annihilation:

…
.”
I wonder what this production method is for positrons Smith is talking about that he expects to create 5 trillion positrons per second over the next few years.
Bob Clark
Let’s not also forget that the positrons being produced are simply by blasting away at gold foil; research into nano-tweaked foils which will more efficiently distribute laser energy, increased scaling of laser emitters (which has been previously mentioned), and better energy efficiency of energy storage devices (especially as lasers are not always terribly efficient) will also increase the output of positrons. As for storage of these positively charged particles, I believe two concentric spherical shells with an appropriate dielectric in between them (spherical capacitor) would be sufficient to store them without expending much energy.
To lower the required onboard antimatter fuel I propose researching the interactions of antimatter with Bose Einstein Condensates.
It’s said that BEC in many ways behave as a single superatom due to overlapping wavefunctions etc,
what I would like to know just how far extends this superatrom behaviour?
Could it be possible that if we aim an antimatter particle at a cluster of atoms condensed into a BEC, the antimatter would not only annihilate a matching atom, but kill the whole entangled cluster.
It would be like killing 100.000 birds with one stone and shift the engineering/economical challenge from how much antimatter can you produce affordably to less tasking effort of bringing ordinary matter into BEC and add a grain of salt.
All of this highly speculative, but has anyone tried it?
Another way to create antimatter positrons would be to create a positron emitter like sodium-22 or carbon-11 or nitrogen-13 or oxygen-15. The positrons could then be stored in a magnetic trap and reacted with electrons for energy. The only problem is that methods for creating these nuclei that I find tend to be endothermic. One way I can think of creating carbon-11 (I’m not sure if it will work) is nuclear fusion of lithium-6:
Li6 + Li6 -> C11 + n (neutron)
also a proton may be released instead of a neutron, so I’m not sure how efficient it will be, but I looked at the nuclear binding energy of lithium-6 and carbon-11 and it seems that the reaction is exothermic (31.994 MeV per Lithium-6 so 63.989 MeV total for reactants and 73.439 MeV nuclear binding energy for carbon-11 so 9.45 MeV released in the reaction).

Commercially available robotic hands are often expensive, customized for specific platforms, and difficult to modify. It is typically impractical to experiment with alternate end effector designs. This results in researchers needing to compensate in software for intrinsic and pervasive mechanical disadvantages, rather than allowing software and hardware research in manipulation to co-evolve.
This project intends to establish a series of open-source hand designs, and through the contributions of the open-source user community, result in a large number of useful design modifications and variations available to researchers.
While advances in rapid-prototyping have made it increasingly tractable to make custom parts expediently and on-demand, design choices must be made to make robotic hands suitable for repeated functional use, not just design prototyping. Hands developed through this project are designed to be minimalistic and rugged, especially appropriate for iterative design and operation in unstructured environments.
The released hand designs feature tendon-driven underactuated fingers. Underactuated hands have been shown to improve the generality of simple grippers by adaptively conforming to the surface of objects without the explicit need for sensors or complicated feedback systems. This design paradigm separates the actuation and finger elements, enabling a greater degree of customization.
The fingers are fabricated via a process called Hybrid Deposition Manufacturing, which combines resin casting and 3D-printing to create multi-material, monolithic structures. Casting flexure joints and fingerpads increases robustness and minimizes the required number of fasteners.
The source CAD files allow for variable configurations, allowing users to quickly change functional parameters (ie. link lengths, transmission ratios) and manufacturing parameters (ie. shell thicknesses, hole dimensions) and have those changes propagate across all relevant parts..
A more dexterous alternative to the Model T, the Model T42 incorporates two underactuated, flexure-based fingers, each driven independently by either a Dynamixel or hobby servo. This type of hand has been shown to be adept at both in-hand manipulation and precision grasping..
The Multi-Modality (M2) gripper employs a single underactuated finger driven by both agonist and antagonist tendons, as well as a modular thumb that can be swapped out for different tasks. The actuated finger may exhibit either underactuated or fully-actuated behaviors, depending on the actuation scheme. A single-actuator version (Model M) is also available as a minimalist design alternative.
To accommodate the hands listed above, we also provide the designs for a set of mechanical couplings compatible with several of the most popular (and documented) robotic arm platforms.

Pawlenty addressed the Minnesota School Boards Association on Thursday morning. He didn't offer the group much in the way of new initiatives or pledges of per-student funding increases.
Later, the Republican governor told reporters that last year's school funding increase was one of the largest boosts in modern history. He said the $800 million increase in K-12 education spending will probably be it for this two-year budget cycle.
"When you have an economy that is slowing down, and we just gave the schools a total state increase over a two-year period that was about 8 percent," Pawlenty said. "That's a reasonable increase. I think that's the amount of increase they're going to get during this two-year period."
Some school districts did better than others because lawmakers gave an extra boost to those with a high concentration of special education students.
All districts got 2 percent more on the per-pupil allowance for this school year and are line for 1 percent more next fall.
In November, 99 school districts asked voters to raise property taxes as a way to supplement their state aid. It was the highest number of levy votes since 2001, and about two-thirds were successful.
Pawlenty also took questions from high school journalists. He told them he would resist efforts to end Minnesota's participation in the federal No Child Left Behind law.
Several Republican and Democratic lawmakers want Minnesota to stop abiding by the law, which places a heavy emphasis on student testing in reading, math and science.Airloom Oriental Rug Washing Co

1. The Comprehensive Development Framework of the Kyrgyz Republic to 2010 (CDF) has become a concentrated expression of the general development vision of the Kyrgyz Republic. The National Strategy of Poverty Reduction (NSPR) is a medium-term program for implementation of the first CDF phase. Both of these documents identify poverty reduction as the top priority.
2. The government continuously emphasizes the unique process of designing and implementing these programs, which are based on constructive dialogue between all government branches, the civil society, private sector and the donor community for attainment of the identified objectives. Achievements in this area were highly praised by the international organizations. Many donor-assisted international and national workshops, round table discussions and meetings were held as part of this dialogue. Among others, this includes recent held workshops on promotion of private direct investments; improvement of budgeting process and tax policy; and development of mining industry.
3. In the period from June to October this year, the government
has been implementing measures for preparation of the final NSPR document.
The interim NSPR (I-NSPR) document, which will be discussed by the Boards
of the World Bank and IMF, is already being implemented, while we are
taking steps to finalize a final NSPR.
4. A number of important developments occurred in the period
between June and October 2001. The government undertook important
measures to actively continue implementation of reforms, consistent with
the IMF-supported PRGF economic program and the World Bank Country Assistance
Strategy Progress Report.
5. Favorable conditions were being developed for promotion
of entrepreneurship and the private sector. Several legal documents were
approved to simplify taxation of small and medium enterprises, to eliminate
a number of excessive registration and licensing procedures, unjustified
inspections, and to eliminate other obstacles for their development. These
are considered to be important measures since the contribution of the
entire private sector to GDP has recently exceeded 85 percent.
6. Licenses have been canceled for insolvent commercial banks
to facilitate reforms of the financial system and recovery of the banking
sector. Jointly with the National Bank, the Government has developed a
Regulative Response Policy.
7. Substantial work was conducted on budget-tax adjustments
that take into account amendments to the 2001 budget. In August, the government
prepared draft state budget for 2002 which was developed using elements
of program budgeting. Further steps in this direction included September
discussion of budget parameters with IMF mission, as well as submission
for review by both parliament chambers of draft budget law and package
of draft legislature on amendment of Tax Code and amendments aimed at
increasing the budget revenue. On 18 October 2001, the draft budget was
approved in the first hearing of the Assembly of People's Representatives
of the Jogorku Kenesh. The parameters of the projected budget expenditures
for 2002-05, for inclusion in the final NSPR, will be corrected after
the adoption of state budget and the draft legislature. The government
is making considerable efforts to enhance the Social Fund budget and,
starting from 2002, integrate its reporting into the consolidated state
budget.
8. Government measures and active implementation of reforms
have substantially improved macroeconomic indicators. The inflation rate
for January-September 2001 averaged 1.5 percent and compared to December
of last year, stabilization of the Som to U.S. dollar exchange rate is
also notable. The GDP growth rate for 9 month of 2001 amounted to 6.7
percent over the same period of 2000. High growth rate is noted in agriculture
and service sectors. The country experienced positive balance of trade
for January-September 2001. Nevertheless, number of sectors are still
stagnating.
9. To improve institutional framework for finalizing development
and later implementation of the CDF and NSPR strategies, Presidential
Decree established a National CDF Council and Secretariat. Close coordination
of CDF and final NSPR priorities will be one of the principal areas of
Secretariat activities. A Task Force to finalize the NSPR document was
developed; it includes representatives of the President's Administration,
Prime Minister's Office, state agencies, as well as nongovernmental organizations.
10. The following key issues on poverty reduction will be
addressed by the government in the period to 2005 under NSPR: ensure annual
GDP growth rate of 4-5 percent; reduce annual inflation rate to 5
percent; achieve a primary fiscal surplus of 3.5 percent of GDP while
increasing the allocations for social spending in real terms; increase
tax revenue to 15 percent of GDP. Besides, we will further improve
budget management processes.
11. We are intending to increase volume of private micro-lending
as one of the mechanisms for social mobilization and reduction of poverty.
The government guarantees to meet all its social obligations under the
approved budgets and will take measures to annually increase real income
of people.
12. However, in addressing these issues we face real problems
which we hope to successfully tackle, in close cooperation and interaction
with international donor organizations. One of the tasks is to reduce
by 2005 volume of the Public Investment Program (PIP). The Kyrgyz Republic
began active cooperation with international donors to analyze the efficiency
of implementing specific projects in order to bring PIP volume in accordance
with country's capacity to service external debt. By the end of 2001,
we will develop clear criteria for prioritizing various types of capital
investments on the basis of their potential impact on growth, export potential
and reduction of poverty.
13. With ADB technical assistance, we are completing the analysis
of the PIP projects. But much remains to be done in development
of a system to monitor project implementation. We hope to address this
issue with WB support.
14. Due to reduction of the PIP volume we are in the process
of improving the investment climate and thus increase inflow of direct
private (both foreign and domestic) investments and grants for economic
and social development.
15. High level of external debt is one of the main problems
and a principal obstacle to poverty alleviation. The government will continue
to put much effort to reduce the level of external debt. We have adopted
a comprehensive strategy for reduction of external debt. Key elements
of this strategy include requesting concessional external debt restructurings
in the context of the Paris Club.
16. Another complex task for finalization of the NSPR document
is an assessment of the total cost of the program. The solution of this
problem includes identification of priorities that would correspond with
available resources. In relation to this, we have to finalize Medium-Term
Financial Framework to 2005 that will become a foundation for identification
of resources necessary for implementation of the final NSPR strategy.
We hope to receive World Bank assistance in addressing this issue.
17. Another important issue is the need to undertake of poverty
analysis for the latest available survey data. In preparation of the final
NSPR we will use updated poverty data received from the surveys carried
out by the National Statistics Committee. WB support in carrying out complete
poverty analysis will be a major contribution to determining reasons for
the depth and structure of poverty, and will help in elaboration of the
effective measures for reduction of poverty, that will be included in
the final NSPR.
18. The government also considers development of the Monitoring
and Evaluation system to monitor the progress in CDF and NSPR as well
as to monitor and assess development of the country in view of the internal
and external threats and risks. This is very important issue, along with
elaboration of effective preventive measures, to reduce their negative
impact on planned programs. In this area we also hope to receive assistance
from the World Bank and other international organizations.
19. The government plans to complete the development of the
final NSPR document by September 2002. However, all efforts will be made
to finalize the document earlier (by June, 2002). The process will be
carried out in close cooperation and interaction with major international
donor organizations such as IMF, WB and ADB.
20. To finalize the NSPR document the government needs technical
assistance in the following areas:
21. Finalization of the NSPR will be carried out by taking
into account developments of the international as well as national situation.
The impact of September terrorist attacks in the United States and anti-terrorist
military operations in Afghanistan could substantially effect economic
development in Central Asia, including The Kyrgyz Republic over the medium-term.
The experience of our country in the last few years in fighting international
terrorism, armed groups and drug trafficking has caused reduction in foreign
trade, reduction in tourism and service sectors. The attractiveness of
the country for foreign investors and inflow of direct investments have
been directly affected by these developments. Besides, the country will
need considerable additional financial and technical resources to enhance
national security and strengthen borders. Other consequence of military
actions in Afghanistan could include inflow of refugees that will also
require additional financing. At present, we are assessing the possible
impact of these events on the Kyrgyz Republic. Therefore the building
of the system to monitor and evaluate threats to development is necessary
for our country.
22. We are fully support and ready for active cooperation
for implementation of the statement made by leaders of IMF, World Bank
and other leading international financial organizations of October 5,
2001 due to the deterioration of the world economic situation after events
of September 11 in USA.
23. To ensure general coordination and effective response
to the changes in the economic situation as well as to ensure consistency
in national economic policy we have established Economic Policy Council,
which is led by the Prime Minister.
24. The government intends to adopt necessary measures for
mobilization of domestic resources to address these issues, but we need
the full and continuous support of the international community in this
endeavor.Canadians are used to buying expensive smartphones and having them subsidized by agreeing to a long-term contract with a service provider, but what if you could instead buy a phone and receive almost-free service as a result?
That’s the concept behind Palo Alto, Calif.-based Ooma Inc.’s home phone service. It only charges its U.S. and Canada-based home phone subscribers the required telecommunications taxes and fees to operate their network, according to Jim Gustke, the vice president of marketing at Ooma. Now the cloud-computing powered phone service provider is launching its business-focused Ooma Office to the Canadian market, which combines a a Linux-based router with a cloud PBX to deliver its Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phone service.
“We found many of our home phone customers were using their home phone service to run their small business,” Gustke says. “Based on that we decided to go into the small business market place.”
Ooma Office has been available in the U.S. and now its expanding north of the border. The hardware that supports the service is the key differentiator over other VoIP providers, according to Gustke. While its method of prioritizing voice packets over the rest of the network traffic is not patented, Ooma’s upfront charge for its hardware allows it to invest in making the router a higher quality with more features.
“No matter what’s going on with the rest of the network the voice traffic is always priority one,” he says.
Aside from the router, Ooma Office also comes with two DECT radio receivers, the type built into typical cordless phones. These plug into an outlet and become a remote phone jack that works with traditional landline phones and communicates back to the router. It saves businesses from having to run Ethernet cables across the office for their phones, and the jacks can be configured via Ooma’s web-based dashboard.
That dashboard, Ooma Office Manager, allows users to change settings using their web browsers. Users set up the virtual receptionist feature and select what greeting they want callers to hear, set up calling groups, and assign extensions to their phone jacks.
“it’s a do it yourself set-up, you don’t need an IT consultant to come in and set it up for you,” Gustke says. “It literally takes less than 30 minutes… this is really the perfect solution for a micro-business or a business that doesn’t need everyone to have their own phone.”
All the same features available for Ooma Office U.S. are available in Canada, he adds. That includes virtual receptionist, conferencing, hold music, and unlimited calling across Canada and the U.S. Ooma can even direct calls to your cell phone from an extension.
Ooma Office costs $249.99 for the base station and two phone jacks and a $19.98 per month subscription cost. Each addition phone jack can be added for a cost of $9.99 per month, up to five physical jacks.Legal Question in Family Law in Iowa
Last year my ex and I had settled out of court and had a decree for child custody drawn up and filed. This is a year that he is suppose to claim our daughter for taxes but he has not paid me up to date my child support his excuse is because he has not had a job because he is focusing on going back to school.Although I understand and commend him for this effort in the decree we have a stipulation that says if he is not paid in full by January 15th I would get the right to claim by default. I have had a real hard time but he doesn't think I deserve to claim her because I have had a job and he does not. I am her custodial parent but he does get visitation. I tried to get him to sign the required IRS 8332 form but he will not because he is intent on claiming his taxes. My question is can I go ahead and claim her because he is not paid up to date on his child support or because he will not sign this paper and do not have money obviously to take it to court let him go ahead and claim her leaving myself and my financial need for my daughter so that his financial needs can be met?

You can, but if he does as well you're both likely to get audited by the IRS.VIEWS: 10 PAGES: 4 CATEGORY: Politics & History POSTED ON: 5/21/2010 Public Domain
UT100 SERIES OF TEMPERATURE CONTROLLERS MATSUMURA Ken *1 HAMADA Takayuki *1 AKAISHI Hiroshi *1 TANAKA Satoru *1 We have developed the UT100 series of temperature controllers. In contrast to the existing Green series of digital indicating controllers which can cover a wide range of process control, the UT100 series controllers are low priced and are intended mainly for temperature control. The UT100 controller is a traditional PID controller that features the newly developed auto-turning control function, Omakase, which permits optimum control with the same degree of ease as operating a thermostat. Moreover, in spite of being a low price controller, the models of the UT100 series have a variety of functions including a universal power supply, universal input, PID control, ON/OFF control, heating/cooling control, and optional communication capability. This paper describes the main specifications, Omakase (auto-turning control function), cost-saving design, and how to produce a variety of products in a short leadtime. INTRODUCTION function that enabled the controller to be ready for operation immediately after installation. I n recent years, the restrictions of ISO14001 standards and HACCP have meant that temperature control and monitoring have become a necessity in a wider range of fields. Together with the demand for high-precision control performance, has come the need for increased diversity in terms of input sensors, control methods, and manipulated-variable output signals, as well as improved ease of operability. Table 1 shows the main specifications of the UT100 series. The universal power supply, universal input, and a variety of outputs and options allow the UT100 series to be applied in a wide range of temperature control applications. Furthermore, the UT100 series boasts a large, easy-to-see LED display (see Figure 1), which conforms to various safety standards as well as the EMC standard (CE, CSA, and UL). The main purpose for the development of the UT100 series was to create a compact temperature controller at a low price which incorporated numerous functions including a self-tuning *1 Yokogawa M&C Corporation Figure 1 External View of UT100 Series UT100 Series of Temperature Controllers 27 Table 1 Basic Specifications of UT100 Series (1) Power ON Model UT130 UT150 UT152 UT155 (2) Setpoint value is changed.

Britt is using offseason workouts to practice shooting with his right hand after attempting jump shots using his left, Raleigh TV station WTVD first reported. The rising sophomore has a hitch in shooting motion when he tries from distance with his left hand.
The change is a gamble Britt probably felt he needed to make given that he sank only three shots from behind the arc all season as a freshman and that he shot 36.7 percent from the field. Those are percentages in need of improvement if Britt is going to compete for playing time in a backcourt that also features all-ACC point guard Marcus Paige and fellow guards Luke Davis, Stilman White and incoming freshman Joel Berry.. One of the few guards comfortable using either hand is Drexel's Tavon Allen, who shoots foul shots and 3-pointers mostly with his left and pull-up jump shots inside the arc primarily with his right.
Before he got to North Carolina, Britt spent a year at Oak Hill Academy and shot with either hand from inside 10 feet, coach Steve Smith told the Fayetteville Observer. Smith added that Britt's "shooting form is much better right-handed," which surely gives the Tar Heels hope that this could be a useful switch.
From his ball handling to his passing to his ability to finish at the rim, Britt did a lot of things well during his first season in Chapel Hill. If his shooting ever improves too, North Carolina could have itself another very nice point guard.

Is this really the limited understanding that new lawyers have of their profession? Can they possible think so small and grasp so little?
The teaching of evidence in law school is not in anticipation of someone being a litigator. Granted, it is absolutely required for a litigator, and especially for a trial lawyer, but that’s not where it ends. Knowledge and understanding of evidence is a core competency for every niche (read that clearly, every niche) in the practice of law. Yes, M&A. Even real estate closings and wills. Multinational contracts. You name it, you still need to know evidence. Why? Because every aspect of law entails a potential of dispute leading to litigation. Any lawyer who doesn’t comprehend evidence cannot competently perform his function.
If nothing else, the concepts of relevance and materiality are basic to thinking like a lawyer. If you don’t get them, you can’t think. You can’t reason. You can’t understand things the way a lawyer must.
The Canadian law school experience is disturbingly similar. (more…)Weddings at the Guildhall

James Younger Gang summary: The James-Younger Gang was notorious in the latter part of the 1860’s. It was located in Missouri. Most of their unlawfulness centered on robberies. The gang consisted of the James brothers, Jesse James and his older brother Alexander Franklin “Frank” James. Sometimes the Younger brothers, Jim, John, Bob and Cole Younger would join the gang temporarily. Other members would be part of the gang at one time or another. These included John Jarrette who was Jesse James’ brother-in-law, Clel Miller, Arthur McCoy, Matthew Nelson, Charlie Pitts, and Bill Chadwell.
This notorious gang was the outgrowth of men who had known each other the bushwhackers of the Civil War. When the war was over, these were among the men who seemed not to fit into society any longer. They took to robbing banks to support themselves. While they were not very organized at first, some of them drifting together by chance, they soon became a gang that had grown and learned from their mistakes.
While the gang was in Northfield, Minnesota, a Swedish immigrant farmer was killed by a bullet as the gang was trying to rob the bank. The assistant cashier inside the bank would not open the vault for the gang and was shot for his refusal. All the gang got from their robbery attempt was a bag full of nickels. After this failure, they decided to go their separate ways to elude the police.
Eventually, a gun battle ensued between the James Gang and the police. One bullet killed Pitts and others caught the Younger brothers but not killing them. Eventually, the Younger brothers were sentenced to life in prison. Jesse James was killed by one of his own gang members.
During their outlaw careers, the James brothers and the Younger brothers dealt in fine-blooded stock, raced thoroughbreds and rode beautiful American Saddlebreds. All were expert horsemen, always paying careful attention to their animals, which were essential tools of their ‘business.’ Also essential to the West’s most famous outlaw brothers’ success was the support of a circle of trusted friends. Included in those supporters were such prominent and influential families as the Hudspeths, who raised stock and bred horses on their vast landholdings in JacksonCounty, Missouri. Among the most outspoken was Virginia-born newspaper editor John Newman Edwards, who had been Confederate General Joseph O. Shelby’s adjutant during the Civil War..
After the Civil War, other ex-guerrillas — who had ridden with the notorious William Quantrill and ‘Bloody Bill’ Anderson — were as well known as the Jameses and Youngers. Some were recruited as gang members. These men were not only known in Missouri but also in a wide area across the South from Kentucky to Texas. The gang’s base, where the leaders recruited and planned, was the farm of Frank and Jesse’s wealthy uncle, George W. Hite, at Adairville, in Kentucky’s Logan County, 10 miles from Russellville, scene of an 1868 bank robbery. The James boys’ father, Robert, was born in Logan County and graduated from Georgetown College near Midway, Woodford County. Their mother, Zerelada Cole James Samuels, was born at Midway. After meeting and marrying in Kentucky, they had moved to Missouri in the early 1840s.
From February 13, 1866, through the September 7, 1876, Northfield raid in Minnesota, the James-Younger Gang reportedly robbed 12 banks, five trains, five stagecoaches and the gate cash box of the ticket booth at the Kansas City Exposition. A network of friends showed sympathy and support for Frank and Jesse even after the famous fiasco at Northfield. Others, though, turned against the boys — not only those people who could no longer see them simply as ‘victims’ of Northern aggression and big business, but also personal acquaintances and even some new gang members.

In such a dangerous line of work, the old gang could not last forever. Gang member Oll Shepard was killed in 1868 at Lee’s Summit. Brothers Bill (‘Bud’) and Tom McDaniel were captured and killed in 1874 and ’75, respectively. Tom Webb, alias Jack Keene, was captured in Kentucky with Tom McDaniel. Up in Minnesota, Clell Miller, Bill Chadwell (alias Bill Stiles) and Charlie Pitts (alias Sam Wells) were killed, while brothers Cole, Jim and Bob Younger were wounded, captured and imprisoned for a quarter of a century in the state penitentiary. Thus, in 1879, when Frank and Jesse James resumed their criminal careers in Tennessee and Kentucky, no old gang members were available. The loyal network of friends, however, provided them alibis and gave them sanctuary as Frank and Jesse lived freely using aliases — ‘Ben J. Woodson’ and sportsman ‘Tom Davis Howard.’
The James-Younger Gang always rode in style. Newspaper accounts of the gang’s robberies often reported that the outlaws were mounted on the finest horseflesh in Kentucky. The boys took great pride in their horses, too. According to the Little Rock Daily Gazette, when traveling on a raid, the gang usually rode ‘two abreast about one hundred yards apart. One man would lead a horse, and he being the odd man, would ride at the rear.’ This practice, which allowed one horse to rest while the others were ridden, was mentioned by eyewitnesses after the train robbery near Gads Hill, Mo., on January 31, 1874., W.Va.,.
The James and Younger boys considered themselves sporting men (Frank and Jesse’s cover in Nashville from 1877 to 1881; Jesse James was co-owner of the racehorse Jim Malone, which won $5,000 in 26 starts in 1880-81). Alexander Frank James, who was born on January 10, 1843, and Jesse Woodson James, who was born on September 27, 1847, learned to ride and appreciate horses in the 1850s — and those lessons paid off in the 1860s. During the war and their postwar criminal careers, good horses meant the difference between freedom and capture, life and death. Horses were also a lot of fun. Frank and Jesse were no strangers to the health resorts frequented by the wealthy sporting crowd of their day — such as Monegaw Springs in St. Clair County, Mo., and Hot Springs, Ark., where there was horse racing. The Daily Gazette and John Gould Fletcher’s book Arkansas reported that the outlaws had been seen at the springs before the January 15, 1874, stagecoach robbery on the road between Hot Springs and Malvern, Ark. By the early 1870s, Frank and Jesse were also going to Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and Long Branch, N.J., (Monmouth Park racetrack opened near there on July 30, 1870) to run their thoroughbreds. A picture of Jesse was taken at the Long Branch resort. Records in Kirk’s Guide to the Turf show Jesse James’ horse Skyrocket, which was foaled on April 12, 1873, near Midway, Ky., raced at Monmouth Park in 1875-76.
In the meantime, the Youngers were racing thoroughbreds in Missouri, Louisiana, Texas and Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). Their knowledge of racehorses also went back to their childhood. According to the March 26, 1874, Louisville Courier-Journal and the May 8, 1901, Chicago Tribune, their grandfather Charles Younger, who had moved his family to Crab Orchard, Ky., from Virginia, was a man ‘of wealth and sporting proclivities, owning stock, and of the anti-emancipation aristocracy.’ The family eventually moved to Missouri, where Charles’ son Henry Washington Younger married Bursheba Fristoe of Independence in 1830. The family home (and Cole Younger’s birthplace) was Big Creek, southeast of Lee’s Summit.
Sometime in 1869, according to an article in the March 27, 1875, Chicago Tribune, a horse race led to some trouble for Cole Younger in Louisiana, where he had lived for a time shortly after the Civil War and still had plenty of friends. Younger, according to the article, put every dollar he had — $700 — on his own horse, ‘one of the famous long-limbed, blue-grass breed of racers, an animal not fair to look upon but of great speed.’ Younger’s horse had a comfortable lead until someone came out of the crowd waving a cloth, causing the horse to lose its stride and finish second. When Younger refused to pay up, he found himself opposed by an angry mob. His response, according to the newspaper, was to draw two Dragoon revolvers and empty them into the crowd before dashing away. ‘Three of the crowd were killed outright, two died of their wounds, and five carry to this day the scars of that terrible revenge,’ the newspaper reported, adding that the deadly affair previously had been ‘apparently overlooked in the crimes attributed to [the Youngers] by the press.’ Whatever happened that day didn’t keep Cole Younger out of the state. According to a letter published in the November 30, 1874, St. Louis Republican, Cole claimed that he was in Louisiana’s Carrol Parish from December 1, 1873, to February 8, 1874, and thus could not have participated in three alleged James-Younger crimes — stagecoach robberies at Shreveport, La., (January 8, 1874) and Hot Springs, Ark., and the train robbery at Gads Hill, Mo. That March, the Louisville Courier-Journal ran an article stating that Cole and his brothers ‘all are good-looking, manly, and to a certain degree accomplished gentlemen. They would be accepted at any hotel or on any Mississippi steamer and hardly [be] taken for what they are — desperadoes without pity or fear.’ In short, the Younger boys, like the James brothers, had solid roots and were anything but antisocial loners. They were well educated and of aristocratic origin, with the manners of gentlemen. One of those gentlemen, John Younger, the brother of Cole, Bob and Jim, was killed by a Pinkerton Detective agent in a shootout near Monegaw Springs on March 17, 1874.
The James-Younger connection with Joseph Orville Shelby is well known. Born in Lexington, Ky., in 1830, Shelby was a boyhood playmate of John Hunt Morgan, who became a prominent Confederate raider in Kentucky. Shelby, whose family was related to the first governor of Kentucky, Isaac Shelby (1750–1826), rose to brigadier general in the Confederate Army. He served in every major Civil War campaign west of the Mississippi River, including the disastrous Missouri campaign in 1864. John Newman Edwards, whom he had befriended in Lexington, became his adjutant. Both Shelby and Edwards came to admire the courage of Frank James and the other Missouri guerrillas who were resisting Union forces. Frank was one of the guerrillas who saved General Shelby from capture on December 7, 1862, at the Battle of Prairie Grove, Ark. After Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered in April 1865, Shelby relocated to Mexico to offer his military services to Emperor Maximilian. Although Maximilian was soon shot by a firing squad, Shelby prospered in Tuxpan, Mexico. In 1867, he returned to Missouri, still a Confederate at heart. Almost certainly he harbored Frank and Jesse James when they were being pursued. Shelby owned 1,000-acre Travelers Rest, nine miles from Lexington, Mo., in Lafayette County, and he also owned 960 acres at Adrian in Missouri’s Bates County. He was one of the largest wheat growers and landowners in the state.
When Frank James went to trial in Gallatin, Mo., in August 1883 for his actions (he had allegedly killed passenger Frank McMillan) during the July 15, 1881, Winston, Mo., train robbery, Edwards was still urging in the newspapers for all to be forgotten and for Frank to be acquitted. And Shelby was still in Frank’s corner, testifying as a character witness for his old friend. Shelby said that he had seen Jesse James in November 1880 but hadn’t known that Jesse was wanted by the authorities. Shelby added, ‘The last time Jesse was at my house was at Page City, in the fall of 1881, where I saw Frank James in 1872, which was the last time I saw him.’ The lead prosecuting attorney, William H. Wallace, questioned Shelby about a waybill the old general had signed for Frank’s wife, Annie Ralston James, in the spring of 1881. Drunk at the time of his testimony, Shelby didn’t like that line of questioning and threatenedWallace. The next day, he apologized to the court for his earlier behavior, but Judge Charles H.S. Goodman still fined him $10. After court had finished, Shelby again tried to intimidateWallace, this time outside the courtroom.
In 1894, President Grover Cleveland appointed Shelby the U.S. marshal for the Western District of Missouri. Shelby died in office on February 13, 1897, at Adrian and was buried with full military honors in Kansas City’s Forrest Hill Cemetery on February 17. ‘Thousands of people lined the streets through which the procession passed,’ the Lexington Morning Herald reported the next day. ‘The sermon was preached by Rev. S.M. Neil of the Presbyterian Church and there was an address by Judge John Finis Phillips of the U.S. Circuit Court, a lifetime friend of the deceased.’ Judge Phillips had been part of the legal team at Frank James’ trial in Gallatin, and in 1915 he would give the eulogy at Frank’s funeral.
Far less well known is the James brothers’ connection with James H. Workman, a prominent resident of Union Township in Missouri’s Nodaway County. The parents of James Workman were among the first settlers of Nodaway, having migrated there from Indiana. James became a noted horse breeder, and his brother William was a wealthy landowner and respected citizen in the county. Although perhaps somewhat reluctantly, James Workman bought and dealt in blooded horseflesh with the James-Younger Gang, which paid him in $20 gold pieces. The gang sometimes camped in thick timber near Clear Creek, which bordered the Workman farm, west of Pickering. Four gang members, most likely Frank and Jesse James, Cole Younger and Clell Miller, may have been at that location before riding north into Iowa in early June 1871 to rob the Ocobock Brothers’ Bank in Corydon.
The gang’s inner circle of friends also included, to name a few, Howard County (Mo.) resident John McCorkle, an ex-guerrilla who had befriended Cole Younger and Frank James and later wrote Three Years With Quantrill; former Confederate Colonel Robert McCulloch, who lived near Boonville, where ‘The Great Cole Younger and Frank James Historical Wild West’ show performed on September 2, 1903; former Confederate Captain Warren Carter Bronaugh, a Missourian who worked hard to get the Younger brothers paroled from the Minnesota State Penitentiary at Stillwater; and, as mentioned earlier, the extended Hudspeth family of the ‘Six Mile Country’ (between Independence and Lake City) in Jackson County, Mo.
According to Through the Years With the Hudspeths, a three-volume family genealogy by Anna Ford, Major William Hudspeth had migrated to Missouri by 1828. He had been a soldier in both the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 and had founded Franklin, Ky. William was also considered a sportsman, bringing with him to Missouri a fine collection of foxhounds (the Hudspeth hounds later became famous, thanks to the efforts of a grandson, Thomas Benton Hudspeth). The major and his wife, Tabitha, whom he married in 1801, had 11 children — Nathan Beall, Thomas Jefferson, Sylvia, Joseph W., Missouri L., Silas Burke, Benoni Morgan, Joel Ephriam, George Washington, Robert Nichols and Malinda Paralee. The Hudspeth Settlement, as it was first known, was established at what is now Lake City, Mo. Robert Nichols ‘Bob’ Hudspeth, who never married, gave land for the small town. His house was about eight miles northeast of Independence. When he died in 1885, he owned 1,500 acres of land, which was being used for raising stock and farming. During the Civil War, Robert Hudspeth had served briefly with Quantrill, and Frank James was a good friend. Robert and brother Silas, who owned a 120-acre farm, supplied the James-Younger Gang with valuable horses and allowed their homes to be used as hideouts. Frank James’ only son, Robert Franklin (1878–1964), was named for Robert Hudspeth, according to descendant Joe Elsea, whose great-grandfather was Joel ‘Rufus’ Hudspeth (1839–1895).
Rufus Hudspeth was one of the children of Joseph W. Hudspeth, who had married his first cousin Amanda in 1830 and become a prosperous Jackson County farmer. After Amanda died in 1850, Joseph married Louise (Rice) Brown, and they had one more child — Joseph Lamartine (‘Lam’) Hudspeth. Rufus, who played with Frank and Jesse when they all were schoolboys, was one of several Hudspeths to serve in Quantrill’s guerrilla band, while other family members harbored the Rebel raiders. Rufus also later served under General Shelby and Maj. Gen. Sterling Price. After the war, Rufus went to Kentucky with Quantrill, but he returned to Missouri in 1865, married Sarah Franklin the next year, had four children — Joseph, Mary Amanda (Elsea), Elvira Beall (Chiles) and Charles B. — and became a prominent farmer and stockman. Rufus’ brother William Napoleon ‘Babe’ Hudspeth also served with Quantrill. After the war, Babe married Nannie Ragland of Independence and built a large two-story Victorian home that still stands in Lake City, which was then a thriving community with stockyards and a racetrack.
Other sons of Major William Hudspeth living nearby included George Washington Hudspeth and Joel Ephriam Hudspeth, who inherited the family farm. An 1877 history of Jackson County states: ‘It is probable that no finer nor a more extensive view of the surrounding country can be obtained than from the hill upon which the residence of Joel E. Hudspeth is located. It overlooks the Valley of the Blue. Its landscape is in its rural beauty.’ Many of the Hudspeths vacationed at Monegaw Springs, where James-Younger Gang members were known to hang out.
A strong connection between the gang and Hudspeths, if not already known by the authorities, became obvious from the testimony of former gang member James Andrew ‘Dick’ Liddil at the 1883 Gallatin trial of Frank James. Liddil, who once rode with Quantrill, had been part of Jesse James’ new gang, beginning with the October 8, 1879, train robbery at Glendale, Mo., and then had surrendered to the sheriff of Clay County on January 24, 1882. Liddil told the law most of what he knew about the gang, but his surrender was not publicized, so as not to alert Jesse James. The news didn’t become public until March 31. At his St. Joseph, Mo., home on the morning of April 2, 1882, Jesse read about it and supposedly commented that Liddil was a traitor who deserved to be hanged. Shortly thereafter, Bob Ford fired a shot heard around Missouri and beyond — the ball struck Jesse in the back of the head, killing the famous outlaw.
During his testimony at Frank James’ trial in 1883, Liddil said that after the Glendale train robbery, he, Jesse James and Ed Miller rode into the Six-Mile Country and went to Bob Hudspeth’s farm. From there, Liddil said he traveled about two miles to the 40-acre farm of Lamartine Hudspeth. Liddil had worked for Bob Hudspeth in 1870–75, and he testified in 1883 that he had lived at Bob’s ‘off and on for nine years.’ There, he added, he had become acquainted with John Younger and Jesse and Frank James, who often stayed around ‘a day or a night or two nights.’ Liddil told of the time he had been ‘riding a horse of Bob Hudspeth’s, which I had [taken to] Lake City for the purpose of running a race.’ He ran two heats before he was chased from the area by Deputy Marshal Ed Lee. Liddil then returned to Bob Hudspeth’s home to put the horse in the stable. From there, Liddil’struck out on foot, and next day went to Ben Murrow’s [place], who knew I was dodging the officers, and bought a horse from him in trade.’ Ben Hudspeth Murrow’s mother was Major Hudspeth’s oldest daughter, Silvia. During the war, Ben had served under General Shelby and had later joined Quantrill. Liddil also said that in 1879 he met with Jesse James, Wood Hite, George Hite, Ed Miller, Daniel ‘Tucker’ Bassham and Bill Ryan at Murrow’s 56-acre home (built by the Hudspeths in 1830) west of Buckner, Mo. Ben Murrow would be a pallbearer at the 1882 funeral of Jesse James and the 1915 funeral of Frank James.
Lamartine Hudspeth (1858–1915) also received further mention in Liddil’s testimony. Liddil said that he bought a chestnut sorrel horse from Lamartine before the Winston train robbery on July 15, 1881. Lamartine lived in Lake City, but he owned a beautiful racing stallion named John Morgan and he attended horse races at Louisville and New Orleans. In The Complete and Authentic Life of Jesse James, Carl Breihan noted that a fresh horse was always waiting for Jesse at the Hudspeth stable. ‘On some mornings when Lamartine went out to the barn,’ Breihan wrote, ‘the fresh horse was gone and standing in its place was a tired animal that Jesse [or Frank] had left.’ After Jesse James was killed, Lamartine Hudspeth was one of the people called upon to identify the body. Lamartine later ran into his own serious trouble with the law. On November 25, 1899, he went on trial for killing Joe Kesner, a married railroad station agent who had apparently been showing too much interest in Lamartine’s niece. Lamartine’s attorney was Arthur N. Adams, considered the best in Jackson County at the time, and Lamartine was acquitted.
The Hudspeths sometimes bred their horses with the horses of another prominent Jackson County family, the Chiles. Jim Crow Chiles and Kit Chiles were both members of Quantrill’s raiders, while William Chiles was an early member of the James-Younger Gang. Bill Chiles was one of the men suspected of holding up the Clay County Savings Association bank in Liberty, Mo., on February 13, 1866. Although Jim Crow Chiles may never have ridden with the James boys, he became involved in a dispute with gang member and ex-guerrilla Payne Jones, whom he caught stealing a valuable horse from him before the gang robbed the Daviess County Savings Association in Gallatin on December 7, 1869. Jim Crow’s name also surfaced after the ticket booth at the Kansas City Exposition was robbed on September 26, 1872. Jesse James was one of the accused men, prompting him to write a letter to the Kansas City Times in October, denying his involvement. Among other things, Jesse wrote: ‘It is generally talked about in Liberty, Clay County, that Mr. James Chiles, of Independence, said that it was me and Cole and John Younger that robbed the gate, for he saw us and talked to us on the road to Kansas City the day of September 26th. I know very well that Mr. Chiles did not say so, for he has not seen me for three months, and I will be under many obligations to him if he will drop a few lines to the public, and let it know that he never said such a thing.’ Jim Chiles did respond with a letter, in which he denied seeing Jesse or the two Youngers on or near the date of the robbery. That November, Cole Younger wrote a letter to the St. Louis Republican denying his own involvement, but in detailing his movements on the day of the robbery, he said he had had a long talk with Chiles at the Big Blue River and had spent the night at Silas Hudspeth’s place in Jackson County. Bill Chiles’ son, Ike, was in the Saddlebred business for many years. One horse bred by the Chiles family was known as Jesse James’ Mare. They also bred the Saddlebred mare Mary Low, whose sire was Lamartine Hudspeth’s stallion John Morgan.
After Jesse James was killed, the Hudspeths continued to support Frank James. Frank’s 1883 murder trial in Gallatin, Mo., lasted 16 days, and he was acquitted after the jury deliberated for 3 1/2 hours. Because Dick Liddil had implicated Frank in the March 11, 1881, holdup of a paymaster in Muscle Shoals, Ala., Frank also stood trial in Huntsville, Ala. That trial lasted 10 days in April 1884, and again Frank was declared not guilty. Once back in Missouri, he faced charges for the July 7, 1876, train robbery at Otterville, because a captured gang member, Hobbs Kerry, had fingered him long ago. However, just two days before the trial was scheduled to begin in Kansas City in February 1885, the case was dropped because evidence was missing and there were no living witnesses available. Frank James was now clear of all charges in Missouri, and newly elected Governor John Sappington Marmaduke, a onetime Confederate general, had no intention of turning the former guerrilla over to Minnesota authorities to stand trial for the Northfield robbery. Marmaduke, according to newspaperman Edwards, had merely advised Frank to go to work on a farm and ‘to keep out of the newspapers. Keep away from fairs and fast horses, and keep strictly out of sight for a year.’
Over the next 30 years, Frank James would continue to be welcome whenever he made a visit to one of the Hudspeth homes in Lake City. On January 8, 1897, the former outlaw was in St. Louis when he wrote a letter to Mrs. Malinda Paralee Hudspeth Wood, the youngest daughter of Major William Hudspeth:.
George Hudspeth died six years after the letter was written. Babe Hudspeth died in 1907. Malinda Paralee, to whom Frank wrote the 1897 letter, died in 1913, two years before Lamartine Hudspeth and Frank James himself died. Ben Hudspeth Murrow lived until 1916, as did Cole Younger. During their criminal careers and afterward, the James and Younger brothers had an inner circle of good friends, and few were better than the Hudspeths, faithful to the end.

Liberty, Missouri has a nice ring to it and will no doubt be remembered for as long as folks recall the Wild West’s most famous anti-establishment rebels–the James (or James-Younger) Gang. It was on February 13, 1866, that at least a dozen former Southern guerrilla soldiers, including Frank James and Cole Younger, held up the Clay County Savings Association in Liberty. Jesse James was recovering from wounds suffered as a Confederate guerrilla and probably wasn’t able to help brother Frank and Cole, but the Liberty bank job is considered the James-Younger Gang’s first robbery.
Adair, Iowa, might not have the same ring to it, but it was there on July 21,1873, more than seven years after the Liberty holdup, that another James-Younger first occurred–the gang’s first train robbery. Using their wartime guerrilla skills–riding and shooting and eluding the enemy–the boys may have robbed as many as nine banks before they got around in 1873 to tapping into this new, lucrative source of treasure, the railroad industry.
Actually, the James brothers and the Younger brothers were not the first post-Civil War train robbers in the country. Another set of brothers, the Renos, had held up an Ohio & Mississippi passenger train near Seymour, Ind., in October 1866. The Reno Gang struck again in May 1868 at Marshfield, Ind., but its third attempt at a train robbery bombed that July outside Brownstown, Ind. Within two years of the Renos’ first train robbery, the Pinkerton Detective Agency, with help from local vigilantes, had destroyed the gang.
Apparently no outlaw gang was strong enough or bold enough during the next five years to take on the railroad industry. But the railroads were routinely transporting millions of dollars in gold, silver and greenbacks, and even though the Jameses and the Youngers had made out quite well robbing small-town banks, they must have envisioned greater profits by stopping trains. In any case, by the summer of 1873, they were ready to attempt the first train holdup west of the Mississippi. Such a robbery did have a few advantages over bank jobs. They could stop a train at a point of their own choosing, and by destroying the nearest telegraph office to delay news of the robbery, they would not have to immediately contend with a posse. Also, they would have the element of surprise working for them–at least the first time.
The trouble with train robberies, especially after the James-Younger Gang reinitiated them wholesale, was that the railroads put armed guards on their trains and kept the schedules for their big shipments of bullion and currency a secret. For that reason, the gang found it necessary to spy on the railroads for information about valuable cargoes and accompanying guards. When the famous Missouri outlaws struck at Adair, they started a veritable war with the powerful railroads and their detectives.
The James-Younger Gang’s first train robbery did not come close to matching the monetary haul of its first bank robbery. In fact, the $60,000 taken at Liberty was most likely more money than was collected in any of the gang’s later robberies. The previous year, Confederate soldiers had robbed a bank in St. Albans, Vt., but the heist in Liberty is considered the first successful peacetime daylight bank robbery in U.S history.
Liberty only seemed to whet the gang’s appetite for loot. Within 15 months, three more banks in Missouri were held up, though Jesse and Frank James may not have participated in any of those robberies. The James boys, as well as Cole Younger, most likely did rob a bank in Russellville, Ky., in March 1868. After a bank holdup in Gallatin, Mo., in December 1869, the Jameses became the chief suspects in that and other crimes. As the gang fled Gallatin, Jesse James was unseated from his horse and forced to double up on Frank’s horse. Later, the fine-blooded horse left behind was recognized as belonging to Jesse James of Kearney, Mo. The James-Younger Gang went on to rob banks in Corydon, Iowa; Columbia, Ky.; and Ste. Genevieve, Mo., before it got around to working on the railroads.
In July 1873 the gang learned of a big gold shipment being sent by rail from Cheyenne, Wyoming Territory. The outlaws–now probably including Cole Younger’s brothers Jim, John and Bob–planned to strike the eastbound Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific train outside Adair, Iowa, and rode into that town about July 18. Posing as businessmen, they picked up information about the train schedule and also explored the rails. On July 21, they were camped near a blind curve along the line. Before dark, according to the Leavenworth Daily Times, they pulled up several railroad spikes holding down a rail on one side of the curve. They then hitched a large rope around the end of the loosened track and waited. At dusk, they heard the loud puffing of a steam locomotive approaching their position. As the ground trembled under their feet, the bandits tugged at the rope, pulling the rail inward and out of alignment.
Aboard the train, engineer John Rafferty peered down the track through the twilight, alert as he entered a sharp curve in the line. Then there were shots, and a bullet tore through the engineer’s right thigh. Rafferty threw the engine into reverse, but it was too late. His engine lurched off the track, crashed into a ditch and toppled on its side, breaking his neck. The fireman, Dennis Foley, was badly burned but survived. A towering cloud of steam and smoke spewed from the wrecked locomotive. Wearing masks, the outlaws quickly approached the stalled cars. They broke into the U.S. Express Company’s safe but found only about $2,000. According to the Daily Times, 3 1/2 tons of gold and silver bullion was also on the train but was apparently too heavy for the outlaws to carry away. (Later accounts of the robbery maintain that a following train carried the bullion.) Disgusted, the bandits moved among the passengers, lifting wallets, jewelry and valuables before they took off, heading south.
The outlaws’ trail led straight into Missouri. Several people in the area of the robbery said that two of the outlaws looked like Frank and Jesse James. In response, on December 20, 1873, Jesse James wrote the St. Louis Dispatch from Deer Lodge, Montana Territory, denying the brothers’ complicity in that and other crimes. If Missouri Governor Silas Woodson would promise them protection, Jesse wrote, ‘we can prove before any fair jury in the state that we have been accused falsely and unjustly. The protection would be from a mob, or from a requisition from the Governor of Iowa, which is the same thing.
Just over a month after that letter was written, the James-Younger Gang targeted a train at Gad’s Hill, Mo., a flag stop 120 miles south of St. Louis on the Iron Mountain Railroad line. About 4:45 p.m. on January 31, 1874, five bandits armed with Navy Colt revolvers and double-barreled shotguns captured the stationmaster and flagged down the Little Rock Express. Conductor C.A. Alford later described the outlaws to a St. Louis Republican reporter as tall men dressed in Federal Army overcoats and wearing white cloth masks with holes for eyes and nose. One of the bandits had grabbed Alford by the collar and told him, Stand still or I’ll blow the top of your head off! The passengers, who were gaping out the windows, were warned that if anyone fired a gun, the conductor would be killed.
Boarding the train, the bandits relieved the 25 passengers of their money and jewelry, preying especially on what they scornfully called the plug-hat gentlemen. Each male passenger was asked tauntingly if he was Mr. Pinkerton, whom the outlaws said they wanted. After rifling the mailbags and robbing the Adams Express safe, one of the bandits, thought to be Jesse James, handed engineer William Wetton (or somebody else, accounts differ) a whimsical press release titled A true account of this present affair. It! (Jesse had conveniently allowed for the railroad to fill in the amount lost, but apparently that was never done.) A 25-man posse formed the next day but was unable to follow the outlaws’ trail.
The first train robbery in Missouri had gone off seemingly without a hitch–nobody had been killed at Gad’s Hill, and the outlaws had enjoyed themselves. However, because registered mail had been taken, the Pinkertons were immediately called in to track down the robbers. Pinkerton agent John W. Whicher arrived at Liberty on March 10, 1874, and consulted with D.J. Adkins, president of the local Commercial Bank, and O.P. Moss, a former sheriff, about his plans. He told them that he intended to obtain a farmhand’s job at the Samuels’ farm (the farm of the Jameses’ stepfather and the boys’ hangout). When the opportunity was ripe, he said, he would capture the outlaws. Both of the local men cautioned Whicher against such a bold plan. Moss told him, The old woman [the James boys' fiery mother, Zerelda] would kill you if the boys don’t. The cocky 26-year-old detective would hear no more. After getting directions to the Samuels’ farm, Whicher dressed up as a farm laborer (though he was described as having a tender complexion and hands like a city fellow) and, at 5:15 p.m., boarded a slow freight taking him to within four miles of the farm. Unfortunately for Whicher, the James boys had already been alerted, most likely by banker Adkins. Whicher’s body was found the next morning, south of the Missouri River near Independence, Mo. He had been shot through the head and heart, and a rope dangled from his neck.
Meanwhile, two other Pinkertons were hot on the trail of the Youngers in St. Clair County. On March 15, 1874, agents Louis Lull (using the name W.J. Allen) and James Wright (also known as John Boyle)–accompanied by a part-time deputy sheriff from Osceola, Mo., Edwin B. Daniels–set out from Osceola for Roscoe. After staying at the Roscoe House hotel that evening, the three left the next afternoon for the farm of Theodrick Snuffer, a family friend of the Youngers, some three miles out of town. Wright fell back out of sight as Lull and Daniels approached the farmhouse. Snuffer came out to talk to the two men, who posed as cattle buyers. John and James Younger watched the exchange from Snuffer’s attic. The two strangers in the yard were well armed and suspicious looking. When they departed to rejoin Wright, the two Younger brothers followed them.
When the Youngers were within shouting distance of Lull, Wright and Daniels, John Younger ordered the trio to halt. Wright panicked and put spurs to his horse. Jim Younger fired at him, shooting his hat off, but Wright kept on going. Lull and Daniels turned around slowly in the road. The Youngers told the two cattle buyers to throw down their guns and then questioned them about what they were doing in this part of the country. Rambling around, Lull replied. An argument ensued, and John Younger leveled his shotgun at Daniels. Lull saw his chance. He pulled a No. 2 Smith & Wesson from inside his coat and shot John Younger in the neck. Recoiling, the wounded Younger fired both barrels of his shotgun at Lull, striking him in the left arm. Lull’s horse now bolted eastward, with John Younger in pursuit. As Lull attempted to regain his reins, John rode beside him and fired twice, one of the bullets tearing into Lull’s left side. The detective’s horse then charged into a thicket, where a low limb stripped Lull from the saddle. Meanwhile, John turned back toward his brother, rode a few yards, and tumbled into the road dead. By that time, Jim Younger had killed Daniels and had received a flesh wound in his hip. The seriously wounded Lull was taken to Roscoe later that evening, but he died within six weeks.
The deaths of Whicher and Lull enraged William Pinkerton, head of the detective agency, and the Pinkertons began accusing the gang’s Missouri friends of harboring and supporting the outlaws. Newspapers debated the issue. Missouri Governor Woodson hired secret agents J.W. Ragsdale and George W. Warren to aid in the outlaws’ capture. None of these developments kept Jesse James from marrying his cousin Zee Mimms in Kearney in late April 1874 after a nine-year courtship, or Frank James from eloping with Anna Reynolds Ralston that June.
By December 1874, the James boys and two of the surviving Youngers, Cole and Bob, were ready to rob their third train. After learning of a huge gold shipment from the west, five gang members forced section hands to pile ties on the tracks of the Kansas Pacific Railroad near Muncie, Kan., on December 8. Then, using a red scarf, the outlaws flagged down an express train and stole at least $30,000, perhaps as much as $55,000. During the holdup, shots were fired at the conductor as he ran from the train, apparently to flag a freight train that was following the express. He was not hit. In response to this latest outrage, the Kansas Pacific Railroad Co., the governor of Kansas and the express company together promised at least $10,000 for the capture of the robbers, dead or alive. The suspects included Jesse and Frank James, of course, but only one man, Bud McDaniel, was ever captured and charged with the crime. McDaniel never confessed or squealed on anyone; he escaped jail before he could be tried and was soon after shot and killed while being pursued.
On January 26, 1875, the Pinkertons pursued their most desperate solution to capturing the James brothers. That night, a special train eased out of Kansas City, Mo., carrying a team of heavily armed detectives and their horses and gear. Conductor William Westfall let them off near Kearney and then returned with the train to Kansas City. The detectives rode to the Samuels’ farm, where they sent a cast-iron ball filled with flammable fluid crashing through the window of the Samuels’ parlor in a shower of fire and glass. Reuben Samuel, Frank and Jesse’s stepfather, rushed into the room and, fearing the house would go up in flames, kicked the flaming ball into the fireplace. A tremendous explosion rocked the house, mortally wounding 9-year-old Archie Peyton Samuel (Jesse and Frank’s half brother), mangling Zelda Samuel’s right arm (which later had to be amputated at the elbow), and wounding her black servant. The detectives left as abruptly as they had come, without even summoning a doctor. A neighbor of the Samuels family, James A. Hill, rushed to Kearney and brought back Dr. James V. Scruggs, but there was nothing the doctor could do for young Archie.
Exactly what happened during the raid is unclear, and it has been debated whether the object thrown was intended as a bomb or a flare. Likely, at least one of the outlaw James boys had been in the house, for later someone borrowed Dr. Scruggs’ horse to escape from the area. There was also talk that some of the detectives had been killed, but that was never verified. What is clear is that a revolver left behind by the detectives bore the inscription P.G.G. (Pinkerton Government Guard). That organization, however, refused to accept responsibility for the attack.
In March, a Clay County grand jury found murder indictments against Robert J. King; Allan K. Pinkerton, William Pinkerton’s son; Jack Ladd, a Pinkerton spy who worked at Daniel Askew’s farm, next to the Samuels’ place; and five other men. But no one was ever arrested. Many at the time believed that high-placed officials in the Missouri government prevented the arrests to protect themselves, the Pinkertons and the railroads. Ultimately, so much public sympathy was aroused for the Jameses because of the debacle that a move was made in the Missouri Legislature to provide amnesty to the James Gang. While the vote was 58 to 38 in favor of amnesty, the measure still failed because a two-thirds majority was needed. In the meantime, the James brothers dispensed their own justice. John Askew, the Samuels’ neighbor who had hired the Pinkerton spy, was gunned down in front of his house on the night of April 12, 1875. That September, a bank was robbed in Huntington, W.Va., that may have involved the James-Younger Gang (see story in December 1998 Wild West).
The James-Younger Gang renewed its attacks against the railroads on July 7, 1876, when it struck a Missouri Pacific train at a site known as the Rocky Cut, near Otterville, Mo. Riding out of heavy woods, the gang seized Henry Chateau, a watchman guarding a railroad bridge under construction, and his red lantern was used to signal the incoming train to halt. As the train squealed to a stop, discharging pistols and terrific yells rang out, accord-ing to the Kansas City Evening Star. John B. Bushnell, the chief messenger, fled to the other end of the train with the U.S. Express safe key. Once inside the baggage car, the outlaws held a gun to the head of baggage master Louis Pete Conklin (sometimes referred to as Conkling) and forced him to lead them in search of Bushnell. As the masked bandits proceeded through the train, women shrieked and men scrambled beneath their seats. After finding Bushnell and threatening him with death, the outlaws retrieved the key and opened the safe. They then obtained the engineer’s coal pick and broke into the Adams Express safe. From the two safes the bandits gathered more than $15,000, which they stuffed into the gang’s signature two-bushel flour sack. A small posse soon formed but had no luck–the hard-riding gang was long gone.
The railroad and express companies responded by persuading Chief of Police James McDonough of St. Louis to send his agents into southwest Missouri to chase down the criminals. In turn, McDonough enlisted the help of Larry Hazen, a well-known detective from Cincinnati. This effort led to the arrest of inexperienced gang member Hobbs Kerry, who had been flashing money in Granby, Mo. Told there were witnesses who recognized him from the Otterville robbery, Kerry broke down and confessed, naming as his accomplices Jesse and Frank James, Cole and Bob Younger, Charlie Pitts, Bill Chadwell and Clell Miller. A case was now building against the gang–if it could be captured. Jesse James continued to write disclaimers to newspapers, calling Kerry’s confession a well-built pack of lies from beginning to end in one letter published in the Kansas City Times in August. The Kansas City Journal described the letters as suspiciously–almost nauseatingly–monotonous. Cole Younger later wrote that Kerry’s implication of the Jameses and Youngers convinced the gang members to make one haul, and with our share of the proceeds start life anew in Cuba, South America or Australia.
The next month, the gang was changed for all time when the Jameses and Youngers not only went back to robbing a bank but also chose a bank far from their usual stamping grounds. The aborted robbery of the First National Bank of Northfield, Minn., on September 7, 1876, took the Youngers out of the James-Younger Gang. Cole, Jim and Bob Younger were all captured and sent to prison in the aftermath of that fiasco, which had also cost the lives of Pitts, Chadwell and Miller. Jesse and Frank James escaped, but now they had to recruit new men. After Northfield, the notion that the James boys were being accused of robberies that they had not committed played poorly in Missouri. The gang of ex-Civil War guerrillas having problems with postwar adjustment had become a gang of common thugs in the eyes of many disenchanted Missourians. Outsiders now called Missouri the Robber State and an Outlaw’s Paradise, and lawmen increasingly targeted the gang.
The James brothers were not heard from for months after escaping from Minnesota, but they had not gone to South America or Australia. More likely they had spent time with family in either Texas or Kentucky. By the summer of 1877, they had moved to Tennessee, where Frank adapted to the quiet life better than his younger brother. In need of money and perhaps excitement, too, Jesse recruited new gang members and took on the railroads again, this time without Frank.
The new James Gang struck on October 8, 1879, at Glendale, Mo., a little station on the Chicago & Alton line 15 miles east of Kansas City. The outlaws abducted at gunpoint a handful of Glendale citizens, the stationmaster and the telegraph operator. After smashing all of the station’s telegraph equipment to prevent outside knowledge of the robbery, they ordered the telegraph operator to lower the green light (a signal to the conductor to stop the train for further instructions). When the operator refused, the muzzle of a gun was shoved into his mouth and he weakened, according to a Kansas City Times reporter.
To ensure that the train stopped, the robbers also covered the tracks with stones.
At 8 p.m., Jesse and company halted the eastbound train and fired enough shots to keep the passengers inside. The express messenger, William Grimes, filled a satchel with money from the U.S. Express Company’s safe and tried to escape out the back of the express car. Anticipating this move, a gang member intercepted Grimes and struck him on the back of the head with the butt of a revolver, knocking him unconscious. Some 30 minutes later, the outlaws rode off uttering wild whoops of exultation, according to one account. Estimates of the take ranged from $6,000 to as much as $50,000.
Jesse James returned to Nashville after the Glendale robbery, but he was heard from twice in September 1880 in Kentucky–holding up a Mammoth Cave tourist stage and then a Dovey Cove Mine payroll in Mercer. Jesse had a nice haul at Muscle Shoals, Ala., on March 11, 1881, when he robbed paymaster Alex Smith of $5,000. But things took a downturn two weeks later when one of his gang members, Bill Ryan, was arrested in Tennessee. Ryan was eventually convicted for his role in the Glendale train robbery after another of Jesse’s recruits, Tucker Basham, testified against Ryan in Missouri. Basham also mentioned Jesse James as an accomplice, which caused James confederates to burn Basham’s Jackson County home. Basham fled the area.
The James Gang wasn’t through with trains yet. In fact, Frank James returned to contribute his expertise. On the evening of July 15, 1881, a Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific train stopped at Cameron, Mo., and was boarded by two gang members wearing dark suits of clothes [and] high caps, according to the Kansas City Evening Star. A few miles to the northeast, at Winston, Jesse and Frank James and their cousin Wood Hite boarded the train and put on masks. As the train proceeded, William Westfall, the same conductor who had brought the Pinkertons to the Samuels’ farm back in January 1875, collected fares in the smoking car. Suddenly, a tall man with black whiskers and wearing a linen duster (probably Jesse James) yelled, Stop! and ordered the conductor to raise his hands. Instead, Westfall crouched and raced for the back of the car. One of the bandits then shot him in the back. Westfall reeled onto the back platform and tumbled dead off the moving train. The bandits then cut the bell rope, signaling the engineer to stop the train.
Meanwhile, gang members Dick Liddil and Clarence Hite, another James cousin, fired into the locomotive, shattering its windows and ensuring that the engineer pulled onto a siding at Little Dog Creek Bridge. As the outlaws robbed the express car, a curious passenger, Frank McMillan, gaped at them from the platform. A bandit shot him in the head, and McMillan rolled from the train. In the express car, bandits had pistol-whipped the two messengers and robbed the express safe. Exactly how much money was taken is uncertain. The Kansas City Evening Star on July 16 called the crime the most daring, reckless, and cold-blooded murder and robbery ever enacted in the country. Liddil later confessed to participating in the Winston train robbery and said that Jesse shot Westfall and Frank shot McMillan.
Missouri Governor Thomas Crittenden was determined to stop the James Gang once and for all. The governor was under considerable pressure, since Missouri was trying to cast off its reputation as the Robber State. With the aid of Colonel Wells H. Blodgett, attorney for the Wabash Railroad, he called a meeting of railroad and express company executives in St. Louis on July 26, 1881. The officials promised to pay $5,000 each for the delivery of Frank and Jesse James. Another $5,000 each would be offered for their convictions.
The James Gang was not quite done. On September 7, 1881, exactly five years after the failed bank robbery in Northfield, the outlaws stopped a Chicago & Alton train where the tracks ran through Blue Cut, some two miles west of Glendale. Along with Jesse and Frank, participants likely included Clarence Hite, Dick Liddil and a new recruit, Charlie Ford. They used a red lantern to get the train to stop, broke open the express car and struck messenger H.A. Fox with a pistol butt. The gang leader not only didn’t wear a mask but also announced that he was Jesse James. Engineer Choppey Foote later said that the bandits took all the money they could but that the leader gave him $2 to use to drink the health of Jesse James tomorrow morning. The outlaws collected $1,000 at most, as well as jewelry. They made a clean getaway, but there would be no more robberies for the James Gang.
In February 1882, Clarence Hite was arrested in Kentucky and extradited to Missouri, where he pleaded guilty to involvement in the Winston robbery and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Another cousin of the Jameses, Wood Hite, died early that same year at the hands of Dick Liddil and Bob Ford, Charlie Ford’s younger brother. Apparently, both Liddil and Wood Hite had been vying for the attentions of the attractive widow Martha Bolton, the sister of the Ford brothers. Liddil turned himself in and told all he knew about the James Gang’s robberies.
On Monday, April 3, 1882, Bob and Charles Ford were visiting with Jesse James in his St. Joseph, Mo., home when Bob shot the famous outlaw in the back of the head. Two weeks later, the Fords were indicted on murder charges, found guilty and sentenced to hang. Governor Crittenden granted them full pardons that very afternoon. Many people assumed there had been a conspiracy involving the governor to eliminate Jesse James. In a letter to the Missouri Republican that he supposedly wrote in February 1884, Bob Ford said that he had not been hired by Crittenden or anyone else.
On October 5, 1882, Frank James, with no desire to return to outlawry and fearing the same treatment as Jesse, personally surrendered to Crittenden in Jefferson City. Frank’s wife later said that her husband could not even cut a stick of wood without looking around to see if someone was slipping up behind him to kill him.
In August 1883, Frank James stood trial for the murder of train passenger Frank McMillan during the 1881 Winston robbery. Frank’s star-studded troop of lawyers got him off, overcoming the testimony of a gang member turned informer, Dick Liddil. They got a boost from the governor himself, who testified that Liddil initially told him that Jesse James was the one who had shot McMillan. Furthermore, in February 1884, Crittenden dismissed all other charges against Frank James in Missouri.
That April, Frank did have to stand trial in Alabama for the 1881 Muscle Shoals robbery, but he was found not guilty. By the middle of 1884, 41-year-old Frank James could begin to pursue honest work under his real name. The first bank robbery at Liberty in 1866 and that first train robbery at Adair in 1873 no doubt were impossible to forget, but at least they could now be dusty, distant memories for Jesse’s big brother.

ALBANY, Ga. -- Michael Odom, who retired as a master sergeant in the Marine Corps Friday, joined the military 20 years ago. Now he is ready to move on to the next phase of his life.
Odom, 39, was born and raised in the Albany area. While stationed at Marine Corps Logistics Base-Albany, he founded and became the pastor of Agape Christian Worship Center, now located at 3200 Martin Luther King Jr. Drive.
Its roots, however, are at the Holiday Inn near the Albany Mall.
"We founded it in 2003. We've gone from five members to 100 members," Odom said.
The church moved to its present location eight months after its founding. In the process of helping the ministry grow, he had help from various members of the community.
"We have had Marines and civilians help us establish (the church)," the pastor said.
Since his military career started in 1990, Odom has been working in information technology. While on the base, Odom served as the information technology data center manager.
"We support systems that support Marines around the world," he said.
Odom is married to Isha Odom and has five children, one of whom is a sergeant in the Corps. He also has a cousin serving as a staff sergeant.
Being both a pastor and a Marine has given Odom a different sense of perspective when it comes to coping with what life throws at people.
"You deal with life's issues and crises," he said. "You deal with crisis on the job, and (being a pastor) has helped me bring balance and stability to others."
Odom assumed his duties in Albany in 2003, and left in 2006 to serve at Camp Lejuene in North Carolina. He returned to Albany in 2007 and has remained here since.
When asked what it was like to be retiring, he said: "It's a milestone for me."
Odom said his immediate plans for the future will be to spend the next 10 to15 years working to mature his ministry and possibly doing some contractor work. In the meantime, he will be completing his doctorate in transformational leadership from Bakke Graduate University.
After that, he will go into the third phase of his life, or as he likes to call it, the "RV years."
"At 54, I want to have the freedom to enjoy life," he said. "Everyone should have a life plan. If you don't have one, write it down. If you do, work through it."
Odom is also in the early phases of bringing to life the ACDC Community Development Center, which will one day sit on 32 acres of land and will include an education center, an apartment complex, a day care center, among other features.
"We are talking to engineers and an architect," he said of the project's status.
The goal is to have the facility up and running in five years, and it is the pastor's hope that the center will benefit the economy as well as encourage people to serve.
"I want them (community leaders) to have a heart to make a difference," he said. "I believe if we are going to make a difference in Albany, we will have to start with the leaders. My mission is to be part of the change."
As far as his career as a Marine goes, Odom said there is virtually nothing that he would change.
"At every duty station I've had good jobs and have had fun," he recalled.
Perhaps the best thing about Odom's two decades in the service is he and his wife having the opportunity to take care of other Marines, he said.
"I've had the chance to mentor young men and women leaving home for the first time," he said.
Odom went to Africa earlier in the year, which has motivated him to possibly expand his mission to the international level.
"I'm looking to travel to other countries," he said. "My goal is to expose others to mission work."
On the day of his retirement, his wife said she is also ready to move on to the next chapter.
"It's an emotional situation because this has been part of our life for so long; it crept up on us so fast," Isha Odom said. "I'm so excited to be able to take on new challenges.
"We're happy."

K-9 donations help take a bite out of crime
by Brad Lindberg Staff Writer
September 26, 2013
THE GROSSE POINTES AND HARPER WOODS — A second police dog is on the prowl.
The dog and its handler, funded with $2,400 start-up costs donated by K-9 Safety Partners of the Grosse Pointes, are members of the Harper Woods police department, which is part of the Grosse Pointe mutual aid pact.
Harper Woods’ dog, a German shepherd, is available to the Pointes just as the City of Grosse Pointe’s K-9, Raleigh, of the same breed, is deployed to Harper Woods on mutual aid requests.
Members of the partners and Raleigh hosted the new dog’s debut last week at Village Fest.
“I’m surprised how pet-like they are,” said John Stevens, Partners founder from the City of Grosse Pointe. “Kids cuddled up to them.”
Appearances can be deceiving. “If the commander says ‘bite,’ the thing bites,” Stevens said.
The partners were created to assist the Pointes and Harper Woods maintain or establish K-9 operations.
“We’re waiting for cities to make applications to us for funding,” said James Fox, retired City of Grosse Pointe public safety director. “We’ll do what we can to provide them with that.”
“The City’s dog is going to be retiring soon,” said Greg Theokas, Grosse Pointe Park mayor pro tem. “A police dog is like a community pet, but it has a real function.”
“Besides being a great public relations tool, it’s a strong deterrent to crime in our neighborhoods,” Fox said.
“It sets a mood when you have a couple dogs,” Stevens said. “It keeps people at bay a little. It sends a sense of safety. You feel protected.”
Raleigh routinely sniffs out drugs and fleeing criminal suspects.
“It’s good to get our police on the streets more, and this is a way to do that,” Theokas said. “People like to see that. They have a sense that police are on the street looking out for problems.”
The partners, a tax exempt organization, want to raise more than start-up funds.
“We hope to raise enough money to maintain the K-9s, too,” Fox said. “It will be the city’s responsibility to pay for overtime on the dog. We’re trying to ease their burden by providing some of the funding they need to get the K-9s.”As a patient at Oakland Mercy Hospital,.PS2 Review - 'Dynasty Warriors 6'

RO units create purified water by forcing pressurized tap water through a semi-permeable membrane. The membrane only allows very small molecules (such as H2O) to pass through it, effectively removing up to 99% of most water impurities.
Aquariums that May Benefit from an RO System
Aquariums with Excessive Algae Growth - Excessive algae growth in the aquarium makes it look dark and unnatural and greatly increases the amount of maintenance required. Algae growth requires 3 things: nitrate, phosphate, and light. If your tap water contains either nitrate or phosphate, or both, chances are your aquarium will develop algae problems. By using purified water for your regular water changes, you will reduce these levels in the aquarium.
Freshwater Planted Aquariums - Freshwater plants grow best in water with specific pH levels. Because of natural or added minerals, it is very difficult to control the pH of tap water. By using purified water, you can customize your water with one of the many available
buffers, to easily maintain the optimal pH level your plants require.
Saltwater Fish and Reef Aquariums - The first step in setting up a successful saltwater aquarium is using purified water. Commercially available
salt mixes contain all of the necessary minerals and trace elements that your fish, corals, and invertebrates require. If you don't use purified water, the existing minerals that are in the tap water can throw the water parameters out of balance. This can lead to problems with low pH levels, high levels of nitrate and phosphate, and diatomaceous algae blooms.
By investing in a quality reverse osmosis unit, you'll save yourself the headaches of unstable water conditions and hours of extra maintenance, while providing your aquarium's inhabitants with the most optimal water conditions possible.The Bowling Green Hornets are pleased to officially announce the signing of 6-10 center, A’Darius Pegues, to their roster this morning. The Fayetteville, N.C. native, Pegues, originally was a member of the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers’ Men’s Basketball program from 2006 to 2008; however, a pair of medical injuries forced him to miss his first two seasons under former head coach Ken McDonald. Ultimately, after transferring to various smaller schools to gain valuable playing experience, Pegues’ final stop landed him in Campbellsville, Kentucky where he completed his only season for the Tigers during this past 2013-2014 campaign. As one of only three seniors on the team, Pegues’ became a leader on the court for the Tigers, averaging 8.4 points per game, 5.0 rebounds per game, and 1.3 blocks per game in 29 games this season. The Hornets hope that Pegues’ intimidating 6-10 frame and extended wing-span, paired with the dominating presence of Trevecca Nazarene’s John Paul Nyadaro (6-10) and Western Kentucky’s O’Karo Akamune (6-7), can create match-up problems for opponents inside in the paint as the team makes their post-season run.
In order to satisfy league requirements of not exceeding a 14-man roster, the Hornets released former Hilltopper, Marcus Vasquez, from the roster to make room for Pegues. He is expected to make his debut for the Hornets (2-3) on Friday, April 18th at home in Russellville, Kentucky against the Chattanooga Rail Runners (4-1). Furthermore, the Hornets are scheduled to play their final home game versus the Fort Wayne Flite on Saturday, April 26th at the Biggers Sports Center on the campus of Lindsey Wilson College in Columbia, Kentucky; which is approximately twenty miles south of Campbellsville. As the first Tigers player to ever play with the Hornets, it may be a homecoming of sorts for Pegues on that day, as local Campbellsville fans will have a realistic opportunity to view him in action for the first time in a professional basketball environment.
With players. Last week, former Hornet and Hilltopper, Kahlil McDonald, received an international contract to play in Australia. four of their own players sign their first overseas contracts, while also having nine former players with international-playing experience participating on their own roster during that span.Horror Movies that were in Theaters.

The centre will deliver residential courses for patients and carers on how to cope with the effects of chronic pain, and how to manage their condition.
Patients in Scotland have to travel to a unit in Bath, Somerset, about 400 miles from Glasgow, for such highly-specialised care.
The facility is expected to be running at full capacity by 2016. Details of the new centre of excellence were announced by Public Health Minister Michael Matheson.
He said: "Chronic pain can be distressing and difficult to deal with, but we know that if the condition is managed well, it can make a huge difference.
"That's why this new national service, based at a single location, will have a truly positive impact on people's lives.
"The establishment of this new national service in Scotland is a major milestone for people who suffer from chronic pain.
"We're determined that patients will have access to the very best services without having to take the long journey to the south of England. This new national centre comes on the back of a £1.3 million investment in chronic pain services nationally. We are working closely with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to ensure that the new facilities are up and running as soon as possible."
Chronic pain is defined as pain that persists for 12 weeks or more. About 223,000 Scottish adults, or more than 5 per cent of the population, are thought to experience severe chronic pain.
Professor Blair Smith, national clinical lead for chronic pain, said: "The care and treatment that the residential service will provide represents an important part of our ambition to improve the lives of people living with chronic pain.
"This new national service also presents Scotland with an excellent opportunity to build on our experience of developing world recognised research, with the aim being to deliver continuing improvements in the treatment and management of chronic pain."Posts Tagged ‘Sylvain Guintoli’

tom daschle concerned on April 25, 2013 at 8:17 AM
Thousands (and thousands) of Congressional aides…and the average salary is well above the national average…well above.
It is not like a Senator comes to DC and brings along all of his own people, fresh from the farm or small town America.
There is a professional cadre of congressional aides who flit from congressional office to congressional office after every election, offering their services and “long time expertise” to the incoming office-holder…for a good price (to them) with benefits.
Some have been on the Hill for decades. Others, the sons and daughters of America’s elites, do it as a stepping stone to politics, or law, or a lucrative consulting gig, another career where they can sell their “Hill top experiences”…but all are driven by money, not patriotism or wanting to do good and all that pap. That’s the harsh reality.
And a good portion of them live in houses out in Great Falls, or Potomac, or nice townhouses all around Lincoln Park that most Americans can never afford…and we are supposed to feel sympathy for them?
It is a job.
Don’t like the benefits?
Find another job.
Millions do it. Or did, before Obama and Congress screwed the economy.
But, if their bosses pass a law they themselves helped to get passed…deal with it.
We have to.

Big deal. A few people who actually pay attention to these kinds of things will do nothing more than bellyache in comment on sites like this one, imagining that their outrage is somehow registered and vented, and nobody cares.
The only thing that moves a politician is pain, and no pain ever happens on a web site. If it did, Elizabeth Warren would have been stomped by Legal Insurrection, and – poof – nothing happened and no one cared and she was elected.
Until the right figures out how to cause real pain to politicians and how to inform know-nothing voters, it’s just a bunch of hot air.

I’m confused. Why are members of Congress and staff required to purchase plans through the exchanges under Obamacare in the first place? That isn’t how the law works for everyone else. If you get your insurance through your employer Obamacare doesn’t change that. In fact, if your employer provides you with insurance Obamacare forbids you from purchasing a plan on the exchanges. Members of Congress and staffers currently get their health insurance from their employer, so I don’t understand why they would be pushed into the exchanges.

Not long ago at all Congress passed, again in the dark of night, legislation that strips the requirement of politicians to show all details of investments. People should remember back not long ago when several politicians got busted for insider trading then feined they did not know that this law applied to them. SHOCKING — the laws they pass actually apply to THEM as well?! In order to avoid criminal prosecution/punishment they passed a bill that basically stated “From NOW ON this law will apply to us as well’, & the matter was resolved. This was bogus legislation designed to prevent these guys from being punished — another law wasn’t needed because EVERYONE already knew ALL laws they pass applies to them. What BS! NOW, this new legislation basically prevents anyone from finding out if they are engaged in Insider Trading or not…”If you catch me doing it I can be punished, but good luck trying to catch me now!”
Just like how politicians enjoy the BEST healthcare we taxpayers can afford while we struggle to afford any at all, of course these Socialist elitists are further searating themselves from the masses & the horrible lifestyle that they are forcing us to exist in. Socialism is awesome…as long as you are one of the inner-circle elitists and the money those people seizes from the masses doesn’t run out.

I believe it was Midas saying on another thread exactly what is in my mind now: We’re broken as a nation and there is nothing that will bring it back together again except a terrible cleansing.
We have a royal class which supports criminals such as Rangel and Killary, and keeps accepting back feckless retreads like Crist and Sanford who can’t seem to survive in the private arena they regulate. Then of course there’s the Dog Eater himself, a man so unaccomplished that you would laugh him out of the room were he to petition to lead your local PTA.
Our people are sacrificed all over the globe so some politician can claim that terrorism has been defeated, and half our populace is willing to point fingers at the other half in blame for a bombing in which the jihadi bomber did everything but yell “Alahu Ackbar!”

Isn’t that interesting?… that the only “risk” they expect to face is “being dubbed hypocrites”? The entire House faces the American people every two years for election, but they’re not really concerned about our wrath. They aren’t worried that every last one of them will be drummed out of office. Nope. They’re worried we might call them “hypocrites”, meaning that some might face a more difficult opponent in the next race.

Anyone smarter on the law then I am (probably most of you…) care to answer a question?
By making themselves and there staff immune to Obama Care, does that open up a new route to challenge the laws in the courts? I would think between this and all the waivers that were arbitrarily given out to certain businesses that you could challenge Obamacare via the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment.
But I must be missing something cause I would think someone would have already tried it.

coldwarrior on April 25, 2013 at 8:42 AM
When this happens, BTW, it is CRITICAL for Americans to get those representatives out of Washington as quickly as possible. In most cases, however, these politicians throw ‘crumbs’ from the table onto the floor to sate the ‘hungry peasants’. Unfortunately, too many Americans are too willing to hand over their independence, their rights, and their freedom in exchange for mere ‘crumbs’ – the enslaving social programs that are designed to meet their minimum needs, if that, and to keep them dependent on the Socialists depicting themselves as the only ones who care for them. Americans used to be hard-working trailblazers who would not settle for anyone’s ‘charity’ but have now become ‘crumb-eating zombies’.

I’m with Erickson on this one. Lawmakers excluding themselves from the laws they make for the rest of us makes me livid.

How arrogant and evil will WE let our governments become?
Will the government leaders ever become so hungry for more money to spend that they tax coffins based on the amount of resources they use (that can no longer be used by society)?
Will they tax the estates for the ground/space that the coffins lay in? That cemetaries can’t be used for some greater good like a civic center or such named after the politician of the moment?
Will there be an ongoing “use” tax for every year that the grave space is occupied?
So, even in death you won’t be able to escape taxes?
This country is proving that man cannot govern himself.

They exempted themselves from the EEOC, IIRC, which is why a member of Congress could hire only employees from his own racial or ethinic group.
Wethal on April 25, 2013 at 8:49 AM
IlikedAUH2O on April 25, 2013 at 8:50 AM
I’m engaging in pure speculation but here’s a guess.
For people in the private sector, whether they are in the exchanges is a function under the law of whether they have an offer for “affordable health insurance” from their employer. To provide that, the employer must fund the cost of the health insurance from the worker’s total compensation. So whether the worker gets it through the employer or through the exchanges the worker effectively has to foot the bill.
Federal employees, however, have thus far received health insurance heavily subsidized by the taxpayer. Because the health insurance they receive is not deducted from their compensation, but rather financed by other taxpayers, the only way for them to face the same costs as those in the private sector is to require them to buy insurance through the exchanges (or, failing that, require them to foot the entire cost of their employer-provided coverage out of their wages).
My — admittedly wholly speculative — guess is that the requirement was an attempt to create parity between the public and private sector. Without such a requirement, the public sector would be receiving a subsidy denied to others, since in the private sector all employer-provided health insurance is financed from total worker compensation.

One upside, congress and its employees will soon learn that there won’t be many docs in the doc business anymore as more and more retire early or just leave the business to save their sanity.
We’ll all be waiting in healthcare lines for that crumb of care. This is what those commies et. al want.

Your core idea is good but your execution is awful.

1) Warren was elected by low-information voters in Massachusetts, a typically Democrat left-leaning commonwealth – the rest of us didn’t get a chance to vote in that election.
2) Until the 47% wake up and get off their butts to do something, we’re screwed, no matter who the elected Kritters are. First, you have to change the culture so that laying about looking for the next handout and relying on government to punish the wealth producers (other than HollyWeird, of course) becomes reprehensible rather than acceptable.

Ed, you are missing an important question:
If ObamaCare is so good for the nation, why are Democrats working with Republicans to exempt themselves? I can understand why Republicans are doing this, but this is a quite admission from Democrats that this is a bad law.
BigGator5 on April 25, 2013 at 9:35 AM
Another disheartning day in Washington. My senator Saxby Chamiss is retiring so he’ll do whatever the hell he wants. His seat is the hotspot so the other senator Johnny Issackson wont be challenged and I fully expect him to go along with the immigration BS. Both are good ole boys. Washington is so corrupt and so many need to be replaced its a daunting task. Theyve given themselves lifetime jobs. What honest person in their right mind would want to jump into that cesspool anyway? The founders intentions are so perverted theyre unrecognizeable

Marcus on April 25, 2013 at 9:43 AM
OK, I think I’m ready for more baseless speculation. . .
My guess is that at the time of the original law’s passage, no one in a position to do anything saw a sufficient political advantage in taking on the federal employee unions. This thing passed only with D support — my guess is that they felt politically vulnerable to demands that they include themselves in the legislation, but saw more political pain than gain in extending it to the entire federal workforce.
Feel free to dismiss this as the speculative musing that it is, but there it is for what it’s worth.

The Democrats pushed the Obamacare down our throats without any Republican votes, and they are no better then anyone else, so no, they cannot exempt themselves, their aides, or unions from Obamacare. Can still be repealed next year after there is a major change in leadership in the congress.

I suspect the low life bottom feeding, slim sucking politicians will eventually exempt themselves and their staffs in spite of any bad press. They don’t work for us, they work for the big special interest donors (where most campaign money comes from) and the low info minority block votes who vote for them no matter what. The rest of us are just a kind of “fly over” people.

Perhaps it does. The article doesn’t say that this particular problem won’t exist for all federal employees. It just says that these negotiations are trying to fix it for one specific set of federal employees — members of Congress and their staffs.
I would not at all put it past these dirtbags in Congress to attempt to craft a “solution” for themselves and their staffers while simultaneously ignoring the same problem for all other federal employees. After all, they’re willing to ignore the problems of Obamacare for all of us who work in the private sector.

Because everybody loves a Saturday night….
The night before last, all over the world, Jews began saying Selichot, the confessional prayers that ask God to forgive us for everything we’ve done wrong in the past year.
All this week, we’ll be getting up extra early (or showing up late to work) (uh, sorry, Daniel) in order to spend those extra few minutes with God. But for the first Selichot service, we want to get it in as early as possible, so we stay up late on Saturday night. Most synagogues hold services at midnight or 1:00 A.M. (a few do it at 11, so make sure you find out first). Hands-down, my favorite part is seeing the rabbi in his pajamas.
This year, I was in Philadelphia for the main event. I was out with my friend Odin, who used to play in a death-metal band with me in high school and has since (of course) started writing instrumental hip-hop music. He’s not Jewish at all (though we did meet because he dated this girl I knew from Hebrew school), but he’s always been curious about the culture. The 1:00 a.m. service, I’m pretty sure, earned another check-mark in his “weird-but-cool things about Jews I’ll never completely understand” notebook (a notebook that has, btw, been getting considerably stuffed of late).
We usually go out to the local diner, get tea, and linger for most of the night. Tonight, because I realized that drinking out of ceramic coffee cups probably isn’t so kosher, we hit up the late-night Philadelphia Israeli restaurant, named (as these places so often are) Cafe Espresso & Sushi. And the night crept on, and then he checked his watch — “Hey Matt, don’t you have to do the pajama praying thing?”
And so I did. As luck would have it, the synagogue was a block away.
It was a motley assemblage of people — many old, a few young, this one couple, very clean-cut and Middle American-looking, who were just at the restaurant, it appeared, on a late-night date. And the 80-year-old identical twins who always dressed alike.
This, I think, is the heart of what I love about Judaism. About God. Praying transcends cultures, but it also transcends age, sex, race, musical demographic, and just about any other way you can divide people. Pause everyone, smack in the middle of a Saturday night, and remind them all that they have a duty to their Creator. You’ll get people coming from everywhere — study hall, date, dance club and bed — into that room, with only one goal in common: say hi to God, and ask for some forgiveness.
We closed our eyes. We recited those lines out of the prayerbook that everyone always did, those same prayers that people prayed about a thousand years ago. The clothes and the vernacular might be new, but the message was the same as it’s always been: We messed up. We are sorry.NUREMBERG (Jan. 25)
To safeguard the restitution claim of a New York Jewish businessman, Karl Joel, against the owner of one of Germany’s largest mail order houses, the latter has been ordered by the Restitution Chamber of the local German court to furnish a bank guarantee of $235,000, believed to be the highest amount ever fixed prior to a decision on the claim as such.
Mr. Joel had built up a successful mail order house in this city and in Berlin. In 1938, when anti-Jewish measures made it utterly impossible to continue operating the business, he entered into sales negotiations with a Wuerzburg textile retailer, Josef Neckermann. Before a contract could be drawn up, he had to flee for his life to Switzerland. The purchase price which Neckermann eventually paid went into a blocked account that was seized by the Nazi state, without Joel receiving a penny.
The Aryanized business flourished. As a precaution against wartime air raids, Neckermann moved it to a small Bavarian town. The U. S. Military Government later sequestered it as presumptive Jewish property. A series of “custodians” were named to operate it, but in the end they completely dissipated the assets. This worthless shell, Neckermann has offered to “restitute” to Joel.
Under a slightly different trade name, Neckermann himself launched a mail order house in Frankfurt four years ago and has made it into one of the largest in West Germany. He describes it as entirely distinct and separate from the old firm, whereas Joel, insisting that it is based on the good will of the original business, asks that the Frankfurt business be restored to him. Although the legal dispute has been dragging for more than six years, no verdict has yet been reached by the Restitution Chamber. Any ruling it issues is likely to be appealed to two higher courts in turn.Get Fit! Stylish Athletic Gear Under $50

Acqua di ParmaColonia Travel Spray (30ml)£84.00Brazilian legend Rivaldo announces retirement
World Cup winner Rivaldo has announced his retirement from professional football at the age of 41.
The Brazilian, who scored 34 times in 74 appearances for his country between 1993 and 2003, played for the likes of Barcelona and AC Milan at the peak of his powers but prolonged his career with short stints at lesser clubs like Olympiakos and AEK Athens.
Following stints in recent years at the likes of Bunyodkor and Sao Paulo, Rivaldo signed on with Mogi Mirim for the third time in his career at the end of 2013 with the deal set to see him stay until 2015.
However, the forward finally called an end to his "miracle" two-and-a-half decade career on Saturday and hopes his time on the field has set an example for future players to follow their hearts despite being advised otherwise.
"With tears in my eyes, I would like to thank God, my family and everyone else for their support and love I have received during my 24 years as a professional footballer," Rivaldo wrote on his official social media outlets.
"My history as a player has come to an end today. My entire career was built upon a miracle, I've left my hometown Paulista without any financial resources, no agent, disbelieved by doctors and coaches and I saw a distant dream come true.
"With persistence, dedication and, mostly, by the hand of God, I've achieved to be recognised as the best player in the world, to be a world champion, among many other awards and honours.
"In a land where everything is for consumption, I exit as part of history, maybe an example, as testimony for sure that it's worth fighting and believing for what you want."
The striker has pondered retirement in the past but subsequently moved back from playing in Angola in 2012 to his native Brazil where he has played lower league football.Do I have to drive to Karl's Sausage for great brats?
- re: grant.cook
- re: ginnyhw
If Norwell is closer to you, you could try the Smokehouse or call them and ask about a retail outlet.
For a larger producer Johnny's carries grote & weigel from Connecticut and brats were on sale Saturday. They are pretty good for what they are, but wouldn't put them up against a smaller producer.
The Smokehouse in Norwell (also sold at Savenours) makes incredible sausages of all types, but they specialize in German sausages. I hate brats so haven't eaten any but have had a number of their other German sausages and they were my-t-fine.

Actually, we didn't battle traffic at all: since I knew Route 1 north is going to be at a standstill on a Friday afternoon rush hour, we just went out Route 9 to 128, went around that way and then dropped the half-mile on Route 1 southbound. Twice the distance, at least, but it was in the opposite direction as all the traffic, so I'm sure it was still a faster trip than being stuck on Route 1 north. And Allstonian's exaggerating a bit, anyway. She didn't get out of her office until well after five and we pulled into Karl's parking lot a couple minutes before six.
I've only lived in Massachusetts a little over six years, but if I know anything, it's this: never go north on Route 1 on Friday afternoon and never go south on Route 1 on Sunday afternoon.

If you really want to visit, the 429 from the Lynn Commuter Rail Station can drop you off at Walnut Street and Route 1. Its between and 1/4 and 1/2 mile to Karl's and I think that part of Rt 1 is ok for pedestrians. There are also options to get to the Square 1 Mall (430 from Malden) and get a taxi from there.
Saturdays Rt 1 can get slow from just before Rt60 and up to the Square 1 Mall. Starts around 10:30ish and goes into the afternoon.

Senators
On a Hockey Night in Canada, the Senators served notice they’re back in the playoff picture.
The Senators blew a two-goal, third-period lead, but Clarke MacArthur saved the night by scoring on the power play only 58 seconds into OT to give Ottawa a 4-3 victory over the Montreal Canadiens.
With P.K. Subban in the box, MacArthur beat Carey Price just inside the post to give the club its fourth straight victory. Goaltender Craig Anderson made 26 saves for his fifth straight win.
Erik Condra, Colin Greening and Mark Stone, who had his first NHL goal, scored in regulation but the Senators couldn’t hold up after an onslaught by the Habs in the third to tie it.
“It was (big to get the two points),” said MacArthur. “That’s a negative that we sat back (in the third period) and they kind of took the play to us.
“It was a good job stopping the momentum midway through the third and getting back to our favour. We’re fortunate to get one in OT. We don’t want to see it go there again though.”
Daniel Briere led the attack for the Habs with a three-point effort -- including two goals and an assist. Brian Gionta also scored in a wild third period that saw the Habs come back to tie it.
The two-goal lead the Senators held going into the third evaporated pretty quickly. Gionta tied it up at 4:46 with the club’s second goal in a span of 1:49.
Briere, a healthy scratch for two straight games, had pulled the Habs to within a goal only 1:57 into the third when he beat Anderson upstairs standing at the post.
“It was a big test for us coming in here,” said coach Paul MacLean. “We always know it’s going to be a great atmosphere and we knew it was going to be a good game. We were ready to play.
“I thought we did a good job of the whole team contributing, playing and finding a way to win the game.”
For only the 15th time in 44 games, the Senators held the lead after two periods. They did it by out-muscling the Habs, outshooting them by a 21-17 count and getting timely saves from Anderson to hold a 3-1 lead they built up in the first.
Neither team had many great chances in the second period, but Rene Bourque did hit the post late.
“A wild third period? Yeah. They came out with push in the third,” said Anderson.
“They had momentum for the first five or six minutes when they got the first two goals. We were able to settle it down and kind of play 50/50 from then on and generate some offensive zone time.
“We were able to get it done on special teams. Things are starting to go in our favour. We’re working hard at it and we’re getting better every day.”
The Senators couldn’t have scripted a better start.
They pulled out to a 3-1 lead on 14 shots at Price on the strength of goals by Condra, Stone and Greening. Not all are likely sources but they came up big.
Condra’s fourth of the season came on an attempted pass to Zack Smith going to the net bounced off Francois Boullion’s skate and by Price at 14:04 to give the club a 3-1 lead.
Stone’s first career goal will be one to remember. He took a pass from Kassian and beat Price on the stick side at 13:50. The Senators did a good job making it tough for Price and there were plenty of breakdowns.
“I just tried to get it through as quick as I could,” said Stone. “When I saw it trickle through, if you saw my face I was pretty excited.”
Briere’s sixth pulled the Habs to within a goal at 11:32.
He was able to pick up his own rebound in front to beat Anderson on the stick side. Up until then, he hadn’t been tested a lot -- though Subban hit a post and the Habs had a goal by Bourque nullified because of a quick whistle.
The Senators returned home to rest and get ready to face the Colorado Avalanche Wednesday in Denver.

Don Barden who was a trailblazer for economic empowerment in our communities. Don was born in Inkster, Mich., a Detroit suburb, which was the home of the first Black owned radio station, WCHB, and was also the abode of the great Stevie Wonder. He was the ninth of 14 children and shared a bed with three of his brothers. It was there that he resolved he would become an entrepreneur. He rejected the common option of working in an auto plant and went off to college at Central State University in Ohio. He soon ran out of money and took $500 in savings and opened a record store in Lorain, Ohio (a Cleveland suburb).
Donnie Records became a success and promoted appearances by the Jackson Five and James Brown. He stayed 20 years in Lorain, Ohio and became the first Black member of its City Council and also founded a newspaper known as The Lorain County Times. Also, he worked as a news anchor and hosted a weekly television talk show. He was indeed an innovator.
Having ventured in real estate in Ohio, Don turned his focus back to his home in the Detroit area, during the 1980’s. His timing was perfect. The nation was experiencing strong Black mayors, who were determined to make Black business moguls. Harold Washington, in Chicago, Marion Barry, in D.C., Carl Stokes, in Cleveland, Tom Bradley, in Los Angeles, Maynard Jackson, of Atlanta, etc. were determined to make a difference and leave a legacy. Mayor Coleman Young, of Detroit, was no different. So, when the cable television contract presented itself to the Detroit market, Mayor Young pursued the most capable Black businessperson to gift the opportunity. Don Barden, like Robert Johnson, in D.C, (aided by Mayor Marion Barry) was awarded the contract to install a system throughout the city.
This gave him leverage for greater things. Robert Johnson leveraged his D.C. cable franchise into the great BET Corporation. Likewise, Don Barden sold his cable company and took the revenue into a casino endeavor. That is where I met him. Indiana was allowing six casinos into the state and the Honorable Bill Crawford, Indiana State Representative, insisted on Black ownership on at least one of the casinos. People thought this was far-fetched, but Bill insisted. Out of the “blue” came Don Barden, who stated he would build a casino franchise, if the State of Indiana would license him. He had just sold his cable franchise to Comcast and was flush with cash. So, when the question came up as to how he would finance it he stated “I will do it with my own cash.” Let me tell you those Indiana Hoosiers were indeed shocked.
Thus, the first Black-owned casino was built in Indiana, the Majestic Star Casino. He would later build casinos in Tunica, Mississippi, Las Vegas, Colorado, and Pittsburgh. Of late, the casino portion of his portfolio was floundering (from the recession) and is currently in bankruptcy proceedings.
A big heartbreak for Don was when Detroit decided to bring seven casinos to the city. It seemed like a natural for him. The only Black owner of casinos in the nation and casinos were coming to his home. However, the city of Detroit no longer had a mayor of Coleman Young’s ilk and the city council was now thinking that “white man’s ice was colder”. They made moves to insure that their own Don Barden would not receive a casino license. It was and still remains a terrible disgrace. It is the current mindset that leaves this city in extreme turmoil.
When I wrote an editorial decrying this injustice, the local Detroit democratic operatives did what they usually do. They performed a forensic audit on Don Barden’s company and personal expenses hoping to find an instance that he gave me or the NBCC money to protest this injustice. They, of course, found nothing and were bewildered with the fact that I protested on principle alone.
Don Barden was indeed a great brother. He never forgot where he came from. He organized a series of regional economic peace conferences to address Detroit’s immense crime problem. He was continually involved in community interaction and sought to solve the problems of a city so terribly corrupted by crime and immoral elected officials. He showed us how you can rise from the abyss and still stand strong and be a leader and business owner.
I will miss and cherish the nights sitting across a table from him and having a casual conversation while we sipped our favored drink. He was a mogul and yet he was as common as the guy living next door. Detroit and America are better because Don Barden came through and made a difference. Enjoy Heaven Don.

Many of you read my articles this week about Janet Zweig's public art project and the reaction it got from some of our elected officials. So much has been said since, that it seems a round-up is in order.
The Twitterverse and Facebookverse (yes, I am making up words now!) were buzzing about the whole affair. The RadioMilwaukee guys were tweeting about it, Jonathan Jackson of MilwaukeeFilm was sharing links on Twitter. Melissa Musante from MARN set up a Facebook group to organize support for Zweig's project.
Art rabble-rouser Mike Brenner said he would, shall we say, do his business on the lawn of any alderman who got in the way of the art. That, in turn, prompted Ald. Joe Dudzik to call with his home address. He said the project was "cancelled" and he was looking forward to Mike's offering upon his propoerty. Wait, there's more. Mike then took Dudzik's voicemail and turned it into the AlderBoy Remix. Some of you are concerned by my support of MIke's antics. I responded at the blog, but let me direct your gaze to an even better argument from Bob Tanzilo at OnMilwaukee. Spot on Bobby.
I was thrilled to see that some of our civic leaders also took the time to weigh in and be heard, from Julia Taylor at her ThinkMKE blog to the Cultural Alliance's Christine Harris at her blog. Way to go ladies. These gals also rallied the troops, encouraging people to write or call their aldermen.
I simply adored the essay by littletinyfish about his encounter with Zweig's work in the Prince Street subway station in New York. This was discussion about art -- not discussion about art discussions. Gene Evans, who you know from Luckystar, made a related post at Third Coast Digest. audience.

Buchanan, winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in Economic Science, developed a program that changed the way economists analyze economic and political decision-making. He examined how politicians' self-interest and noneconomic forces affect government economic policy.
"Public choice is summarized as the extension and application of the tools and methods of economics to the subject matter of political science," he says. "That is, to the behavior of persons in public choosing roles-as voters, representatives, legislators, bureaucrats, political agents generally-and to the functioning of the institutions within which they act in these roles.
"In a shorthand sense, I have referred to public choice as 'politics without romance,' but the program also embodies attention to prospects for changing the rules with the purpose of getting better results," he says. "In a general sense, public choice proceeds from the presupposition that political agents are just like everyone else."
Buchanan, the advisory general director of the James Buchanan Center for Political Economy at George Mason University, first outlined this theory in a book he wrote with Gordon Tullock in 1962, The Calculus of Consent. "Public choice, as a research program was developed by many scholars over a full half century," says Buchanan. "Its origins are in public finance theory, welfare economics, game theory, rational choice theory, institutional economics, and other areas of inquiry."
Buchanan explained his thinking process in an interview in 1995: ," he said. "I was influenced by the Swedish economist Wicksell, who said if you want to improve politics, improve the rules, improve the structure. Don't expect politicians to behave differently. They behave according to their interests."
Applying economic analyses to the political arena has had a major impact on public policy. Public choice theory says economists can no longer assume government intervention alone will fix economic problems but that economists must also look at how government actions are implemented.
"Public choice was not a primary cause for the general disaffection with governments that emerged in the last decades of the century," says Buchanan. "But public choice did offer explanatory bases for understanding why governments everywhere failed to meet public expectations."
Buchanan, the son of a Tennessee farmer, received his PhD from the University of Chicago in 1948 and has held teaching positions at the University of Virginia, the University of California at Los Angeles, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute. He says he became an economist "for the simple reason that a small graduate fellowship was available in economics, rather than in either of my other two undergraduate majors, mathematics or English literature."
On winning the Nobel Prize, Buchanan says, "For me, the award was a vindication both of the importance of the program and of my own willingness to follow my own interests rather than the drift of the orthodoxy."

2.11 Nonprofessional Leaves
A faculty member may request a leave for a purpose unrelated to normal professional activity of the faculty. (Professional leaves are treated in Sections 2.9.2, “Sabbatical Leaves,” and 2.9.3, “Other Professional Leaves.”) Examples of leaves covered in this section include, but are not necessarily limited to, illness, disability, military training, jury duty, the birth or adoption of a child, critical illness or death in the immediate family, or other compassionate reasons. Leaves for illness or disability or due to the birth or adoption of a child are subject to policies within the college’s [university’s] faculty benefit program. See Section 2.12.2, “Employment Benefits,” applicable policies in Part III, and applicable state and federal laws, rules, and regulations concerning mandatory leaves.2.11.1 Nonprofessional Leaves with Pay
The college [university] provides for short-term leaves with pay in some circumstances such as jury duty, mandatory military service, or medical or compassionate reasons. A short-term leave of absence is ordinarily not more than 10 working days but may be extended for a longer period. Short-term leaves for illness or disability are subject to the provisions of the disability policy of the college [university].
A longer parental leave is available due to birth or adoption of a child, with the leave occurring either in the semester of the birth or adoption or in the following semester. If both parents are employed by the College of Saint Benedict and/or Saint John’s University, only one of the parents is eligible for the leave.
Requests for leaves are submitted in writing to the divisional dean [and/or the dean of the School of Theology] along with a written recommendation on the leave from the department chair. In the case of emergency leaves for compassionate reasons, the requests may be made to the divisional dean [and/or the dean of the School of Theology], who may waive a written request in view of the circumstances.2.11.2 Nonprofessional Leaves without Pay
A faculty member wishing to have an extended leave without pay for any of the above reasons should make a written request to the divisional dean [and/or the dean of the School of Theology as appropriate], accompanied by an evaluation by the department chair. Ordinarily such leaves are not granted for more than one academic year. An effort should be made to arrange the leave to coincide with the academic terms.2.11.3 Effects of Nonprofessional Leaves
The faculty member’s status or tenure will not be affected by nonprofessional leaves. Nonprofessional leaves with pay are counted toward tenure, promotion, and sabbatical, but nonprofessional leaves without pay do not count toward tenure, promotion, or sabbatical.
Fringe benefits are not provided during leaves without pay although the faculty member has the option to continue such benefits by paying the college [university] for them. Benefit arrangements are made with the Human Resources Office.
Faculty members on nonprofessional leave without pay for an academic year are nonetheless eligible to receive the normal annual salary increment upon their return.2.11.4 Nonprofessional Leaves without pay which will be granted upon request. If the reassignment lasts longer than two years, the sister [monk] resigns but may be reappointed by the president at a later date in accord with Section 2.13.1.3.What does GRK mean in ASX Symbols?

La Petite MarmosetAs the Philadelphia Eagles prepare to open training camp on July 25, we examine whether the team is better or worse than last season at each position. We continue with the tight ends.
BETTER
Zach Ertz
This kid is poised to have a breakout year, period.
You could just see him beginning to take over games late last year, especially when the Eagles were down inside the red zone. Ertz reeled in all five of his touchdown catches over the second half of the season, including one in their playoff loss to the New Orleans Saints.
You could just see it looking at the guy back in training camp. At 6’5, 250 pounds, Ertz may have the body of a tight end, but he runs very fluidly, almost like a wide receiver. Don’t worry about his 40 time, Ertz has deceptive speed, plus he knows how to use his body to shield the ball from defenders.
Tight ends often experience a leap in production during their second season, and it certainly appears Ertz is headed for a spike. The second-round pick finished 2013 with 36 receptions for 469 yards and four touchdowns, which were better totals than the likes of perennial Pro Bowlers such as Antonio Gates, Jason Witten, Vernon Davis and Jimmy Graham posted for their rookie campaigns.
With the release of wide receiver DeSean Jackson, it’s only logical the Eagles would utilize the tight end more in the passing attack. If Ertz’s rapid development continues like it has, he can potentially push 1,000 yards and double-digit touchdowns in ’14.
James Casey
It took the Eagles awhile to find much use for Casey. Signed to a three-year, $12 million contract during free agency last year, some observers had expectations Casey would play a big role in the offense, but he wound up buried on the depth chart behind Brent Celek and Ertz.
Casey started to see an uptick in playing time around December, though. Granted, he wasn’t targeted at all in the passing attack late in the year. However, Casey is a very effective run-blocker, and the Birds were pounding the rock while trying to put games against the Detroit Lions, Chicago Bears and Dallas Cowboys on ice.
That seems to be his role going forward. Now that the Eagles finally found the right packages for him, Casey should have more value to the offense than merely a competent backup and special teams contributor.
WORSE
Nothing.
THE SAME
Brent Celek
Celek is approaching his 30th birthday, so one could easily make the case his best days are behind him, and he’s at risk of decline setting in—if it hasn’t already. Last year was a career renaissance of sorts for Celek, though, as he went from being known largely for his ability as a receiver to a key component of Philadelphia’s No. 1 ranked ground attack.
Celek was a beast of a run-blocker in ’13, playing a big part in paving the way for LeSean McCoy’s first rushing title. According to metrics site Pro Football Focus, Celek graded out as the best of any regular tight end in that department. It’s that ability that will likely keep him in the starting lineup for another season over an emerging Ertz, at least in the beginning.
And while Celek’s receiving totals were down, it was actually one of his best seasons in several aspects. His 15.7 yards per reception was the highest of his seven-year career, and three more than his lifetime average. Six touchdowns were also good for the second-best finish as a pro.
The other thing about Celek is he’s dependable. The guy plays through injuries, missing only one game since reaching the NFL. Even if his talent begins to fade, Celek is going to give a ton the Eagles a ton of effort and will get the job done—for one more year, at least.
THE UNKNOWN
Blake Annen, Trey Burton
Last year, the Eagles carried four tight ends out of training camp. I don’t think they’ll bother this year, as an extra running back and/or offensive lineman could be in the cards instead, but the team does have intriguing options here in a pair of undrafted rookies.
Annen is the one who caught my eye. He only managed to haul in 19 passes in four years at Cincinnati, but set the world on fire at his pro day, clocking a 4.41 in the 40-yard dash at 6’4”, 247 pounds. Annen is basically the same size at Ertz with wide receiver speed—far less polished, of course.
Burton lined all over the offense at Florida, taking snaps at tight end, wide receiver, running back and even as a passer—versatility that no doubt appealed to Eagles head coach Chip Kelly. He’s only listed at 6’3”, 235 pounds, which I find small for a tight end, but realistically, it’s probably his position in name only.
I don’t think either guy is ready for the main roster, but wouldn’t be surprised to see one or both make the scout team.
BETTER OR WORSE
Better. Ertz can be a star in my opinion, as in right now, which is what makes this group leaps and bounds better than last season. Celek is still an effective receiving option, and found his niche in the Eagles’ run-blocking scheme, which should help offset any decline in talent. Nothing not to like here, including some interesting developmental rookies in the mix hoping to get noticed.
>> Previously: Quarterback / Running Back / Offensive LineThe Kelowna Rockets are pleased to announce that the NHL’s Detroit Red Wings will hold an open practice at Prospera Place in Kelowna on Wednesday, March 17 as part of a three day stay in Kelowna.
Canada’s Olympic head coach and Detroit bench boss Mike Babcock and the rest of the Red Wings will be stopping in Kelowna due to a four-day break between its games in Calgary on March 15 and in Edmonton on March 19. Players will be in Kelowna for three days while the team has scheduled two practices. The public will be able to watch one of the practices while the other will be closed to the public.
The open practice will be held from 11 a.m. to noon on March 17. Doors will open at 10 a.m. and the Kelowna Food Bank will be on hand to accept donations as admission to the event. Joining members of the food bank will be students from Okanagan College’s Students in Free Enterprise (SIFE) program who will receive course credits for helping out.
“The Red Wings contacted us about coming in because it didn’t make sense for them to go back to Detroit,” said Rockets’ President and G.M. Bruce Hamilton. “We felt it was a great opportunity to have them in Kelowna. It’s another event that is in our building and we’re looking forward to it.”
The Red Wings connection to the Okanagan is well known. Red Wings general manager Ken Holland is a Vernon native while Former Kelowna Rockets assistant coach Jeff Finley is a scout for the Red Wings and lives in Kelowna.

Technical information about the Canadian ePassport
This document provides technical details about international interoperability, authenticity of origin, integrity, unauthorized reading and chip cloning.
Technical details about the chip
The ePassport contains an embedded contactless computer chip and antenna using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology with a frequency of 13.56 MHz. To read the information on the chip, the ePassport reader energizes the chip circuitry by wirelessly emanating power and communicating through its antenna. The designed operating range of the chip circuitry is very small; it must be held within 10 centimetres of the reader.
Interoperability: Compliance with international standards
With technology such as ePassport chips, it is important to make sure that the chip can be read in Canada and by other countries. To do so, the ePassport chip is rigorously tested to ensure it conforms to various internationally recognized standards, including:
- ICAO 9303: This is the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) technical standard for machine-readable passports, specifically for biometric or electronic passports.
- ISO/IEC 14443: Managed jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electro-technical Commission (IEC), this standard defines proximity cards used for identification and the transmission protocols for communicating with them.
- ISO/IEC 7816: Managed jointly by ISO and IEC, this standard is related to electronic identification cards with contacts, especially smart cards.
- Common criteria: This refers to the common criteria standard for information technology security evaluation.
Tampering and inauthenticity: Passive authentication
The ePassport bearer’s personal information and digitized picture are stored on the embedded chip. To prove this data hasn’t been tampered with and is authentic, a security feature called passive authentication is used. During production, the data is digitally signed with strong Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) algorithms such as RSA-PSS 2048 and SHA-256. For this purpose, a “document signer” certificate is used, which in turn is signed with the issuing authority’s Country Signing Certification Authority (CSCA) certificate. The CSCA certificate forms the root of trust for the issuing authority’s ePassport PKI, a hierarchy using certificates to prove the data authenticity and integrity of ePassports. Due to the sensitive nature of this root of trust, the public portion of the CSCA certificate is distributed between nations through diplomatic exchange.
During validation of an ePassport, passive authentication cryptographically verifies the digital signature of the data stored on the chip and traces the signature back to the issuing authority’s CSCA certificate. This way, it can be determined if the issuing authority actually stored the ePassport data on the chip, and if this data is authentic and unmodified. As part of the ePassport validation process, border authorities may optionally check a revocation list of document signers published by the issuing authority’s CSCA. In the highly unlikely occurrence of a revocation, to minimize the number of ePassports affected by any one document signer certificate, the document signer certificates are changed at least every 90 days.
An alternate means for ePassport certificate distribution is the ICAO Public Key Directory (PKD) service. Participating countries, such as Canada, share their document signer certificates and revocation lists through this secure directory.
In addition to passive authentication protecting against data tampering, the chip is fused (permanently locked) after being encoded. This feature prevents any further writing to the chip.
Unauthorized reading: Basic access control
The personal information stored on the chip is privacy protected by basic access control (BAC). For the chip in the Canadian ePassport to be read, the passport must be held within 10 centimeters of a reader and the date of the individual’s birth, the date of expiration of the passport and the passport number must also first be provided to the reader (either by manually entering the information or from the machine readable zone when the book is inserted in the reader). Without this information, the information in the e-chip cannot be accessed.
BAC also protects the wireless communication channel after access is granted by generating a session encryption key with the reader and then encrypting all data transmitted both ways between the chip and the reader. The information cannot be read or easily decrypted by a radio frequency (RF) eavesdropper.
Cloning: Active authentication
An ePassport without chip copy protection could potentially be cloned by an impersonator with a substituted chip. This is an insignificant issue since the existing physical passport security features and passive authentication protect the ePassport against tampering.
As a preventative measure to detect cloning, active authentication (AA) is implemented in ePassports. AA works by including a cryptographic key pair unique to each chip. While the AA public key is digitally signed with the rest of the ePassport data using passive authentication, the corresponding AA private key is stored in secure memory and cannot be read or copied. During ePassport validation, the chip then proves knowledge of this private key by means of a challenge-response protocol. This means that the chip’s private key signs a random challenge presented by the ePassport reader, and the ePassport reader then uses the chip’s AA public key to verify the signed response and recognize the ePassport chip as genuine.

By Jessica Agi
Since winning the latest season of Last Comic Standing, and ultimately scoring himself a half-hour stand-up show on Bravo and a development deal with NBC, Josh Blue has rarely stopped moving.
It’s a Friday afternoon and Blue has just landed in Florida for a headlining spot he’s doing that evening. But the sky-weary yet chipper stand-up comedian is happy to talk. “I work pretty much every day of the week and I’m in a different city every night, which is really crazy,” the 28-year-old comic says. “I’ve just been working all the time. [Last Comic] changed my life, because now I’m really famous,” he jokes. “It’s cool that so many people want to see what I have to say, but it’s also a head trip.”
Calling it a “head trip” is a huge understatement. Blue was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, a neurological disorder that permanently affects body movement and muscle coordination, at the age of 1. Normally, it’s no laughing matter, but for Blue, CP has been the backbone for
a lot of his jokes. Stand-up, known to rip the honesty from performers’ mouths, makes perfect sense to Blue, who has no reservations about talking about his condition onstage or off.
“The thing is, it’s all I’ve ever known, you know? Cerebral palsy. If I didn’t have palsy, I’d just be some other geeky white guy,” he says. “Now at least I have something to talk about.” Blue is so honest, it’s painful sometimes. So it’s no surprise that he admires Chris Rock, a comedian known for his “no BS” approach.
“I just think he’s very educated, a very smart man,” explains Blue. “The stuff he talks about, if you think about it, should not be funny, but the way he puts it makes you not only laugh but also think about the situation.”
Blue calls his own stand-up style self-deprecating. “Some of my friends call it ‘reverse teasing’ because I make fun of myself,” he says. “I make fun of you by making fun of myself by making fun of you if that makes any sense at all.”
Sad but true, people are bound to stop and look, “so I want to give them something to stare at,” he says. “No one would deliberately be a jerk about someone with a disability, but you know if they are — fuck them. If people have negative things to say, usually it’s just that they’re ignorant. You’re afraid of what you don’t understand.”
This attitude came shining through for Blue even when his career in stand-up was just fledgling. Though he started hitting the country’s stages in earnest in 1999, Blue first did stand-up as a sophomore at Evergreen State College, a liberal-arts school in Washington. He used the confidence he gained from those informal shows to start at open- mics. During his last year of school, he was doing time every week at
a local coffee shop.
It’s been an upward climb ever since. Two years before he beat out 11 other contestants on Last Comic Standing, Blue won the Bass Ale New Talent Contest as well as $10,000 for being tops at the Las Vegas Comedy Festival’s Royal Flush Comedy Competition. He’s also just released his first live concert film 7 More Days in the Tank! and is already booked to headline clubs across the country well into the summer 2007.
Wise beyond his years and continually active, Blue has never let his condition ground him from doing much of anything – even off the comedy stage. He’s an avid soccer player, and in fact, went to Athens, Greece, to play as a member of the 2004 U.S. Paralympic soccer team. He’s also been known to occasionally play the slide guitar for Denver band Zebra Junction, and he’s an enthusiastic painter and sculptor.
“I had a big art show at a gallery opening four days after I won Last Comic Standing,” he says, adding that the gallery experience was one of his most rewarding accomplishments, even with all his newfound fame.
“Things are still good, but it definitely takes getting used to,” Blue says. [It’s]“Like you’re on a date and somebody comes at you, like, ‘Hey man, can I get your autograph?’ It’s hard to keep her feeling special because all these people want my attention so much. It’s a weird dilemma to be in.
OUT OF AFRICA
Blue is no stranger to adjusting to an ever-changing life. He was born in the central African nation of Cameroon, where his father, Walt, a French professor, was teaching English in the small rural country. Although he left when he was very young, Blue returned to Africa when he was 15 and has been to the continent four times since.
“The last time I was in Africa, I was doing an internship,” he says of his time at the Dakar Zoo in Senegal. “I’ve been attacked by more animals than most people know the names of. The cool thing about Senegal is that I knew if I got the internship there, the laws and rules were a little more lenient. So the first day I got to the zoo, they gave me a broom and put me in a tiger cage to clean it — holy shit!”
But since the summer of 2001, when Blue took a job at an Easter Seals camp, the comedian has called Denver, Colo., home. By 2002, he quit
a steady paycheck — this time working with developmentally disabled adults — to pursue stand-up full time.
He and his family get good mileage out of their passports. His brother lives in Korea, one of his sisters lives in Mexico, and his other sister and his parents live in Minnesota. Perhaps it’s that Midwest culture that keeps Blue out of the sometimes toxic Hollywood scene. Don’t get him wrong, he’s still good friends with fellow Last Comic Standing contestants. It’s just that his aspirations lie beyond the stand-up stage.
“There’s a ton of stuff on my plate. I’d like to be in movies, write a sitcom, and maybe direct eventually,” he says. “I have a book that I’d like to publish. I started writing it in college — just a bunch of short stories about my life. I gotta work more on it. And I’d like to have a big house out in the woods somewhere and raise some kids.”
Blue continues to entertain and inspire comedians, comedy fans and those living with disabilities. “With comedy, the only way you know you’re good at it, or to figure it out, is to do it — you have to try it and see what happens,” he says. “The way I learned comedy is just by watching other people — watching many other comics, see what you like and what you don’t like. As for living with a disability, watch as much comedy as you can. Don’t take things too seriously. I won’t ask for help but I’m not afraid to ask for help. There’s a fine line between asking for too much help and just being stubborn.”
Blue is no doubt a brave man. He uses something that stops so many others as fuel for success. He has every right to be on cloud nine but has somehow stayed grounded throughout it all. It makes sense that when asked about his biggest fear, nothing comes to mind: “I know when to be afraid of situations,” he says, “and I know when not to be.”

Fuselage panels for the upper shell of the center fuselage will ship from Spirit's plant in Kinston, N.C., where they are being manufactured.
Workers are finishing up the final panel, Spirit spokesman Ken Evans said.
A giant Antonov airplane is on the ground at the Kinston plant ready to move the shipment, Evans said.
Spirit workers in France will begin final assembly of the panels as soon as they arrive, he said.
The panels for the lower shell of the center fuselage will ship from Kinston by the end of the year, Evans said.
Final assembly for the upper and lower panels, which will become the center fuselage section over the wing, will occur during the first quarter of 2012, he said.
The early shipments will be flown to France. Eventually, the panels will be delivered by ships to France.Chicago, ILUSA

Landing Gear Hydraulic Hose Failure
Landing Gear Hydraulic Hose Failure
This article was provided by the FAA Aircraft Certification Office (ACO) Airframe,
Propulsion and Services (ACE-118W) located in Wichita, Kansas.
Failing Parts: S2178-4 series hydraulic hoses used in the landing gear system.
Service Difficulty Reports (SDRs) are being received of landing gear hydraulic hose
(P/N S2178-4 series) failures. In several cases, the failure resulted in a loss of
hydraulic fluid, inability to extend the landing gear, and a gear-up landing.
An example of this is NTSB Report DEN01LA119 describing a Model 177RG. On
July 1, 2001, the aircraft landed nose gear down/main gear up due to a nose gear
actuator hose failure. After the accident the failed hose was identified as an
S2178-4 series hose.
Cessna provided a Service Bulletin SEB 92-8 dated April 17, 1992, which
mandated replacement of S2178-4 series hydraulic hoses with S2888 series hoses
for certain Cessna Models 177RG, F177RG, 210, and P210.
Since an operator is not required to incorporate an SEB to maintain an
airworthiness certificate, it appears that some operators (like the 177RG example)
are not implementing SEB 92-8. To avoid in-flight loss of hydraulics due to
S2178-4 hose failures, all owners, operators, and maintenance personal should
verify Cessna SEB 92-8 has been incorporated on aircraft they fly and maintain.
If the SEB has not been completed, it is recommended that it be complied with
immediately.

In July, 1,904 existing homes found a buyer, for a 13 percent increase over July 2011, according to numbers from San Antonio Board of Realtors.
"I think we're seeing the confidence back in the consumer now," said SABOR CEO Angela Shields. "There's a lot of good deals out there today."
Who's buying?
Houses are moving because people are moving to San Antonio for jobs. Bargain basement interest rates are a lure, too.
"You're seeing some first-time home buyers getting into the market," Shields said. "You're also seeing people taking advantage of the fact they can buy up."
Homes prices less than $200,000 are the hottest sellers, making up about 65 percent of the July sales.
Prices are moving on up, too.
The median price of homes sold in July was $164,200, compared to $157,000 the same time last year.
So far this year, sales are outpacing 2011. If the trend continues, the city is on track to have the strongest year since before the Recession.

For the download to begin, you must have The Witcher 2 already fully installed. Be aware that the downloader will not resume downloads of in-progress files.

Patches and Modifications
Official Patches
Version 3.4.1 is available here. This patch adds an option to User Content Manager where you can choose the location where you want to keep the mods for The Witcher 2.
Modifications
Game modifications can be found at The Witcher Nexus.
Known Issues
Poor Performance
More a feature than a bug; be sure you meet the system requirements of The Witcher 2 before attempting to play it. It is a very resource intensive game and playing it even on the lowest quality settings requires a powerful computer with a modern graphics card and high clock-speed CPU. You should not attempt to play The Witcher 2 without at least 2GB of RAM, a 1GB video card and a 3GHz or faster dual (quad is preferred) core processor.
GOG Trivia
- The first new game released on GOG with a pre-order offer.
- Users could pre-order The Witcher 2 some months before its release on GOG.com, but were not charged immediately and could pay the pre-order price until the end of May 2011.
- The news that The Witcher 2 would be censored in Australia led GOG.com to change its privacy policy and remove the automatic IP-based geolocation from the site essentially giving Australians access to the full, uncensored game.
- Users buying this game in Europe (the UK not included) are awarded coupons equal to $15 as store credit because legal issues mean the Euro price cannot be adjusted to match the price in USD and so European customers are charged around $15 extra for the game.
- The Witcher 2: Enhanced Edition is the only game in the GOG catalogue that has three pages of screenshots.
- The Witcher 2 is the only GOG with more than one gigabyte of bonus content, and currently has more bonuses than any other GOG.Search the collections

Title:
South America Sheet II Guayana and North Brazil.
Description: This is a fine example of the 1837 Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge or S.D.U.K. map of Guyana and northern Brazil. It covers from British Guyana south to Bahia. Dutch and French Guyana are also included. Throughout, the map identifies various cities, towns, rivers, mountain passes and an assortment of additional topographical details with elevation rendered by hachure. This map was issued shortly after the Brazilian war of Independence that freed the massive South America nation from colonial Portuguese control in 1822. In 1831, Pedro I, the founder and first ruler of the new Empire of Brazil abdicated in favor of his five year old son and left for Europe. Under the weak regency elected to rule the country until Pedro II came of age as Emperor, Brazil descended into in civil war. In 1840, Pedro II was declared fit to rule and, proving a strong monarch, managed to bring stability and peace to Brazil. This map was originally published by Baldwin and Cradock and copyrighted in 1836, but was issued in Volume two of Chapman and Hall's 1844 edition of Maps of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. It was engraved by John Walker of J. and C. Walker.

WalkerI enjoyed Diana Ross's performance in the movie, but I truly do not understand why she would want to play this role. Let me explain.
Diana Ross plays Tracy Chambers. She wants to be a fashion designer. Badly. She spends her days working at a department store and her nights taking fashion classes. She's working VERY HARD to accomplish her dreams. She's passionate about fashion. That's great! Good for her.
Then men start to fuck things up for her.
First there's this one - famous fashion photographer Sean (played by Anthony Perkins). He's shooting a campaign for the department store that Tracy works at and thinks she'd be a much better model than the ones the store provided him with. He tells Tracy she should come to Rome with him and he'll make her a star. She doesn't particularly want to be a model, but she thinks it could help her break into the fashion industry and start her on her way to becoming a designer..... so she considers the option. Good, right?
Not so much, because from the get-go it's pretty blatant that Sean is a sketchball and he also exploits her (deciding to shoot the fashion campaign in front of some abandoned slum-ish buildings near where Tracy lives; using poor and homeless people from her neighborhood as human props during the shoot).
Meanwhile, around the same time that Sean steps into her life - so does Brian Walker (Billy Dee Williams). They become a couple.
Brian is trying to help his neighborhood (which is also Tracy's) and change the world. Marvelous! That's commendable! But he is so, so incredibly full of himself and infuriatingly self-righteous. He acts as though Tracy is a frivolous nimrod because she wants to be a fashion designer. He wants her to just stop that silly bullshit and work for him! The worst part - she basically does!
Sean goes back to Europe and Tracy doesn't go with him, opting instead to stick around Chicago to help Brian with his campaign. She continues to go to her classes, but Brian definitely isn't happy about it and he's especially pissed when she dares - DARES - to miss a dinner or two in order to go meet with clothing companies she'd like to get a job designing for.
He is an asshole. At this point in the movie (the beginning), I thought that the movie ALSO considered him to be an asshole. So I was fine with it.
Little did I know that that was not the case.
Thankfully, she eventually gets sick of him constantly demeaning everything that's important to her, so she decides to go off to be with Sean in Rome. I still believe that Sean is trouble, but at this point I think that anything is better than hanging out being Brian's smiling dinner date, so I'm pleased about her choice.
Mere moments after entering Sean's apartment it becomes apparent that she should run away as fast as she can. He has a shrine to his last model muse. He tells her that he turns his creations into "inanimate objects". His last one was known as "Crystal", Tracy will be known as "Mahogany."
At the first meeting she attends, Tracy doesn't enjoy listening to the men talking about her as though she were a piece of meat, but she carries on and soon the movie makes it seem like she is insanely successful as a model.
I won't say that she is extremely successful (later on the plot makes it seem like she may not have been), but there's a very long montage that suggests she is as huge as Cindy Crawford or Naomi Campbell or Linda Evangelista were in their heyday.
Meanwhile - back in Chicago - Brian sees her in a fashion magazine. In my head (once again - at this point I'm convinced that the movie sees Brian as being "wrong" / the "bad guy" in their relationship) I presume that he's thinking - "Wow. She really is successful. I was so wrong to rain on her parade and be a total dick to her regarding her interest in fashion."
But as her success grows, she decides that maybe the time has come to start pursuing that designer dream again. She tries to wear one of her own creations in an ad - Brian mocks her and rips the beaded neckpiece off.
Sean embarasses her in front of everyone by bidding an insultingly low price for it. She cries on the runway. A wealthy Italian man feels bad for her and bids / purchases the dress for a very high amount. She disses Sean. He is not pleased that his creation is disrespecting him.
At this point I'm confused, because if she were truly as successful as the last portion of the movie made it seem like she was, people would immediately have started bidding on her dress. It wasn't made to look hideous in any way (although very geisha-like and cultural appropriation-y). You can't tell me that people in the audience wouldn't want to bid on a dress designed by a FASHION SUPERSTAR even if it WAS ugly. This is when - in my mind - accuracy goes out the window: if she is truly a fashion superstar like they imply, she would have people fawning all over her and tons of contacts willing to help her start a line.
Anyway. This dude shows up. I think - "He's come to congratulate her! He's come to apologize to her!" NOTHING OF THE SORT. He continues to belittle her and asks her to quit and come back to Chicago to help him run his campaign. ARE YOU KIDDING ME, MAN?
Yes, Sean starts going off his gourd and threatens him with a gun from his enormous collection, but still! She's breaking away from Sean anyway. She needs to just get rid of both of you.
And - after Sean terrifyingly puts her life in danger in order to get a shot - she does. She moves in with the wealthy Italian guy to escape Sean and he agrees to finance her first official collection.
She exhibits some diva-esque behavior (for the FIRST TIME, basically) in the midst collection creation stress, but it is pretty mild. It in no way compares to the array of shitty Brian or Sean behavior we have seen so far in the movie. She yells at a few of her seamstresses (and the Italian man chides her for it). It's not appealing or particularly becoming (she used to be best friends with a seamstress, she should know better), but it's also not damnable or odious.
I want to state again - that this is the first time (in my opinion) that she does anything remotely "unlikable" during the course of the film.
Not that it's bad to be unlikable in a movie - people that won't watch a film with an "unlikable" heroine are people that I just cannot fathom - but I wanted to point that out.
Not that it's bad to be unlikable in a movie - people that won't watch a film with an "unlikable" heroine are people that I just cannot fathom - but I wanted to point that out.
Her collection is enthusiastically received but she's just not happy. In my mind this is because she realizes that she was a bit of a shit to the people helping her make it but - once again - I am incorrect and that is not the case.
Back at the Italian villa, the rich guy implies that now that the runway show is over, she needs to climb into bed with him in order to repay her debt. She decides to leave. Her collection was so successful I figure she'll still be sticking around Europe to pursue her dreams (now that it's obvious she has real talent). Maybe she won't stay in Rome, but she'll try Paris or somewhere else. After all - with so many ads and billboards, she must have some money, right?
Another question - if she were really such a superstar.... she wouldn't be a millionaire, but she'd at least have enough money to finance a collection without the help of a sleazy guy for help?
In the end, the movie was on Brian's side all along. In the mind of the movie, the titular character was a fashion-obsessed idiot who needed to learn that that was a bunch of silly shit and that she should come to her senses and stand by her man. WHATTTTTTTTT. Thus - why would Diana Ross make this movie? Why would someone in the arts want to play a role in a movie that basically says - "The arts are stupid. Anyone interested in pursuing them must be pretty insipid. Be in politics." There's no way that Brian would have supported Tracy if she had wanted to be a singer instead of a designer.
The worst part - I keep track of all the movies I've watched on Letterboxd, and after I finished this one I went over there to mark it off. While I was doing that I found the following review (from a guy, naturally) -
"Mahogany starts by contrasting Billy Dee Williams's political fervor with Diana Ross's vapid interest in fashion. After insinuating Williams's path is more valid, it's bizarre the rest of the film follows Ross as she becomes a model and designer. She sort of gets her comeuppance, but it's unpleasant being saddled with such a shrill narcissist."
Are you KIDDING ME? "Shrill narcissist"? Nothing is more narcissistic than Brian expecting his short-term girlfriend to abandon all of her own dreams to help him pursue his. I can't even. Sexism at its finest.
I wish I had chosen to watch Lady Sings the Blues instead.About FTD
What is FTD?
- Frontotemporal dementia (also known as frontotemporal degeneration) is a progressive brain disorder that results from atrophy in the frontal and/or temporal lobes of the brain. Depending on the specific location of the degeneration, frontotemporal dementia can result in changes in behavior, language, and personality. "FTD" can refer to the whole class of disorders or a specific subtype called "behavioral variant."
What are possible symptoms?
- Change in personality (often including social withdrawal)
- Loss of interest in usual activities
- Sense of detachment from family and friends
- Socially embarrassing behavior (loss of "social filter")
- Development of compulsive or rigid behaviors (new routines, repetitive habits)
- Changes in eating behavior (increased intake, carbohydrate cravings)
- Difficulty with finding or understanding words (slower verbal processing)
What do I do if my loved one exhibits some of the above symptoms?
- Visit a neurologist for an evaluation and share your observations.
- He or she will probably recommend:
- Blood tests to rule out other causes of cognitive changes
- Brain imaging
- MRI
- An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan will look for changes in the size or structure of different parts of the brain
- PET
- A PET (positron-emission tomography) scan will look for changes in the activity of different parts of the brain.
- Once these evaluations are completed, you may request a referral from this neurologist to the UCLA FTD & Neurobehavior Clinic.
- Records of blood tests, neurological evaluation, and brain imaging must be sent to the Nurse Practioner and Clinic Coordinator, Jill Shapira.
- The records will be reviewed and you will be contacted for more information, if necessary.
- If the records and referral are appropriate for our program, the Clinic Coordinator will contact you to schedule an initial evaluation.

The Association for Frontotemporal DegenerationFAPESP and JSPS organize Japan-Brazil Symposium
The March 15-16, 2013 conference promotes international research collaboration between scientists in the state of São Paulo and in Japan through discussions on research in strategic areas
A symposium jointly organized by the São São São sustainable rural development in Brazil, and research on biofuel production, among other topics.
On March 16, the program will present researchers’ findings on obesity, Chagas disease, the diagnosis of viral diseases, and the development of vaccines against malaria and factors associated with its emergence.
Exhibit on biodiversity
One of the activities slated for the Japan-Brazil Symposium will be the March 14 opening of the ‘Brazilian Nature’ exhibit in the Espaço Cultural at the Embassy of Brazil in Tokyo. Result of a partnership between FAPESP and the Berlin Botanical Museum, the exhibit displays the documentation of German botanist Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius (1794-1868) in his work Flora brasiliensis, which, 172 years after its first publication, still stands as the most complete survey of Brazilian flora ever made.
The botanist’s work also led to the project ‘Flora Brasiliensis On-line and Revisted’ that includes an updated nomenclature of von Martius’ original work along with recent information and illustrations of species described after the initial publication. The exhibit also presents a comparison of the 19th century drawings and current photographs of plants and biomes, and depicts some of the findings of research performed under the scope of the project ‘Phanerogamic Flora of the state of São Paulo’ and the BIOTA-FAPESP program on biodiversity, which for 13 years has conducted research for the description, conservation, recovery and sustainable use of the biodiversity.
Conceived on the basis of data obtained through these three projects sponsored by FAPESP, the exhibit features 37 panels with reproductions of prints and illustrations along with explanatory text. The sample that will travel to Tokyo has already been viewed in Madrid and Salamanca (Spain), Berlin, Bremen, Leipzig, Heidelberg and Eichstätt (Germany), Toronto (Canada), and Washington, DC, Columbus, Cambridge and Morgantown (United States).
Digital scans of the exhibit may be viewed with subtitles in Portuguese, English, German and Spanish at:.

Disclaimer:Yankee pulled south by Mexican magnet
Electronic scrap dealer opens outpost in Guadalajara, pursuing NAFTA-era suppliers in 'Silicon Valley del Sur'
To people in Guadalajara, Mexico's booming number two city, Larry Manhan must have cut an odd figure. The founder of BCS Inc., an electronic-scrap business based in a Los Angeles suburb, flew 1,300 miles deep into the Mexican heartland in August to visit the so-called Silicon Valley del Sur. Mexico and Manhan, 63, a self-described workaholic who speaks no Spanish and favors loud Hawaiian shirts, aren't a natural fit. Yet in touring Guadalajara's bustling industrial sectors, he recalls, "I was absolutely overwhelmed by the size of the plants and the number of people they employed."
So overwhelmed was Manhan that two months later he started BCS Electronic Recovery Service, in Guadalajara, the Mexican counterpart of his company in Canoga Park, Calif.
Manhan was pursuing his source of supply. Many computer, telephone, and circuit-board manufacturers, including such giants as Hewlett-Packard and Solectron, have been expanding their plants in Mexico more quickly than in California. A major reason for that is NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, adopted by Canada, Mexico, and the United States in 1994 to dismantle all remaining, substantial trade barriers among the three countries over 15 years.
As large companies shift their manufacturing facilities to Mexico, seeking lower wage rates and less regulation, entrepreneurs like Manhan are following on their heels. He's part of an influx of American start-ups--particularly in the consulting, component-manufacturing, telecommunications, and electronics industries--that in many cases are "providing support services to the assemblers and big manufacturers," says Andrew Wylegala, a commercial attachÃ‰ at the U.S. embassy in Mexico City.
Manhan is new to Mexican ways, and he's also operating his company long-distance from California. That has meant some cultural adjustments. On his second trip to Guadalajara, in September, he scouted for rental space in a warehouse. The five real estate agents who schlepped him around town didn't always know what they were doing. One, for instance, handed her card to the cab driver and asked for leads. "When I cross the border, I don't act like a Yankee," says Manhan. "I slow down."
Undaunted, Manhan returned to Guadalajara later that month. He rented a warehouse, paying $30,000 up front for one year--customary in Mexico. With the help of the local electronics manufacturers' association, he hired a general manager and a marketing director. And he paid a lawyer $20,000 to incorporate BCS Electronic Recovery Service as a Mexican company. All told, getting the business off the ground cost $100,000.
Much about the Mexican venture looks promising. As the sole electronics recycler in Guadalajara, Manhan has an abundant supply of scrap. He sells to his network of Asian customers, especially the Chinese. His costs are low--the salaries he pays his Mexican employees, for example, are about a third of what he'd pay in the United States, he estimates. He's already projecting a small profit in 1999, on revenues of $600,000.
In an economy as historically unstable as Mexico's, of course, some risks are inescapable. The economic turmoil that's already roiling emerging markets could slow Mexico's economic growth and batter the peso, says Sidney Weintraub of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in Washington, D.C. For Manhan, whose Asian customers pay him mostly in pesos, weakness in the currency would eat into profits.
Manhan must contend, too, with the complexities of absentee ownership. At a cost of $1,000 he flew his general manager to California for tutelage about the scrap business. But, Manhan says, when the general manager delayed having the Guadalajara warehouse cleaned and its telephones connected, Manhan fired him.
In adapting to Mexico, Manhan says he'll go only so far. In meetings with officials and suppliers, he wears khakis instead of his trademark California-casual jeans. But he says that learning Spanish--beyond burrito and tequila--is another matter.
Bite losing teeth
La mordida, the bite--the wry Spanish euphemism for bribery--is to Mexico's business life what cornmeal is to its diet, no?
Actually, no.
Cornmeal remains the national staple, but the culture of la mordida appears to be waning in Mexico, say some experts. "It used to be nearly impossible to do business in Mexico without paying a bribe," says Jorge Gonzalez, chairman of the economics department at Trinity University, in San Antonio, and a Mexican-affairs specialist. "Now, many companies are doing fine without paying."
Deregulation of the economy is removing the opportunity for corrupt officials to demand bribes, says Gonzalez. Opening a store in Mexico City 15 years ago, for example, might have required 25 permits, compared with 3 or 4 today.
A second reason for the retreat away from la mordida is the growing revulsion felt by a new generation of Mexican business and professional people now coming into their own, says Nancy Oretskin, director of the U.S.-Mexico Conflict Resolution Center at New Mexico State University, in Las Cruces, N. Mex. "Young people understand," Oretskin says, "that Mexico will be rebuked by the international business community if corruption isn't attacked."

UNITED STATES of America, Appellee,
v.
Sheldon Arthur YEFSKY, Defendant, Appellant.
No. 90-1174.
United States Court of Appeals,
First Circuit.
Heard Dec. 7, 1992.
Decided May 3, 1993.
Theodore L. Craft, Boston, MA, for appellant.
Louis M. Fischer, Atty., Dept. of Justice, Washington, DC, with whom A. John Pappalardo, U.S. Atty., Boston, MA, was on brief, for appellee.
Before TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge, and CYR, Circuit Judge.
COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.
Sheldon Yefsky was convicted by a jury of a dual-object conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371 and 1341, and of four counts of mail fraud, unrelated to the conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341. On appeal, Yefsky raises a number of challenges to his conviction. After an exhaustive review of the record, we affirm.
I.
We begin with a brief description of the facts and proceedings.
The Greater Boston Police Council (GBPC) was formed in the early 1960s as a mutual aid society for various metropolitan area law enforcement agencies. The GBPC enabled its members to purchase equipment at reduced prices pursuant to collective purchase agreements. As an unincorporated association, the GBPC relied on one of its members to act as its fiduciary agent.
At all times relevant to this case, the Town of Newton, whose police chief William Quinn served as the chair of the GBPC, fulfilled that role. Quinn, in turn, relied heavily on Timothy Coogan, a civilian employee of the police department, to conduct the daily operations of the GBPC. Coogan became a full-time employee after graduating from law school and ended his affiliation with Newton in mid-1985, when the offenses underlying this case surfaced.
A primary concern of the GBPC was the inability of the member police departments to communicate with each other by radio. To solve this problem, the GBPC undertook a project to develop an integrated radio system for its members. This system became known as the Boston Area Police Emergency Radio Network (BAPERN).
In 1975, the GBPC hired a Chicago-based firm, Computer and Engineering Services (CES), of which Yefsky is president, to assess the existing radio systems. One year later, CES was awarded a bid contract of $31,000 to design and implement BAPERN. The system used Motorola equipment, which was available at a discount through a GBPC collective purchase contract.
By June 1978, BAPERN was fully operational, connecting 23 cities and towns, and Coogan had became the BAPERN project director and general counsel and administrator for the GBPC. In these capacities, Coogan exercised financial and administrative control of GBPC affairs, including the BAPERN project. He encouraged organizations to join BAPERN and recommended CES to them for engineering and design work. Coogan alone received shipping orders from BAPERN members to the GBPC, prepared GBPC/Newton shipping orders to CES and Motorola, approved invoices from these businesses to the GBPC/Newton for payment, prepared bills from the GBPC/Newton to the BAPERN members, and received the members' payments. Newton officials, including Quinn, merely rubber stamped his work. Coogan was, in many respects, the person most identified with the GBPC.
In 1985, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began an investigation of Coogan, which revealed large amounts of income that he had not reported to the IRS. The unreported income stemmed from two sources. First, Coogan had become a paid consultant to International Telecommunications Service, Inc. (ITS), a subsidiary of CES, to perform engineering field work on the BAPERN system. Second, Coogan had overcharged GBPC members for radio equipment and had diverted the overcharge to a secret bank account for his personal use.
In 1989, Coogan, Yefsky, his son Michael Yefsky, the president of ITS, and Samuel Diamond, the financial officer and tax preparer for CES and ITS, were charged with numerous criminal violations stemming from their involvement in the BAPERN project. The indictment charged the existence of two separate schemes to defraud members of the GBPC and charged Coogan alone with tax fraud for concealing his illicit profits from both schemes (Counts 2-4).
The first scheme charged was a conspiracy involving all four defendants (Count 1). The goals of the conspiracy were to pay Coogan kickbacks for sending engineering work to CES and to help him hide that income from the IRS. The kickbacks were the payments ITS made to Coogan, allegedly for his field services. At trial, the government explained that the kickbacks were financed by charging GBPC members for engineering services that were unnecessary or never were performed or by overcharging for work actually done.
The second intrigue implicated Coogan and Yefsky in a mail fraud scheme based on the equipment overcharge and diversion of funds for Coogan's personal use (Counts 5-14). The government consistently has admitted that this was a scheme distinct from the engineering conspiracy. The mailing of ten payments for equipment, maintenance fees, and BAPERN expansion fees by member organizations comprised the individual mail fraud counts.
A tedious and rambling trial stretching 86 days ensued. Over 1000 exhibits were admitted, with more than half subjected to limitations as to the various counts and defendants. The government alone consumed 44 days and 878 exhibits to present its case-in-chief. Yefsky used another 24 days and 376 exhibits to present his defense. The thrust of his defense was that he did not join in either the conspiracy or the equipment scheme but was a pawn of Coogan.
At the trial's conclusion, the jury convicted Coogan of all 14 counts against him. It convicted Yefsky of the conspiracy count and 4 of the 10 mail fraud counts. It also convicted Michael Yefsky and Diamond of the conspiracy count, the only charge against them.
During the proceedings below, Yefsky made many motions, the decisions of which form the bases of this appeal. These motions include a motion for acquittal based on insufficiency of the evidence; a motion to dismiss the indictment for insufficiency and double jeopardy; a motion for severance; and an omnibus motion for a new trial that reiterated many of these issues as well as errors at trial.
Yefsky, his son, and Diamond appealed their convictions. The government then conceded the insufficiency of the evidence supporting the convictions of Michael Yefsky and Diamond, and the verdicts against them were set aside and dismissed. United States v. Yefsky, Memorandum and Order, Nos. 90-1222, -1240 (1st Cir. Jan. 29, 1993). Coogan did not appeal his conviction. Yefsky's appeal remains, and we turn now to the issues he raises.
II.
Yefsky contends that the district court erred in denying his motion, renewed at close of trial, for acquittal based on insufficiency of evidence. When reviewing a motion for acquittal, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. United States v. Torres Lopez, 851 F.2d 520, 527 (1st Cir.1988). We, therefore, "draw[ ] all legitimate inferences and resolv[e] all credibility determinations in favor of the verdict." United States v. Angiulo, 897 F.2d 1169, 1197 (1st Cir.1990).
A. The Conspiracy Count
To support a verdict of guilt, the evidence must prove each element of a conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt. These elements are the existence of a conspiracy, the defendant's knowledge of it, and his voluntary participation in it. United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 735 (1st Cir.1991). To prove voluntary participation, the government must show that the defendant intended both to agree with his co-conspirators and to commit the substantive offense. Id. Moreover, when the commission of mail fraud is a goal of the conspiracy, the government must show either an intent to use the mails or the reasonable foreseeability of such use. United States v. Dray, 901 F.2d 1132, 1137 (1st Cir.1990). We turn now to the facts that the jury reasonably could find in support of the verdict.
In 1979, the relationships among the GBPC, Coogan, and Yefsky changed, allowing the conspiracy to germinate. First, Coogan was forced to leave regular employment with the Newton Police Department because he was maintaining a private law practice. He became instead a consultant to the Department and, in 1980, to the GBPC. His duties, however, remained the same: assistant to Quinn (as police chief and GBPC chair), administrator of and general counsel to the GBPC, and project director of BAPERN. In addition, his contracts permitted him to engage in other telecommunications consulting work.
Second, government funding and oversight of the BAPERN project ended. Coogan then prepared an open-ended consulting contract for CES that defined its role during the expansion of BAPERN. The new contract called for CES to provide engineering services as requested by shipping orders issued through Newton on behalf of the GBPC members.
The CES contract did not permit CES to use subcontractors without written consent from Newton. Nonetheless, in December 1979, CES entered a contract with ITS by which ITS would perform field implementation studies and services for various CES projects, including BAPERN, and CES would pay ITS's salaries and overhead expenses.
At some point during this period, Coogan approached Yefsky, proposing to become CES's local "clerk of the works" for the BAPERN project. In December 1979, Coogan entered a contract with ITS to provide field engineering; site, installation and testing supervision; and training for the BAPERN expansion. Unlike Yefsky's other subcontractors, Coogan was paid a fixed price for each project on which he worked and was not required to submit time sheets to corroborate his fee. Neither Yefsky nor Coogan ever revealed their subcontracting relationship to the GBPC. Coogan, in fact, repeatedly denied to Chief Quinn engaging in any outside telecommunications consulting work.
From 1980 to mid-1985, 25 to 30 organizations joined the BAPERN system. Coogan recommended CES to many of them for engineering work. As a result, CES's income skyrocketed; during this period, the firm received approximately $964,000 for engineering services relating to BAPERN. More than half of the payments were for field work billed by Coogan. Coogan, in turn, received approximately $484,760 from ITS for his services. CES reimbursed ITS for this and other expenses, pursuant to their subcontract.
Many of the payments for engineering were inflated or unnecessary. Yefsky himself testified that he had not performed work for some of the police departments that had paid for engineering services. Some departments also paid more to the GBPC than CES had billed GBPC. Payments routinely were sent to the GBPC by mail.
Coogan did not report his ITS income to the IRS. Nor did ITS file Forms 1099 with the IRS to reflect payments to Coogan. ITS did, however, list the consulting fees as business expenses on its corporate tax returns. CES also listed its payments to ITS as business expenses.1
From these facts, the jury reasonably could draw a series of inferences to connect Yefsky to the mail fraud prong of the conspiracy. The jury could find that, once government oversight ended, Coogan and Yefsky grasped an opportunity to make money out of the BAPERN project. Thus, it could find that Coogan drafted the open-ended CES contract so that CES could pay him kickbacks to steer work orders to CES. It also could find that CES and Coogan financed the kickbacks by charging inflated fees for engineering work actually performed or completely false fees for work never performed. Accordingly, the jury could find that Yefsky and Coogan agreed to enrich themselves by defrauding the members of BAPERN.
Because we find the evidence sufficient to support Yefsky's conviction of conspiring to commit mail fraud, we uphold his conviction on Count 1 without considering the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the tax fraud object. See Griffin v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct. 466, 473-74, 116 L.Ed.2d 371 (1991) (evidence supporting one object of dual-object conspiracy held sufficient to support conspiracy conviction).
B. The Mail Fraud Counts
The indictment charged Yefsky and Coogan with ten counts of mail fraud in connection with the equipment overcharge scheme. Each mailing represented a payment from a BAPERN member that Coogan diverted to his secret bank account. Yefsky was convicted of four of the ten counts.
A conviction for mail fraud2 requires proof of two elements beyond a reasonable doubt. They are the defendant's participation in a scheme to defraud and the use of the mails, either by or caused by the defendants, in furtherance of the scheme. United States v. Serrano, 870 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1989). The defendant need not instigate the scheme so long as he willfully participates in it, with the knowledge of its fraudulent nature and with the intent to achieve its illicit objectives. Id. (citing United States v. Price, 623 F.2d 587, 591 (9th Cir.1980)).
A mailing falls within the scope of the fraud if it is sufficiently connected to the scheme to defraud and reasonably is foreseeable as a result of the participants' actions. United States v. Pacheco-Ortiz, 889 F.2d 301, 305 (1st Cir.1989); United States v. Silvano, 812 F.2d 754, 760 (1st Cir.1987). The mailing of proceeds of a fraudulent scheme is sufficient to uphold a conviction for mail fraud. Silvano, 812 F.2d at 760 (citations omitted).
Yefsky challenges the sufficiency of evidence linking him to the scheme to defraud and to the mailings. Because each count of which he was convicted undisputedly represents a mailing of proceeds of the scheme, Yefsky's convictions must be affirmed if the evidence sufficiently supports his participation in the scheme to overbill for equipment. We turn, therefore, to the evidence of Yefsky's participation in the equipment scheme.
In 1982, the GBPC negotiated a new contract with Motorola for the purchase of equipment. Yefsky assisted Coogan in the negotiations, which resulted in deeper discounts for BAPERN members. Coogan then began to bill BAPERN members inflated prices for Motorola equipment. He also provided false price lists, representing them as part of the Motorola contract, to corroborate the prices he charged. A Motorola employee testified at trial that a comparison of Motorola bills with GBPC bills for equipment revealed that Coogan had overcharged BAPERN members by at least $888,000.
Coogan deposited the overcharge into a bank account opened under GBPC's name but without its knowledge or authorization. He was the only person authorized to withdraw funds from this account. By December 1984, over $1.5 million had been deposited into the account. Coogan diverted this money for personal use, such as purchasing certificates of deposit and paying mortgages. The government conceded at oral argument that Yefsky had no knowledge of this account and did not share in the proceeds from the overcharge.
Yefsky, however, was present at meetings when inflated prices were quoted and discussed. He also recommended the kinds of equipment to be purchased to organizations joining BAPERN and included inflated price lists, obtained from Coogan, in feasibility studies he conducted for two organizations.
The facts connecting Yefsky to the equipment scheme are not as numerous as those connecting him to the engineering conspiracy. Nonetheless, the jury could conclude that Yefsky knew that the equipment prices were being inflated because he had helped to negotiate the purchase agreement that established the legitimate prices. It could conclude that Yefsky then joined the equipment scheme by supporting and using Coogan's quotations of inflated prices. It also could conclude that Yefsky entered the scheme to ensure Coogan's ongoing participation in the engineering conspiracy. These inferences and the facts supporting them are sufficient to sustain Yefsky's convictions of mail fraud.
III.
Yefsky next challenges the adequacy of the indictment, claiming that the engineering fraud prong of the conspiracy count was defective because it did not specify the false pretenses used.3 He contends that this defect deprived him of the ability to present a meaningful defense. The district court agreed that the count did not specify the false pretenses alleged but determined that the indictment as a whole sufficiently warned Yefsky of the charges against him. Memorandum and Order, December 20, 1988, at 2. It therefore refused to dismiss the engineering fraud count. We disagree with the district court's decision but find its error harmless.
Rule 7(c)(1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires an indictment to provide "a plain, concise and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged." The Supreme Court has instructed that an indictment is sufficient if it contains the elements of the offense charged, fairly informs the defendant of the charges against which he must defend, and enables him to enter a plea without fear of double jeopardy. Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 117, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2907, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974); accord, United States v. Serino, 835 F.2d 924, 929 (1st Cir.1987). The indictment may incorporate the words of the statute to set forth the offense, but the statutory language " 'must be accompanied with such a statement of the facts and circumstances as will inform the accused of the specific offense, coming under the general description, with which he is charged.' " Hamling, 418 U.S. at 117-18, 94 S.Ct. at 2907-08 (quoting United States v. Hess, 124 U.S. 483, 487, 8 S.Ct. 571, 573-74, 31 L.Ed. 516 (1888)). An indictment for conspiracy, however, need not allege the predicate offense with the same precision as the substantive count. Wong Tai v. United States, 273 U.S. 77, 81, 47 S.Ct. 300, 301-02, 71 L.Ed. 545 (1927); United States v. Fusaro, 708 F.2d 17, 23 (1st Cir.1983).
Focusing on this last principle, the government argues that the indictment passes muster. It urges that the challenged count's imprecision regarding the mail fraud objective is irrelevant. Because the count clearly charged an agreement to defraud by use of the mails, the government argues that Yefsky was able to prepare a defense to the conspiracy charge.
We disagree. " 'Where guilt depends so crucially upon such a specific identification of fact, our cases have uniformly held that an indictment must do more than simply repeat the language of the criminal statute.' " Hamling, 418 U.S. at 118, 94 S.Ct. at 2908 (quoting Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 764, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 1047, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962)) (emphasis in Hamling ). We think a mail fraud conspiracy depends so crucially on the underlying fraud that the fraud also must be specified in the applicable count.
We reach this conclusion based on the unusual nature of mail fraud. A multi-member mail fraud is itself treated like a conspiracy. See Serrano, 870 F.2d at 6 (multi-member fraud requires each member to participate in common scheme with intent to commit fraud); see generally United States v. Wormick, 709 F.2d 454, 461 (7th Cir.1983) (applying conspiracy principles to multi-defendant mail fraud indictment). Thus, the engineering conspiracy count essentially charged Yefsky with agreeing to commit another conspiracy.4 Yefsky could not be expected to defend himself from a charge of conspiring to join a conspiracy to perpetrate a fraud if the indictment did not identify the fraud that was the ultimate underlying offense.
It is undisputed that the engineering conspiracy count did not identify the plan used to defraud the GBPC. The count alleged only that Coogan had used his control over the GBPC to arrange CES's open-ended engineering contract in 1979, that Coogan had signed a contract with ITS to provide field services, that CES received approximately $964,000 under its new contract, and that ITS paid Coogan $484,760. None of these allegations, on their face, describe fraudulent conduct. The count then stated in conclusory language drawn from the mail fraud statute that Coogan had obtained this money from the GBPC members through false pretenses. It did not divulge the factual basis of this accusation. Accordingly, the count did not provide Yefsky with adequate notice of the charge against him.).
The district court, however, upheld the sufficiency of the indictment because it held that "such specification can be inferred from a reading of the entire indictment." Memorandum and Order at 2. The substantive mail fraud counts specified that Coogan and Yefsky had charged inflated rates for equipment. The court reasoned that the similarity of the engineering conspiracy and the substantive equipment scheme enabled Yefsky to determine that the false pretenses used for the conspiracy must have been overcharges for engineering services.
Contrary to the district court's ruling, the deficiency in the count was not curable by reading the indictment as a whole. " 'Each count in an indictment is regarded as if it was a separate indictment.' " United States v. Winter, 663 F.2d 1120, 1138 (1st Cir.1981) (quoting Dunn v. United States, 284 U.S. 390, 393, 52 S.Ct. 189, 190-91, 76 L.Ed. 356 (1932)); 1 Charles A. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Crim.2d (Federal Practice and Procedure ) § 123 at 349 (1982). Thus, each count must be sufficient without reference to other counts unless the allegations of those counts expressly are incorporated. Winter, 663 F.2d at 1138 (quoting United States v. Fulcher, 626 F.2d 985, 988 (D.C.Cir.1980)); 1 Federal Practice and Procedure § 123 at 349. The engineering conspiracy count did not incorporate any of the allegations underlying the equipment fraud counts. We therefore review it standing alone, and, as it was written, the engineering conspiracy count was defective.
Indeed, there is no reason for the conspiracy count to refer to the separate equipment fraud counts. Although it makes sense to read a conspiracy indictment as a whole when the substantive offenses also are the objects of the conspiracy, see, e.g., Fusaro, 708 F.2d at 23, the substantive mail fraud counts in this case did not flow from the conspiracy count. The substantively charged scheme encompassed overcharges for equipment, not engineering, and, throughout trial, evidence of the two different overcharges was limited to the appropriate counts. We consider it disingenuous of the government to abandon this distinction, which it repeatedly has emphasized, when the blurring of the schemes conveniently serves a specific argument.
The finding of error does not, however, conclude our inquiry. We still must determine whether the defect in the indictment prejudiced Yefsky. Fusaro, 708 F.2d at 23 (citations omitted). Having reviewed the record and considered the impact of the error on the jury,))).
Although the indictment itself did not warn Yefsky of the nature of the engineering conspiracy, he received ample notice before trial of the facts underlying it. Months before trial, the district court's decision on his motion informed Yefsky that "it would have been necessary for the defendant to charge inflated rates in order to make the alleged kickbacks to defendant Coogan." Memorandum and Order at 2. In addition, documents provided by the government during discovery revealed the overcharges that formed a basis for the engineering conspiracy. Yefsky, moreover, took 24 days to present his defense, which thoroughly explored his involvement in the BAPERN project and laid the blame for the engineering fraud at Coogan's feet. He thus had ample opportunity to rebut the government's charges. The defect, therefore, was harmless.
IV.
Yefsky also contends that the conspiracy improperly was joined with the substantive offenses and should have been severed. Alternatively, Yefsky argues that, because the joint trial prejudiced him, the district court should have severed the counts and also should have separated his trial from Coogan's. We deal first with the question of joinder and second with the question of severance.A. Joinder
Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure governs the joinder of offenses. Offenses may be charged jointly if the acts or transactions from which they stem are related. Fed.R.Crim.P. 8(a), (b). Yefsky contends that joinder of the conspiracy, tax fraud, and mail fraud counts was improper because each set of offenses was comprised of a discrete series of acts. The district court determined that despite the distinct nature of the three offenses, the acts underlying them were sufficiently connected for the offenses to be joined. Memorandum and Order at 3-5. Our review of joinder is plenary. United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 306-07 (1st Cir.1991) (citing United States v. MacDonald & Watson Waste Oil Co., 933 F.2d 35, 59 (1st Cir.1991)).
Yefsky points out the following dissimilarities among the counts. The engineering conspiracy involved one scheme to pay kickbacks to Coogan and to help him evade tax liability; the tax fraud encompassed Coogan alone; and the substantive fraud scheme entailed a distinct plot to inflate equipment prices, which overcharge Coogan alone pocketed. The conspiracy also predated the equipment overcharge scheme by three years. Yefsky argues that the only common thread in these charges is Coogan and that this single strand is too weak to bind the three offenses.
There can be no doubt that the tax fraud counts properly were joined with either the conspiracy or the mail fraud counts. As the district court noted, it is axiomatic that a defendant can be charged with both the conspiracy and the substantive offenses arising from it. United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 245 (1st Cir.1990); United States v. Arruda, 715 F.2d 671, 678 (1st Cir.1983). In this case, the conspiracy embraced many of the acts that constituted the tax fraud offenses and, therefore, the two properly were joined under Rule 8(b). Similarly, the tax fraud and mail fraud counts could be joined because some of the unreported income was the fruit of the mail fraud scheme. See United States v. Treadwell, 566 F.Supp. 80, 86-87 (D.D.C.1983), aff'd, 760 F.2d 327 (D.C.Cir.1985).
The harder question is whether the conspiracy and the mail fraud counts properly were joined. Although Count 1 accused defendants of conspiring to commit mail fraud, this engineering conspiracy differed from the equipment scheme charged substantively in Counts 5-14. To determine if the two schemes sufficiently were connected to the same series of acts to be joined, we must consider whether there is "substantial identity of facts or participants" underlying the charged offenses. United States v. Levine, 546 F.2d 658, 662 (5th Cir.1977). Mere similarity of the acts would not suffice. Natanel, 938 F.2d at 307; King v. United States, 355 F.2d 700, 703 (1st Cir.1966).
We conclude that the indictment properly consolidated these counts. Both schemes used the same basic mechanism to overcharge for services and equipment. As the district court found, the engineering conspiracy and the equipment fraud shared the same participants and victims and overlapped in time. Both offenses depended on the interrelationships among the GBPC, Coogan, and Yefsky for their operation. A joint trial of the offenses thus avoided problems of inconsistent verdicts and repetition of testimony. See United States v. Doherty, 867 F.2d 47, 63 (1st Cir.1989). Accordingly, the acts underlying the offenses were sufficiently related to warrant joinder.
A finding of proper joinder does not, however, end our inquiry. If a defendant is prejudiced from the joinder of counts, severance may be appropriate, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 14.5 We, therefore, must consider whether the benefit of joinder outweighed the risk of prejudice to the defendant. King, 355 F.2d at 704.
B. Severance
Yefsky argues that the district court erred in refusing to sever the engineering conspiracy from the equipment fraud6 and his trial from Coogan's. The decision to grant severance is committed to the district court's sound discretion. Zafiro v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. 933, 937-38, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993); Natanel, 938 F.2d at 308. Severance is appropriate "only if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence." Zafiro, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 938. Incidental spillover prejudice, which is almost inevitable in a multi-defendant trial, does not suffice. United States v. Sabatino, 943 F.2d 94, 97 (1st Cir.1991); United States v. Martinez, 922 F.2d 914, 923 (1st Cir.1991). We will not reverse a denial of severance, therefore, unless the defendant makes " 'a strong showing of prejudice.' " United States v. Gray, 958 F.2d 9, 14 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting United States v. Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d 42, 45 (1st Cir.1991)).
We look first at the severance of counts. In his pre-trial motion to sever, Yefsky suggested only that evidence of the amount of money garnered from the equipment fraud would overwhelm the lack of evidence of his participation in the engineering scheme. The district court refused to sever the counts, finding the mere allegation of potential spillover insufficient to warrant severance. Memorandum and Order at 6.
We agree with the district court. It was Yefsky's burden to articulate specific ways in which he was prejudiced. Zafiro, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 938-39. To make the requisite strong showing of prejudice, a defendant must "present enough information ... to satisfy the court that the claim of prejudice is genuine." United States v. Tracy, 989 F.2d 1279, 1284 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting Baker v. United States, 401 F.2d 958, 977 (D.C.Cir.1968)). Speculative allegations of prejudice fall far short of the prejudice required to prove an abuse of discretion in denying a motion for severance. United States v. Porter, 764 F.2d 1, 13 (1st Cir.1985) (citations omitted). Yefsky did not provide the district court with a factual basis to determine if his claim of prejudice was genuine. On this record, the court did not err in denying the motion to sever counts.7
Yefsky also contends that he was prejudiced by being tried with Coogan. Specifically, Yefsky argues that the weight of the evidence against Coogan, coupled with the lack of specific instructions at the close of trial limiting that evidence to Coogan, prevented him from presenting adequately his defense that he was merely a pawn in Coogan's scheme.
This argument first ignores the fact that Yefsky was charged with Coogan in a conspiracy and in a separate mail fraud scheme. Evidence against Coogan thus was admissible against Yefsky.8 Sabatino, 943 F.2d at 96; see Wormick, 709 F.2d at 461 (applying conspiracy doctrines to multi-member mail fraud schemes). A separate trial, therefore, would not have availed Yefsky.
Second, the argument overlooks the fact that mere antagonism of defenses does not require severance. Zafiro, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 938; Arruda, 715 F.2d at 679 (citations omitted). Instead, the tension between defenses must be so great that a jury would have to believe one defendant at the expense of the other. Arruda, 715 F.2d at 679. Yefsky has not met this standard. Although Yefsky proclaimed his innocence by blaming Coogan, Coogan merely denied the occurrence of any fraud. Yefsky cannot credibly complain that a jury believing Coogan's defense therefore would find Yefsky guilty.
The district court, in fact, took appropriate steps to minimize any spillover prejudice Yefsky might suffer. It routinely issued instructions limiting the evidence to the appropriate counts and defendants. Juries are presumed to follow such instructions. Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 211, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 1709, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987). It also instructed the jury to give separate consideration to an individual defendant's guilt on each count. These instructions were sufficient to cure incidental prejudice from evidentiary spillover. See Zafiro, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 939.
Rule 14 leaves the determination of the risk of prejudice and any necessary remedy to the court's discretion. The district court weighed the risk to Yefsky and acted suitably to protect him. Because Yefsky has not shown any manifest prejudice, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion to sever.
V.
Yefsky next argues that the district court erred in excluding defense evidence offered at trial and that the errors prevented him from presenting his defense. We review each piece of evidence in turn.
A. Maxine Yefsky
Maxine Yefsky acted as bookkeeper for her husband's and son's firms. She testified that she had no accounting training and had problems filing correct Forms 1099 with the IRS. The district court barred her from testifying about a conversation she had had with Coogan in January 1981 about these forms. Ms. Yefsky would have testified that Coogan had told her not to file the forms for him because his office would. The court excluded Coogan's statement as hearsay.
Yefsky contends that the court erred in excluding Coogan's statement as hearsay. Yefsky urges that the evidence was not hearsay because he sought to introduce it only to demonstrate his wife's reliance on the statement and his own lack of intent to help Coogan evade taxes. See United States v. Hicks, 848 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1988) (evidence not offered for its truth is not hearsay). The government agrees on appeal that the testimony wrongly was excluded.
We must consider, however, whether the error harmed Yefsky. Lubanski v. Coleco Indus., Inc., 929 F.2d 42, 47 (1st Cir.1991). Our inquiry depends on the centrality of the evidence excluded and the prejudicial effect of the exclusion. Id. at 46 (citations omitted). Yefsky argues that the error was highly prejudicial because it effectively prevented him from presenting a defense to the tax fraud conspiracy. His defense was that he had no knowledge of and no intent to assist Coogan's wrongdoing but was merely a pawn.
Our review of the record convinces us that the error was harmless. This evidence was relevant only to the tax fraud objective of the conspiracy count. As we have found sufficient evidence of Yefsky's participation in the engineering fraud objective, see Section II supra, the erroneous exclusion of Ms. Yefsky's testimony did not affect Yefsky's conviction on Count 1.9
Two Motorola employees called by Coogan testified about their involvement with the BAPERN project. Both testified that they had made sales proposals to prospective customers and had had conversations with their supervisors regarding GBPC pricing procedures and policies. One employee also testified that he knew of equipment prices quoted by Coogan. The court prohibited as hearsay testimony about the substance of the witnesses' conversations with their supervisors and their customers, which would have revealed Motorola's awareness of Coogan's pricing practice.
At trial, Yefsky attempted to use this testimony to show that Motorola had offered BAPERN prices to non-GBPC members. On appeal, Yefsky argues instead that the testimony was admissible to demonstrate his lack of knowledge that Coogan was inflating prices. The government again concedes that the disputed testimony would not be hearsay if offered for the purpose Yefsky now advances. But because Yefsky raises this issue for the first time on appeal, we review the exclusion for plain error. United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 15, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1046, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985). Yefsky can prevail only if the error was so egregious that he suffered a miscarriage of justice. Id.
Yefsky does not meet this standard. Although the employees did not testify about the actual price discrepancies, they did state that they did not discuss the discrepancies with the GBPC chairman. Yefsky thus was able to argue that Motorola tolerated the inflated prices. Yefsky also called a third Motorola employee who testified that Yefsky had consulted Motorola before making three price proposals and that those prices matched Motorola's. Yefsky thus could argue that he did not assist Coogan to inflate equipment prices, or at least acted in good faith when he quoted prices, and that Motorola did not inform him of Coogan's overcharging. Under these circumstances, Yefsky had adequate fuel for his defense and did not suffer from the exclusion of the testimony in question.
Yefsky also claims that the district court erroneously excluded the depositions of two police chiefs, which also would have shown Motorola's knowledge of Coogan's pricing practice. Deposition testimony is admissible, however, only when the witness is unavailable. Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1). One of the witnesses actually testified at trial for the government and, so, clearly was available. Yefsky has offered no evidence that the other witness was unavailable. No error, therefore, occurred.
C. Harvard Radio Tower Project
A Harvard official testified about Harvard's entry to the BAPERN system. Yefsky then tried to elicit evidence of work he subsequently performed on the Harvard radio tower. The district court excluded the evidence as irrelevant. Yefsky argues that the testimony was admissible as evidence of his good faith as a general business practice.
A district court enjoys broad discretion regarding the admissibility of evidence on relevancy grounds. Conway v. Electro Switch Corp., 825 F.2d 593, 597 (1st Cir.1987). We will reverse a court's decision only upon a showing of manifest abuse of discretion. Id. (citations omitted).
Yefsky does not make such a showing. At trial and on appeal, Yefsky concedes that his work on the Harvard radio tower project was not connected to any GBPC or BAPERN contract. Nor was it temporally related to BAPERN, for the project came two years after he completed work on Harvard's entry to BAPERN. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit testimony so tenuously connected to the issues at hand.10
VI.
Finally, we turn briefly to the issues remaining in Yefsky's appeal.
A. Double Jeopardy
Yefsky also raises the severance of counts issue as a problem of double jeopardy. He claims that evidence of the engineering conspiracy impermissibly was used to convict him of the equipment mail fraud and therefore caused him to be tried twice for the engineering conspiracy. This claim is mistaken. Yefsky properly could be charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and with the underlying substantive mail fraud. Boylan, 898 F.2d at 245. Such an indictment would not have exposed Yefsky to double jeopardy because the government would have had to prove different facts for each charge. See Serino, 835 F.2d at 930. In an indictment for both conspiracy and mail fraud, the first requires proof of an agreement and an intent to involve the mails, and the second requires proof that the mails were used. Dray, 901 F.2d at 1137; United States v. Camiel, 689 F.2d 31, 36 (3d Cir.1982). The problem Yefsky raises is that the jury may have been unable to compartmentalize the evidence properly. See Section IV supra.
B. Jury Charge
Yefsky also contends that the district court erred in not charging the jury that specific intent to commit the object offenses was an essential element of the conspiracy. The court instructed the jury that "[w]hat is necessary is that the defendant must have knowingly and willfully participated in some way in the unlawful plan with the intent to further the unlawful purpose of the conspiracy." Tr. Vol. 82 at 20. We review the jury charge as a whole to determine whether this instruction was erroneous. Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U.S. 141, 146-47, 94 S.Ct. 396, 400-01, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973).
Although the insertion of "specific" before "intent" may be preferable, we find the jury charge sufficient. We upheld a similar instruction in United States v. Porter, 764 F.2d 1, 16-17 (1st Cir.1985), which stated, "you would have to find that the person knew that a conspiracy existed and voluntarily entered into it with the intent of achieving the illegal object of the agreement". Here, the court defined the terms "knowingly" and "willfully" for the jury before giving the disputed instruction. In particular, it defined "willfully" to mean "voluntarily and purposefully with the specific intent to do something the law forbids." Tr. Vol. 82 at 15. The court thus clearly instructed the jury that it had to find that Yefsky joined the conspiracy with the specific intent to accomplish the unlawful purpose of the conspiracy, namely tax and mail fraud. Because the instruction adequately covered specific intent, Yefsky is not entitled to any relief. United States v. McGill, 953 F.2d 10, 12-13 (1st Cir.1992); United States v. Nivica, 887 F.2d 1110, 1124 (1st Cir.1989).
Affirmed.
CES and ITS had taken deductions for their payments to Coogan. But they were never indicted for tax fraud in connection with the kickback scheme. Although the two companies were audited by the IRS, they were not required to pay additional taxes for the years in question
The mail fraud statute, ... takes or receives [from the Postal Service] any such matter or thing, or knowingly causes to be delivered by mail according to the direction thereon ... shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.
The original indictment charged the engineering fraud in Count 5 as a conspiracy separate from the tax fraud conspiracy. When the district court ordered that the two be consolidated, the allegations of the engineering fraud were incorporated virtually verbatim into Count 1. Thus, Yefsky's motion to dismiss Count 5 applies on appeal to Count 1 of the superseding indictment. We refer to the original Count 5 as the "engineering conspiracy" or the "engineering fraud" to avoid confusion with the tax fraud prong of the conspiracy now charged
Yefsky, of course, could have been charged with both conspiracy to commit the engineering fraud and with the substantive mail fraud without risking double jeopardy. See infra Section VI.
We do not address the question of severing Counts 2-4. Because Coogan was the only defendant charged with tax fraud and he has not appealed, these offenses will not be re-tried and cannot affect Yefsky on a remand
On appeal, Yefsky suggests for the first time that he was prejudiced by the jury's inability to differentiate between the engineering conspiracy and the equipment scheme. He bases his argument on the fact that the four substantive counts of which he was convicted involved projects for which he personally performed engineering work. Because this argument was not presented to the district court, even though Yefsky raised the issue of severance again in his post-judgment motion for a new trial, we do not consider it on appeal. Tracy, 989 F.2d at 1284 n. 2 (citing United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990))
Toward the close of trial, the district court determined that a preponderance of the evidence demonstrated the existence of a conspiracy, each defendant's membership in it at the time that certain declarations were made, and that these declarations were made in furtherance of the conspiracy. It therefore allowed the issue of conspiracy to go to the jury. See United States v. Petrozziello, 548 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir.1977). The court later charged the jury that it could consider each co-conspirator's acts and statements in determining a defendant's participation in the conspiracy. Yefsky did not challenge this instruction
Moreover, on cross-examination, Yefsky testified that his wife had informed him of her conversation with Coogan. He also testified that, in not filing the tax forms, she had relied on Coogan's assurance that he would. His trial counsel used this testimony in closing argument to support Yefsky's defense. Yefsky himself thus cured the error, and he cannot complain now of prejudicePolice find 30 live snakes in Moline house
Narcotics investigators say they found 30 live snakes when they executed a search warrant at a home in Moline, Illinois.
Quad City Metropolitan Enforcement Group investigators executed the warrant in the 2000 block of 18th Street B at about 2 p.m. Tuesday, May 14, 2013.
“During the course of the search warrant, approximately 30 live snakes were found inside the residence in violation of Moline city ordinance,” said a statement from Lt. John Hitchcock of the Moline Police Department’s Investigation Division.
Hitchcock said animal control officers would handle the animals and the ordinance violation.
There was no information released on what type of snakes were found.
No injuries were reported.Fear is a liar. Running from fear gives power to lies.
We needn't run. All we need do is believe in our dreams, and the lie is defeated. We are Americans. Our dreams are our destiny.
When we believe something - firm and clear - we live as though our beliefs were common reality. And of course - they soon become so.
This process is not as simple as many believe - because "the liar" is ever-present.
The past two weeks, our nation has been over-exposed to the political agendas (or lack, therein) of those who wish to be our national leaders.
Our trickle-down economy has failed; our financial institutions have turned against us and our Capitalism has matured to mediocre meanness.
During awful times it is often comforting to be lied to - to blame the stranger, the immigrant, the African American, the women, the irresponsible young, the lazy, the poor.
But blame leads to fear - and fear is a liar. Living with lies makes us shallow people.
Once again, I choose hope. I choose the dreams of my generation; the people stuffed into overcrowded elementary schools in the 1950's - crammed into Sunday Schools and Hebrew Lessons and Catechism throughout our childhood - called to action by an unjust war, racism and the horrific pain of our emotionally unavailable WWII dads and their lonely wives.
I choose the hope we carved out of the conformity of an industrial age. I choose our poets, our actors and our scientist - who opened the universe to our imagination and our energy. I choose the future my generation has always chosen; laced with joy and pride - messages of courage and the challenge of being a real human being.
Don't be afraid. If fear were the truth, we'd know it by now.
You know what's right. You know what's true. Go. Live in the sunshine.
Be like a Baby Boomer.

Totem Pole in Sitka National Historical Park - © Patrick Endres 4 1.800.557.4852 • sitka.org • scvb@sitka.org Sitka is a place where stories of the past come to life, and history is tucked into every corner. The Tlingit settled in the area thousands of years ago, living off of the land and the sea. They established and named the town Sheet’ka, which was later Anglicized to Sitka. Russians ﬁrst arrived in 1799 in search of sea otter pelts for the lucrative fur trade. After several ﬁerce, back-and-forth battles with the Tlingit, the Russians ﬁnally established a colony in 1804. This fortiﬁed settlement was named “New Archangel” and served as the capital of Russian America and the center of their worldwide fur trade. New Archangel became the most populated city on the West Coast, and was nicknamed the ‘Paris of the Paciﬁc’ due to its culture of high society. Castle Hill was the site of the ceremonial transfer of Alaska from Russia to the United States on October 18th 1867, and it still shows the remnants of Russian rule. Sitka commemorates the transfer each year with a week-long Alaska Day Festival that culminates on October 18th with a parade and reenactment Alaska Day Festival - © James Poulson ceremony. Besides being the birthplace of the Alaska Territory, Sitka also served as its capital for nearly 40 years. Those who desire to immerse themselves in both famous and lesser-known stories of Sitka will be delighted with the Sitka Historical Museum, where the Tlingit, Russian, and American eras spring to life through exhibits and artifacts. With such a diverse history, it’s no wonder that Sitka boasts 22 sites on the National Register of Historic Places.

Within just a half-mile walk you’ll ﬁnd a Tlingit community house, rare Russian architecture, and a Lutheran church founded in 1840 by Finnish immigrants which was the ﬁrst Protestant church on the Paciﬁc coast. Massive totemic panels stand watch outside the Sheet’ka Kwaán Naa Kahídi, a theater built in the style of a community clan house. Inside, the stage backdrop is fashioned from giant cedar panels that are adorned with hand-carved totemic designs and painted in traditional colors. A central ﬁre pit and tiered seating creates an unforgettable setting for the Naa Kahídi Dancers, who offer stirring performances of ancient songs and dances of the Tlingit people. Explore the state’s largest collection of Alaska Native artifacts at the Sheldon Jackson Museum where native artisans demonstrate age-old crafts while visitors gaze upon more than 5,000 pieces contained in the collection. Step back in time with a visit to the Russian Bishop’s House, one of the only remaining examples of Russian log architecture in the Western Hemisphere. Located downtown, the building was completed in 1842 and served as the seat of the Russian Orthodox Diocese which spanned from California to Kamchatka New Archangel Dancers - © William Greer in the Russian far east. Today, the historic site looks much like it did at its commencement and is adorned with period furniture and Russian icons. Nearby, the prominent onion-shaped domes of St. Michael’s Cathedral mark the Sitka skyline as they have for nearly two centuries. Those who venture inside the active Russian Orthodox church will discover a remarkable collection of religious art, with pieces believed to date back to the 17th century. Energetic new life is breathed into Sitka’s Russian history by the New Archangel Dancers.

At R-Squared — The Risk & Reward Conference, learn to take smart risks
to move libraries forward..
Colorado Lieutenant Governor Joseph Garcia Welcomes R-Squared Attendees
Colorado Lieutenant Governor Joseph Garcia welcomes R-Squared Conference attendees to Colorado in a letter support.
"Libraries are a vital service in our country, and I applaud you for taking the risk to participate in a conference that will make libraries even more essential and impactful." – Colorado Lieutenant Governor Joseph Garcia
The countdown begins...
We are just 27 days out from R-Squared – The Risk & Reward Conference. Risk-takers coast to coast are traveling to Telluride this September to learn new ideas and connect with other creative library professionals. See all of the states that are represented on our risk-takers map and add your own location.
To ensure we have all of your correct info when R-Squared kicks off on Sept. 9, please login to fill out your profile and confirm name, meal preference and location are included. When you save your location info, it’s automatically added to our risk-takers map. Add a photo if you choose and your smiling face will appear on the attendees page.
Transportation
For those traveling from the Front Range or flying into DIA, the shuttle leaves Denver Public Library on Sept. 9 at 8 AM. Parking at the Cultural Center is $8 per day as opposed to the $20+ per day to park at the hotels in Mountain Village, so this is a great alternative. The cost for the shuttle is $80 round trip. It departs from Mountain Village on Wednesday, Sept. 12 at 8 AM. Guaranteed this will be a good time trekking through Colorado while getting a head start connecting with other risk-takers. Reservation deadline for the shuttle is Aug. 26, so please make your reservations soon!

A space that inspires
What makes a place, a space irresistible?
When you walk into a brilliant public space, you notice a remarkable feeling of belonging and a sense of invigoration and inspiration. You can’t wait to explore and engage. How can you make that happen in your world?
The Creative Spaces Experience is part Architecture 101, part workshop on making spaces and place making. Led by architects Dennis Humphries and Ozi Friedrich of Humphries Poli Architects, day one is for exploring concepts of space so you can design spaces that inspire and enliven people.
With the help of Cynthia Nikitin from the Project for Public Spaces, day two is centered on public place making - learning to evaluate successful public spaces. Are they accessible? Do people engage in activities there? Is the space comfortable with a good image? Is it a sociable place where people meet each other and want to take people when they come to visit?
Guaranteed, at the end of the conference, you’ll have the nuts and bolts to create a space that works, whether it is your office, your apartment, your library or...

Traveled to the Himalayas in Tibet with 6 cameras this summer, seeking enlightenment and great lomography. But the pictures I love most are not the ones I took but the ones I gave.
Went to Burning Man festival last year. Besides the costumes, the desert arts, the pyrotechnics and the crazy parties, one thing I love pass through the Tibet every year, each clicking away with their expensive cameras.
To us, children and nomads of the highest plain represent golden photo opportunities, the last drops of innocence on earth. Americans pay USD$30,000 to go on photography tours here. But the Tibetans? Globalization has brought Hershey’s Kisses chocolates to the shelves of expensive supermarkets in Lhasa, but on the vast plains of the Tibetan plateau, life at 5000m above sea level depends on yak dung. Most Tibetans are battling Chinese occupation, poverty, harsh elements and global warming. Many of these poor people have never had a camera, let alone owning photos of themselves or their loved ones.
So there I was, after 55 hours on the Qingzang railway plus 3 days on a Jeep, high up in the Himalayas by the glacier, waving my Qing Hua Diana F+ and the Instant Back+ around, giving out Polaroids.
Knowing that some African tribes hate cameras stealing their souls, I initially had some reservations as to whether Tibetan would warm up to the idea. But in no time, kids gathered around me, adults pushing to the front, point, I had trouble getting back into the Jeep and closing the door without snapping off some dirty little fingers. That was how I got my first bout of high-altitude sickness. That was how I forgot to take my own picture with the Himalayas and had to stop and retake it.
That afternoon, when I saw a father happily tucked away his son’s picture inside his robes and a mother chased me down eagerly put her 1yo. This picture below is the only record I have, but I have many LomoWalls scattered halfway up Mount Everest. That warm feeling? Yeah, it will stay with me for a very long time.
Next time you travel, think about taking as well as giving pictures.
+ Qing Hua edition is specially designed by designer-illustrator Dorothy Tang. The camera’s vintage Chinese appeal perfectly matches the Diana F+ trademark soft-focus and dreamy qualities. See it with the rest of the Diana Clones here!

Big Joe Henry’s 17th Annual Christmas Eve Spectacular
By Amanda Brodhagen, Farms.com
The swearing-in ceremony of Ontario’s new cabinet meant some new changes to the Ontario Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs portfolio. Premier Kathleen Wynne took on Minister of Agriculture while taking away the Rural Affairs portion - handing it over to Jeff Leal. In an exclusive interview with Farms.com, Ontario PC Agriculture Critic Ernie Hardeman shares his reaction to the change to the agriculture portfolio. “I think it’s a big mistake, obviously there is a direct connection between agriculture and rural affairs...that’s why it is one ministry,” says Hardeman. In the heat of the election campaign Wynne pledged on Dec. 6 2012 that she “will serve as the Ontario’s Minister of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs for at least one year,” published in a release on her campaign website. Hardeman says “the premier didn’t promise that she was going to split the ministry, what she did promise was that she would be Ontario Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.” Hardeman went on to say that “she [Kathleen Wynne] only did half of what she said that she was going to do.”The Dec. 6 pledge also went on to say that she would appoint herself to the role for at least one year in order to demonstrate her personal commitment to rural Ontario. Hardeman says that Wynne didn’t hear the concerns of people from rural Ontario “there is no definitive line between agriculture and rural affairs,” said Hardeman. As opposition critic, Hardeman plans on putting on the pressure to ensure that rural issues like the horse racing industry, the process of implementing windmills on farms - along with paying attention to the importance of providing rural services in communities such as hospitals and schools will be heard in the legislature.The UK's fastest-growing regional news network

Kent Highways has admitted there is a problem with parking around a school – but have failed to come up with a solution.
Kent County Council has put forward £1.5 million proposals to build four new classrooms at Queenborough primary in Edward Road.
The proposed development includes a new hall link corridor, additional toilets and teaching assistants’ room and the playground will also be altered and increased to compensate for the new buildings. But it does not include any plans for parking.
Queenborough school is set to expand despite parking problems
The classrooms will replace mobile buildings and temporarily increase the number of new pupils from 60 to 90 for September this year.
This is so a deficit of primary places on the Island can be covered until the new school opens at Thistle Hill in September 2015.
In April we reported how people who live nearby are concerned about the expansion as parking is already horrendous, with cars being left half on pavements and blocking driveways and they fear an increase in cars will make it even worse.
In the planning committee’s report, which suggests the development would attract an extra nine vehicle trips each morning and afternoon, Kent Highways says it does not raise any objection.
They say they don’t think this will have a significant impact given the level of traffic already associated with the site.
The report says: “The roads immediately next to the school are already at saturation point for parking and the current demand has spread beyond these roads to include parts of Main Road and the [Sheppey Hall] car park.
“There is certainly more capacity around these locations to absorb more parking demand without having much of a noticeable impact, particularly in Borough Road, considering only nine additional vehicles are forecast.”
And Swale’s planning officers described the parking arrangements as ‘clearly unsatisfactory’ but said they don’t think it would make the existing situation any worse.
Swale’s planning officers have recommended councillors back the plans – and the county council will make the final decision.
Pat Mumford, who lives in Edward Road, said residents had petitioned a few years ago to get wasteland at the bottom of the street made into a car park.
She said: “It’s such a waste that land down there doing nothing.”
“Kent Highways is accepting there’s a problem but is not willing to do anything about it.
“It’s definitely going to get worse.
“Last week [half-term] was lovely because we could take the car out whenever we liked and didn’t have to plan.”
Town councillor and former mayor of Queenborough Sue Simpsoncorr said she agreed the school needs the expansion.
She said: “Speaking personally and as a resident, we have had a lot of problems down there.
“It’s a nightmare and I don’t know what the solution is but I think any extra cars along there will make it worse.
“There are too many cars and it’s reaching saturation point.
“I don’t think they should be running out of mobile buildings and improvement to any school is good.
“But I think something has to be done about the cars before a child is.<<

If you’re going to contest a will one of the first questions you have to ask yourself is "am I too late?"
If the will you want to contest has already been admitted to probate and your client’s been served with a "notice of administration," F.S. 733.212 says you’ve only got 3 months to object. But the
mechanics of objecting to a will involve two basic steps: [1] filing your objections with the court and [2] serving "formal" notice of your objections on the opposing party.
In the linked-to opinion the will contestant (the decedent’s wife) filed her objections within the 3-month limitations period, but didn’t get around to serving formal notice of her objection on the other side until about 4 months later. So was she too late? According to the probate judge the answer was yes, so Wife’s objections were dismissed with prejudice. Wrong answer says the 2d DCA. Here’s why:
The Wife contends that the statute, section 733.212(3), Florida Statutes (2006), requires only the “filing” of objections within three months and that her failure to serve her motion by formal notice within the three-month deadline is not fatal to her claim. She further contends that even if service by formal notice were required within the three-month period, the Daughters waived the requirement by engaging in protracted litigation before raising their objection to the service. The Daughters respond that section 733.212 is implemented by Florida Probate Rules 5.025, 5.040, and 5.041(d), which require that an objection be served with formal notice by the three-month deadline.
Section 733.212(3) provides:.
(Emphasis added.)
The Wife’s motion was an adversary proceeding as defined in rule 5.025(a), and therefore she was required to serve formal notice pursuant to rule 5.025(d)(1). Rule 5.040 sets out the requirements for serving formal notice. It provides in subsection (a)(3)(A) that formal notice shall be served “by sending a copy by any commercial delivery service requiring a signed receipt or by any form of mail requiring a signed receipt.” Rule 5.041(d) governs filing and provides that “[a]ll original papers shall be filed either before service or immediately thereafter.”
None of these rules contain a time requirement for serving formal notice. Further, the trial court’s conclusion that section 733.212(3) requires service of formal notice within three months is erroneous because the statute requires only the “filing” of objections within three months after the notice of administration is served. It does not require both filing and service of formal notice within the three-month period. It is undisputed that the Wife’s motion was timely filed. We therefore reverse the order dismissing the Wife’s motion and direct that it be reinstated.Respite facility work tipped to start soon
The Shire of Northam says works to expand the town's Killara respite facility should begin in the next few weeks.
A builder has been chosen to construct the $3 million extension at the short-stay accommodation centre, which will include 16 new beds.
The works will be funded through the Royalties for Regions program.
Shire president Steve Pollard says he was surprised at how many companies tendered for the contract.
He says the works will take about 40 weeks to complete.
"I believe they're a Perth-based company. It's a wonderful facility and I'm looking very forward to getting these beds up and operating because the demand for the beds should be quite high," he said.
"I think the contracts need to be signed up and after that it's going to be a 40-week build process, so I guess any time over the next couple weeks there'll be some site works and preliminary works done."> SEE ALL MERCK MANUALS
Housing for potbellied pigs may be provided outdoors, indoors, or both.
A large pen equipped with a structure—such as a large dog house—to provide a sleeping, feeding, and watering area makes a suitable outdoor home. You should allow at least 50 square feet per pig. Pigs will instinctively eat and sleep in one area and defecate and urinate in another. Daily removal of feces and the addition of fresh dirt to cover and absorb urine are required for both the good health of the potbellied pig and the control of odor. Hay or straw may be added to partly satisfy the pig's need to root. Fresh dirt should be added weekly or more often if needed. Fencing should be well secured in the ground to prevent it from being “rooted up.” Fencing should also be removable, as the entire pen should be relocated periodically to prevent the buildup of wastes in the soil and to provide “new ground” for rooting. The old pen dirt should be smoothed out so that it is even with the surrounding soil surface and left unused for several months. If pens are maintained on solid surfaces (such as concrete pads), feces and urine should be removed daily, and fresh hay or straw provided 3 to 4 times per week. Water dispensers must be secured to prevent spilling or damage to the dispenser by chewing.
Potbellied pigs are territorial. If they are to be kept indoors, they need a defined space (such as a portion of a laundry room) with a sleeping and eating area in one corner and an elimination area in another. A large litter box with one side cut down to accommodate easy entry and exit often works well. Be sure the litter used is nontoxic; dry dirt or pine shavings are appropriate choices. Potbellied pigs are not only curious, they tend to chew on everything. Providing a blanket to burrow under or a box of dirt to satisfy the need to root will go a long way toward protecting your home furnishings.
Fresh water should be available at all times to prevent dehydration and salt toxicity. Balanced diets are essential to maintain health and prevent obesity. Starter, grower, and maintenance rations for potbellied pigs are available in many larger pet stores as crumbles or pellets. Provide the recommended amount per body weight and age divided into 2 or more meals per day. Meals should be presented at about the same time every day. Green leafy vegetables, alfalfa, and green grasses (but not weeds, because some are toxic) can be added to the ration to satisfy appetite. Fruits such as apples and grapes can be given in limited amounts. A regular source of citric acid, such as commercial products or oranges, is recommended to reduce the possibility of bladder infections and urolithiasis (the formation of kidney stones), which are common urinary problems in these animals. Many common house and garden plants are toxic to potbellied pigs, which like to root and are adventurous eaters (see Poisoning: Introduction to Poisoning). To avoid potential danger, do not allow your pig to have access to such plants.
Potbellied pigs gain excess weight easily and have a very difficult time slimming down because, once obese, exercise options are limited. Overweight pigs are likely to become lame and develop health problems such as diabetes.
The best way to help keep your pig healthy is to provide a nutritionally sound diet that discourages obesity. Do not offer high calorie treats or table scraps to your pig. Instead, offer limited amounts of healthy treats such as apples, grapes, and other fruits. Do not forget to consider the impact of treats when planning your pig's overall diet.
A daily routine that includes exercise and engaging activities is important for the mental and physical health of your potbellied pig. Regular exercise is necessary to maintain good health and prevent obesity. A play time that does not include treats may help reduce boredom and discourage eating foreign objects, chewing on furniture, and other destructive or dangerous behaviors.
Potbellied pigs enjoy rooting in blankets or in a special towel box supplied just for play. A favorite toy can be hidden in blankets or towels as part of a rooting game. A dirt box can also supply needed play for your pig; the dirt should be changed regularly and the box thoroughly cleaned before new dirt is supplied.
These pigs may also be trained to walk on a leash. Daily walks and play are important in reducing boredom and avoiding undesirable behaviors. Like meals and other events, walks and exercise periods should occur at about the same time each day.
Potbellied pigs are intelligent, curious animals, and they can be affectionate toward their owners. Boredom may result in destructive chewing or rooting or in aggression. The stimuli provided by regular exercise and access to an outside environment appear to have both health and temperament benefits.
These animals have a strong sense of place and rank in their herd or family. At approximately 2 years of age, many healthy potbellied pigs will develop a more aggressive personality and challenge other potbellied pigs and humans for the position of “top hog.” Small children and even adults can be in danger from an aggressive 100-pound pig. It is at this stage that many potbellied pigs are either abandoned or placed in animal shelters.
Male potbellied pigs should not be kept as pets unless they are neutered. Neutering at an early age (2 to 3 months) is recommended to avoid development of an aggressive personality. A male pig that is rescued or adopted from a shelter should be neutered as soon as possible. Early spaying may also improve the temperament of female pigs.

London 2010: Introduction from stml on Vimeo.
Fans of Patrick Keiller's 1994 film London may be interested in James Bridle's London 2010 project, where he is painstakingly refilming each scene in present day London.
London takes place over the course of a year, you never see the characters and it's shot in static frames. So if you were going to refilm a film it's more manageable than most (still quite an undertaking though). I could watch it over and over again and often wondered where some of the locations are and if they still exist. Now I'm happy. Every shot is collected in a London 2010 Flickr set. To complete the project can anyone help to identify any of these unidentified locations?
Just realised this is the first post of the new year - happy 2010 everyone.
I was thinking about writing some more end of year round-ups, or some new year resolution-type things but changed my mind. Instead here's something that tickled me - Deadly Pretty Things is Bristol skateboarder Jason Hills, who repaints those familiar insipid China figurines as Day of the Dead figures. A great improvement, I'd say.Popular Christian music acts to perform at Magic Springs

"I love performing in Arkansas," Chapman says. "Great, great folks there, including one of my favorite people, Dan Fife [of Conway, who works in communications and marketing]. Dan's a great man from that area who's been key to our ministry in recent years and helps us put on quite a few concerts each year. It's always great to hug his neck."
Chapman visited the state twice last fall, performing before packed houses in Bentonville and Little Rock on a tour promoting his latest album, The Glorious Unfolding. The coast-to-coast tour began in May with a Canadian run, with sporadic dates this summer. By the fall, he says, he and his band will have played 90 dates. "We've just completed The Glorious Unfolding music video," most of it filmed in Europe, he says.
"We do plan to do a 'JOY' Christmas tour this December," Chapman says. "My good buddy Brandon Heath [a contemporary Christian musician from Nashville] will join me and I'm hoping we can get your way for that. And we just announced I'll be playing with my band and a full symphony as well as a 250-plus-voice choir at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., in June [2015]."
Chapman began his career in the late 1980s as a contemporary Christian singer-songwriter. Since then, he has released more than 20 albums, eight of them certified as gold or platinum. He has been recognized with five Grammy Awards and 58 Gospel Music Association Dove Awards, seven of the latter for "Artist of the Year."
Of his songs, 44 have become No. 1 radio hits, and he has sold more than 10 million albums.
West is based in Nashville, where he works as a contemporary Christian musician and actor. He headlines Friday night's show with the Rhett Walker Band, a Southern Christian rock band also from Nashville, as the opening act.
Having released five studio albums to date, West is best known for his songs "More," "You Are Everything" and "The Motions." He won the 2013 American Music Award for Best Contemporary Inspirational Artist and was nominated for five Dove Awards in 2005.
West's second single, "Hello, My Name Is," from his album Into the Light, held the No. 1 position on the Billboard Christian Songs chart for 17 consecutive weeks.

I receive National Right to Life's daily e-mail update called Today's News & Views. Today's edition is a reprint of an article from the March 2006 printed NRLC newsletter (written by the President of the NRLC) because the daily editor is out on vacation. I thought it was a blog-worthy overview of the life issue, enjoy!

Constitutionally, the legal underpinnings of supposedly constitutional "abortion rights" are at least as weak now as they were in 1973. The pro-abortion majority on the Supreme Court is, of course, aware of the fatal constitutional flaw underlying Roe and its successors. Bereft of a constitutional basis for their ruling, the pro-abortion majority in Casey was again forced to engage in "an exercise of raw judicial power," just as it originally had done in Roe. Desperately (and pitifully) trying to command respect, the pro-abortion plurality in Casey wrote, "the Court's interpretation of the Constitution calls the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution." Since the pro-abortion pressure groups had already gotten from the Court what they wanted in 1973, this arrogant statement could only mean that the pro-abortion majority on the Court wanted pro-lifers to shut up and go away.
[Article continued below the fold...]
Many proponents of the right to abortion are aware of the problematic state of so-called abortion rights in this country. Especially in the last ten years, the country has become more pro-life; the brutality of abortion is more evident than ever; the stranglehold of radical pro-abortionists on the national Democratic Party has seriously weakened that party; the young are increasingly pro-life; and the Court's constitutional "interpretation" and "mandate" on the abortion issues are collapsing.
The personnel changes on the Supreme Court and the potential for more such changes have exacerbated the anxieties of pro-abortionists about the future of abortion rights. (Of course, there is still a majority for abortion rights on the Court--we only know that Justices Scalia and Thomas are sure opponents of Roe--but the "Roe is dead" hysteria makes for good fund raising.) In any event, many pro-abortionists either perceive a "crisis" or are already preparing to fight pro-lifers in the state legislatures in case Roe and its successors should be overturned.
A small group of pro-abortion legal scholars wants to find an adequate constitutional basis for abortion rights. Their problem is that there is "nothing in the language or history of the Constitution to support" an abortion right (Justice White dissenting in Roe). And, like Justice Blackmun, they don't know how to get around the humanity of the aborted child. The Constitution and science are not on their side.
Other pro-abortionists, concerned about the damage done to the national Democratic Party and to the image of progressives in general, are ready to abandon Roe and its successors and fight it out with pro-lifers in the state legislatures. They admit that Roe is constitutionally unfixable, that it has seriously damaged "liberalism," and that it has poisoned the political life of the nation. They are a small group of "progressive" opinion makers and intellectuals--but they do not represent the radical pro-abortion pressure groups.
In the real and manufactured versions of "the crisis" about Roe, the radical pro-abortion pressure groups--NARAL, NOW, Planned Parenthood, the extreme left wing of the Democratic Party, etc.--have resorted to what they know best when challenged on the merits of their case. They lie. And they will lie even more if the fight over abortion goes to the state legislatures. Be prepared for an onslaught of distortion and disinformation and "pro-choice" dishonesty.
They hope that the public has forgotten the embarrassment the pro-abortionists suffered when they repeatedly were caught lying during the campaign to ban partial-birth abortions. So you must remind the public.
They are already recycling some of their big lies of the 60s and 70s. Recall this passage from Bernard Nathanson's Aborting America (1979 â€“ p.193): "In N.A.R.A.L. we generally emphasized the drama of the individual case, not the mass statistics, but when we spoke of the latter it was always '5,000 to 10,000 deaths a year' [before abortion was legalized]. I confess that I knew that the figures were totally false, and I suppose the others did too if they stopped to think about it. But in the 'morality' of our revolution, it was a useful figure, widely accepted, so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics?" Once again, the pro-abortionists are coming up with wild figures about how many women would die if Roe were overturned. They count on public amnesia about their lies in the 60s and 70s.
We are also hearing again Bill Clinton's clever, but dishonest, phrase that abortion should be "safe, legal, and rare." Aside from the fact that Bill Clinton's actual policies were to keep abortion legal and as accessible as possible (remember Hillary Clinton's health care plan), the phrase is fundamentally dishonest because what was once criminal will become anything but rare when you legalize it.
Start preparing now to unmask the pro-abortionists' dishonesty.

Metro claims Reds boss Brendan Rodgers is preparing to submit an official £9million offer for the player amidst interest from a number of European clubs.
AC Milan, Atletico Madrid and AS Monaco are all reportedly chasing the Egyptian international, whilst the Red Devils have also been credited with an interest in the past.
It’s Liverpool who appear set to come to the table however, as Rodgers looks to add to his title-challenging squad.
The Reds have shocked many so far this season, and the Anfield outfit are only six points off top spot in the Premier League.
Adding some depth to the squad could be crucial if Liverpool are to sustain their push at the top of the table, and Salah would add some additional quality on the flanks.
His arrival could also see Raheem Sterling leave Merseyside on loan, according to the paper.
Manchester United were plotting a move for Salah - as well as Basle teammate Fabian Schar - back in December, according to reports.
However, manager David Moyes appears set to miss out once again, with the Scot struggling to make his mark in either the transfer window or on the pitch for the Red Devils at Old Trafford.
After missing out on a number of top targets in the summer, the Manchester United boss has struggled to follow in the footsteps of Sir Alex Ferguson this season, and some January signings could reignite the club's chances of a top four finish.
Moyes may have to move quickly if he wants to beat Liverpool to Salah though.

Get the 1500 ESPN SportsWire delivered to your inbox daily, and keep up with all the news in Twin Cities Sports
The Minnesota Vikings haven't ruled out signing a veteran starting quarterback, and rumors about the likes of Donovan McNabb are bound to swirl unless and until they do.
But if the Vikings have time to get their top draft pick ready -- a big if, given the tenuous nature of the NFL's labor situation -- Frazier made clear on Sunday he hopes Christian Ponder will start as a rookie from Week 1.
"Ideally, I'd like for him to be ready to go when we play San Diego (on Sept. 11)," Frazier said in an appearance on 1500 ESPN Twin Cities.
."
In other words, Frazier likes Ponder's chances for starting immediately -- but not if a lockout erases the Vikings' offseason program and perhaps training camp and the preseason, too, leaving insufficient time to evaluate the rookie's readiness.
"It would be tough to be able to send him out there against San Diego if we don't start football, if we don't report until, say, mid-August, or three weeks prior to the season," Frazier said. ."
The only other quarterbacks on the roster are Joe Webb and Rhett Bomar, who are considered developmental prospects, with Webb best-suited to handle a multipositional role at this stage of his career.
New offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave has said he'd like to add a veteran quarterback to "balance" the position. And the Vikings reportedly have shown interest in McNabb, 34, who was benched down the stretch last season in Washington and probably will get released once the lockout ends.
But the likelihood of that union -- or signing another veteran free agent such as Matt Hasselbeck or Marc Bulger -- took a hit when the Vikings drafted Ponder out of Florida State with the 12th overall pick in the NFL Draft on Thursday night.
Ponder's intelligence is highly regarded within scouting circles. And he has a head start on learning the Vikings' new offense, thanks to a session with new coordinator Bill Musgrave and quarterbacks coach Craig Johnson while the NFL was open for business on Friday.
Shortly after Ponder arrived at Vikings headquarters on Friday morning, Frazier put him on the phone with receiver Percy Harvin, whom Ponder hopes to use as an intermediary to connect with his new teammates and perhaps even organize workouts in Florida if the lockout drags on.
How long it drags on seems to be the main question surrounding Ponder's short-term role, since the last thing the Vikings want to do is put their new franchise quarterback in a position to fail. If the answer is "too long," the Vikings would be left with Webb, Bomar or a stopgap veteran willing to serve as strictly a placeholder until the rookie is ready.
"It helps to a degree that he has some information in (Ponder's) hand," Frazier said. "He has some things that he can look at and go through -- even the fact that he may be able to get together with Percy and some of the other players if this offseason continues the way it is, gives us an opportunity maybe to gain an advantage, hopefully. So, we'll see what happens, but the uncertainty just creates a lot of doubt about certain things."
No concern
After the draft ended on Saturday, Frazier said the Vikings felt comfortable after their due diligence on Iowa defensive lineman Christian Ballard, who fell to them in the fourth round after reportedly testing positive marijuana at the NFL scouting combine.
"One of the things about all of our draft picks, our security staff, our scouts have done a great job along with our coaches of delving into every player's background and really having a great feel for what guys would fit our football team and what guys would not fit our football team," Frazier said.
"When we select a player, we are confident that we selected a guy that will fit what we want to do and really be a part of our situation and our team in a positive way. I feel good about all the guys we selected from a character standpoint."
Vice president of player personnel Rick Spielman said the Vikings had a second-round grade on Ballard, whose versatility was viewed as an asset. He'll work initially as a three-technique undertackle -- Kevin Williams' position -- but also played end for the Hawkeyes and could factor at multiple positions in a backup role.
"He gives us some flexibility because of what he's able to do, the fact that we can play in the three-technique or play nose, but he could also slide outside as a defensive end," Frazier said. "He's one of those rare commodities when you talk about big men. He moves extremely well and that flexibility should really help our defense."
Building depth
Another target Frazier had entering the draft: building depth along the offensive line.
They selected two -- Arkansas tackle DeMarcus Love and Slippery Rock center Brandon Fusco -- in the sixth round, making the first time in nine years the Vikings have taken more than one offensive lineman in the same draft.
"It was very important to me," Frazier said. "That was one of our goals going into this. We had a number of picks in order to get it accomplished. Fortunately, we were able to draft a couple of guys who we think will really help us from a depth standpoint and eventually push our starters to improve or eventually be starters."
Quick hits
• The draft's early run on quarterbacks began at No. 8, when the Tennessee Titans selected Jake Locker. Was Frazier surprised? "It's kind of hard to predict," Frazier said. "But you know once that cycle begins, it's going to go fast and that's what was happening at the quarterback position. So, I'm not completely surprised that Jake went where he did. For the same reasons Tennessee took him were similar probably to the reasons we took Christian when we did. You just don't know, and you don't have that many opportunities -- at least we hope we don't -- where we're going to be drafting 12 in the draft, and so you've got to decide. Are you going to do it now? Or are you try to do it free agency? And we all know the uncertainty of free agency this year."
• Spielman said Vikings officials planned to meet on Saturday night to set their college free agency board, then meet with coaches on Sunday to discuss their plans -- whenever those plans need to be put in motion. And then? "I'm going to try and play golf this week if I can," Spielman said, smiling.Re: origin of Pinneo in America
- In reply to: origin of Pinneo in AmericaWanda Riecks 10/22/99
I hope that this will help:
Jacques Pineau, whose name was soon transformed into Pinneo, came to Bristol about the year 1700,in company with Jean Soulard. Tradition relates that they fled from persecution in France, and landed in Plymouth,Massachusetts; and that being unable to pay their passage across the ocean,they were sold into servitude by the captain for a term of four years. Their conduct was so excellent, however,that they were released after a few months. About the year 1725, they removed from Bristol to Lebanon, Connecticut, where Pineau left descendants* Soulard became a resident of the same locality.
* James Pinneo had two sons and three daughters.James, the eldest son , born 1708, married Priscilla Newcomb, whos son, James was the father of the Reverend Bezaleel Pinneo, for fifty-three years pastor of the First Church in Milford, Connecticut, from 1796 till his death in September 1849.
The Pinneo family is an extensive one, and is represented chiefly in New England and the Middle States,and in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.

Hi, I've used these forums as a resource since being diagnosed and have decided to join myself. :) I usually can't handle super long posts, but I want to share my experiences so I'll give an abridged version first:I'm 21 from Miami, seroconverted in April, diagnosed in May, saw my first doctor in June, and began Stribild last week.And the long version:I am a 21 year old male from Miami. I was unfortunately exposed to crystal meth in high school and have had on and off issues with it, though never long term. Separately, I had struggled financially to afford an expensive art school in Chicago, and I'd been taking time off to save money to return. I finally returned this past January, and couldn't have been happier.In April, midway through the semester, I had taken some Adderall to get schoolwork done, but I must've taken a bit too much, because the craving for meth took over after nearly a year clean. I made some mistakes that weekend, and sure enough, two weeks later I came down with what I thought was nasty food poisoning, followed by gingivitis, followed by gastritis, followed by an esophageal ulcer. I got two IVs, lost 35 pounds, and failed all my classes over attendance.I returned to Miami in May, and got tested a week before my 21st at an Out of the Closet with my best friend as an annual tradition, when learned I was positive. A part of me had always suspected my irresponsibility would catch up, but I just could never have imagined how it would feel when it became real.It felt like this: made the decision to immediately tell my family, who have been extremely supportive and have come to all my initial appointments. Once I received my initial bloodwork results (237,000VL/ 430 CD4), I decided to be very open with my status, letting friends know when I saw them and making it clear that it was not a secret. My circle of friends, a mixed bag of straight and gay, male and female, didn't know anyone else our age who was positive, and didn't realize how real the risk was. Sick of the night sweats, I began taking Stribild just under a week ago. Got the nausea, got the runs, and I puked yesterday, but I can handle it.Over these past five months, two things in particular have surprised me:1) HIV has done more good for me than bad. I had already been iffy with drugs, and this was the slap in the face I needed to really cut them out of my life. Cigarettes are coming next. Maybe I'll even go to the gym. It's given me a sense of direction that I feel I had lost after I dropped out of school. I'm focusing on freelancing as a web developer, and I feel much more in control of my life. Sure, I have some days when I'll cry about it or feel weak, but the good days seem to be more frequent (so far).2) I feel more comfortable with my sexuality. I've been out since middle school, but have always been just a bit uneasy with certain aspects of my sexuality. I usually resist gay culture, I don't get the references, and I don't go to the bars. But lately I feel I've been less self-loathing... I follow some gay blogs now and caught up on Drag Race! I'm able to accept that enjoying certain aspects of gay culture doesn't define me as something separate from everyone else.I still feel a little lost, though, because I don't personally know anyone else with HIV. It would really make me feel better to have a friend going through, or who has gone through, what I currently am. I've thought about going to support groups, but I'll admit I'm a little nervous. I even messaged a guy on Grindr who was poz asking if he'd be willing to get lunch and talk (but no reply). For now, I'll start by posting here :)HI
Jeff G:
Hi Waisland , welcome to the forum . I'm struck by your good attitude and I know it will help you going forward . We have many people here who have had HIV longer than you have lived yet , so your going to be just fine in time . Welcome and I'm glad you found us , sorry you needed too .
WillyWump:
Welcome aboard Waisland, Sounds like you you've got a pretty good grasp on things, this will help you greatly as you navigate through the world of HIV. Keep your head up and chest out!I hope you finally settled in with the Stribild and aren't having any more probs.Good hearing your story and hope to see ya around ;)-WIll
EUINAU:
Hi Waisland, I was also recently infected and diagnosed and started meds straightaway. I too feel in some aspect things got better as I always struggled with will power of hitting the gym. Now it's an objective I take seriously and enjoying it.I did not tell anyone except for my partner and to be honest I do not feel the need to tell anyone, however mainly because I am almost twice your age and experienced bullying and stigma of being gay. I am not out at work, though out to my friends.I do not know anyone positive and this forum has been amazing in offering support and there is Poz Personals section I am sure there will be an opportunity for you to meet someone from your area and talk about stuff you'd like to share.I have joined the personals and have been chatting to couple of guys, it helps :)Just my two cents worth...
wolfter:
Welcome to the forums. That's a great mindset, one which many struggle with for years to come to grips with their infection. That was also a bold and courageous action you took regarding your status. I too tested positive at age 21 during college thanks to bad drunken behaviors on my 21st birthday. ;) But that was a LONG time ago.Again, welcome and looking forward to hearing more from you. PS, we have an annual get-together and this year we went to Chicago. Part of me is still recovering even after 3 weeks.Wolfie

Abstract
Objective:
Obesity is frequently associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Both conditions are proinflammatory and proposed to deteriorate cardiac function. We used a nested cohort study design to evaluate the long-term impact of bariatric surgery on OSA and how weight loss and OSA relate to inflammation and cardiac performance.
Design and Methods:
At 10-year follow-up in the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study, we identified 19 obese subjects (BMI 31.2 ± 5.3 kg m−2), who following bariatric surgery at SOS-baseline had displayed sustained weight losses (surgery group), and 20 obese controls (BMI 42.0 ± 6.2 kg m−2), who during the same time-period had maintained stable weight (control group). All study participants underwent overnight polysomnography examination, echocardiography and analysis of inflammatory markers.
Results:
The surgery group displayed a lower apnea hypopnea index (AHI) (19.9 ± 21.5 vs. 37.8 ± 27.7 n/h, P = 0.013), lower inflammatory activity (hsCRP 2.3 ± 3.0 vs. 7.2 ± 5.0 mg L−1, P < 0.001), reduced left ventricular mass (165 ± 22 vs. 207 ± 22 g, P < 0.001) and superior left ventricular diastolic function (E/A ratio 1.24 ± 1.10 vs. 1.05 ± 0.20, P = 0.006) as compared with weight stable obese controls. In multiple regression analyses including all subjects (n = 39) and controlling for BMI, the AHI remained independently associated with hsCRP (β = 0.09, P < 0.001), TNF-α (β = 0.03, P = 0.031), IL-6 (β = 0.01, P = 0.007), IL 10 (β = −0.06; P = 0.018), left ventricular mass (β = 0.64, P < 0.001), left atrial area (β = 0.08, P = 0.002), pulmonary artery pressure (β = 0.08, P = 0.011) and E/Ea ratio (β = 0.04, P = 0.021).
Conclusions:
Patients with sustained weight loss after bariatric surgery display less severe sleep apnea, reduced inflammatory activity, and enhanced cardiac function. Persisting sleep apnea appears to limit the beneficial effect of weight loss on inflammation and cardiac performance.
Introduction
Obesity is an important risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a syndrome characterized by the partial or complete recurrent collapse of the pharyngeal airway during sleep (1). The prevalence of OSA increases along with the degree of obesity (2, 3) and the two conditions share a common influence on inflammatory activity and cardiac function.
Accumulation of visceral adipose tissue generates a rich source of humoral mediators, including proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6. Obesity is also associated with increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), reflecting a state of low-grade inflammation (4). OSA, per se, has been linked to higher concentrations of TNF-α and IL- 6 (5) and circulating cytokine levels are reduced following treatment of the sleep disorder (6). Recently, Punjabi and Beamer (7) reported on an association between OSA and elevated levels of CRP independent of obesity markers.
Obesity is known to influence the structure and function of the heart, partly through the increased hemodynamic load that accompanies body fat accumulation. Sleep apnea may also contribute to left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, most likely via hypoxia-induced sympathetic activation and hypertension (8). Interestingly, pro-inflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction, presumably by direct induction of myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis and apoptosis (9).
It has been proposed that the cardiovascular risk associated with obesity is amplified by OSA (10, 11) and that low-grade systemic inflammation may provide a common intermediary pathway between these conditions and the development of cardiac disorders. However, to what degree interactions between obesity, OSA and inflammation are involved in the pathogenic process of cardiovascular disease in these patients has not yet been resolved.
Short-term weight loss provides a benefit with respect to obesity-related OSA (12, 13), inflammation (14) and cardiac dysfunction (15). However, to what extent OSA is improved long-term following surgical obesity intervention is still largely unresolved (16, 17). This is of importance since persistent sleep apnea may have a negative impact on the outcomes of bariatric surgery. The aim of the current study was to investigate the long-term effects of surgically induced weight loss on sleep disordered breathing and to evaluate how the presence of sleep apnea relates to circulating inflammatory markers and cardiac performance.
Methods
The SOS study is a prospective, controlled, surgical interventional trial, which enrolled 4,047 obese subjects at 25 surgical departments and 480 primary health care centers in Sweden. The study protocol is described in detail elsewhere (18, 19). Briefly, the surgery group comprised 2,010 eligible subjects desiring surgery and, at the same time, a matched control group of 2,037 obese subjects. Inclusion criteria were age ranging from 37 to 60 years and BMI of ≥ 34 for men and of ≥38 or more for women. The exclusion criteria, aiming to obtain operable patients, were the same for both study groups. At SOS-baseline information about sleep apnea was collected through self-administered questionnaires, using questions that have been validated against polysomnography and applied in previous sleep-surveys in Sweden (20, 21). Patients were asked if a family member had observed frequent pauses in breathing during sleep (yes/no). Patients were also asked to rank on a five-point scale the presence of load and disrupting snoring and daytime sleepiness (never, rarely, sometimes, often, and very often). Subjects reporting “often” or “very often” were considered to be frequent snorers or to have frequent daytime sleepiness.
Present study population
Patients enrolled in the present smaller substudy were recruited amongst participants of the SOS study who were subjected to 10-year follow-up at our local study center at Sahlgrenska hospital during 2007. To be included in the study, surgery patients were to display a weight loss >15% compared with SOS-baseline and obese control patients a weight change of <5%. In all, we recruited 39 subjects, including 19 surgery patients and 20 obese controls. The study group comprised 26 women and 13 men in the age range 52-71 years. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee at the University of Gothenburg (Approval number: S 341 01), and all study subjects gave their informed consent to participate.
Clinical measurements and inflammatory markers
Weight and height were determined to the nearest 0.5 kg and 0.5 cm, respectively. Blood pressure was measured in the supine position after 10-min rest and the mean of two recordings was registered. Blood samples were obtained in the morning after a 12-h fast and inflammatory cytokines, including high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) were quantified using an ultra-sensitive bead-based assay (Human TH1/TH2 10-Plex Ultra-Sensitive kit; MSD, Gaithersburg, MD).
Overnight polysomnography
Polysomnography at 10-year follow-up included the following signals: two leads of EEG (C4A1; C3A2), two leads of EOG, and a submental EMG continuously registered by surface electrodes. A one-channel ECG was continuously registered. Leg movements were detected by an anterior tibialis electromyogram. Airflow was monitored by combined oronasal thermistors and a nasal pressure canula, abdominal and chest wall movements by inductive plethysmography, and arterial oxygen saturation was measured by finger pulse oximetry. All recordings were stored in a computerized polysomnography system (Embla A10, Flaga, Reykjavik). Sleep stages were manually scored by a trained sleep technician using the Rechtschaffen and Kales criteria (22) and the ASDA criteria (23) for event and arousal scoring. An apnea/hypopnea event was scored if there was a clear decrease (≥50%) in the amplitude of a valid measure of airflow (either by thermistors or nasal canula pressure transducer) during sleep (for hypopnea a ≥3% oxygen desaturation or an associated arousal was required) or the combination of a ≥30% reduction in airflow (compared to pre-event baseline) with at least a 4% reduction of oxygen saturation. A minimum event duration of 10 s is required. The total number of apnea and hypopnea episodes per hour was divided by total sleep time to calculate the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI), which was used as the primary study parameter. The number of dips SaO2 ≥4% per hour of sleep (oxygen saturation index—ODI) was also determined.
In a statistical subanalysis, patients were categorized according to whether their AHI was above or below 20, which was close to the median AHI value for the total study population, and allowed for statistical comparison between subsets. Thus, for each study group, two subsets were generated reflecting a high (AHI > 20) versus low (AHI < 20) intensity of sleep apnea. For convenience, subjects with AHI > 20 are designated in the text as having “high levels of OSA activity” and those with AHI < 20 as having “low levels OSA activity.” In a recent study by Gooneratne et al. (24), an AHI above 20 was associated with a higher mortality hazard ratio. Further, this cut-off level has been applied in studies examining how sleep disordered breathing relates to congestive heart failure (25) and outcomes after cardiac resynchronization therapy (25, 26).
Echocardiography
Echocardiography at 10-year follow-up was performed using commercially available standard equipment. Data was acquired with the subject in the left lateral decubitus position at end-expiration. All measurements were averages deriving from three consecutive cardiac cycles. All recordings were made by experienced physicians and analyzed by a single observer blinded to study subject classification using customized dedicated research software (Echopac, GE Vingmed Sound, Horten, Norway). The left ventricular mass was determined using the truncated ellipsoid model according to Byrd et al. (27). Planimetry of the left atrium was performed from a late systolic stop frame with the maximum atrial area. LV ejection fraction was calculated according to the Simpson's rule (28). Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was obtained by calculating the pressure gradient between the right ventricle and atrium from the peak velocity of tricuspid regurgitant flow and adding the estimated value of right atrial pressure. Measurements of early flow velocity (E) and peak velocity during atrial systole (A) were obtained and the ratio E/A was calculated. Myocardial tissue Doppler imaging was performed from the apical four-chamber view. Early (Ea) diastolic tissue velocities were recorded at the septal corner of the mitral annulus and the ratio of early diastolic mitral flow velocity to early diastolic tissue velocity (E/Ea) was subsequently calculated.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS for Windows version 15 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Descriptive data are summarized as the mean (standard deviation) or proportions (%). Comparisons between groups and between subsets within groups were made by unpaired t tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical data. After pooling data from the two study groups, multiple regression analyses were used to examine how apnea/hypopnea index and BMI were related to inflammatory markers and echocardiography measures of cardiac structure and function. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Clinical characteristics and sleep-questionnaire data for the surgery and control groups at SOS-baseline are shown in Table 1. At this time-point, before intervention, the two study groups were comparable with respect to gender, age, BMI, blood pressure, and comorbidities. Furthermore, the two groups reported similar rates of witnessed sleep apnea, loud and disruptive snoring and daytime sleepiness indicating a comparable prevalence of OSA at SOS-baseline.
Clinical characteristics, polysomnography findings, inflammatory markers, and echocardiography results from the 10-year cross-sectional examination are shown in Table 2. The surgery group displayed a weight loss of 27.2 kg (P < 0.001), while the obese group showed no significant weight change, which was in accordance with the inclusion criteria. Also, the surgery group had lower blood pressure, but there were no significant differences between groups with respect to antihypertensive treatment, diabetes and smoking. Patients treated with bariatric surgery showed substantially lower AHI and ODI as compared with the control group. Also, nearly two thirds of surgery patients had sleep disordered breathing that was only minimal (AHI < 5) or mild (AHI 5-15), whereas 60% of control subjects were found to have OSA that was severe (AHI > 30) (Figure 1). The surgery group had lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines hsCRP, TNF-α, and IL-6, and higher concentrations of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Surgically induced long-term weight loss was also associated with lower left ventricular mass, atrial area, pulmonary artery pressure and E/Ea ratio, and higher E/A ratio. However, left ventricular ejection fraction did not differ between study groups.

Findings following stratification of patients into subsets with and without clinically significant sleep apnea (AHI >20 and <20) are shown in Table 3 and Figures 2 and 3. Clinical variables were similar between subsets within study groups, apart from BMI, which was somewhat higher in strata with AHI > 20 as compared to those with AHI < 20, but this was not statistically significant (Table 3). On the other hand, proinflammatory markers hsCRP, TNF-alpha and IL-6 were, or tended to be, significantly lower and anti-inflammatory cytokine Il-10 higher in patient subsets with low levels of sleep apnea (Figure 2). Also, left ventricular mass, left atrial size, pulmonary artery pressure and E/Ea ratio were, or tended to be, significantly lower in patient strata with low OSA activity (Figure 3). In particular, sleep apnea influenced hsCRP, IL-6, left ventricular mass and left atrial size.

Multiple regression analysis displaying the importance of sleep apnea activity and BMI for inflammatory markers and echocardiography measures are shown in Table 4. After including all patients and adjusting for the influence of BMI, AHI was independently and positively related to indices of inflammation, left ventricular mass, diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary artery pressure.
Discussion
The present study has demonstrated that long-term weight loss following bariatric surgery is associated with a considerably lower degree of sleep apnea. Further, lower weight and less OSA activity were linked to lower inflammatory activity and better left ventricular function. Notably, residual OSA appeared to limit the potential effects of obesity surgery on inflammation and cardiac function.
Our findings are at large in accordance with those of a recent large meta- analysis (17) suggesting a substantial reduction of AHI in obese patients following bariatric surgery. However, in the present study, the prevalence of residual sleep apnea (mean AHI of more than 15 events per hour) following surgery was found to be lower than that reported in the meta-analysis, 37% as compared to 63%. A sleep apnea event intensity of 15 per hour or more may contribute to adverse medical sequelae, such as hypertension, heart disease, stroke and difficulty with weight control (29).
Albeit our study group was small, the findings still support a long-term beneficiary effect of bariatric surgery with respect to sleep disordered breathing in obese patients. In addition, our results add to previous data (30, 31) that weight loss-related alleviation of inflammation and cardiac dysfunction may, to some extent, relate to a concomitant reduction of sleep apnea.
Obesity, OSA, and inflammation
Adipose tissue and visceral fat depots in particular, produce a variety of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α and IL- 6. IL-6 is also known to stimulate the hepatic production of CRP (4, 32), contributing further to the state of low-grade inflammation that characterizes obesity. Obstructive sleep apnea has also been proposed to be linked to systemic inflammation, but the nature of this relationship is confounded by the frequent coexistence of visceral adiposity (33).
In the present study AHI was positively related to various inflammatory markers independently of BMI, thus supporting a separate contribution of sleep apnea to systemic inflammation in obesity. This is in line with earlier studies (34, 35), which have demonstrated elevation of inflammatory cytokines in OSA, independent of the degree of obesity. A more recent study (7) has also shown a direct dose-response relationship between OSA and circulating levels of CRP, which was independent of age, BMI, and per cent of body fat. However, studies addressing CRP in OSA have provided inconsistent results which may relate to differences in study population, comorbid conditions and degree of OSA related hypoxia (36, 37).
The lower degree of systemic inflammation in patients with long-term weight loss observed in our study may, at least in part, have resulted from a concomitant reduction in OSA. This would further support a pathogenic role of OSA with respect to systemic inflammation in obesity.
Obesity, OSA, and cardiac function
Obesity is frequently associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, and diastolic dysfunction (8, 38). In the present study, AHI was correlated with a higher left ventricular mass, higher pulmonary artery pressure and signs of impaired diastolic function, including larger atrial size and higher E/Ea ratio, and these relationships were independent of the degree of obesity. Hence, our results are in accordance with previous studies suggesting that OSA contributes to obesity-related left ventricular hypertrophy (8, 39) and the findings of Otto et al (38) and Arias et al. (40), who reported a greater degree of diastolic dysfunction in obese patients with OSA as compared to those without.
Treatment of obesity with ensuing long-term weight loss was associated with lower left ventricular mass, lower pulmonary artery pressure and enhanced diastolic function. Also, for both study groups, the subsets with low levels of sleep apnea displayed a more favorable echocardiographic profile. Thus, OSA that prevails despite previous obesity intervention might preclude the beneficial effects of weight loss on cardiac structure and function. One contributing mechanism may be a sustained activation of the sympathetic nervous system activity due to apnea-related hypoxemia that results in both systemic and pulmonary vasoconstriction and thereby augmentation of blood pressure and ventricular afterload. Also, OSA-related inflammatory activity that persists despite weight loss might act to maintain adverse myocardial remodeling. Proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-6, have been proposed to impair cardiac function through mechanisms of myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and apoptosis (9), although the pathophysiological significance of low-grade inflammation in this context remains unclear.
Strengths and limitations
The major merit and novelty of this study is the long-term follow-up data provided at 10 years after surgical intervention for obesity. Detailed classification of sleep, cardiac function and metabolic/inflammatory status using gold standard methods is provided. Both sleep and echocardiography data were analyzed by single interpreters to avoid inter-rater variability.
The study also has limitations, which may restrict the interpretability of the results. First, polysomnography, echocardiography, and inflammatory data had not been obtained at baseline and we could therefore not perform a direct comparison of treatment effects between the surgical and control groups. Second, the study was not randomized and subjects differed with respect to surgical motivation, which could indicate other and unforeseen differences between groups. Still, given a similar anthropometric profile and a comparable response to a validated sleep-questionnaire, it is highly likely that the two groups had similar levels of sleep apnea, diastolic dysfunction and inflammatory activity at baseline. Third, modifiable risk factors such as smoking, sedentary life style, caffeine and alcohol consumption, which all may have affected the inflammatory markers or cardiac function, could not be controlled for during the 10-year follow-up period and were not systematically addressed. Finally, the small number of subjects limits the statistical power in our study. However, the conclusion of our study is based on a recurrent pattern suggesting that OSA influences the degree of inflammatory activation and cardiac dysfunction in patients with different degrees of obesity. Our data therefore clearly suggests that the influence of sleep apnea should be considered in prospective outcome studies of bariatric surgery in obese patients.
Conclusion
We report that long-term weight loss by bariatric surgery is associated with lower levels of OSA, reduced systemic inflammation and enhanced cardiac function. Our data suggests that persistent sleep apnea, in spite of weight loss, may limits the improvement of cardiac function and reduction of inflammatory activity. Assessment of persistent sleep apnea is likely to be warranted also after successful treatment of obesity.

Aug 13, 2010 – The LiberalOasis Radio Show: Immigrant Unicorn EditionThe gay Burundian asylum seeker Alvin Gahimbaze has won his eleven.
Homosexuality was made illegal in Burundi in 2009. A 2009 Human rights Watch report ‘Forbidden: Gays and Lesbians in Burundi’ details the repression there. A UK Foreign Office expert spoken to off the record confirmed that it is unsafe for gay people.
Although his sister is now a permanent resident, Alvin’s application for asylum was refused as he was not believed to be gay. Several removal attempts were made.
Alvin can now return to his studies at Bristol University, where he had started a law degree at the University of West England. He had built a new life with his sister Danella over the past 11 years in Bristol.
Following a referral by LGBT Asylum News, Alvin’s case was taken up by the Green Party in Bristol. They found new lawyers at Turpin Millars.
The Green Party MEP’s Jean Lambert and Keith Taylor wrote letters to the UK Border Agency as did the Labour MEP Michael Cashman and the Bristol Conservative MP Charlotte Leslie. The Italian Everyone Group have also supported the campaign for Alvin.
SW Greens LGBT spokesperson Ryan Cleminson said “We had to get involved as we couldn’t sit back and allow Alvin to be deported back to Burundi, where he would have faced almost certain torture and or death at the hands of the repressive government."
The threat of removal led Alvin to develop serious depression as the childhood trauma from witnessing massacres was still very present. He said of being removed:
“It would be like handing myself to the people that killed my family and that scares me.”
Following his bail from detention, followed by his receipt of Leave to Remain, Alvin wrote the following letter:
I am writing this small letter in order to thank you the LGBT Greens (part of the Green Party) especially to Mr Ryan Cleminson and many others who intervened in securing my release from detention and most importantly to have the right to stay in this Country.
I believe strongly that the LGBT Greens provided me with so much help because I do not think I would have done it on my own. Spending time in and out of detention for the past three years had left me in a distress and anxiety state after all of these years. It is an awful experience to go through because not only you are worried what’s going to happen to you but also you are always kept in the dark by the UK Border Agency.
In addition to the above, I am writing this letter to express my relief and satisfaction that finally, after years of struggle and dealing with the UK Border Agency, I was released on July 26th 2011 and also was informed that I will be given “Leave to remain” in United Kingdom as a “Refugee”. I am certain that this was possible through the help I received from the LGBT Greens along other Human Rights Organisations that were involved in my case.
It had been a very difficult time for me being in detention for a whole year and just not knowing what was going to happen to me. Thankfully, the UK Border Agency saw sense and ceased my Deportation back to Burundi where I have no family or any connection left other than being my country of Birth.
This experience has profoundly affected me in such way that I feel that I will offer my time in defending Human rights for asylum seekers whenever I am able to and quite rightly speak for them because I believe that those who are seeking sanctuary are not always respected by Immigration Government Department around the World including the UK Border Agency.
I couldn’t finish this letter without thanking all those people and Organisations who have helped me in this fight against my Deportation. I couldn’t have done it without their help, support, and advice and I sincerely hope they know how much I am grateful to them immensely.
Thank you again to everyone who believed in me and was there for me during this difficult time in my life.: "motorcycling" Deals :: Eureka Springs - - Two wheels = great deals Eureka Springs Best Western Eureka Inn Two wheels = great deals in Eureka Springs Price: $77 - $140 Expiration Date: 12/12/2015 Phone: 479-253-9551 Toll-free: 800-221-3344 Website: Showing 1 - 3 of 3 Page: Previous 1 Next View: 20 per page 50 per page 100 per pageWith a close win over Yorktown the week before under their belts, the Beavers sought to continue hitting their stride as they traveled to Woodsboro to face the Eagles in the opening week of District 16-A Division II action.
The Beavers did just that as they used their trademark style of gameplay to shut out the Eagles 43-0.
Falls City head coach Mark Kirchhoff was unavailable for comment as of press time.
The first half saw the Beavers score a majority of their points.
With 10:29 to go in the 1st quarter, senior running back Tyler Wiatrek punched it in on a 3-yard run and also ran in the 2-point conversion for the Beavers’ early 8-0 edge.
Later in the quarter, with 2:21 left, junior running back Phillip Lyssy got into the end zone from one yard out, with senior Scott Lyssy kicking the PAT.
Lyssy would be a perfect 5 for 5 on PAT attempts for the game.
Just 58 seconds into the 2nd quarter, Wiatrek kept the wheels turning as he broke free on a 21-yard run for the score.
Wiatrek would punch it in again later in the quarter on a one yard run with 7:08 on the clock. The final score of the first half came with 1:42 to go as Lyssy broke free for a 21-yard score to give the Beavers a commanding 36-0 lead at halftime.
The second half’s lone score came with 6:06 left in the 4th quarter as senior Wiatrek scored his fourth and final touchdown of the game on a 16-yard run.
Statistically, it was a one-sided affair as the Beavers gained 410 yards of total offense, with 314 rushing and 96 passing.
The Beavers held the Eagles to just 59 rushing yards and gave up no passing yards.
Penalties were not abundant as Falls City was flagged twice for 15 total yards and Woodsboro was flagged four times for 40 yards.
This week, the Beavers will welcome the Pettus Eagles to town.
Kickoff in Falls City is set for Friday, September 30 at 7:30 PM.Novice Member

probably but its the game maker that has to provide all that mmorpg require
its like RED CLIFF great game but since the server are in malesia i guess they forget their game is global and that has game provider its their job to advertise the game world wide or at least provide the info mmorpg need
true on the aaa title mmorpg will communicate with the game dev and ask the minimum they need but when a game is global it is very hard for mmorpg to track all game and make them avail on the website.sometime guys like us find those game and do one post but on a site as popular as this the tread get lost in the 100 of daily post fairly quick .
best bet is to suggest it to game maker to supply the info mmorpg need .
Well, im pretty sure they know enough about it.

The Mayor’s 2013/14 budget includes funding for the Met Police, Transport for London, the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA) which maintains the London Fire Brigade and the Olympic Park Legacy Company.
Mr Johnson said his budget “will cut council tax while making significant strides in growing our economy, fighting crime and improving transport.”
The Mayor added: “Next year the Government will carry out its spending review and I will continue to champion the capital to ensure we get the funding necessary to support the economy and quality of life in this great city.”
One of the Mayor’s funding sources is a levy on the council tax paid by London’s households which is collected on its behalf by the capital’s 33 local authorities.
The levy is one of the Mayor’s few direct funding sources and the sums raised can be used to deliver the Mayor’s policies and secure key London services.
Both the Fire Brigade and Met are facing cuts to their budgets with both services considering closing stations to balance their finances. In addition LFEPA has drawn up proposals to cut the number of fire engines while the Met has announced plans to sell Scotland Yard to plug a £200m funding black hole.
Stephen Knight, a Liberal Democrat member of the London Assembly, said the council tax cut showed the Mayor “has the flexibility to lift the threat of fire station closures in London but sadly he has so far failed to do so.”
Mr Knight added: “Instead of such meaningless gimmicks, the Mayor should focus his energies on keeping London’s fire and police stations open and keeping transport fares down.”
Labour Assembly Member John Biggs described the cut – equivalent to 7p per week – as an “insult“ to Londoners which would be dwarfed by the Mayor’s latest fares increase.
Mr Biggs commented: “Wages for the majority of workers are barely rising. It is scandalous that Boris has not used his power to curb fare rises, but at the same time is claiming credit for saving households 7 pence a week.”
The budget will be subject to consultation until January 23rd after which it will be considered for approval by the full London Assembly.
Helen says
Could you emphasise that it’s an average cut of £3.72 *per annum*? I’ll save £2.75 per annum whilst the cost of a monthly bus bus pass increases by £3.10.
Andrew Bowden says
What a lovely guy Boris is. That 7p will make a huge difference to my life.Jenkins, 44, rallies, sighs after 6th title

The hero, Nick, is an ex-cop and convicted diamond thief — who escapes from prison only to check into a midtown hotel, order himself a nice dinner and then climb out the window, threatening to jump.
Pretty soon a crowd forms. Then a nice (and, of course, beautiful) NYPD negotiator shows up to try to talk him down — or rather, in. He won’t budge. But eventually he will tell her, and us, what he’s up to.
And it’s pretty ridiculous.
I don’t want to give anything away — although seriously, you couldn’t give this story away in a box of Cracker Jack. Still, skip the next paragraph if you’re planning to see it and are completely spoiler-averse.
Okay? Okay. So anyway, it turns out our cop’s threatened suicide is just a diversion, giving two people the chance to prove him innocent — by breaking into a high-security vault, “Mission: Impossible”-style, and showing that the gem Nick is supposed to have stolen was never stolen at all.
Okay, mild spoilers over.
The movie, however, is pretty badly spoiled from the start. As Nick, Sam Worthington — that big slab of grass-fed Australian beef, who everyone keeps saying is going to be big — is merely bland. As the negotiator, Elizabeth Banks is irredeemably perky.
Far worse is Jamie Bell as Worthington’s kid brother, who fidgets like a small furtive mammal, and telenovela star Genesis Rodriguez as the kid brother’s girlfriend, a Latina spitfire stereotype almost as crushingly restrictive as her purple Wonderbra.
And these are the leads, folks.
As in a lot of movies these days, though, the supporting actors are the real draw. Ed Burns, who is beginning to look like Brian Williams’ more-fun brother, is fine as Banks’ friend; as Nick’s old partner, Anthony Mackie is, as always, as cool and sharp as an icicle.
There are also a couple of great who’s-that-guy? faces in the cast too, including the dog-tired William Sadler as a bellboy and the blisteringly authentic Titus Welliver as an officer who is about one frayed nerve away from putting these young cops through a wall.
But without going back into spoiler territory, suffice it to say that the plot is … well, the plot is just ridiculous, from hissable villains (including a pushy TV reporter straight out of “Scream”) to some impossible trickery. And although the stunt work is great, the direction is strictly point-and-shoot, without any real sense of height or space.
Actually, this is one of the few movies that, with its skyscraper action scenes, probably needed to be made in 3-D. As it is, though, it’s barely in 2-D — and really, I’m not sure it needed to be made at all.
Ratings note: The film contains strong language and violence.

TWO STARSDorothy de Rothschild, 93, Supporter of Israel
Published: December 13, 1988
Dorothy de Rothschild, a philanthropist, died Saturday at her home in London after a brief illness. She was 93 years old.
Mrs. de Rothschild and her husband, James A. de Rothschild, were longtime supporters of Israel, active in pressing the British Government for what became known as the Balfour Declaration, the 1917 commitment to work toward a Jewish homeland in British-administered Palestine.
When Mr. de Rothschild died in 1957, he bequeathed to Israel the money for a new building for the national Parliament, which Mrs. de Rothschild dedicated in 1966. Toward the end of her life she gave Israel a new Supreme Court building.
Born Dorothy Pinto in London, she married Mr. de Rothschild in 1912.
After her husband's death, their home at Waddesdon Manor, a 6,000-acre estate in Buckinghamshire, was left to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, along with a considerable art collection. Mrs. de Rothschild continued to be associated with the manor, working for its improvement and upkeep.
In recent years she divided her time between her home in London and Eythrope, her country estate near Waddesdon Manor.

Before my marriage I heard very little about politics at home or abroad, and I knew very little about China except what I read in my history and geography books. But I married into a family that had close ties with China. Many of the Delanos had lived for years in China and all of those who knew China loved the Chinese people and had great admiration for the Chinese merchants.
I was introduced to Chinese art. I saw many things that had been made in China, and I heard the country talked about far more than ever before. Then in January, 1919, when I crossed the Atlantic with my husband, who was on his way to Europe to close up the Navy installations, I found on the ship two Chinese delegations. One was from the north and one from the south, and they were journeying to the Paris Peace Conference. For the first time I became conscious of the fact that civil war was going on in China. On board ship the representatives of these fighting areas seemed to get on perfectly well but at home they were at war. However, I supposed once they arrived in Paris they could cooperate because in a broad way the interests of China would be much the same.
That war never really came to an end. When the Japanese invaded China they probably welded together more closely for a time the innumerable factions that always exist there. But I think one never could have called China a nation. There were so many independent rulers, separated by slow communications and transportation.
It seemed for a time that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek would succeed in forming a coalition government and bring about a unified China, in which reforms of importance to the people could be accomplished. The needs were for sanitation services, improved agriculture, universal elementary education and honest government. I had known James Yen in the United States and knew that he hoped very much to be permitted to try out in one small province these four ideas.
When General Marshall was sent to China it was because the vast sums of money and the great aid in materials sent by us to Chiang did not seem to be bringing about any of these reforms for the people. And no coalition government was materializing. General Marshall was faced with a perplexing problem. If we gave Chiang military aid we would have to take charge not only of the actual maneuvers of the army, but we would have to bring about reforms in government—a government in which for centuries everything obtained was paid for through bribes to many officials. This seemed a hopeless proposition and one which might swallow up a great deal not only of American money but of men. It was obvious that the people of the United States were not prepared at that time to undertake any such commitments.
We shall continue this review tomorrow.May 22, 2015
A marijuana dealer is caught in the act selling drugs to undercover police -- but what's even more disturbing -- authorities say he had a small child inside his car at the time.
Gavino Acosta III is arrested after selling marijuana to undercover police officers. The undercover investigation has been ongoing since November 2011, where police met up with the suspect at a Shell Gas Station on the 2000 block of Texas Avenue; 3400 block of Campus Drive in Bryan [450 feet away from Bryan High School] as well as the 890 block of N. Harvey Mitchell Parkway.
Authorities say on November 15, 2011 Acosta pulled into the Hasting’s parking lot in Bryan to make a $50 marijuana deal with undercover police. Inside his maroon pick-up, police located a female passenger who had a small child in her lap as well as three male juveniles in the backseat.
This makes for Acosta’s 15th arrest.Holly Springs outlasts Person 69-67
Posted December 27, 2012
FINAL Holly Springs 69 Person 67: Holly Springs was able to stave off a furious comeback by Person and advance in the consolation bracket of the Summit Hospitality group with a 69-67 win. Person tied up the game at 54-all early in the 4th quarter, but a 13-5 run by the Hawks was too much for Person to overcome. Person had a chance for the tie when JaShawn King-Barnette was fouled shooting a 3 pointer with no time remaining. King-Barnette made the first free throw, but missed the next one, sealing the win for Holly Springs.
Holly Springs was led in scoring by Anthanee Doyle who finished with 17 points. He was joined in double figures by DeeJay Flippin and Craig McDaniel. UNC-Greensboro commit Tyrone Outlaw Jr finished the game with a tournament-high of 37 points. Sharpshooter Logan Coats finished with 20 points.
END 3Q Holly Springs 52 Person 48: Holly Springs is holding off Person 52-48 after 3 quarters. The 3rd quarter was a game of runs, which saw both teams go on spurts of 6-0 to keep the game nip and tuck heading to the 4th quarter. Tyrone Outlaw Jr continues to lead all scorers pouring in 9 more in the 3rd quarter to give him 26 points for the game. Deejay Flippin is leading Holly Springs with 12 points.
HALFTIME: Holly Springs 36 Person 33: Halfway through this game and we have a tight one going between Holly Springs and Person. Holly Springs found themselves with an 11 point lead early in the 2nd quarter at 29-18 but behind 17 points from Tyrone Outlaw Jr and 11 points from Logan Coats (3-4 from 3 pt range), the Rockets were able to go on a 15-7 run to close out the half.
Deojunique Flippin had 10 points for Holly Springs. Anthanee Doyle chipped in 8 points in the first half for the Hawks.
END 1Q Holly Springs 24 Person 18: Both teams have come out shooting at a very high percentage as Holly Springs clings to a small 6 point lead after 1. Holly Springs was led by Deojunique Flippin's 7 points while Person's "Mr Everything", Tyrone Outlaw Jr, had 9 points.
Pregame: We kick off Day 2 of the HighSchoolOT.com Holiday Invitational with a consolation bracket game of the Summit Hospitality bracket featuring Person High School and Holly Springs High School. The winner will move on in the consolation bracket and play at 11AM on Saturday Dec 29.
Person enters the game off a disappointing 73-50 loss to Broughton High School. After a tight 1st quarter, Broughton opened up a 36-24 lead at halftime and never looked back. Person shot a cold 8% from 3 point range in their first game. Person was led by UNC-Greensboro recruit Tyrone Outlaw Jr who scored 15 points.
Holly Springs finds itself in the loser's bracket after being on the short end of coin toss of all things. The Hawks were scheduled to play the St Joeseph Falcons in Day 1 of the Holiday Invitational but after the Falcons had issues getting here due to weather, the game was cancelled and the outcome was decided on a coin toss. Holly Springs is led by senior forward Deojunique Flippin who holds offers from Jacksonville, Mt Olive and Wingate and also by guard Anthanee Doyle who also holds an offer from Jacksonville.

Posted on : 12-03-2009 | By : Igor Stepura | In : OpenCV

I played with two ARM9-based single board computers (SBC) recently to investigate how OpenCV would operate on embedded platforms. The SBCs are – TS-7800 and SBC2440-III.
OpenCV uses floating point operations a lot, but not all of the ARM processors have FP coprocessor, so developers should use either some FP library, or as in my case – use Linux kernel FP emulation. There are two types of such emulation OABI and EABI. More details can be found here and here. Kernel release 2.6.16 was the first one to include ARM EABI support.
Unfortunately, CPUs of both SBCs do not support floating point in hardware, but luckily enough, TS-7800 has Debian Linux with 2.6.21 kernel. So I had a chance to compare OpenCV performance for OABI and EABI.
Both SBCs have necessary tool-chains in package – TS-7800 has Linux and Windows(Cygwin) tool-chains, SBC-2440 – only Linux one. In addition to these I downloaded newer release of Codesourcery ARM tool-chain for Windows, because the one from TS-7800 SW package didn’t work properly with Cygwin.
I wrote a pretty simple script to ease OpenCV (version 1.1pre1 from here) configuration for various toolchains. Here it is:
#!/bin/bash ##======== TS-7800 environment settings====== #### Linux host.

Just uncomment setting you need, and comment all the others and you’re all set.
-fsigned-char in
CXXFLAGS is a must. OpenCV will (somehow) work even without this flag, but some functionality will be broken – JPEG parser for example (to say the truth, it will still be broken event with
-fsigned-char, but at least it will correctly parse JPEG headers).
After script finished run
make and then
make install . Libraries and headers will be placed in directory, specified with
--prefix= parameter.
Now when OpenCV is built and ready it’s time to “feel the power in your ARMs”.
I used facedetect sample application (/samples/c/) to test OpenCV on SBCs. I had to remove UILib -related code and add ome more parameter to application, named
--extension, which allows specifying of input file type (BMP, YML, JPG). Changes I made to file can be observed here
The makefile I sued to build the application is written in a way similar to the previous configure script:
# TS-7800 environment settings #DEVROOT=/opt/crosstool/arm-none-linux-gnueabi #APP_PREFIX=arm-none-linux-gnueabi #SBC2440-III environment settings #DEVROOT=/usr/local/arm/3.4.1 #APP_PREFIX=arm-linux #CodeSourcery setup DEVROOT=/opt/crosstool/codesourcery APP_PREFIX=arm-none-linux-gnueabi CC = $(DEVROOT)/bin/$(APP_PREFIX)-g++ CPP = $(DEVROOT)/bin/$(APP_PREFIX)-cpp LD=$(DEVROOT)/bin/$(APP_PREFIX)-ld CXXFLAGS = -I"$(DEVROOT)/$(APP_PREFIX)/include" -I"$(DEVROOT)/$(APP_PREFIX)/include/opencv" CXXFLAGS+= -fsigned-char LDFLAGS = -static -L"$(DEVROOT)/$(APP_PREFIX)/lib" -lcv -lhighgui -lcxcore -lml -lcvaux -lpthread -ldl all: facedetect.o $(CC) facedetect.o $(LDFLAGS) -o facedetect facedetect.o: $(CC) $(CXXFLAGS) -c facedetect.c clean: rm -f facedetect facedetect.o
Copy and paste this text to a file, say makefile_facedetect, and then use it:
make -f makefile_facedetect. It will build statically linked executable – I didn’t want to bother with shared OpenCV libraries.
The file used to detect face was lena.jpg (512×512) from OpenCV samples/c/ directory. I also converted it to BMP and YML, since JPEG parser does not work properly on ARM.
Execution results
TS-7800
EABI build: detection time = 31 512.1ms
SBC-2440-III
OABI build: detection time = 448 151 ms
Conclusions:
1) EABI is MUCH better than OABI
2) Even with EABI FP support, there is still much needed to be improved in OpenCV to make it usable on ARM processors.News

The inspirational leader of the Jo’burg team admitted that although the situation was not ideal, he is determined to give it his all in Witbank.
“We’ve done well to win the last seven games, but I think that we can look back at those early losses as something that cost us dearly,” he told keo.co.za. “But, yes, it isn’t the best place to be: relying on another team to win so that you can go through to the semis.
“It may seem strange that I am hoping for a win against the Bulls, as I am heading up there next season. But until this year’s competition reaches an end, I’m a Lions man 100 percent.”
The Cheetahs win is meaningless unless the Lions pick up five points against the Pumas. With the wooden spoonists having lost every game in the tournament thus far, conventional wisdom suggests this should be a formality. Van Heerden confirmed that the Lions will take no chances.
“The Pumas are an unpredictable team. They are dangerous in broken play, and if you don’t maintain the structure in your game, they can really hurt you.”
Van Heerden first played for the Lions in the 2001 Absa Currie Cup and graduated to the Cat Super 14 team the very next year. He has since played five Tests for the Springboks and was invited to train with the squad earlier this year.
Moving to the Vodacom Blue Bulls has not been an easy decision, but one that he ultimately feels is right. “It has been a very emotional week for me, as I have been through a lot with the Lions union. But I think that the move to the Bulls is the best one for my career. I needed a new challenge and a change.”
Van Heerden leaves the Lions just as they have begun to flourish, which for him makes the move even harder. “After the Super 14, we tried to implement some new structures, and they have now started to pay off.
“There are a lot of young guys in the side who have progressed incredibly this season, and the future of Lions rugby looks very exciting indeed.”

Or download MP3 (Right-click or option-click and save link)
This is the VOA Special English Agriculture Report.
The United States Department of Agriculture has given farmers permission to plant genetically engineered sugar beets with some conditions. A USDA agency ruled on the most popular variety of Roundup Ready sugar beets. The agency said the genetically engineered sugar beets do not harm the environment or increase threats by pests.
The Monsanto Company makes Roundup Ready crops. The genetic change in the sugar beets makes them resist the herbicide or weed killer known as Roundup.
The action lets growers plant the genetically changed sugar beets if they obey certain rules. The USDA agency expects to finish its full environmental study of the sugar beets by May of next year. Then it will decide if it will permit unlimited planting of the crops. Sugar beets provide about half of America’s sugar supply.
The government agency had unconditionally approved the genetically engineered sugar beets in two thousand five. But after legal action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California cancelled the agency’s approval last year. The court said the Agriculture Department needed to perform a complete study of the environmental effects of the sugar beets.
Jim Greenwood leads the Biotechnology Industry Organization. The group represents more than one thousand biotechnology companies and other organizations. Mr. Greenwood says the current decision is a reasonable step. He says it lets farmers make planting choices while the environmental statement is being completed.
But activist groups for the environment and food safety question the product’s safety. They will take legal action in the same federal court that issued the ruling last year. Lawyer Paul Achitoff of the organization Earthjustice said:
PAUL ACHITOFF: “We do expect to be able to challenge that decision before the district court.”
The Roundup Ready opponents say genetically engineered crops can cross-pollinate and damage other crops. And they say the crops can cause the growth of weeds that resist Roundup.
Last year, the United States Supreme Court considered its first case about genetically engineered crops. The court rejected a lower court’s decision to ban sale of genetically engineered alfalfa seeds until the government completed a study of their effects on the environment.
And that’s the VOA Special English Agriculture Report, written by Jerilyn Watson. I’m Karen Leggett.![

WMAJ Studios is proud to announce its newest product offering, Songimations! Building on prior successful campaigns, Write Me A Jingle now combines the best of audio jingles with powerful video animations.
Write Me A Jingle () made headlines with a campaign jingle throwback about President Obama. Featured on MSNBC’s Hardball with Chris Matthews, the talk show host shouted out the WMAJ team saying “politics never sounded so good."
The recent merger between TAM and LAN Airlines also saw an animated rebranding. The TAM Airlines team came to WMAJ to create a powerful Songimation that would help get US residents over to Brazil via the airline. When the folks at LAN saw the commercial, they immediately wanted to jump on board. A few musical tweaks and a couple weeks later, NBC released a co-branded piece between the (now partner) airlines that took flight late 2012.
“The jingle and audio branding industry has been prominently filled with the same recycled music since the 70’s. When we started WMAJ it was our intention to change the status quo.” -Joshua Snyder

“You told me about all these old directors whom people in Hollywood say are ‘over the hill,’ and it made me so sick, I couldn’t sleep. I started thinking about all these conductors – Klemoerer, Beecham, Toscanini – I can name almost a hundred in the last century – who were at the height of their powers after seventy-five. And were conducting at eighty…. it’s only in your twenties and in your seventies and eighties that you do the greatest work … and we must treasure old age and give genius the capacity to function in old age – and not send them away…”
—Orson Welles in Peter Bogdanovich’s Who The Devil Made It?, 1997, pp. 11-12.
On Age and Pop Culture
William Gillette was 78 when he finished his final tour as Sherlock Holmes, having played the role some 1,300 times, beginning at age 46. Many of the traits we now consider part of Holmes’ image – such as the deerstalker hat and curved pipe (and possibly, but not demonstrably, the genesis of the famous “Elementary, my dear Watson”) – were established or cemented by Gillette’s characterisation.
Gillette might have seemed old when he finished up as Holmes, but in today’s media environment it’s tough to see how he even got started: these days, 46 might as well be 78. Robert Downey Jr. may have been around that age when he stepped into Guy Ritchie’s new Sherlock Holmes franchise, but part of Downey Jr.‘s appeal seems to be his eternal frat-boy demeanour: a self-conscious summoning of the idea of youth, even if not its actual presence. The BBC revival Sherlock (2010–) was certainly more comfortable with a younger, more modern, internet-trendy Holmes in Benedict Cumberbatch. I doubt anyone would be surprised if a few incarnations down the track, the “young” in Barry Levinson’s 1985 Young Sherlock Holmes is rendered somewhat superfluous.
The elevation of youth and the creation of opportunities for new faces is vital, but it often seems that it’s more about the image of progress than the real pursuit of it; in a media and cultural environment that’s trained its audiences to be happily superficial, young faces represent little more than basic marketability rather than new ideas and forms of expression. No surprises there, but it’s a shame if a de-emphasis on adult roles results in a lack of real-world “grown-up” concerns in high-profile popular culture.
Certainly plenty of vocal online Gen-Xers and now-ageing Gen-Ys seem content to claim their generations’ narratives in what are essentially children’s stories, re-visiting again and again the same old tales of kids discovering their unique greatness, finding amazing powers that make them “special”, fighting mean ol’ bullies, getting the girl, and so on, almost as though such a refusal to leave the cultural realm of childhood will offer a protective counter-identity to the conservative and consumerist “adult” world that most of us are unavoidably sucked into (“I may work for a multi-national, ethically-bereft, profit-obsessed, human-rights-ignoring corporation, but isn’t my Batman retro-zombie faux-vintage day-glo collectible pillowcase awesome!?”).
While youthful reinvigoration of culture can seem nice, the relevance of the “non-adolescent” starts to diminish when the overall tone shifts towards the young. Just as older unemployed people can find it difficult to get a hold of meaningful employment opportunities, plenty of not-quite-established artists in the realm of popular culture may find their initially-bright spotlight pointing elsewhere before they’ve had a chance to fully explore the limits of their art or profession. While a culture of youth is still presented like it’s an upset to the established order, that’s usually far from the case: “youth culture” is the perfect marketing label to slap on the old conservative ideologies. Pretty new faces to say the same ugly old things.
Not that it’s all roses for the young out there, with rampant exploitation of young workers, highly insecure job positions, and an ever-increasing monopolisation of wealth going on. As Stephen Marcie writes in Esquire’s “The War Against Youth” : “The recession didn’t gut the prospects of American young people. The Baby Boomers took care of that” (26 March 2012). While the problems of “gerontocracy” are real, the constant re-packing of younger and younger faces for the mainstream popular consciousness is – perhaps counter-intuitively – part of maintaining that power imbalance. Such social and financial divisions are easier to maintain if we’re all happy to keep seeing ourselves as – and acting like – kids.
Of course, perhaps that’s just the standard not-too-nuanced and somewhat hyperbolic cry of despair at the hollowness of consumerism, but it’s still it’s a scary thought that the threshold for what’s considered to be “old” might be dropping: especially when length and (hopefully) quality of life are increasing.
There’s a lot to be gained by established powers if people’s voices can stop being heard once they pass a certain threshold, especially if that’s when awareness of social inequality begins to rise: if you’re still complaining after you’ve hit 25, then you’ve probably done something wrong with your life, seems to be the implied wisdom. On a cultural level, pop culture generally seems to suggest that, once people pass a certain age, they’ve more or less rid themselves of pesky things like emotional and personal conflicts worth exploring, if not emotions altogether. In a short scene from great TV series Lou Grant (episode “Takeover” from 6 December 1977), Nancy Marchand as newspaper owner Margaret (Mrs.) Pynchon points out what really shouldn’t be a surprise about the presence of emotion in the old:
There are still plenty of places for older actors and stars, but like Downey Jr. (or those bloated crime savants on detective shows), the best way to stay relevant may be to deny the years and appeal to youth-obsessed grown-ups: a slightly more subtle cultural version of the classic sitcom “Rock ‘n’ Roll Grandma”.
Older faces in pop culture obviously don’t automatically equate to “adult” concerns. Brooks Barnes in the New York Times points out that “older faces on screen draw an overlooked crowd” for grey-fuelled The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (starring 77-year-olds Judi Dench and
Maggie Smith) (23 May 2012), but as Chris Barsanti wrote in PopMatters, both The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and The Avengers opened at the same time and offered essentially the same non-problematised pandering to the perceived desires of their target age ranges (14 May 2012). As Barsanti rightly asks of both films: “These are both films that know their audiences, perhaps all too well… what is there to talk about really?” Pap aimed at different ends of the age range remains pap all the same.
It’s sad to see interesting and exciting actors, artists and performers struggle to get real, substantial work when the wrinkles become harder to airbrush away and the trendy attitudes become harder to convincingly maintain. Aside from the actors themselves, this can also relate to the kinds of stories we can tell about the characters we know. Part of the appeal of certain actors in the modern environment is the absolute identification with a role. Gillette may have been a definitive Holmes for his time, but we don’t have much to draw on when we consider his ownership of the role (only a radio recording survives of his Holmes). Today, with especially rigid control over modern cultural “product” (to use the ugly corporate language) and its global distribution, there’s limited room for multiple interpretations of characters, meaning that characters can often become inseparable from the actors that portray them.
Sylvester Stallone may have led a bit of an old folks charge with Rambo (2008) and Rocky Balboa (2006), but such reclamations of star billing seem to require enormous amounts of cash and social capital (and Human Growth Hormone?). The quality of Stallone’s films may have been questionable (actually, I think they’re not too bad), but it’s always welcome to see mainstream cinema take an opportunity to revisit its icons from a new perspective rather than simply abandoning them for a newer version. Thanks to the current “reboot” trend, our heroes never have to really grow (despite the constant flurry to praise the often meaningless “character arc”): changing actors means the characters stay perpetually young and their most basic conflicts never need to be surpassed. More interesting but less marketable character-actor combinations may find themselves abandoned as hints of age (or mere change) appear on the actors who, for a moment, “owned” a character.
Gillette may have been close to 80 when he performed his farewell tour, but one of the modern day TV detectives didn’t have as much luck. Peter Falk’s affable detective Lt. Columbo failed to return for a swansong when age stood in the way, and it’s always lamentable to hear that one of the most expressive and enjoyable female actors in the fantasy genre, the still-young and vibrant Lucy Lawless, might be seen as too old to be marketable for any return of Xena: Warrior Princess. While neither of these might seem to be great artistic losses, it’s interesting to think how these characters might have been approached by a sensitive creative team had they been given the opportunity to grow with their actor-“owners”. (Columbo may not have strayed from its formula, but the names behind Xena – including Rob Tapert and Sam Raimi – have always been much more interested in character than their unique Three-Stooges-melodrama style might suggest). In any case, after some initial eye-rolling, it soon becomes completely understandable why actor Huang Hoang felt the need to sue Internet Movie Database for revealing her age and, as a result, instantly reducing the amount of work available to her (actually demonstrating this inherent bias against actors due to age in order to claim damages will be the tougher‘America’s Most Wanted’ Canceled After 23 Years On Air
(credit: AP)
NEW YORK (AP) — “America’s Most Wanted,” the Saturday night show that has profiled criminals on the lam since 1988, has been canceled.
Fox announced the cancellation Monday and will be replacing the show on the network’s regular schedule with reruns.
Fox said it would do four, two-hour “America’s Most Wanted” specials next season, but it will no longer be a regular fixture on the network schedule. The series, hosted by John Walsh, debuted in April 1988 and has been on Fox’s Saturday night schedule since 1994.
“We have not made money on the show for a while,” said Kevin Reilly, Fox’s entertainment president. “It was economically getting to the place where it was not viable anymore, but we wanted to keep the concept alive.”

If your clients are looking to invest in tools to advance their business, our survey gave some insight as to what small businesses have been doing in this area.
More than 60 percent of our respondents invested in the following:
- Updating website
- Online services to streamline business
- Software to streamline business
- Social media
Forty-two percent also use online advertising, and 34 percent use online tools for presentations, such as GoToMeeting, Dropbox or video conferencing. Our survey respondents rated the following tools on a scale (effective, not effective, difficult to measure or did not use). These were the results:
- Company website – (77% effective; 3% not effective; 10% difficult to measure; 10% did not use)
- Smartphones for instant communication – 64% effective; 2% not effective; 15% difficult to measure; 19% did not use)
- Online tools for presentations – (46% effective; 2% not effective; 15% difficult to measure; 37% did not use)
- Online advertising – (45% effective; 4% not effective; 20% difficult to measure; 31% did not use)
- Tablets to showcase products – (37% effective; 5% not effective; 14% difficult to measure; 44% did not use)
This tells us there’s room for small business owners to take advantage of technology. It should also give you a good idea which direction to point your clients in.

Filed under: Tweens, Medical Conditions, Home Remedies
After being cancer-free for a year following a previous round of chemotherapy, the disease came back and he started treatment again. Now, however, he wants to switch to alternative treatment including chelation therapy, oregano and green tea. "He told us that he didn't want to undergo any more treatment because he felt that it wasn't going to give him quality of life, that he felt that it would probably take away his life," said the boy's father.
A judge had earlier ruled that the boy was not capable of understanding what it meant to refuse chemotherapy. According to his father, the boy has fetal alcohol syndrome and is somewhat intellectually delayed.

80% cure rate plus he has FAS? He isn't capable of making those choices. I think his parents are not making the right choice for him either, but I don't think he needed to be taken away from them.

This is a topic that really gets my blood boiling. The PARENTS get to decide whether or not he continues treatment. This is a very personal decision and quality of life SHOULD be a factor.
A child shouldn't get to make the decision, but certainly, they should have input WITH THE PARENTS.
Even in cases where doctors say there is a good chance that he could be cured, it is the PARENT's call. Parents are the ones that take EVERYTHING into consideration.
Doctors want to treat the body medically, but there is more to life than just your physical body. While I in NO WAY support any kind of active steps to hasten death (at any age), I do believe we have the right to refuse treatment, especially something that can be as devastating as chemotherapy.
I don't know that in this case, I agree with the parents, but I totally support their right to make the call unless they are proven to be unable to understand. No agreeing with the doctors does not mean they do not understand.

In the words of Karen,"This is a topic that really gets my blood boiling" The child is 11 years old--according to the article, there is am 80% chance of a cure--that's 80 people out of 100 cured. I wouldn't allow a parent or the child to make that decision. If the there is an 80% chance of a cure--then the child and family should be forced to take it. He can complain in 7 years time when he is 18 and of legal age-- or 10 years if it is 21--how he would rather have died.

Well Randy, and what if he is one of the 20%? He has already been through this before. So, he should be put through this misery again and still may die or just prolong his misery? Based on odds? Do you take nothing else into consideration?
What puts YOU in the position to make this decision for HIM and the PARENTS who know this child best?
That is arrogant and disgusting. How DARE YOU decide what is best for this child? How DARE YOU think that YOU KNOW based on odds and no personal interaction with this child what is better for him than his parents?
Reading the story -- I would probably go with the odds to, but no way am I taking this responsibility away from his parents. They are the ones that have to live with the decision. It doesn't effect you at all.
I can tell you right now that I would flat out defy any court that tried to tell me how to make medical decisions for my child. I would do everything possible to keep the government and doctors OUT of this decision. I would take the steps (legal or otherwise) necessary to prevent them from taking custody as well.
This is one of the WORST violations you can commit against the parent/child relationship and unless the parents are proven imcompetent - it is THEIR call.

This is actually happening in my hometown. I feel for the family.
It is such a complicated issue.
What is not complicated is the CAS getting involved. They've been quietly pushing the boundaries of their jurisdiction and they really messed this situation up. The doctor is legally bound to contact CAS if parents refuse treatment that will put a child in mortal danger. But, the choice to not participate in chemotherapy and instead participate in alternative, non chemical therapy was the boy's, FAS or not.
First, they must show a court order to apprehend the boy, which they did not.
Secondly, is it ethical to remove an 11 year old who is a cancer patient from his family who is capable of adequately attending to his day to day needs in order to stick him in a foster home? Will that help this boy? Wasn't there a better way of doing this? Could the CAS not have left the boy in custody but taken steps to arbitrate a solution?
While the treatment for this cancer has an 80% success rate, this is a recurrence of leukemia. It is no wonder the boy doesn't want to relive his chemotherapy and is willing to try an alternative treatment.
Finally, why is the boy not allowed to seek alternative treatment while being monitored in tandem by a pediatric oncologist?

I'm going through chemo right now and I 37 years. It is doable. 80%? I would definitely do it. But it is not like they are refusing treatments they are talking about chosing another route. Is that not they're choice? Taking a sick kid away from parents who clearly want to honor their child's wishes is just wrong. They really are messing with his quality of life because at a time like this family who loves you is very much NEEDED.

The reason the treatment is alternative is that it doesn't work. Using an alternative treatment like this is basically the same as using faith healing to treat diabetes.

This is bullshit, as is the sanctimony of life.
This is supposed to be a free country. What does that mean anymore? Doodley-squat! every jerk-wad with a self righteous opinion thinks that he/she has the right to tell me how I should live, act and think. What right has the government, or any of you other sanctimonious morons have to tell me, or this kid, or anyone else, what's right for me or them?
Moreover, who died and made you gods to decide that life at any cost, situation. or amount of suffering is better than no life at all?
Who has the right to tell me that I have to take medications that in many instances do no more than make pharmacological companies richer? One doctor says this is your problem; take this chemical. Another doctor says, no this is your problem, take this one. And much of the time that doctor is just pushing the "cure" from the company who pays him off best.
Then they tell you crap like there is no clinical study that suggests that tea and honey can help your cold. Why? because there is no profit in that study. But there is plenty of profit in medicines with chemical compounds you can't pronounce that are no better. But they have been proven to benefit those who took it 60% of the time compared to those who took placebo. (Side effects may include sore throat, itching, loss of sight, anal bleeding, and in some instances death.)
Ever been on chemo? many of you idiots screamed out against the tourture at Gitmo, that make chemotherapy seem like a day at the spa.
I'm an AMERICAN. I have the inalienable right to decide how I live, or how and when I die.
That's called freedom and the very definition of liberty.

Oh no, I'm sorry, but I hope that was not a father speaking.
I suppose with that logic he would also suggest your 11 year old child should be allowed to decide any number of things for himself or herself. Yikes.
No, in fact, we do not have the "freedom" or "liberty" to act irresponsibly and endanger others.

No one has the right to tell YOU what to do with your life however, people of this DEMOCRACY, decided they didn't like seeing people abuse children. Which is what these parents are doing by trying to encourage their child to use pseudoscience as a cure.
So the government was pushed by the people of said democracy to begin intervening in the welfare of children, I say for the benefit of this particular child
This is very simple, if you want to convince everyone that pseudoscience works. Get funding from the voodoo companies that push your alternative crap to start a study that uses the proper guidelines(Scientific Method) that will create data and show how your said voodoo works. Then submit completed study to every medical journal available. The Medical industry will then review, methods, standards, and outcome of the study. They will then attempt to repeat your study to confirm that is does indeed work. If it does then you have just changed the medical science.
Until that is done to one will listen to you no matter how much you yell about it, just provide proof, not just any proof good repeatable proof.
I would love nothing more if you could prove that oregano and green tea can cure cancer. But the fact remains it cannot not matter what you say or believe.
As for doctors never prescribing honey for example colds YOUR WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yes, we have the government to step in and protect the welfare of children when parents are incapable of providing that care. BUT, this is not a cut and dry issue. I know of many people with successful chemo treaments and many others who said it was the worst choice they made. The parents aren't neglecting this child, they just CHOOSE a different path. This is not cut and dry and when there are grey areas, the parents get to choose.
Right now we do not have laws making it mandatory for you to follow doctors orders. Until we do - the parent is the decision making authority for the child.
Reply
5-14-2008 @ 12:00PMDon said...
The child was taken into by by the Children's Aid Society, because the state(Canada) feels that the parent's were going to neglect him.
As for the child's actual feeling about cancer treatment they cannot have much merit, because his father seems to be pushing these "alternative" remedies upon him. Parents have a strong influence what a child believes at that age. "The boy also has Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and is Intellectually delayed". Said the Father
So we should be secure in knowing that the boy's desires are in his own best interest, doubtful.
The father sounds like a whacko and boy should be removed from his care for the remainder of his youth.

I will admit that I am really only familiar with the standard and mores of the USA--but in the USA, we the people have decided that usually parents have the paramount right in making decisions for their children. One of the the situations where society has determined that it is proper to intervene is in matters regarding critical illnesses that have a reasonable chance of being cured. If the chance for cure had been less then I am sure the physicians would not have called the child protection services. If the childs cancer has a reasonable chance of responding to therapy, then yes he should be made to to tkae it. And yes, I have no idea how debilitating chemotherapy is--the majority of us probably don't. But if the result at the end of the day is a live child as opposed to a dead one--then I think the choice is obvious. And as a previous post noted--when oregano and green tea are proven to cure cancer, I'll be all for it. The drug companies and and phsycians are not perfect--drug companies especially--but for now at least they have a better track record than the alternative therapies.

From a previous post--"Right now we do not have laws making it mandatory for you to follow doctors orders. Until we do - the parent is the decision making authority for the child. "
You are entirely right-there are no laws making it mandatory to follow physicians orders. On the other hand--at least in the USA there are mandatory laws for physicians to report to the authorities behavior that they feel is life threatening to the child. The physicians felt that this was the case. They presented the case to the authorities and the authorities agreed.
5-14-2008 @ 12:46PMKaren said...
Well, the authorities are wrong. It happens. A lot! Thankfully, in our democratic society (which isn't democratic by the way), hopefully a judge or someone will step in and do the right thing.
And if it were my child, I would violate the law rather than allow them to over-ride what I thought was best for my child. My utmost venom is reserved for people support the government in these cases.
I'm not advocating alternative treatments, and I'm not even saying that the child is the deciding factor, although I do believe he should have some voice, but in grey areas such as these, the parents should be the one to make the call (providing they are capable of understanding). But you can't say that not agreeing with the doctors mean they don't understand.
The authorities should step in ONLY to determine if the parents understand the medical choices given to them. If so, then they decide. If the child disagrees with the parent, then someone should step in to see that the child wishes are considered as well.
But in this case, they should have the right to refuse medical treatment that is debilitating even if YOU don't like the odds of whatever whack treatment they want to use.

"But in this case, they should have the right to refuse medical treatment that is debilitating even if YOU don't like the odds of whatever whack treatment they want to use."
That's just so wrong in so many ways--I will however admit--that these postings have made me back track slightly after some thought. There might be situations where I would agree that treatment should not be pushed on the family. HOWEVER if the situation is exactly like that depicted above --and in real life no situation ever is--but if the situation above were the entire situation then heck yes the child should have the treatment.

I'm 13 years old, and have been a cancer survivor for 12 years.
Some of the doctors tried to convince my parents to give me chemo. luckily my parents looked at the options and decided not to.
the cancer was totally removed from my body, and guess what? no relapses either!
I believe that a child of 11, can have SOME right to how they live, and what they have to go through.
You guys are all saying "oh i've been through chemo, it's not that bad..." Well guess what, you're adults. have you ever seen pictures of young children who are going through chemo? How absolutely drained of life they look? AND yet they usually manage to keep a positive outlook on life. So let me just say, Ha! you've gotta be kidding me! this kid knows what he's talking about. he's been through many chemo treatments. and they're torture. of course they are!
What would it be like to be an 11 year old boy and not be able to run around, or get into a little mischief?
Did any of you miss the bit about the ALTERNATIVE treatment? If there's an 80% chance of survival, does that have anything to do with what kind of treatment? who says that chemo is the only way?
and again. i must say. 11 years old? and you think that he has ABSOLUTELY no right to decide for himself?? yes, legally an 11 year old should not be able to decide everything about their life for themself. but they should have some right to how they live. or the "torture they endure.
One more thing, i know i said my age, maybe that was a stupid thing. But dont you dare go thinking that i'm too young to understand, or dont know what i'm talking about. I can understand things a lot better than many adults. and i have geniune debates with my parents on many topics (politics, religion, etc.). Not to "toot my own horn" and all. but just saying. i refuse to be treated like a child who has no idea what they're talking about....

You people aren't getting the whole story. It COULD have an 80% cure rate IF it's caught early and treated promptly. Since this is his second occurence, his rates of survival go down. There is information on this at The Sick Kid's website if you want to look at it.
I have worked with children with cancer, the treatment is difficult, every child has to be treated individually, and responds in a different manner. He may require ongoing chemo for up to 22 months.

-------------------------------------------
Well Mary, GOOD FOR you! You're ONE of small % of the LUCKY ONES!! You are correct that CHEMO doesn't last forever. In your case, it was a couple of months, and your alive and feel fine.
However, for the majority of cancers being treated with Chemo, it is a couple of months per cycle. Usually 2-4 weeks of no treatment, so it doesn't kill you immediately, then, on to the 2nd cycle. This is normally repeated over and over, unless you have too many white blood cells, becuz the CHEMO is killing the red ones rapidly. Which means that you'll more than likely DIE SOON! Sooner usually, than if you had NOT had the treatment at all. ALOT of people take CHEMO over a period of a year or two,some longer, ONLY TO BE TOLD in the end that there's nothing else they can do, so here's a morphin pump, and a # to contact Hospice. Most die not of the CANCER ITSELF, but the SIDE effects of the TOXINS that WERE your CHEMO treatmants!! DO some research MARY, before you comment in such a Uncompassionate, judgemental way. You are 2 yrs in the clear,and GOD BLESS for that, BUT you still have 3 more before your considered out of the woods, or FINE. May you have many more yrs of feeling fine, and CANCER FREE.
These parents have EVERY RIGHT, or SHOULD, to seek ALERNATIVE MEDICINE if THEY so choose!!!! It is an absolute OUTRAGE that this child has been removed from them for this reason. Especially when they have gone the TRADITIONAL MEDICINE route already, THAT HASN'T WORKED!!!!!
This decision will negetivly effect this child more than YOU or the COURTS/GOV will EVER KNOW, or ADMIT to. OH yeah...YOU/COURTS/GOV, DO NOT KNOW or LOVE this child and YOU/COURTS/GOV, won't MISS or BE DEVESTASTED, when this CHILD is no longer on this earth, but with the angels!
Not to mention that the parents will live on without the child they love, possibley because of People who had NO RIGHT to make a decision such as this. DO SOME RESEARCH!!! MOST of the crap we feed on NEW TREATMENTS and CURES, is BULL***T being washed into your brain by "BIG, PROFITING, VERY POWERFUL...BIG PHARMA!! YOU WILL NEVER SEE A CURE FOUND FOR ANY CANCERS BECAUSE THEY MAKE BILLIONS off your demise. :(

The 2008 National Security Budget and Briefing Slides
President Bush’s fiscal year 2008 (FY 08) Pentagon budget seeks $624.6 billion, not including additional national defense costs for the Department of Energy and other federal agencies (an additional $22.6 billion). Moreover, a comprehensive calculation might also include the costs of the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of State (add another $159.1 billion). Combining all national security related costs would total $802.9 billion for FY 08.
The Pentagon’s budget alone calculates to $1.7 billion per day for 2008. It’s highly probable that our enemies in Iraq do not spend that amount in an entire year, and yet we are losing this war.
Three briefing slides prepared by Winslow Wheeler, director of the Straus Military Reform Project, track these costs using various perspectives.
For the briefing slides, click here. (slides currently unavailable)
>50 Free
1 Bousquet
2 Cielo
3 Adrian
Before Cielo's recent failed test for a masking agent, I had him doing the 50 and 100 Free double. His biggest advantage has been his incredible mental strength, and the impact this had on his competitors. Cielo has always had a mental edge over Fred Bousquet especially, now I think the tables have turned. I see Bousquet sensing a chink in the Brazilian's armour and taking advantage of it.
100 Free
1 Cielo
2 Adrian
3 Hayden
As the Cielo saga unfolds this choice could change, but he did look on incredible form at the Paris Open. Nathan Adrian has not shown his hand in 2011, but should be a force to be reckoned with after a full taper. Brent Hayden might be the most under rated 100 Freestyler on the planet, the only man to break 48 seconds last year and yet still most people see bronze at best for the Canadian.
200 Free (Changing my mind on a daily basis)
1 Park
2 Phelps
3 Lochte
Easily the hardest event to predict in world swimming. Park is my choice for the top spot based on three factors a) he is an Olympic champion, that can never be underestimated, b) he was a full half second faster than the rest of the world last year, and c) he looked in great shape at the Santa Clara meet. Lochte is Lochte and Phelps is Phelps. At this stage its a coin flip between the two of them. I still refuse to rule out Paul Biedermann and he will have a serious point to prove in Shanghai.And then there's the improving Yannick Agnel.... my head is starting to hurt again.
400 Free
1 Sun Yang
2 Park
3 Agnel
I can't wait for this event. Sun Yang vs Tae-hwan Park, both 3:41 guys, both with a legitimate shot at the world record. Check the comments for John26's assessment of the race, I tend to agree with his theory about Sun Yang being under world record pace before falling off, compared to Park being down at all stages of his race at Asian Games. Agnel should have Ous Mellouli for company for the bronze medal fight.
800 Free
1 Sun Yang
2 Mellouli
3 Pizzetti
Nobody is talking about Sun Yang breaking compatriot Zhang Lin's WR of 7:32.12, maybe for good reason as it would require two 3:46s back to back. He also 'only' managed 7:47 at last year's Asian Games. My pick of Pizzetti instead of Ryan Cochrane has been questioned, but I can't overlook Pizzetti who seems to have made a step up in class in 2011. European Champion Sebastien Rouault shouldn't be forgotten either.
1500 Free
1 Sun Yang
2 Mellouli
3 Cochrane
Will Grant Hackett's iconic world record go? I think so. With the greatest of respect to Mellouli, Cochrane and the rest of the 1500 field, I can't see anyone getting within 8 seconds of the new Chinese star.
50 Back
1 Lacourt
2 Tancock
3 Thoman
Lacourt is one of the easier picks in both the 50 and 100 Back. Unless his competitors make enormous breakthroughs, or Lacourt has an off meet, he should come away with double gold from Shanghai. Liam Tancock should be good enough for silver with the battle for bronze wide open. Nick Thoman hasn't convinced me of his long course ability (without a tech suit), but I think he may have enough for bronze here.
100 Back
1 Lacourt
2 Irie
3 Tancock
Irie has been one of the stars of 2011 so far and will look to improve upon his disappointing 4th place at Worlds two years ago. For British hopes next year it would be great to see Tancock pick up a medal here ahead of London next year. The absence of Matt Grevers makes this a relatively straightforward Top 3 to pick.
200 Back
1 Lochte
2 Irie
3 Clary
These three look the class of the field. Lochte is the obvious choice. Irie is Mr. Consistent, he has the top 5 swims of 2011 (all between 1:54.0 and 1:54.6). Clary reportedly swam 1:54.7 in jammers, in training earlier this year, he could cause a huge shock. Chinese youngster Zhang Fenglin, James Goddard, Chris Walker-Hebborn and Polish phenom Radoslaw Kawecki should all make the final.
50 Breast
1 V.D. Burgh
2 Silva
3 Feldwehr
Van Den Burgh remains a class apart in the sprint Breaststroke. Time to see another Silver from Silva.
100 Breast
1 Kitajima
2 Dale Oen
3 Rickard
"I will never bet against Kosuke Kitajima again", this has been my mantra since I doubted his chances in Beijing. Alexander Dale-Oen and Brenton Rickard I have as the clear choices for silver and bronze. Ryo Tateishi is the danger man to break into the top three if he rediscovers his form from last year.
200 Breast
1 Kitajima
2 Tomita
3 Gyurta
Despite the aforementioned mantra, I almost went with Tomita in this one. His 2:08.25 earlier this year was spectacular, but how can you bet against Kitajima and his proven excellence at major competitions? Gyurta is the choice for bronze based on his ability to bring it together on the biggest stage. If Christian vom Lehn improves on his German Nationals time, watch out, but Shanghai might have come a year too early for the German youngster. Watch out for him next year.
50 Fly
1 Cielo
2 Schoeman
3 Targett
Depends Cielo's participation.
100 Fly
1 Phelps
2 Cavic
3 Fujii
Cavic hasn't done a lot to inspire confidence, but he and Phelps are still in a league of their own. Phelps could drop a huge swim in this one. He's focusing more on the 100 distance than he ever has before. Bronze is wide open, but Fujii has been excellent in 2011 and owns 5 of the top 14 times this year.
200 Fly
1 Phelps
2 Matsuda
3 Biczo
We could be looking at the closest 200 Fly final for Phelps in recent years, but given his previous margins of victory that's not saying much. Matsuda
200 IM
1 Lochte
2 Phelps
3 Cseh
This could be one for the ages. We have Phelps vs Lochte, and the world record looks vulnerable. Lochte had the better 2010, but Phelps has already shown his class in 2011. It wouldn't surprise me if this is the race he is most motivated for here. This should be close... and fast. Thiago Pereira and James Goddard will be in the race for bronze, but I don't see them stopping Cseh take yet another international medal.
400 IM
1 Lochte

This one might be a lot closer than many people think. Clary is a legitimate threat to Lochte. For Cseh, read above. Chengxiang Wang put the cat among the pigeons on home soil.

However hard I try, I just can't see USA losing out, not that it won't be close. France have the best chance to take on the Americans, and with Yannick Agnel they seem to have a safe hand on the final leg (assuming Agnel swims the relay). The emergence of James Magnussen means Australia have jumped Russia in my opinion for the bronze medal.

When you have two of the top 200 Freestylers in the world joined by two other Top 10 talents, you have quite a team. Russia might be stronger in the 4 x 200 relay than the 4 x 100 team, while China are boosted by Sun Yang's 1:44 ability. Japan, Australia and France will be the other major strengths.
4 x 100 Medley
1 USA

Make no mistakes about it, this race will be close. USA lack strength on the breaststroke, France lack a butterflier while Japan might struggle on the freestyle. When the dust settles, Michael Phelps' dominance on the butterfly will win this for USA, but he will probably have some ground to make up on France and Japan.
Clary doesn't swim 200 IM. Phelps does.
Can I pass that off as a typo? Didn't think so.
Phelps in for the silver.
Wrong thread i know but just wondering, what are are your views on Amelia Maughan's performances this year on the whole? When she swam 56.51 very early in the year all seemed very promising as she was 1/2 a second up on 2010 pace but she has faltered a fair amount and has under-achieved at yet another meet.
I think i am being a little harsh as her times are great for a 1996 born 56.0 last year but only managed 57.1 at euro's. I also noticed her relay split (56.38) was well up on her individual times and normally i would put it down to the take over, but her relay takeover was 0.54!!!! pretty awful, actually all the Brits were (Lloyd's was 0.66! should have had her on lead ha!
On a plus side o'connor smashed another PB (57.1 lead off) and we got a silver.
cochrane for 3rd in 800. The Italian has nothing on him
I agree. Cochrane will kick ass. He is under rated.

3 Agnel 343.0
(agnel’s time is pretty hard to call because of his illness but I believe Mellouli would come next with a 343mid, followed by a host of 344’s/low 345s battled between Biedermann, pvk and Napolean. I don’t see Park going much faster than the above time, but I could see Sun under 340 because at Chinese Nationals, he posted splits that look like improved fitness and technical turns can bring him close to that mark. Sun’s technique is not as “perfect” as Parks, I expect him to continue dropping time in the future. For Park to go sub340, he’s need to go out, in the first 300, faster than Thorpe did, which I cant see)
800free
1 Sun 836
2 Mellouli 840

(Anything slower for Sun I think would be conservative, he’s going to be over 2 second faster than Hackett at his best at the 400, and at least half a dozen or so seconds faster than 05’ Hackett in the 1500, cracking 835 is shouldn’t be totally shocking but really, its hard to pencil in that prediction because its so much faster than the textile best).

1 Lochte 152.9
2 Clary 153.7

(I don’t trust Irie to drop any time. Lochte wants to get the 200 back record back at some point in his career, he’d need this if he wants to set himself up to it. Watch for wildcard Zhang from China cuz I think he can blow some big names out of the water)

(I think a split of 23.8 + 25.3 +/- 0.1 on each leg looks very likely. Maybe a 50.08 or something is the fastest I can see. I don’t expect him to be challenged. I think Starke has run his wheels a bit at German Nationals, the only one I can see taking bronze other than Huegill is Verlinden who’s looked pretty good. I think Verlinden, Cavic, McGill will all pop a time around 51.7. My prediction earlier this year is that a Chinese swimmer with very little media exposure is going to take a medal in Shanghai, Zhou I smy #1 candidate for this role)

I think a textile record is optimistic and shoulnt be shocking. Anyways I had a hard time not choosing Cseh for bronze but Wu Peng looks primed for a break out swim).

--------------------------------------
Even Ian Thorpe's coach was expecting Ian to swim 3:38.
And now Park has even better underwater and turn than Ian.
I definitely think Ian will swim better than ever in 200 as he has now realized the importance of underwater and turns.
John26, your picks and times are very interesting.
The times are a bit on the optimistic side, methinks :)
but we'll see.
...I hope your wrong or I'll be kinda disappointed when the event comes around. There are certain events I have extremely high hopes for ie 200/400 free. Anyways there was a marked drop in times between 06 and 07, I dont think any of my predictions were outrageous. was there any specific one in particular?
come to think of it, you might be right because I'm calling a textile record in every event except for the 400m free.
There were three things that made 2007 World champs extraordinary:
1. The introduction of Speedo FS ProII. Some even said the effects were equal to FS proII to LZR.
2. The first full extensive use of underwater stroke
3. Phelps was at his highest peak
This year, all men will only be wearing textile Jammer, while in 2007 they were wearing bodysuits or at least ankle length. And we now know that compression helps.
In another note, I think many if not most current textile best are slower than they should have been because of the two years disruption on the progress. so I predict that there will still be many if not most textile best broken, although I wouldn't say all of them.
these events are what I think will be slower than your predictions:
50/200/800 free
50/100/200 back
(lacourt might still break the 50 WR, but maybe in 24.00 or 23.9)
200 breast
(I cannot see anyone swimming sub 2:08)
100/200 fly
(I would think 50.5 and 1:52.5 is more likely)
400 IM
(I think Lochte will swim something like 4:06.50)
I call that 400 free WR goes in Shanghai. (pretty please!!!!!)
Park 3:39.87
Sun 3:40.66
Mellouli 3:42.91
Everyone else 3:44 and later
And yeah, Park's turns appeared much improved in Santa Clara.
Based on that, I think he will win 200 as well.
Park 1:43.50
Phelps 1:43.75
Agnel 1:44.90
Outside of 200 and 400 free, I am most curious to see how low Sun will go in 1500.
Sun 14:33.44
Cochrane 14:41.57
Mellouli 14:43.26
I agree. If there's only one record goes in mens events, I am so hoping that it's 400 free.
Partly because I'm a big fan of Thorpe, and it sicken me that someone like Biedermann in jaked erased Thorpe's name by 0.01 second.
I am an ardent fan of Park!
It's proved in Santa Clara that he improved turns significally! So I think he will break his best-record in both 200 meters and 400 meters. But It's difficult to predict which place he's going to be becasue of Yannick Agnel and Sun Yang.
As long as I know, Park will appear in 100 meter freestyle, which means he is practicing swimming fast and he is very likely to swim fast in the meet!
So I think Park will win 200 meter freestyle beating Sun Yang and Phelps
Park>>>>>Sun Yang>Phelps>>>Agnel>>>>>>>>>>>Others
400 meter freestyle will be a very close game.
Park>Sun Yang>>Agnel>>>>>>>>>>>>>Others..
I also think Park will win the 200. His 100 in Santa Clara was incredible.
I hope either Sun yang or Park will break the 400 WR, but I think Sun yang will do it. he is focusing on that because of his rivalry with Park and I don;t think he want to lose again to Park in the 400 after the asian games.
Sun is not swimming 200 in Shanghai, per reports.
He'll be doing 400, 800, & 1500.
Zhang Lin, the forgotten man, is swimming 200 though.
Man, I totally forgot about him myself!
Agnel, even if it weren't for the recent illness, I wouldn't consider him a gold medal contender in either 200 or 400 just yet.
He's still young and improving massively, so who knows, but I would pencil him in for 3-4 spot for now.
For the 400m, I dont think there is a solid 3rd place candidate other than Agnel. I think he's proven he's the best nonAsian 400m man. I cant see anyone else beating him for that bronze even if he's obviously not at his full potential yet in this event.
My confidence in Sun Yang beating Park comes from his splits. Sun was actually faster than Thorpe's WR up to 100, had a slightly slower second 100, was about even on the third 100 and was much slower coming home (understandable as he wasn't fully rested <-- a very important point). His performance was also impeded by technical aspects (like 3 breaths) that he didn't show during the Asian Games, which suggests to me these are training devices (important point #2) that once removed will make him master than Thorpe to the 300m. Lastly once he's fully rested and geared up to take the 1500m crown, his final 100 is going to be faster too (important point #3).
Park on the other hand was slower in all his 50s splits than Thorpe's WR split-- making it hard to believe he's going to be able to pull it off. Park was slower than THorpe in his final 100m, and I have a hard time he'd be faster to the 300 unless Park could surpass Thorpe's PR in the 100 (144.0) which I looks to be a stretch at this point.
I can't hope but notice that Agnel has made the same improvements as THorpe did in his early days 346--> 343.85 (in season) --> 341.8 (tapered the same season). With illness I dont think Agnel will do the same, but its helpful to note what is possible.
Zhang Lin is the other man I believe is capable of going 341 as he did so in a lzr in Rome. If all works well in the lead up to London, we could see one of the most exciting 400m finals in history. I dont think many people would tip the 340barrier to survive the Olympics.
Thorpe did the 3:41.8 when he was 16 turning into 17. How old is agnel now? 19? 20?
I think relatively, Agnel will be be doing better in 200 as he already has very good 100.
Also, about sun comparison per 100 with Thorpe. I hope you haven't forgotten that Thorpe's final 100 or 50 were always legendary because that was when he started his famous 6 beat kick. So, sun yang really need to get far ahead of thorpe by 300 if he hopes to go under 3:40
BTW, I'm rooting for Sun to go under 3:40, or at the very least 3:40.06 !!!!!
That's not necessarily true. Thorpe's homecoming split in his final 100 was 27.61 and 27.04. Sun Yang was considerably faster coming home last year at the Asian Championships (27.69 and 26.68).
From this, I would suggest that to safely break the WR Sun must have about 1.5 seconds under Biedermann's WR pace going into the 300m, and about a second underneath at the 350m.
This alone will be a challenge, considering he was 1.3 under that pace at the 350 and only 0.3 at the 350.
The strategy is clear for Sun-- clean up that technical stuff for easier early speed and work on finishing speed through taper and fitness. I believe it is doable.
I'd be thrilled to see 400 WR go, and while Sun Yang is definitely a strong candidate and one no one can go wrong with, I'll root for Park mostly because he's a regular sized (6 feet) guy with a regular sized feet (I assume his are not size 18).
I mean, he's by no means a dwarf, but I would have to think that he's had to work much harder on his technique to overcome his smallish physique.
It's just refreshing and eye opening (for me anyway) to see a smaller person topping a bunch of 6'5" semi giants. (A la Justine Henin in women's tennis in her days)
Also I must thank john26, aswimfan, and others for their breakdowns of these races. WOW
Looking forward to all the great swimming in two weeks!
On an unrelated note, I wish Derek Jeter would get his 3,000th hit asap, so that the earth can start spinning again.
So sick of hearing about it!!
To john26..
It seems that you ignored the fact that Park had to compete in 100M and 400M in ONE day in Santa Clara. He had to go through 100M prelim and 400M prelim in the morning 100M final and 400M final(one hour later than 100M final) in the afternoon.
It means that the schedule was tough enough to make him not able to show his consummate performance. In my opinion, without his improved turns and underwater dolphin kicks(he can go up to 13meters underwater compared phelps with 15meter-long uderwater distance), he couldn't have been under 3:45:00 only one hour after 100M final!
I think Park can go under 3:41:00 in 400M and go under 1:44:00 in 200M! He'll be in 1st place in 200M and in 1st or 2nd place in 400M
"Matsuda can proudly claim to have beaten the greatest ever this year..."
I think you're getting Matsuda and Wu Peng confused. Phelps and Matsuda last raced at Pan Pacs. And for the record, the 100 fly might be the toughest race of the meet to pick the minor medals.
what do you think of sun yangs technique?
he breathes 3 times in a row straight of the turn before putting his head down.. iv never seen this before
Anonymous,
Park's performance splits that I was referring to were from the Asian Games, his most reliable race model (also his fastest). Park's inseason swims like Santa Clara are unreliable for judging his performance in 2 weeks because he tends to negative split his in season swims. Against Sun (or if he wants to break the WR) he cant afford to do so.
Also, Park does not go 13m underwater. He has improved his underwaters significantly. In 07, Phelps went out to about the 12m mark after each turn, not 15. The only swimmers that I've seen go out that far are terakawa and Coughlin, although Phelps' strength doesnt necessarily depend on how far he goes but how fast his underwaters are.
Though Park has improved his turns, I've noticed that his starts are still not great (at santa clara), you can see this in his 200m race. And that his most improved turn is his first turn where he stays down around 8 or 9 meters.
I was thinking about this last night and I just cant see Sun losing to Park in the long run. Yes they're both young but Park's been around for so much longer, his technique is nigh perfect and it seems that his improvements have been coming from improving his 100m, thereby increasing his 200, thereby increasing his 400. Since dropping the 1500, he has lost an extremely important edge against Sun.
Park is attacking the same distances as Thorpe and one way to succeed him is by going out faster than him. In other words, doing what Thorpe did better than he did. Dropping longer distances is sure to hamper his home coming abilities.
Sun on the other hand is dropping down a distance, which is a lot easier than reaching up to it. Because swimming shorter distances like the 200m is psychologically pleasing, it is easier for him to gain easy speed than it is for Park to work on his finish speed.
If Sun is within half a body length of Park by the 300, he should win. Even if Park wins this summer, I cant see him bringing home Olympic gold. Keep in mind Sun is only 19, and unlike Thorpe at 19, Sun has only started to realize his potential.
I think Park can still go faster than Thorpe's 1:44, but not 3:40.
With better turns and underwater, Thorpe could have easily swum 1:43 or even under.
When you compare Phelps' 1:43.86 and any of Thorpe's 1:44 swims, it is very clear that Thorpe only lose during turns, and is actually much faster in swimming speed. And since Park's turns and underwaters today are much better than Thorpe, I can see him swim under 1:44
also, Wu peng is not the only this season (twice!) who defeated Phelps in the 200 fly. NIck D'arcy also beat him by .01 in Santa Clara
Oh I see your point. And you are right.
note on Hayden. He has been the most consistent sprinter since 07. I believe this 47.2 in the lzr was probably around the same type of performance that brought Cesar his 46.9 WR. This means if you take out his 08 blip where he failed to advance out of the prelims despite posting 47.5 on the relay, he has been the best swimmer in 07, 09, 10...
He is probably actually the safest bet for Gold if it wasn't for the fact that Adrian is still young and rapidly improving, however we dont really know how fast he's improving which is why he's not a safe bet anyways. Just saying it shouldnt be a surprise if Hayden wins GOld and does so convincingly- although Im sure it'll be viewed as an upset.
and finally back to Sun Yang again but on the 800. He's going to be at least 2 seconds faster than 05 Hackett at the 300 (maybe 2.5+) and maybe as much as 10+ second faster than 05' Hackett in the 1500m. Shouldnt this put him, mathematically 5 seconds or so (maybe more) faster than Hackett was in the 800? This put him at least 833 or so. Anyways, just some food for thought I suppose that he could get pretty close to Zhang Lin's WR, which would be a much more eyeopening swim than breaking the 4/15 because those are expected. However unlike Hackett Sun may not know how to swim this event optimally (his 800 swim in april was pretty weak compared to his 400 and 1500, but he said he was holding back) and will treat it as a warm up for the 15. But we'll see how things work out with others in the race pushing him.
SOmething else, when Zhang Lin broke the 600m WR, he swam the 1500m in 15:54 (significantly slower than we'd imagine Sun s going to swim) and the 400m in 341.35(lzr, so lets imagine he'd be in the 339s). If Sun also goes 339, it should position him pretty nicely at bringing down the record in the intermediate distance. No?
meant to say
" He's going to be at least 2 seconds faster than 05 Hackett at the 400" in 2nd big paragraph
John, I disgaree with you regarding the 800.
In 2001 Osaka when Hackett swam 1:46, 3:42 and 14:34, he swam the 800 in 7:40.
Remember also that when Hackett swam the 800WR in Montreal, he "sacrificed" the 200,400, and 1,500.
Let's say Sun Yang this year is actually faster than Hackett with 3:40 and 14:32 (he has an advantage in that he doesn't have to swim the 200, unlike Hackett normally did), it is still a far fetched to see him swimming in anything close to 7:32.
Remember, Zhang lin's 800 was unbelievable because he swam in jaked which afforded him to swim 25 seconds in the last 50 of his 800!
Not even Thorpe in his mightiest 200 swims swam that fast in the final 50.
Zhang lin paid the price for it in the 1,500 though.
But I agree, if Sun Yang actually swims anything close to 7:32 I have no doubt it would be the swim of the meet, by far.
Thats a pretty good point about Hackett's 2001 800m swim. Although it still puts him in the 835-837 range which is still mighty impressive. If Sun ever decides to start putting more focus in shorter distances, which I bet he will in a few years (its already started with him putting focus on the 400), I dont think the 800WR is out of shot.
I think the best venue for Sun Yang to break Zhang lin's WR would be the asian games.
In the asian games, he doesn't need to swim fast in all prelims, hence saving him much energy. The drawback is there would be no one to push him, but another advantage is that he can swim according to plan without having to worry much about competition.
That's how Perkins broke the 800-1,500 WR in 1994 victoria commonwealth games, and yet failed to replicate it in Rome a month later after breaking the 400 WR.
Tom,
I wonder why you have not changed "Matsuda" to "Wu Peng" in your comment for 200 fly. Matsuda didn't beat Phelps. Wu Peng did (twice) and so did D'arcy.
2 weeks to go & Lochte is still on 1.49s. Wow thats some drop needed to get to John26's 1.43.9.
Very interested to see how USA goes without their usual trials /nats hit out. They did well in melbourne although they were in friendly territory enjoying the pleasant weather summer & sporting the Fastskin Pro advantage.
Things could not be more different.Facing The Tiger cold.
yeah... I don't think Lochte will swim 1:43.9
What's his textile PB anyway? I think it's 1:45+
doubtful he'll drop 2 seconds in freestyle.
And if Lochte was really busting it in Florida in that 1:49 race, I think he is in big trouble.
News coming out from Australia about australian coached park and chinese swimmers sound like they are getting ready to break out.
Th eamericans did well in Melbourne also because their underwaters were so much better than the rest of the field, also it was mainly their men team with the greatest swimmer, the second most versatile swimmer, one of the greatest backstrokers, etc.
Their women team was not so much. I think Libby Trickett won either more golds or at least equal to all golds won by the american women.
I'm not that worried about Lochte. His 200IM today was equally as hohum (by his standards). I think he'll make it guys. I'd be slightly worried if his 200m free was 149 and his 200IM was 157 or something. But both events look ready for an equal sized (about 5 second drop).
The thing about the IM is that its not just about improving your shape (Lochte was in extremely good shape last year), the only way he's going to improve majorly is by improving his strokes. As good as the media played Lochte to be last year, by the standards set by his competitors 145.30 is not THAT fast, if he wants to beat what an in shape Phelps (which might not come this year, but I believe Phelps' focus in this event this year) can give in the 200IM, he's going to want to beat push the 144 barrier. I think Lochte sees that and that's why I expect Lochte to make a similar drop in this event as Phelps did in 07.
We'll see how this pans out though. BTW in my mind, Phelps' main event this year is the 200IM, in the same way it was the 100fly in 09. He has put so much emphasis on the backstroke and breast lately (and only recently back on the fly and free, his stronger events).
Beisel's times (like her 214) is not earth shattering either.
John, I disagree. 1:49 in 200 free is actually worse than 1:59 in 200 IM.
On FINA's IPS point system, Lochte's 1:49.09 200 free is worth 931 points,
while his 1:59.13 200 IM is worth 957
Remember that 4 seconds on a 1:45 is different (or slower) than 4 seconds on a 1:55
Not to mentions that the competition in 200 IM is nowhere anywhere near the 200 free. Up to this point of the year, there are more than 50 guys swimming under 1:49, while they are only 7 (seven!) guys swimming under 1:59.
Either way, it does not look too good for Lochte in Free.
It seems his IM at this point is better than his free.
The encouraging news (or not?) is that all of his team mates (beisel, spofforth, etc) are also swimming very pedestrian times. Spofforth in 1:03 ??
Maybe they were instructed to pay more to attention to technique and racing skills instead of trying to swim fast?
But it does not make sense.
I agree with you re: Phelps focus. It seems Phelps was really stung by Lochte last year. I also think that Lochte's focus is also 200 Im and back, he knows he has greater chance to win in IMs and 200 back, as opposed in 200 free.
How do you guys think Cielo will do in Shanghai?
I don't know what his personality is like, but it'd be awfully tough for anyone to block out all that's going on, especially if people won't stop talking about it and looking at him funny in some cases.
Yikes.
Also, could Lochte possibly be burnt out maybe?
He had an incredible year last year, but I couldn't help but feeling that he was exerting too much energy in a wrong season.
I just kept wondering why he was peaking in 2010.
Hope I am dead wrong, because I want him to keep doing well now that he's finally out of the shadow of Phelps and Piersol.
I meant 149 in the free and 159 in the IM, for him, is probably the same level of performance (this is the type of swimming he's been doing all year long).
If Lochte want to legitimate himself to the title greatest swimmer in the world, I think he's going to have to put up a legitimate challenge for gold in the 200m free (in the same way Phelps did in the past). This might actually be his only chance to do it as Phelps may return to his peak form next year, with quickly improving youngsters Park, Sun, Agnel and Izotov (its really hard to imagine we barely factoring in a 143.9 in poly leggings) looming.
I dont think Lochte is going to burn out. I think the AMerican media is pretty knowledgable in picking dominant performers (I doubted Franklin, media did not). Also, you see viral videos of Lochte's workouts and his showing up to meets in colorful briefs just exudes confidence. I would be very surprised if Ryan did not medal in this event.
Now the following is a possible scenario for this summer:
Phelps wins 3 individual golds 200free, 100fly, 200fly
Lochte wins 3 ind. golds 200back, 200IM, 400IM
Sun Yang wins 3 ind. golds 400free, 800free, 1500free.
Who is the swimmer of the year?
My guess is that USA will have an ordinary championships..
John
Would 3 individual golds be worth more than breaking a WR? for example, if the guys mentioned achieve that but Lacourt wins the 50 & 100BK in WR times? or also inspires the French medley quartet to medley relay vicory over what was in the past an un-touchable team?
I think Lacourt is kind of being forgotten about in the Freestyle circus, the Backstroke is where the WRs look likely on the mens side.
But anyway, the answer to that question if Lacourt falls short is Sun Yang because of the amazing range of class, not even Hackett or Thorpe had a range like Sun, 1.44 200FR & 14.35 1500FR is quite other-worldly!
Also on Lochte and the Florida crew, Beisel has swum very well on Freestyle but not Back similar to Spofforth, i would not worry, Gemma was similar in 2009, she swam well a Nats and that was all, the Gators will time their peaks perfectly as they always do!
Jack, I think you have already forgotten the times that Hackett and Thorpe swam 10 years ago.
Sun PBs are: 1:45, 3:41.8, 7:44.12 (all of which he swam last april, but he couldn't sustain in fall off in the 1,500 where he swam 14:42) and 14:35
Of course eventually he will be faster than Hackett and Thorpe from 200-1,500 but that is natural progression from 10 years ago.
Here's Hackett times: 1:45, 3:42, 7:38, 14:34
Hackett was faster in the longer distances but i don't expect this to last more than 3 weeks
As for Thorpe, Have you forgotten Fukuoka in 2001, where Thorpe swam 47.20 (relay anchor), 1:44.0, 3:40, and 7:39?
THAT is other worldly range.
Thorpe is also the only male swimmer ever to have won medals in three freestyle events in one olympics.
In Montreal 2005, Hackett also won 400-800 (WR) and 1,500 with silver in 200 (behind Phelps).
THAT is other worldly range. Sun Yang will not swim the 200 as he is focusing on 400-800-1500
It is quite fitting that Sun Yang is the next distance king after Hackett (with Mellouli as the gap filler) as he is coached by Dennis Cotterel (Hackett's coach)
if sun yang wins the three golds, and even if he doesn't break WR but getting close to them, in my opinion he deserves to be the swimmer of the year.
In my opinion, wins and WRs in freestyle events worth more than in other strokes.
As John said, if you want to be legitemately considered greatest swimmer, you must win freestyle events.
Robin,
even if Lochte is burnt out, I'd rather he's burnt this year than next year.
I think Lochte will do fine in IM and back, but I can't see him on the podium in 200 free.
Also, Beisel swam PB in 200, but only 1:03 in 100 back. It is surprising to see results all over the place.
I dont think Lacourt would be the swimmer of the year unless none of the aforementioned swimmers break world records or win more than 2 individual medals-- the reason being the same as how last year even though he came closer than anyone to a WR other than Sun at the end of the year, his performances barely received a mention. I remember watching panpacs the 100mback waiting for commentary to mention the incredible performance across the Atlantic, but it never came.
Also, I think because of the serial position effect, people (not just those who give the awards) will remember the first world record and the last one to be set this summer. And we all know who is set up for both of these honors...
I think part of the prestigious of middle distance freestyle = greatest swimmer all started with Thorpe. His dominance once made him a contender for the great of all time, and Phelps understood that to dethrone him he had to take down his 200m WR. I think everyone, since has really caught onto this trend.
Well, Thorpe factor had a small part, most importantly though:
freestyle is the oldest (and the fastest) swimming events at the olympics. And there were three free events (100, 400 and 1500) as opposed to one for breast and back, with butterfly came much later. So it is easier to make comparisons of records, medals and champions for free events. And it was mostly 100 and 400 free (200 came later and 50 came much later). Murray Rose was considered greatest swimmer before Spitz because of his 100 and 400. And who can forget Duke Kahanamoku, among the greatest swimmers ever because of his crawls exploits? or Johnny Weissmuller? Who remember gold medallists in back or breast in 1924 paris? yeah no one does.
Secondly, freestyle has always attracted the best and fastest in swimming and the competition in freestyle events trump any other stroke events combined, so there's a lot of prestige in freestyle. When people say "fastest swimmer", they wouldn't think of kitajima or peirsol.
100 back donets?
Aswim -you are correct. I believe John 26 has only been following swimming since 08 & has the famous 'convert zeal'.
Re Sun . as I se it Sun has had the otherworldly benefit of being able to benefit from all of Hacketts work -every session ,race & split - plus the knowledge & research provided to Cotterill by the Australian Taxpayer Funded bodies For Cotterill personal knowledge that is on the back of every former swimmer including those sent to the swim knackery.
Plus Sun as the advantage of being invited to participate in an open society in a facility paid for & maintained by local council on local property rates.
I don't see any similar offers for gymnastics or diving or badminton to Australian athletes .
In short Sun is just extremely fortunate.
Unfortunately for Sun he carries the Chinese sports stigmata.
Further re Hacket. He had pretty ordinary turns . There are only 24 hours in the day & grant finished school on time & completed a university degree & was always busy on proffessional stuff not just a professional swimmer.
Of course the multi tasking helps him now with as business success plus twin toddlers!
Lets look at the big pic. Swimming is just swimming
Anonymous, it wasn't john26 who said Thorpe and Hackett didn't have the same range as Sun, it was Jack. John26 is actually very very knowledgeable about swimming.
About your other point, yeah australian coaches have been successful (or too successful? lol) in training Sun Yang, Park Tae Hwan, Liu Zige, Ellen Gandy, Therese Alshammar, etc.
In fact, australian-trained swimmers in total might win more golds than any other countries.
Yeah, I remember about Hackett's turns. Maybe that's why Sun yang also does not have decent turns?
Donets is an amazing backstroker in SCM, almost untouchable, but he is seemingly not able to translate it to LCM.
More stats for Jack,
By the time he was 18 (younger than Sun Yang who is already 19), Ian Thorpe had broken WRs in 200, 400 and 800 SEVERAL TIMES and was the world's third fastest in 100.
Ian Thorpe was also an elite 100 backstroker (won silver in 2002 Commonwealth Games) and 200 IMer (won silver in 2003 Worlds behind Phelps)
How is THAT for RANGE and otherworldly?
By the time he was almost turning 19 (younger than Sun Yang who is now 19 and 6 months), Hackett broke the 200 WR, and was fastest in the world by far in 800 and 1,500, and second fastest to thorpe in 400.
So, Hackett broke WRs in 200, 800 and 1,500 (400 was obviously Thorpe's domain and he was consistently second to Thorpe).
And those stats do not even include their SCM stats which are equally impressive.
Now, at 19 years and 6 months, let's see what Sun Yang has done:
LCM WR = 0
SCM WR = 0
LCM World championships = 1 bronze (1,500 in Rome)
Thorpe and Hackett's WRs were from 10 years, they should be broken by someone who aspire to be put in the same sentence as they are, and need to break them by a few seconds.
And I am not even talking rubber WRs, but textile records (1:43.86, 3:40.07, 7:38, 14:34). I'll be disappointed if Sun does not swim 1:43.00, 3:38, 7:35, 14:32.
Having presented Thorpe/Hackett's stats, I have no doubt that Sun Yang is a great talent and have a great coach and will do really great and break Thorpe/Hackett's WRs, but to say that Thorpe and Hackett did not have the same range as Sun Yang is clearly an ignorance at best.
Long live Thorpe, the king.
How easily people forget ay Jack.
aswimfan, the times you expect from Sun Yang, are those the times you want to see him get to in his career or in Shanghai? I think 1:43.0 is ambitious for anyone this year, not just Sun Yang.
I think Jack's come in for a bit of (unfair) stick here. The point didn't appear to be that Sun Yang was the greatest ever, or better than Thorpe or Hackett, it was just stating a fact that neither of those guys managed to swim 1:44.99 and 14:35.43. Clearly both men were ahead of their time and had careers that dwarf the achievements of Sun Yang so far.
If we are talking range, look no further than Phelps. Had he focused on the events, I think we could have been looking at WRs in the 100 OR 400 Free as well as the 100 & 200 Back.
Tom,
This is what Jack wrote verbatim "not even Hackett or Thorpe had a range like Sun,"
That's what I disputed.
Now, Hackett didn't swim 1:44.99, but in his days, he swam 1:45.8, which would be worth around 1:44.+ in today's scale.
And even if we go by what you are saying, Sun Yang has not managed 1:45.8 and 14:34 either. And remember that those times were swum 10 years ago.
Apparently someone has forgotten how incredible Thorpe's range was.
To give an idea, here's I propose an analogy in today's swimmers and standards:
1. Who is the third fastest 100 free currently?
Say it's Nathan Adrian, now, how would you say if Nathan Adrian in Shanghai swim 48.0, 1:43.0, 3:38.0, and 7:35.0
Because those are relative times Thorpe were swimming in 2001 Fukuoka, in one single championships.
2. Or let's say we ask Park Tae Hwan to swim 100-200-400-800, would it be possible to expect him to swim them in 48.0, 1:43.0, 3:38.0, 7:35.0?
3. In the women's equivalent, that would be like asking Pellegrini or Adlington to swim 53.50, 1:54.00, 4:00.0, and 8:14.00
possible?
I hope mr. Jack now has some idea about the range that Thorpe swam.
Also, No one mentioned anything about Phelps, I was only disputing Jack's statement that Thorpe and Hackett didn't have the range of Sun Yang, which is very absurd in itself, because Sun Yang's training and race programs fully use Hackett's as the blueprint, thanks to Dennis Cotterel.
A footnote about Phelps:
Phelps did try to focus on 400 in 2005. results not good.
He also tried the 100 free various times between 2006-2008. Didnt get the results he'd expected.
60 1:44.06 Ian Thorpe 25 July 2001
61 1:43.86 Michael Phelps 27 March 2007
These are WR progressions in the 200m free. Just to show how ahead of his time, Thorpe was. In reality, 1.43.0 shouldnt be ambitous.
Ian Thorpe
2001 Fukuoka – Men's Swimming
Gold 800 m freestyle 7 min 39.16 s (WR)
Gold 400 m freestyle 3 min 40.17 s (WR)
Gold 200 m freestyle 1 min 44.06 s (WR)
Gold 4 × 200 m freestyle relay 7 min 04.66 s (WR)
Gold 4 × 100 m medley relay 3 min 35.35 s
Gold 4 × 100 m freestyle relay 3 min 14.10 s
4th leg - 47.8 s
This set of times can be viewed as the exception or benchmark, either way I am confident no one will come close to the range or level in future.
I think something interesting most people havent really paid attention to is the 60minutes interview Phelps did with Anerson Cooper right after his 8 gold haul. In the interview Phelps and Bowman showed his interviewer his goals sheet for 2008. On the list included a time for every event he could possibly swim including events he didnt tackle like the backstrokes. The time sheet listed a 339.0 in the 400m freestyle.
Now if Phelps was confident enough to list that on his goal sheet at the beginning of the year, what do you think he could've swam? I dont think 346 in 05' was anywhere close to what he could've swam. Afterall his shape in 05' was probably similar to 09 (or even last year). My guess is that he must've been 343 or 342 shape at the very least in 07 to put that down on the list.
Even though Sun Yang is the same age as Thorpe was in his prime, I dont think it diminishes him in anyway as a swimmer. Sun Yang simply reached this level of physical and mental maturity at a much later age. Sun Yang is kind of like a Thorpe from 1999, just about to break onto the major scene for the first time in a big way.
I think why Thorpe retired so young is because he reached that mental maturity to face the media at such a young age and thus reached a breaking point at a young age too. I feel like this has been a pattern with a few other Aussie swimmers.
Because of this just because Sun is hitting Thorpe's strides at 3 years older in age doesn't make him any less of a swimmer. I guess we'd have to wait for Rio to assess how he stacks up in the grand scheme of things.
Sun is definitely stepping on the shoulders of Grant and Ian, but a wise man once said that the heights by great men achieved was attained by standing the shoulder of giants.
I wish we could see the rest of that list! Is there anywhere you can?
10:47 ish
This took forever to find because I'm in China and they dont like it when people break through their firewall.
Anyways what I can see:
100free- hard to see but it looks like a 47.50
200free- hard to see but it looks like 143.3
400free- 339.0
1500free 1505-1510
100fly 49.5
200fly 151.1
100back- 53.0
200back- 153.5
200IM- 153.5
400IM- blocked by hand, but would've been interesting to see
I'm picking Alexander Dale Oen for the 100 breast. He just went 59.9 with a beard, and he is typically not that fast in season.
Dale Oen is a good pick for 100 breast.
Thanks for this John. Fascinating insight into the Phelps/Bowman relationship. Seeing Bowman setting challenges like that, its easy to see how his relationship with Phelps works (worked) so well.
If I had to guess the 400 IM prediction I would say it was right around the 4:03.8 he did acheive. Possibly a shade quicker.
I love seeing the 400 Free and 1500 Free predictions. Such a tantalising 'what if' scenario. Unfortunately with the focus shifting to 100s and 200s we're unlikely to ever see that 400 Free come to fruition... Guess we'll just have to wait for Sun Yang and/or Park to get us under the 3:40 barrier.
Here is how my medals table would look on the men's side:
USA - 8 Gold - 4 Silver - 4 Bronze - 16 Total
FRA - 3 Gold - 2 Silver - 1 Bronze - 6 Total
CHN - 3 Gold - 0 Silver - 1 Bronze - 4 Total
JAP - 2 Gold - 4 Silver - 2 Bronze - 8 Total
BRA - 2 Gold - 2 Silver - 0 Bronze - 4 Total
KOR - 1 Gold - 1 Silver - 0 Bronze - 2 Total
RSA - 1 Gold - 1 Silver - 0 Bronze - 2 Total
TUN - 0 Gold - 2 Silver - 0 Bronze - 2 Total
GBR - 0 Gold - 1 Silver - 1 Bronze - 2 Total
RUS - 0 Gold - 1 Silver - 0 Bronze - 1 Total
SRB - 0 Gold - 1 Silver - 0 Bronze - 1 Total
NOR - 0 Gold - 1 Silver - 0 Bronze - 1 Total
HUN - 0 Gold - 0 Silver - 4 Bronze - 4 Total
AUS - 0 Gold - 0 Silver - 3 Bronze - 3 Total
CAN - 0 Gold - 0 Silver - 2 Bronze - 2 Total
ITA - 0 Gold - 0 Silver - 1 Bronze - 1 Total
GER - 0 Gold - 0 Silver - 1 Bronze - 1 Total
I want to see this thing break 100 comments!!!!!! Come on all, keep chatting!
Only 3 bronzes for Australian men? I think that is a record low for the aussie men in the past 2 decades.
If Thorpe focused on 1,500 and then later on 100, I think he would have broken the WRs in those distances. And then he would have been the second person to have broken all WRs from 100 to 1,500 after Shane Gould.
I am actually excited to hear that Thorpe is now focusing only on 100-200 in his training with Gennady Tourestky. I can't wait to see how it goes for him.
I don't think he had realized his potential in the 100. He consistently swam 47. low in relays from 2001-2004, but only swam 48.5 individually (Athens).
I think by London he could be sub 47. high
Strange how everybody is convinced Lochte will winn 200 IM.
not me. I think Phelps will win the 200 IM, and Lochte winning 400 IM, although he will have really stiff competition from Tyler Clary, which I think will step up big time in Shanghai.
So Magnussen has pneumonia? That's just unfortunate.
He is my dark horse in 100 free, and I hope he can still compete to the fullest.
Bet the young Aussie men are itching to prove something to Thorpe.
I guess I haven't seen too many pick AUS in 400 free relay for the podium, but how much would his illness be a factor?
I guess we need to see how serious it is. That sounds odd with suspected pneumonia, but his coach seemed to think there was a chance he'd be ready for Shanghai.
The Aussies have good strength in depth, but if he's not on top form it might just be enough to scupper their medal chances. USA, France, (Brazil) and Russia all have a guy (or two... or three!) that can crush a high 47, low 48. Aus would probably need Eamon Sullivan to step in and be that guy in Magnussen's absence.
OMG! GB would get 2 male medals! haha that IS a first.
AUS was my pick to win 400 FR bronze. With Magnussen ill, I might have to replace AUS with RUS
But let's see how it goes in the next couple of weeks
No idea about Sullivan in swimming . However he is opening up an expresso bar in Perth. I wanna go sample his chocolate dessert zoompaloopa he won Celebrity Masterchef with.
I hope he is Maitre de coz he is very agreeable looking .& that he wears (short ) shorts so we can see those nice slim legs.
That Stef Rice is one picky girl.
To help reach the 100 I would like to inform you that Eamon has a new companion -seen siting with him in various cafe haunts around tow.
Its a He & its a cute French Pug!
Of course the heading in the newspaper was "Its puppy love for Eamon "
Im waiting to see if he has replaced Stef in those underwear ads..
Well, Steph Rice has traded up, no?
Isn't Quade Cooper an improvement? maybe richer and has bigger pecs and forearms? and not bad looking either?
But can Quade cook? ;)
Don't know who Quade Cooper is (a rugby player, is that right???), but I think Sullivan is one handsome dude.
And a cook to boot!
I have a question though.
Is Sullivan a "suit swimmer"?
All the bad injuries aside, he hasn't been impressive at all since the ban.
Is it just the injuries, or did the suit have too big an impact on him?
Austalia s very appreciatve of Eamon. We realise he is a fragile sprinter but highly talented. Ditto Cate Campbell.
These sorts of sprinters are rare & valued. They are thoroughbreds not workhorses.
We can wait.
Sullivan is definitely not a "suit" swimmer.
He is naturally talented. As a 18 yo, he already swam in the 400 FR final in Athens, the third changeover. He already swam 22.00 in 2006,
and Have you forgotten that he won bronze behind double gold Hayden and Magnini in 2007 Melbourne in 48.4, ahead of the fourth place, Cielo?
He was also fifth in 50 free in 22.05
2008 was the first year when Sullivan completed almost ideal training, with a little bit of injury in feb or march.
In 2009, Sullivan was busy cooking and did little training, and I don't think he's actually been back to the sort of training he did in 2007-2008.
Also, the rubber suit couldn't have helped Sullivan who is small for sprinters as much as the helped the bigger guys such as Bernard, as we know the suits provided buoyancy and compression effects.
Did you see Hannah Miley got as much advantage from the suit as Hosszu for example?
Yeah, like Campbell, Sullivan needs very fine tuning and heavy work out actually put too much stress on their bodies. Campbell was diagnosed with overtraining. I hope they will be back to their best by London.
This may be my underlying patriotism coming through but Fran Halsall's dog () is clearly cuter than Eamon Sullivan's dog.
And Sullivan is still young, he's still 25, and for a sprinter, he's still got few years left in him. The question is if he still wants it now that he's got other burgeoning interests outside swimming.
I hope he does, though. I want to see Australian 400 FR next year in London with this composition:
1. Eamon Sullivan
2. Michael Klim/Matt Targett
3. James Sullivan
4. Ian Thorpe
Ashley Callus is still going strong, so they just need 38 year old Chris Fydler to comeback and they'd have a proven Olympic winning team... albeit from 11 years ago...
LOL, that's so true Tom!
With all the talk about australian men sprint depth, they can always rely on the oldies for some olympics lesson!
Few more to go. 100!!!!!!!!
Thanks for the insight on Sullivan, guys.
And yes I did forget that he won the bronze at Melbourne.
I have extra affinity for small guys and gals in the world of sports.
The fact that he appeared far removed from his WR setting days these few years made me anxious, but from what I've just read here, I better be more patient and stay hopeful!
Yes, let's break 100!!!
If you are looking for 'small ' & fast take notice of Kenneth To. I used to see him at as a 12 year old at school comps & he would put many many metrs on the other kids just at the start. He is not as tall nor weighs as much as most of the ladies but he is super fast off the walls I think he is about 49.5 100 & good speed on all strokes.He has a very heavy university attendance requirements (I know others doing the course ) & is delightful to watch.
l
Thanks for the tip!
I've heard of him a little bit, but didn't know he was "small."
:D
Of course, I don't go around looking for smaller athletes just to have someone to root on.
It's usually when they make it to the top, I have more appreciation for their abilities because of their smaller stature and end up rooting for them vs. all the 2m tall giants.
Well, I guess Sullivan is not exactly "small." Just skinny, right??
Anyway, I'll be rooting hard for all of them in Shanghai.
For a male sprinter, Kenneth To is extremely small, he is only 170 cm and 68 kgs.
Yes, Sullivan is not exactly small, but he looked small when standing on the blocks next to the likes of bernard, cielo, adrian, etc.
He is 189 cms and has small frames.
Yeah, Sullivan looks small, but not really, I guess.
And To would be small for a female swimmer.
He still made the team?
That's amazing!
I'll definitely follow his progress in Shanghai and beyond.
100... :D
I have a legitimate question though, Mr. Willdridge.
Who are the three swimmers featured in the photo on this home page?
I assume they are men.... right?
I've always wondered.
Woohoo congrats on making the 100th comment! :)
about the photo:
Let's attempt some detective work:
- Through the water, it is clear that the roof is the WaterCube, Beijing, so that means it was taken in 2008 Olympics
- From the first stroke, that is clearly freestyle. So it's a mens freestyle event
- From the swimmer in the middle, he is wearing the yellow australian swimming cap, and he is clearly smaller than the other two next to him but he is clearly already further than the other two, so we can safely assume it's Eamon Sullivan.
Therefore, it is either the 400 FR final (where Sullivan was the first leg), or 100 free semis or final (where he was in the middle lane in both).
aswimfan, that is a shrewd observation.
I kind of figured that it was an Aussie guy in the middle (although I thought there was a chance that these were women. With 6' ladies everywhere around the pool, you never know!).
Looked too small to be Hackett, that's how far I got.
What a great timing that Sullivan was already the topic of our discussions. LOL
Well done on getting Sullivan.
It is the 100m Free final. You have Pieter van den Hoogenband on the left (lane 3), Sullivan in the middle (lane 4) and Alain Bernard on the right (lane 50).
For anyone itching to know who owns the legs on the left... they belong to Stefan Nystrand.
yknow I always just assumed it was Trickett.
Also aus was in lane 3 in the 4x1fr relay.
Sullivan had hayden to his left (bald head) and hoogy to his right- so that cant be it either
could be the final where he had bernard to the left and hoogy to the right.
Well worth watching all these videos just to get some blood pumping a week before :D
I should have followed my first gut instinct: It could not have been 400FR as Australia was not in the middle lane.
And I'd already forgotten who was next to Sullivan in semis. I knew that Bernard was in the first semi.
Speaking about the olympics clips, does anyone know where I can watch *FULL* races?
the ones on the youtube by the official olympics are so horrendous; they only showed the first few seconds of the races and the last. And especially so in longer races and relays (where they only mostly show the changeovers!!).
Youtube has weeded "unofficial" clips uploaded by fans etc. I don't mind if they only show the official ones, as long as they are not crap like what they are now.
i downloaded a bunch from here. British commentary. its pretty safe
Excellent! Thanks much, John!!

Active IngredientsBell.1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to connector devices that have communication receptacles mounted therein. In particular, the present invention relates to communication receptacles that are flush mounted on a surface such as a wall.
2. Description of the Prior Art
Communication receptacles, such as the one shown in the Hughes et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,221,458, are installed in walls or on panel boards of various communication equipment to be used as connectors in a communication system. The receptacle has a housing which is placed within a cavity in the wall surface and a plug receiving end which is positioned proximate the plane of the wall surface. The receptacle is typically positioned in at least two known methods.
In the first method, the receptacle snaps into grooves or the like located on the edge of the cavity, as shown in the Hughes et al patent. This method required the edge of the cavity to fit precisely around the housing of the receptacle to cover the opening of the cavity and hold the receptacle.
In the second method, the receptacle is fixed to a flat metal framework that extends across the cavity. The metal framework is typically attached to an electrical box in the cavity. The metal framework has holes which are aligned with threaded holes in the electrical box. The framework is then attached to the electrical box by screws extending through the holes in the metal framework and threadably engaging the threaded holes in the electrical box. The receptacle is generally attached to the metal framework by a snap connection. A cover plate with a receptacle opening is attached to the metal framework with screws. The plug receiving end of the receptacle extends through the opening and the cover plate hides the cavity from view. The second method has the disadvantage of three separate components that need to be aligned and attached to each other to install the receptacle.
Terminals are sometimes included on the rear side of the receptacle for conductively connecting the receptacle to wires which are conductively connected to the communication system. Since the receptacle is typically small, only a limited number of terminal posts, generally four, can possibly be included on the back of the receptacle, limiting the number of conductive connections to the receptacle. In other situations, the receptacle has no terminals, but has electrical wires running from the back of the receptacle that are sufficiently long enough to be conductively connected to a central terminal board in the communication system. The wires extending from the receptacle must be of sufficient length to reach the central terminal board. Thus, the receptacle has to have wires of sufficient length to fit most applications or its application is limited.
The present invention includes a connector device for use in a communication system that mounts on a surface, such as a wall, for receiving an electrical communication plug. The device includes a cover plate having at least one opening therethrough and a periphery on a rear side which abuts the wall. Screws are used to mount the cover plate to the wall. At least one receptacle housing is attached adjacent to the rear side of the cover plate. The receptacle is found in an insulated housing with a plug receiving end that is aligned for cooperation with the opening of the cover plate and a rearward end which extends into a cavity within the wall. The receptacle has a plurality of spaced apart spring-type contacts for conductive contact with corresponding electrical connectors in the plug. A plurality of wires extend from the rearward end of the receptacle. A terminal board is positioned on the rear side of the cover plate and is spaced from the cover plate by a plurality of supports. The terminal board has a plurality of terminals for connection with the wires of the receptacle and with wires of the communications system.
The connector device permits mounting of the communication receptacle in an easy and efficient manner by simply positioning the cover plate over a cavity and attaching the cover plate to the surface of the wall near the cavity or to an electrical box in the cavity. In addition the plurality of conductive terminals permit simple and readily accessible conductive connection between a communication system and a receptacle having a large number of communication lines.
FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the connector device of the present invention having one receptacle;
FIG. 2 is an exploded perspective view showing the rearward side of the connector device of FIG. 1;
FIG. 3 is a perspective view of the terminal board of FIG. 2 showing the supports;
FIG. 4 is a perspective view of another embodiment of the present invention having two receptacles;
FIG. 5 is a rear elevational view of the connector device in FIG. 4; and
FIG. 6 is an exploded perspective view of the rearward side of the connector device shown in FIGS. 4 and 5.
FIGS. 1-3 illustrate one preferred embodiment of a connector device of the present invention, generally indicated at 10. The device 10 includes a cover plate 12, at least one receptacle 14, and a terminal board 18. The connector device 10 is used as a connector in a communication system providing conductive connection to communication lines within a wall, panel board or communication equipment. The communication equipment includes vocal communication equipment such as telephones and telephone answering machines and includes machine to machine communication equipment, such as computer to computer communication.
The connector device 10 is mounted flush against an outer surface 16. The outer surface 16 is part of a conventional wall, or a wall of a panel board or, communication equipment. The connector device receives at least one electrical communication plug (not shown) and conductively connects the plug with the communication lines. The electrical communication plug (not shown) is a conventional electrical communication plug that is conductively connected to and is used to connect communication equipment, such as the equipment described above. A typical example of the plug contemplated is shown in the Hughes Patent et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,221,458.
More specifically, the cover plate 12 has a front side 20 and a rear side 22. The rear side 22 has a peripheral flange 24. The front side 20 faces outwardly, covering a cavity 23 (usually an electrical box) from view and has a generally attractive appearance. The cover plate 12 has an opening 26 having a configuration conforming to the contour of the plug used. Preferably, a plurality of screw apertures 28 extend through the cover plate 12. Screws 29 extend through the apertures 28 and threadably engage corresponding threaded holes (not shown). The threaded holes (not shown) are located either in the surface 16 or in an electrical box (not shown) beneath the surface in the cavity 23 holding the cover plate 12 flush against the outer surface 16.
The receptacle 14 is positioned on the rear side 22 of the cover plate 12 and is preferably attached to the rear side 22. The receptacle 14 is a conventional communication receptacle and a typical example is described in the Hughes et al patent. An insulated housing 30 has a plug receiving end 32, defining an interior cavity with a plurality of spring-type contacts 34 for conductive contact with corresponding conductive connectors in a mating plug. The plug receiving end 32 is aligned with the opening 26 of the cover plate 12 to allow the communication plug to be inserted into the plug receiving end. The plug receiving end 32 is also preferably aligned substantially in the same plane as the cover plate 12. A rearward end 36 of the housing 30 extends into the cavity 23 when the cover plate 12 is mounted flush against the surface 16. A plurality of wires 38 extend from the rearward end 36 of the receptacle 14 and are conductively connected within the receptacle to the spring-type contacts 34.
The terminal board 18 has a base 19 and is preferably attached to the rear side 22 and has a plurality of terminal screws 40, 41 located on backside 43. Other types of terminals are also within the scope of the present invention. The terminal board 18 is preferably attached by the terminal screws 40 to posts 44 on the rear side of 22. The terminal screws 40 extend through apertures 42 in the base 19 and threadably engage threaded holes 56 in the posts 44. However, terminal board 18 can be attached to the cover plate 12 by any conventional method. The terminal screws 40, 41, are made of a conventional conductive material.
The terminal screws 41 threadably engage a plurality of threaded holes 46, each located in a spacer post 48. The spacer posts 48 are positioned on a front side 50 of the base 19 of board 18 which faces the rear side 22 of the cover plate 12. The spacer posts 48 space the terminal board 18 from the rear side 22 such that the front side 50 is supported by the posts 48 spaced from the rear side 22. The spacer posts 48 allow sufficient mounting space for the receptacle 14. An opening 52 in the base 19 is positioned to allow the wires 38 to extend therethrough for conductive connection to the terminal screws 40, 41 on the back side 43.
The apertures 42 extend through the base 19 into the posts 54 and have a larger diameter in the posts 54 than in the base 19 so the posts 54 slip over the posts 44 and the screws 40 threadably engaging the aperture 56 in the posts 44 to hold the terminal board in place.
Each wire 38 is preferably conductively connected to an electrical connector 60. The wires 38 extend through the aperture 52 in the base 19 and are fastened to the terminal screws 40. 41. Communication wires (not shown) connected to the communication system (not shown) are conductively connected to the terminal screws 40, 41, conductively connecting the communication system. A location 61 for a resistor if needed is included preferably on the back side 43 between the terminal screws 40.
Another embodiment of the present invention generally indicated at 62 is shown in FIGS. 4-6. The embodiment 62 is similar to the one shown in FIGS. 1-3 and has two plug receptacles 64, 66 with a terminal board 68 fastened to the receptacle 66. As seen from the figures, the device of the present invention also includes a plurality of receptacles attached to a cover plate 70.
In more specific detail, the cover plate 70 has openings 72, 74 both having a configuration conforming to the contour of a particular communication plug (not shown) which is conductively connected to a piece of communication equipment. Each receptacle 64, 66 is aligned in the same manner as the receptacle 14 with the corresponding opening 72, 74. The cover plate 70 also preferably has a plurality of apertures 76 through which a plurality of screws 83 are inserted for fastening the cover plate 70 to a surface 78 of a wall or to an electrical box (not shown). The cover plate 70 adjacently abuts against the surface 78. The cover plate 70 has an outer periphery 80 on a rear side 82 which adjacently abuts the wall 78 when the cover plate is mounted flush by the screws 83 against the surface 78 as previously described.
The receptacle 66 has a plug receiving end 84 for receiving the corresponding communication plug (not shown). The receptacle 66 is attached to the rear side 82 of the face plate 70 such that the plug receiving end 84 is aligned with the opening 74 in the face plate 70. Likewise, the receptacle 64 has a plug receiving end 86 for receiving the corresponding communication plug (not shown) and is aligned with an opening 74 permitting the receptacle 64 to receive the communication plug (not shown).
The receptacles 64, 66 are similar to the receptacle 14 previously discussed above. The receptacle 64 includes a housing and has a plurality of conductive wires 88, each wire 88 being conductively connected to an electrical connector 90 at a free end and being conductively connected at the other end within the receptacle 64 to spring-type contacts (not shown) which engage the communication plug (not shown) when inserted into the plug receiving end 86. The receptacle 66 also includes a housing and has a plurality of wires 92 with their free ends being conductively connected to electrical connectors 94, and the other ends, similarly being connected to spring-type contacts (not shown) within the receptacle 66. Receptacle 66 further preferably includes a plurality of terminal screws 96 which act as conductive terminals.
The terminal board 68 has a plurality of spacer posts 98 on a base 99 for spatially separating and supporting the terminal board 68 from the rear side 82 of the cover plate 70. The spacer posts also preferably receive and threadably engage terminal screws 100 which serve as conductive terminals on a backside 102 of the base 99. A plurality of terminal screws 104 extend through a plurality of apertures 106 in the base 99 and extend into a plurality of threaded apertures 108 located in a rearward end of the receptacle 66. The terminal screws 104 threadably engage and retain the terminal board in position on the rear side 83 of the cover plate 70 by attaching the terminal board 68 to the rearward end of the receptacle housing. Alternatively, the terminal board 68 can be attached to any receptacle housing that is attached to the cover plate 70. A plurality of wires 88 conductively connected to the receptacle 64 extend through an aperture 110 in the base 99 and are conductively connected to the terminal screws 96, 100 or 104, acting as conductive terminals, as shown in FIG. 5. A plurality of wires (not shown) conductively connected to a communication system (not shown) are conductively connected to the terminal screws 96, 100, 104 to complete conductive connection of the connector device 62 to the communication system.
In use, the device of the present invention as illustrated in the Figures provides a plurality of terminals on a terminal board attached to the rear side of the face plate. The wires which are conductively connected to the communication system are simply attached to the terminals located on the back side of the base of the terminal board. The cover plate is then attached by screws to the surface of the wall or to the electrical box in a cavity and is positioned flush against the surface of the wall hiding the cavity that the receptacles are being simultaneously inserted into. The device of the present invention eliminates the need of separately attaching the receptacle and cover plate and aligning both with respect to each other during installation. More importantly, more complex type contacts which receive more complex communication plugs having a greater number of conductive connectors are easily accommodated by the connector device of the present invention. Such receptacles and communication plugs are of great value in complex phone systems and computer connections.
It should be understood that the above described embodiments are only illustrative of the quantity of the receptacles and the terminal boards that are within the scope of the present invention. The connector device of the present invention includes greater quantities of receptacles and terminal boards than illustrated in the Figures.
In addition, persons skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail with respect to the cover plate, receptacle, and terminal board without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.Client Success

3 Answers | Add Yours
Titanium is a silver grey metal with chemical symbol Ti. It is the ninth most abundant element in the world. However because it is very difficult to extract titanium from the ores, it is a very expensive metal. If it was possible to find a way to extract titanium in a inexpensive way, it has the potential of replacing both steel and aluminium as the primary material for construction of many products.
It is ductile
Density of Titanium is between aluminium and steel. Its density is about 56% of steel. It is stronger than aluminium and about as strong as steel. It also has better corrosion resistant properties than stainless steel. It is also a ductile. At the same time it has high hardness.
It is not a good conductor of electricity.
Titanium melts at temperature 1725 degrees centigrade. It boils at 3287 degrees centigrade.
Its atomic number is 22 and atomic weight is 47.88.
Titanium(symbol Ti) has an atomic number of 22, it is a silver gray colored, light material which has a density somewhere between that of stainless steel and aluminun. A relatively abundant material,titanium has a number of important properties: It is has an excellent strength to weight ratio which make it a superb choice for aircraft, is very resistant to corrosion especially to chemicals like chlorine and acid, has a very low density. Another important property is it's very high melting point 1,660°C. as well as a high melting point 3,287. Titainium importantly has a huge number of appications in many different fields ranging from medical, oil refining, steel and the aerospace industry.C. The metal combines with oxygen at red heat, and with chlorine at 550C.
Titanium metal is considered to be physiologically inert. When pure, titanium dioxide is relatively clear and has an extremely high index of refraction with an optical dispersion higher than diamond.
Titanium has a high melting point of 3135°F (1725°C). This melting point is approximately 400°F above the melting point of steel and approximately 2000°F above that of aluminum.

Great game. kept me busy
with the many many items and classes it offers a level of customability that other games rarely offer.
and for the people who talked about not seeing the updates,
he mentioned that he just implemetned them today (12/31/07) and that it will take a few days for admins to review the changes (Maybe longer, since it is the holidays.)
so sit tight and y ou wont be disappointed!
Right on! :D

excellent game... found some shortcuts :)
High praise! Excellent job.
for everyone complaining about the "once per day" rules, the game doesn't have individual timers for everyone to check if you've already done something in that day... that would be ridiculous, the game makes a time stamp based on the time YOUR computer has then compares it to the current time that your computer is showing (when you try to select a once per day activity). So if you want to redo something:
1. save your game
2. exit game
3. change the date in your computer's calendar
4. load your saved game
that's how I bought all the best equipment from zone 4 :P by fighting the one soldier who gives 2000 euro tablets as a prize :) [instead of those THREE idiots who are harder, take longer to beat and give a measly 600]
as for the bosses: i beat the game with an assassin, suppress is your friend -- abuse it like you should all friends! If at any time any boss uses any buffing move that raises his attack to ridiculous levels just use break. (which you should definitely have if an assassin).
To the author:
great game, great concept, but there are some flaws...
I don't know if this was a glitch or not but when I fought the paladin some random chick showed up on my team, 'amber', with absolutely no back story. :S
my other complaint is that this amber has an amazing ability called 'shadow blend' which raises her speed 500% which is excellent for an assassin, but despite the fact that i made sonny the same class he cant learn this ability, why?
also I'm assuming every one of the zone4 bosses has weaknesses.. can you give some hints for the doctor/medic boss? the one with 1,000,000 health points.
i can give hints for the other two, if anyone wants them:
baron: let the paladin do all the work, just keep yourself alive with suppress and whenever you get chance use moves that force the enemy to take more damage on subsequent attacks (ie wound, sunder). You are basically a damage sink here. The less damage you take the more time the medic can spend healing the paladin.
Paladin: gets much weaker after you defeat the baron, I cant see how anyone can have problems with him.
zone4boss1: this takes some luck... he heals at a rate of 1000pts/turn and can kill you in 2 moves using 'destiny', basically.,.. train amber and hope she decides to use shadow blend and a decent attack afterwards, if she does then the boss doesn't stand a chance. the problem is she usually doesn't.. which is why it would be helpful for sonny to learn shadow blend.
zone4boss2: this man has 320,000 health pts... no point in attacking the regular way, sometimes he will decide to use a buff that allows him to do huge damage to you on the next turn -- in return for taking huge damage -- as soon as you see him healing himself (this signals the start of the buff) use break, he will sustain massive damage and wont be able to move next turn. break needs to be ready at all times so do not use it for anything else. at all other times during this fight you should be using suppress to lower damage and allow the medic to focus on himself and your other fighter. Sunder is also good to lower the bosses' regular attacks.
zone4boss3: no clue... he has 1 000,000 health points and nothing special that allows you to kick his ass like boss. Any suggestion would be helpful...
Amber has that ability to make her more powerful, but I should've added it to the Assassin tree as well, I just thought about it too late. You are right, Assassins would be a lot more viable if they had it!
Good tips for the players! <3
To beat Doctor, he heals himself for 2,000,000 HP when he is EXACTLY OR BELOW 99% health. So you can figure that out I suppose? The timing is DEAD important.

Well done you!
Well done! They look excellent. My kids don't get to use a machine until they turn 8. Until then it's handstitching all the way! I love sewing kids clothes. They are so achievable! I used to sew almost everything my kids wore, until the quilting bug bit so hard. I do have an overlocker, but don't use it to finish off woven seams. Depending on the fabric (how much it frays) I just pink the seam edges. Very quick, easy and effective. And I think it looks good too. I always use the pinking shears on cord.Mel B

Green roofs are all the rage in Europe, and they're catching on in progressive cities such as Chicag...
Choosing the most appropriate environmentally responsible roofing material for your home may not be easy, but the benefits speak for themselves.
Conventional roofing materials tend to be failure-prone, and most find their way to a landfill within twenty years. Asphalt roofs encourage excessive storm water runoff that washes sediment and other contaminates into our water supply. In addition, roofs, buildings, and roads absorb tremendous amounts of solar energy and reradiate for hours afterward, creating a high-temperature phenomenon called the urban heat island effect, which alters weather patterns and speeds the chemical reaction that creates ozone, the primary component of smog.
Vegetative coverings, known as green or living roofs, can naturally address several major environmental issues—energy/resource conservation, storm water management, climate change, and smog—without taking up even an extra square foot of space.
In Europe, green roofs have been successfully used on homes, office buildings, and parking garages for more than thirty years (more than 10 million square feet of green roofs are installed in Germany each year). Now, several U.S. cities including Seattle, Chicago, and Philadelphia are evaluating the costs and performance of green roof systems for large buildings, and local grassroots groups such as the Northwest EcoBuilding Guild are also exploring ways to bring this technology to homeowners.
Green roofs do a lot more than just look good: The plants’ leaves catch dust, the roots filter water, the soil provides noise and heat insulation, and the entire roof provides a habitat for birds and insects. And that’s just the beginning. In urban areas, 75 percent of rainwater becomes surface runoff, and cities spend millions on sewer systems and treatment plants to address these periodic floods. Older cities that use combined systems for handling sewage and storm water cannot handle heavy rains; consequently, contaminates frequently overflow into nearby rivers. Green roofs offer an immediate solution. The soil and plant mats retain 75 percent of rainfall, and, even at full saturation, the soil and roots trap sediment from the runoff before releasing it. The retained moisture is released gradually, slowly introducing humidity that helps cool nearby areas.
Nonvegetated surfaces absorb incoming solar radiation and reradiate it as heat. During a typical ninety-five-degree day, for example, blacktopped surfaces can reach 175 degrees or higher. Temperatures in big cities average about 10 degrees higher than in neighboring areas. But computer models performed at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, California, suggest that increasing green space by 5 percent in a city such as Los Angeles would lower summer temperatures by four degrees, resulting in 10 percent less smog and an annual energy savings of $175 million. “Cooling a city could reduce smog more than almost every other pollution-fighting measure,” says Hashem Akbari, a researcher at the lab.
Individually, green roof temperatures rarely vary more than fifteen degrees over a typical day, which helps reduce—or eliminate—air conditioning costs. In Germany, a developer recently used a green roof for a single-story shopping mall. The six-inch-thick roof was sufficient to maintain comfortable indoor temperatures without air conditioning.
Green roofs can be divided into two categories: intensive and extensive. Intensive gardens, such as the one recently built on the roof of Chicago’s City Hall, are intended for human interaction. Composed of trees, shrubs, and manicured landscapes, intensive gardens require a minimum soil depth of one foot. Although attractive, intensive roofs add considerable weight (80 to 150 pounds per square foot) and require regular maintenance—just like a regular garden.
Extensive green roofs can also look attractive, but they are built primarily for their environmental benefits. Requiring two to five inches of soil, extensive roofs add only fifteen to fifty pounds per square foot and are more suitable for retrofitting onto existing roofs. Extensive roofs require very little maintenance; once the plantings are established, they require only periodic watering and annual fertilization.
Surprisingly, building a green roof isn’t that difficult. Although a few manufacturers have patented special materials, nearly all roofs are composed of a few basic elements: a waterproofing layer, a root-blocking membrane, a drainage system, a growing medium, and, of course, plants. One company even sells a leak detection system that sounds an alarm the instant water penetrates the membrane.
Most waterproofing layers are made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a rubber membrane, or asphalt. PVC isn’t as environmentally friendly as the others, but it offers the best protection against leaks and root penetrations because the seams are heat-sealed. Rubber membranes are a good alternative, though extra care must be taken when sealing seams with tapes or adhesives. Liquid asphalt can provide a seamless surface, but because it’s an organic compound and can become food for various organisms, it must be covered with a layer of polyethylene sheeting.
After laying the root-blocking membrane, the soil is applied. Several green roof companies offer lightweight growing mediums, but in most cases the topsoil left over from construction works fine. (You may need to add clay to improve water retention.) Although some extensive roofs can support a healthy plant community with a two-inch base, thinner soil layers place higher physical demands on your plants; green roof designers recommend at least three inches if you’re mixing the soil yourself.
Unlike asphalt shingles, which can be installed just about anywhere, plants are far more region specific. To help you make the right choices, check out the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Plant Hardiness Zone Map (). After you identify your zone, choose appropriately marked plants.
The American Horticultural Society has developed a Plant Heat Zone Map () that charts an area’s annual number of “heat days” (temperatures above 86 degrees.) Although all the plants typically used for green roofs have a certain resistance to the summer heat, if you live in a heat zone “hot spot,” you may want to investigate extra-hardy varieties.
Contrary to what you may think, most green roofs are not made of sod. “Grass is too maintenance intensive,” says David Beattie, an associate professor of ornamental horticulture at Pennsylvania State University. “It requires intensive irrigation and regular trims.” Instead, Beattie suggests succulents and other low-growing plants that are capable of storing water in fleshy leaves, bulbs, or roots. “Think alpine conditions,” says Beattie. “Plants that have a natural ability to survive in regions with shallow soil, little water, high winds, and intense sun are good candidates for green roofing.”
Initially, roofs may need to be fertilized and watered, perhaps once a week, to encourage the seedlings to grow. Within six months, extensive roofs can usually be left on their own. Don’t worry about having to drag the lawnmower up the ladder—green roofs don’t need cutting. Because thin soil layers do not support tall growth, vegetation spreads horizontally.
Green roof technology is simple, proven, and will save you money over time, but if you want to cash in on the green revolution right away, you’ll need to clear a few hurdles.
The right roof. Besides load restrictions, most conventional roof slopes are not ideal for roof gardens. According to green roof manufacturers, the ideal roof slope should be about five to twenty degrees, steep enough for the water to drain naturally, but not steep enough to lose soil or plants. Steep roofs—up to forty degrees—can be greened, but they require a special terracing system to hold the soil in place until the plants can form a self-supporting mat. Surprisingly, flat roofs aren’t recommended either because they allow puddling, which can eventually lead to leaks.
Code compliance. There are no U.S. building codes pertaining to green roof design or construction. In most cases, your inspector will ask you to have your project plans approved by a structural engineer to ensure that it can withstand the weight of the soil.
Seed money. Realistically, it costs $15 to $20 per square foot—two to three times the cost of a traditional roof—to install a complete green roof system. Manufacturers predict that bringing in German mass-greening techniques, such as pre-grown vegetation mats, could cut costs in half within a few years. However, green roof pioneer Tom Lipton, a storm water specialist in Portland, Oregon, successfully created a green roof atop his ten-by-eighteen-foot garage using readily available materials for about $80, or forty-four cents per square foot.
Yet even at the high end, green roofs can save you money. Besides controlling soaring summer temperatures and keeping the home cooler, the vegetative cover protects the waterproof membrane from temperature extremes and UV radiation, allowing it to last up to three times longer than a conventional roof.
Additionally, several areas offer financial incentives for green roof pioneers. Funding for green roofs may be obtained through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Water Act Section 3 grant program. Baltimore’s Critical Areas Program taxes areas of impervious surfaces in close proximity to the Inner Harbor and redistributes that money for projects that alleviate the runoff problem. Similarly, Portland, Oregon’s Clean River Incentive and Discount Program encourages commercial and residential property owners to try greenU.N. Security Council condemns N. Korea nuke test

Daniel Sudarsky earned the B.S. degree in physics and mathematics from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel, in 1981. In 1982, he moved to Purdue University, USA, and worked on his Ph.D. degree under Ephraim Fischbach on the Fifth Force. His work centred on the possible use of the neutral Kaon system in the search for new interactions. He then moved to University of Chicago, where as a Visiting Scientist under Robert Wald, he jumped into the wonderful world of general relativity and did some interesting work on the newly discovered colored black holes and closed an outstanding gap in the classical black hole uniqueness theorems. In collaboration with G. Matsas and A. Higushi, he found that ordinary QED Bremsstrahlung can be viewed in the rest frame of the accelerated charges as the interaction of those with Rindler photons. After a brief adventure in Dominican Republic, he moved to Mexico, where he joined the Institute of Nuclear Sciences of UNAM. Since then, his interests have slowly moved from classical aspects of gravitation and cosmology to the interface of gravitation and quantum theory, a subject he approaches while remaining sceptical about the most popular approaches towards a quantization of gravity itself. He has been interested in the possibility of quantum gravity phenomenology, with and without violation of Lorentz Invariance (LI).

I've shared before about the true VALUE in family meals. In our hurried and overstuffed schedules, we are unable to gather around the table EVERY night, but we treasure the handful of nights that we do!
Occasionally, I grab the chance to make a fun night centered around our family dinner with little surprises, learning lessons, exciting announcements, or a time of sharing together. If you would like to see the details of our traditional FAMILY SHOW N SHARE NIGHT, click here to see photos and read all the good details!
I used this winter cozy family dinner night as a time to teach. It was a kick off to a new educational series of money, investing, and personal finance for our kids! Personal Finance is a skill that our boys will be practicing every.single.day. of their adult lives. I've felt an intense responsibility, as their parent, to find a way to incorporate this teaching into our schedules.
As they ran down the stairs for dinner, they quickly noticed the mysterious kraft paper-wrapped-somethings in the center of the table, along with a stack of books. In the middle of our cups of water, Correlle dishes, S&P shakers, was a stack of FUN in the center of our table.

along with family time to learn
personal finance
I am so excited to start this financial curriculum with my boys! I have so much to learn as well and I can't wait to make positive changes in our life. There are a few curriculums available to use in teaching children about personal finance and simple economics. I chose Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace Jr. (again, this is not a sponsored post, I'm just sharing our pick!).
In the box...
We have a lesson plan to follow, a commission chore chart system, and budget envelopes for each of the boys.
I also bought Dave Ramsey's financial book series for kids. We kicked off our money lessons with a story on saving. These books teach all the basic and essential values of money in simple and entertaining style for kids.
We did a brief overview over dinner, introducing the kids to this new program.
We will also be incorporating Warren Buffet's program for kids, Secret Millionaires Club to learn investing AFTER we complete the personal finance program.
After the kickoff was complete and our plates cleared, I revealed the mystery underneath the kraft paper wrapped packages. We presented the boys with their own specially framed shares of stock.
We actually bought these shares for the boys when they were toddlers. However, I waited to give them out until now. I wanted them to have an introductory understanding of what investing was, what a share is, and what stock in a company means! Chris has taught the boys some of this through the years and I'll never forget the year Cameron (6 years old at the time), asked for stock in Wal Mart for Christmas!
After I finished showing the boys the Dave Ramsey finance curriculum, Chris talked to them again about shares, stocks, companies, and business. I was part of the eager audience! I have so much to learn. I've always LOVED listening to Chris teach. His voice is so soothing and he explains everything perfectly. (Kinda love that guy a lot) ;)
They were very excited to hang their shares in their rooms! These shares don't have a big financial value, they are simply ONE share. It's the concept that counts. They make super unique gifts too! You can visit OneShare.com to pick a stock of your choice, personalize it, and buy it.
When I chose a company to buy a share of stock in for each child, I tried to find something exciting for kids and fun. Again, I bought these stocks several years ago when the boys were just toddlers.
I also personalized each share at the bottom, tying in the theme of the company with my words. For Cameron, I chose stock in Disney because he was always so full of wonder.
Dakotah's nickname is Kotah Bear, and he has always been our cuddly boy so a bear themed company worked!
These framed shares of stock hang in each of their rooms, hopefully reminding them of how much they're loved, to always work for their dreams, and to be wise with their money.
One of my personal goals is to focus more on using wisdom with each dollar God has blessed us with. It's difficult to change habits, but I am full of hope and anticipation as I embark on new challenges. I want to learn right along beside my kids, so that I can be the best steward of our money and foster a spirit of gratitude for the age of abundance we all live in.
To see other blog posts I've shared in the archives on MONEY, click HERE and enjoy! =)
My favorite blog post on money was one of my very first blog posts called 5 at a Time. This is a unique and easy concept to start saving CASH.
Here are the rules:
1) Use cash for all purchases
2) Never keep a $5 bill
3) Put all $5 bills in a jar
(if you get handed a 5 dollar bill as your change, it goes in the 5 dollar jar. 5 dollar bills NEVER go back in your purse or wallet. You'll be so SURPRISED at how quickly you'll accumulate cash by using this simple method.
If you have any tips for us as we begin this new adventure as a family, pretty please let me know!

I love Dave Ramsey. Great to give your kids such a boost in life!!
Good job!
Such a great idea! I love the stocks, the personal-ization of the plaques. You are investing in you children in a wonderful way!
I wish we had the money to get our kids stocks, however I can still teach them about money!
Thanks for the idea!
What a wonderful way to spend family time! And not to mention the family memories (and valuable lessons for your boys)! So many great ideas...thanks for sharing!
This is great! It's never too soon to teach kids about money.
Love that you are teaching your boys about finances. It's such an important lesson...one all kids should learn.
Good for you! And Dave Ramsey has a lot of great, Biblical wisdom to share.
Chris is a fabulous teacher! Dad and I want to come too. :)
i always love this idea, and have thought about doing this for the boyfriend (though his stocks cost a lot per share) and for my niece. i love how you made this super personlaized and very special.
That is so exciting for your boys! I know my kids would be. It is a very wise thing for you to do. I think most people get out of high school and have no idea how to manage their finances. Even close family that are Christians have a hard time. Thanks for sharing these ideas! Hope to see you at True Aim.
Lisa this is fantastic!
I love that you framed the stocks!
Thanks for linking up! I featured your post in my wrap up have a great weekend!
lessons learned when they are young stay with them when they are older love that you are teaching them lessons of life I did mine as well
come see what I shared at
I love the $5 bill idea!
What great parents you are. Your boys are blessed.
What great parents you are. Your boys are blessed.

Regrettable Results — How could Cobb taxpayers be so stupid? Tim Lee forced a March 2011 SPLOST and insisted if we didn’t approve it that property taxes would go up. Well, less than two months later, our property taxes did go up — with a millage increase. Our taxes were increased twice in the same year!
Happy Camper — What a wonderful day to live in Cobb! I regret so few chose to exercise their right to vote. I am thrilled. Now we can get back to the serious work at hand. No, it won’t be easy, but morale in the county will improve considerably! Having the opponent threaten and/or try to intimidate other commissioners, staff, Lee supporters, etc. had resulted in an environment in which it is hard to be productive. Lee is a consensus builder and excellent manager. Get out of his way and let him work, now.
Old Man — To all you Byrne supporters — maybe your candidate lost because enough people remember how Bully tried to isolate Cobb and cost us a lot of money. And his East Cobb City proposal was just plain dumb. I’m no Lee supporter but when you have no choice, what can you do? Maybe next time someone good will run.
LeChat — Lee didn’t win because of yard signs, newspaper stickers, or wealthy backers ... or even because he was particularly good. He won because enough people realized Byrne was worse.
East Cobber — Thank God Bill Byrne was defeated. We had enough of him 10 years ago.
FuzzyLogic — @East Cobber. You may be right about Bill Byrne, but now we have to “gird our loins” and prepare for four years of Tim Lee and his cronies. No matter how you cut it Cobb was in a no win situation with these two as our only choices.
FantasyWorld — I sure hope that Lee doesn’t interpret this narrow victory as a mandate for him to continue his tax-and-spend policies for another four years. Even with overwhelming support from the big business special-interest groups … and running against an under funded and very flawed opponent, his margin of victory was quite slim. Hardly an overwhelming vote of confidence from the electorate that bothered to show up and cast their ballot.
What A Joke — What a sad four years this is going to be. I hope Tim Lee doesn’t look at this as a victory. Did he notice that half the people that did come out to vote, didn’t vote for him?
Kennesaw Resident — It was bound to happen. With 24% of GDP made up of money spent by the government and one-half of all Americans on the hook to the government for some portion of their income, a progressive Republican like Lee will be tough to get out of office.
Glorious Morning — I have waited for months for this day to arrive as I have read through the numerous comments that bashed, chastised, defamed and lied about Lee. For me, today will be an excellent day as I sit at work and revel in the fact that the Lee bashers with their made up negative catch phrases and petty school yard bullying will not only have lost but that it was also all in vain.
Do You Know Lee? — Glorious Morning: We are in MOURNING because we knew the Tim Lee from his community group. We know how back-stabbing, underhanded, cruel and cut-throat he is and will continue to be. You apparently only know him since he was elected. He is even more emboldened today and will continue to serve outside interests (CIDs, Cobb, everyone in attendance last night at his party) instead of Cobb taxpayers.

However, state Superintendent of Education John White told BESE that, under federal rules, some of those students who earn diplomas will not earn points for their schools under the state’s accountability system. Federal rules require students to be fully aligned with traditional academic standards for diploma purposes. Students with the most significant cognitive disabilities who do not earn all the required Carnegie units will not count, officials said. BESE on Wednesday approved rules changes to start implementing the law. However, the panel also directed the state Department of Education to come up with ways for those students who earn diplomas to benefit their schools and districts, which White backed. Shawn Fleming, deputy director of the Louisiana Developmental Disabilities Council, said keeping those special education graduates out of the accountability system would perpetuate a setup that already encourages schools to be selective. “Our current educational system is a competitive-based structure,” Fleming said in an interview after the meeting. “So schools that serve students that don’t count lose points or don’t get points perhaps,” he said. “There is no value placed on what students with the most significant needs are receiving.” The state has about 74,000 special education students. How many could benefit under the new rules is unclear. However, less than 1,000 may be excluded for accountability purposes even if they graduate. While the law won lopsided approval earlier this year in the Legislature, it continues to spark controversy in the special education community. Liz Gary, who lives in St. Tammany Parish, praised the law and said it stems from the state’s low graduation rate for students with disabilities. “It is clear our policies, not individuals, that were causing the problem,” she said. Rebecca Ellis, who also lives in St. Tammany Parish, told BESE that the overhaul showed politicians in the Legislature were listening, which she said they have not done in the past. But Rana Ottallah, of Metairie, referred to comments by federal officials that the state law may violate U. S. laws and could jeopardize Louisiana’s public school aid. Ottallah said $292 million in federal aid could be at risk. The advisory panels are called IEP teams because they come up with Individualized Education Programs for students. They are supposed to assemble alternative “rigorous” routes to graduation, devise instructional programs and offer novel ways of teaching. Ottallah said parents need assistance in deciding whether their child should pursue the new route. “This is too much hardship on parents,” she said. “It is too much power for the IEP team.” Follow Will Sentell on Twitter @WillSentell.

This was fine but not great. I will keep the "perfect pan roasted chicken thighs" recipe and the Cooks Illustrated Chicken in a Pot recipe as my go to. I think this needed more depth - leeks, shallots¿.something.

Has anyone been successful using skinless, boneless thighs??
This was very tasty. A little too much salt. I cooked it in the convection oven and it cooked a little quicker. Definitely would make it again.
Easy and delicious. I did drain a few tablespoons of fat off the pan after the initial cooking of the chicken. My chicken was not organic and had a good deal of fat on it. Otherwise, perfect.

This recipe was recommended to me by a friend. I make it with 1 small rutabaga, 1 small turnip, 1 red onion, and butternut squash instead of the potatoes and carrots and it has become a family favorite. I buy the butternut squash pre-cut into 1 inch squares and cut everything else about the same size. It is so simple and delicious. Everyone should give this one a try and, if you don't like carrots and potatoes, try other vegetables and it will still be great. I hear that purple potatoes, sweet potatoes, and cabbage also work well. I would not recommend trying brussell sprouts as those did not work for me.Supportive Child Care Subsidy Policy Statement
Number: P-EEC-Supportive-15
Individual Assessment and Child's Individualized Plan
Within 45 (calendar) days of enrollment in Supportive Child Care, the Supportive Child Care provider must complete an individual child assessment and child's individualized plan. The assessment must be based on information provided by the DCF social worker at the time of referral to Supportive Child Care, information gathered by the Supportive Child Care provider during the child's first weeks in care, and any other relevant information.
The assessment data must include, at minimum, information about the child's development and emotional adjustment and the Supportive Child Care provider's contact with the family. The child's individualized plan will serve as a blueprint for the Supportive Child Care provider's interactions with the child and family in upcoming weeks and months, and must identify the child's needs, the Supportive Child Care provider's goals for the child, and activities, services and referrals that the Supportive Child Care provider will make.
Post Placement Child Care Conference
Within 45 (calendar) days of enrollment in care, the family and the Supportive Child Care provider will meet to review the child's initial assessment and the child's individualized plan. The Supportive Child Care provider will discuss goals to be achieved during the next quarter as well as expectations regarding family involvement and parent participation in the Supportive Child Care program.
The Supportive Child Care provider will encourage the family to present documentation of their income at this time if the family has not previously done so. However income documentation is not a requirement of Supportive Child Care.
The Supportive Child Care provider will also begin to educate the family about the transitional nature of Supportive Child Care, and will discuss with the parent the options and criteria for continuing EEC subsidized child care once Supportive Child Care ends. 1
Depending upon the needs identified by the Supportive Child Care provider and the DCF social worker, the DCF social worker may or may not attend this meeting. The Supportive Child Care provider must provide a copy of the child's individualized plan to the DCF social worker. If the DCF social worker does not attend the meeting, the Supportive Child Care provider must contact the DCF social worker and provide information about:

Only the most discerning eye would have noticed anything unsavory about the lobster tails on ice recently at the fresh fish counter in a Middletown supermarket.
They belonged to American lobsters, and each was illegally undersized. In New Jersey, that means the sixth abdominal segment -- a band just above the fin-like tail -- must measure at least 1 and one-sixteenth of an inch.
"To be honest, unless you are used to seeing thousands of lobsters, it's difficult, by eye, to tell if the tail is legal or illegal," said Joe Meyer, deputy chief of the Bureau of Law Enforcement for New Jersey's Division of Fish and Wildlife.
But that's part of his job as one of the bureau's 10-member Marine Unit of conservation officers. Along with federal agents, they enforce a complex patchwork of state and federal regulations designed to protect ocean waters from over-fishing, which is reducing an already dwindling seafood supply off the U.S. coast.
U.S. consumers spent $68.4 billion for fishery products in 2007, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOAA. Globally, the illegal, unreported and unregulated ocean fishing business is worth $9 billion a year, according to the federal Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs.
For Meyer and his crew, the job is a local one -- probing even the smallest violation by recreational ocean fishermen as well as commercial trawlers, often to find bigger fish.
In the Middletown case, the supermarket was fined and led authorities to a Canadian commercial distributor, ultimately banned from delivering seafood to New Jersey.
Federal and state regulations have become increasingly complex to control the transfer of catches from dock to dinner plate, and pirates are plentiful. Often targeted is the so-called fish of the day.
Tautog, often called blackfish and fetching as much as $10 per pound, is a good example.
"There is an illegal market for live tautog in sushi and Asian markets where people like to pick out their own fish," Meyer said.
Customers also like them small -- under the legal size limit recently increased to 14 inches. The declining species was the subject of several enforcement efforts this past year, including a Cape May case in October, when a husband and wife were found with 30 tautog they caught off a jetty. That was 29 fish over the legal limit, and 20 were illegally undersized.
Yet, that haul amounted to "small fish" compared with the 2,114 pounds of excess fluke, commonly called summer flounder, found a month earlier in Cape May as a commercial fishing rig docked. The fisherman planned to make about $3,000 selling it in Virginia.
"Where the general public sees a fish, most commercial fishermen -- people who make their livelihoods fishing -- see a dollar bill. Not that they wouldn't appreciate the species or anything, but it's a business to them," said Scott Doyle, supervising criminal investigator for NOAA's Northeast enforcement division.
"So, if you are limited to a 400-pound haul, but you bring aboard 500 pounds, how do you throw those extra dollar bills overboard? Honest fishermen do it. Some don't," he said.
Another factor in that equation is competition from cheaper imports from foreign fisheries, which aren't as tightly regulated.
"If you get away with it, it's substantial money," said Tim Cussens, chief of the state law enforcement bureau. "But in the fluke case, the captain now faces fines of $3,000 and a 60-day suspension of his New Jersey fluke landing permit."
That's what investigators call their "hammer."
The permit loss means a commercial fishing vessel sits at a dock, not making money. But some remain undeterred.
In July, New Jersey marine officers stopped the vessel Two Brothers as it landed from a sea scallop trip in Wildwood. It allegedly held an overage of scallops -- 71 pounds more than the 400 pounds the vessel was permitted to collect that day, all hidden and not listed as required in a federal fishing log, according to charges filed.
The owner of the Two Brothers could not be reached comment.
The boat was one of three linked in 2004 to illegal sea scallop fishing by a family of fishermen who operated a Wildwood seafood dealer called Capt'n Charlie's Clams. On just one day, officers said, they watched two vessels unload a combined shipment of 2,349 pounds of Atlantic sea scallops --more than 1,500 pounds than permitted -- that were taken to Fulton Fish Market in New York for sale.
Nearly $1 million in fines and several years of suspensions were leveled, which NOAA and New Jersey conservation officers said at the time was the largest penalty ever assessed on the Atlantic Coast. While the fine was reduced to $75,000 under a 2006 settlement, Capt'n Charlie's lost its license to deal in seafood for 10 years, the family was forced to sell one of its three vessels and they had to alternate the use of their two remaining vessels for a two-year period.
That settlement may now be revised because of the new charges, authorities said.
"Right now, the standard price you will bring in on scallops is about $5 to $7 per pound, so if you're bringing in an extra 1,000 pounds over the legal limit in a week, you can get an extra $7,000," said Doyle of the NOAA. "But the risk and rewards are not worth it."
Meyer of the state division said recreational fishermen, and the restaurants willing to illegally trade in seafood, can be just as bad.
"We just found 335 sublegal sea bass in one recreational fishing boat," he explained. "To have a party boat with 335 undersized fish is a lot more greedy than a commercial fisherman dragging in too many fluke."
His office spent months probing a recreational boat out of Wildwood Crest this year, focusing on a fisherman who illegally sold sea bass to restaurants. Six others were later nabbed, including the owners of three restaurants in Camden and Gloucester counties that purchased the illegal sea bass. One business had openly advertised the fish as a dinner special.
Doyle of the NOAA said state and federal agents are getting better at catching pirates on both ends of the trade.
"Just because we don't catch you today doesn't mean we won't tomorrow," he said. "And we will do some forensic accounting to get you for the fish you illegally took today and yesterday."Top 5 Apps --Categories - Requires You To Think!!

No replies to this messageCards catcher Rowan Wick tags out Bristol's Thurman Hall..
Bucciffero (1-1) had been hit hard in his first start to the tune of seven runs. This time, he faced just two batters over the minimum in his seven innings of work.
“I just had to rebound from that last start,” said Bucciffero, a 14th-round pick out of Michigan State in 2012. “Baseball’s all about bouncing back and I was able to do so. I needed that.”
Bucciferro, who struck out seven and didn’t issue a walk, allowed only one runner past first base. Two relievers joined in to complete a four-hitter.
Bristol (3-6) came into the game tied for last place in the Appalachian League’s West Division and with the league’s worst batting average (.185). The Cards (7-2) were in first place and had the league’s top pitching staff, boasting a team ERA of 1.87.
So what happened? Bristol banged out 15 hits, five for extra bases.
“It just depends on a given night,” Johnson City manager Joe Kruzel said. “Any particular pitcher on a given night is capable, and that young man threw a heck of a game. He mixed speeds pretty well. He hit his spots continuously and we just failed to make some adjustments. You have to take your hat off to that young man.”
The top four batters in Bristol’s lineup combined for 10 hits. Trey Michalewski and Patrick Palmiero each had three.
“That takes a lot of pressure off you when the bats are swinging,” Bucciffero said. “It was a good team win today.”
In the second inning, Cards starter Nick Lomascolo worked himself into a bases-loaded, one-out jam before getting Victor Velazquez on an inning-ending double play.
An inning later, Thurman Hall led off with a double and advanced to third on a groundout. With the infield playing in, Michalewski grounded to third and J.J. Altobelli threw him out at the plate.
Just when it seemed as though the Cards were out of trouble, Palmiero drilled a run-scoring triple off the wall in left and scored on a wild pitch.
Bristol broke it open with three more runs in the fourth, two on a double by Toby Thomas -- that ended the night for Lomascolo -- and another on a double by Michalewski.
Lomascolo (1-1) allowed five runs on seven hits and three walks in his 3 2/3 innings.
“That’s why we play 68 of these,” Kruzel said. “One game’s not gonna decide. Hopefully by the time the season’s over, we’re gonna be consistent and getting better.”
The Cards are scheduled to play one more game at Thomas Stadium, July 26 against the Elizabethton Twins.
“Beautifuly facility ... this is outsstanding,” Kruzel said. “The city and the community should be very proud of this. The result wasn’t very good, but the experience of playing here ... they have a state-of-the-art facility and they should be very proud of that.”User Profile

when is the best time to plant alfalfa?
I'm thinking of getting 100 pounds of alfalfa seed this year and planting it to most of my pasture with a broadcast seeder.
When is the best time to plant?

I want to know the answer to this very question too. We want to overseed a mixture of clover, alfalfa and timothy in our sparse orchardgrass pasture. We'd like to know when is best too.

paul , donna ,
right now ,(if in the north ) while we still will get a bit of freezing temps at night , thats called frost seeding , the action of freeze and thaw will drive the seed into the soil .. you can even broadcast it on top of a thin snow layer(keep in mind then to plant enough for the birds to ..
)
and depending where you are a bit more snow is expected good ol poor mans ferilizer... will help
this is fine if you are planning on overseeding and exsisting meadow , or patching in areas that are bare ..helps if you meadow grasses are shorter grazed off or mowed ....

An exact time will depend upon your climate. I'm from MN so I know northern ideals. Generally alfalfa & clover should be seeded when it's cooler and much gentle rains are in the forcast. Very slow to sprout & grow, it should only be planted 1/2" deep.
Frost seeding works well as described tho I haven't done it.
If you are interseeding into existing hay then fall seeding won't work - too much ompetition from the growing grass.
So, from now through the first week of May, depending on your rain/ cold is a good time. Your grass needed to be clipped or grazed very short.
I renovated my pasture years ago by spreading fertilizer, running my field cultivator about 1" deep to take out very narrow shallow strips of grass & stir the fertilizer. Then I seeded the alfalfa & dragged (harrowed it. Work pretty good, but had the driest spring in 2 decades that year, so didn't get what I could have. It would have beed great on a normal spring.

I've had good luck frost seeding red clover. Would broadcast about 3lbs per acre right after the snow melted. I've heard that alfalfa will not compete as well. Frost seeding grass seed does not work very well because the lighter grass seed isn't able to make it through the sod and get good soil contact.
I've done similar things as Rambler, used a press drill once when the pasture was still quite soft. Also used the old style disk where you could adjust the disk angles so it just cut narrow furrows, then broadcast and rolled it with a field packer. Frost seeding worked just as well most years and was less work.
Another option is to use a no-till drill. Here in MN many Soil and Water Offices have them for rent. This would be a good choice if you want to seed grasses.
Like Rambler said the success will depend on if you get sufficient moisture. Also, if you are cutting for hay try to get the first cut off early or at least on time. Otherwese the new legume seedlings will be crowded out.
This is a pretty good write up with more info:

I remember when the farmers here in central Illinois used a 3 or 4 crop rotation they would sow Clover or Alfalfa in the Winter wheat, or Spring oats, in March. They tried to catch the last snow or, at least, a few nights of freezing temps. Wheat needs to be planted thin if you intend to interseed legumes as it will crowd out the weaker plants.
Now they inter-seed in August using a no-till drill. Do this right after cutting and baling off what you have growing.
Our county Ag. Dept. has a no-till drill for use by anyone in the county. All you have to do is sign up for when you want it. No cost, which is unusual for the government.
If you are interseeding existing pasture, Fall will probably be best as the established grasses/legumes will shoot up too fast and shade your new sprouting seed in the Spring.
One other thing. After seeding new legumes, either Spring or Fall, you should not graze, or cut hay, till the new is well established. If you seed in the Fall you should not run cattle on it till the next Spring after green up.
Bear in mind the legumes will be a real treat for cattle so watch for Bloat. Horses too, need to be put on legumes real careful or they will have problems.

If you still have some snow up there in north of Spokane, and a good sunny day you can broadcast the seed with excellent luck and almost no bird loss, the darker the seed color the better it goes into the snow and away from the birds, however you must watch your pattern as you walk, if the wind is blowing just a little you will maybe have a bare strip like an old timer i know did one year.... he worked up his ground in the fall and planted his medium red clover in the snow in the spring, however he had the most acurate 2 foot wide paths in his field where the wind made him miscalculate his broadcastings.... prolly he is turning over in his resting spot now as i tell the world what only his neighbors laughed about a years ago.

Paul, what are you neighbors that are the "better farmers" growing to meet their needs? I find that it is best to grow what is native to the area or what has already proven to be establishable. He in NC for example the extension dept pushes us to grow endophyte free fescue. It is just not winter hardy enough to persist. The farmers with the best stands of grass grow ky31 fescue and offset the endophyte problem by interseeding with legumes, mostly clovers. I even have some sericea lespedeza that the cattle consume readily when in the early stages of growth. Sericea is considered as a noxious weed but it works if managed correctly. Alfafa is too hard to establish and has insect problems here. It is grown under expensive management for horse hay but IMO is not worth the effort. I would listen to the feed store guys and not waste my money on the expensive seed. If they thought you had a chance they would have sold you the seed.

Unless your soil ph is high which most often it isn't in eastern states, the alfalfa won't make it. Unless you are planning on using the field for hay the alfalfa won't be as good as you'd like. Without a grass drill to put the seed in the ground a little bit, the odds of a good stand is very slim this time of year.

Paul, you may want to read Malabar Farm by Louis Bromfield. He did extensive testing on plots of land growing various grains and grasses. What he found out about alfalfa was interesting to me - that it's basically a scrub grass and does not like a lot of fuss - that's why you see it by the wayside growing so well. Anyway, I'm no farmer, so get the book and read what he had to say. It may help you with when and how to plant.

Old farmers here in Illinois say to plant alfalfa in any month with an "r" in it. They seem to grow a lot of hay.

Old farmers in Indiana plant most of their alfalfa in late August into ground worked into a fine powder on top. It is planted with a grass drill or grain drill with a grass seed atachment. The dust allows the moisture to come up but it won't come through the dust and evaporate. The alfalfa comes up very quickly even though the ground looks bone dry.
Anyone willing to spend the money required to sow alfalfa will have had the soil ph tested, and applied however much ag lime the test showed was needed to get the ph up where it needs to be. If there are any places that are not really well drained in the field don't waste alfalfa seed on them. All alfalfa seed are not the same. Alfalfa dwindles out after a few years. Some varieties are much longer lived than others and the seed price reflects the difference.
Some plant in the spring just as early as a tractor can get over the ground. They use a thin stand of oats planted right with it for a cover crop. The oats is them made for hay as soon as it starts getting heads.

Best time about two years before you want to harvest it.
On first time plowed (broke) land we will plant barley only this first year, about May 8, 2004 to June 2004 (sometime in there). Then we will pick and/or rake more roots. Then finally, next spring (about May 8, 2005) we will plant hay (Alfalfa, Timothy and Brome mixture), in 2005 fall we will only get another crop (no hay - too small). Then in 2006 fall we will harvest our first hay.
We will seed drill with 24 (verify length?) foot seed drill for all seeding.
We will only first time seed about 55 broke acres this year, 65 next year.

Alfalfa needs a higher ph level, 7 or so. You will _not_ get good results planting alfalfa if there has been any old alfalfa plants growing there in 3-6 months. The adult plants have a toxic substance in their roots that kills off new alfalfa sprouts.
Sounds like your _best_ bet would be to kill off everything growing there, lime & lightly fertilize, and when fall rains come replant with a good pasture mix that contains the type of alfalfa you want - high yield, wet tolerance, leafhopper tolerance, grazing tolerance, or even a (slow growing) type that spreads itself with runners. Alfalfa supplies it's own nitrogen, so it sounds like a great addition to what you have growing there - will give you the N you need for the grasses.
Trying to interseed as you want to do is a gamble. The old grasses can kill it, without a good seedbed & just scattering seed you will need to plant about 300# instead of 100#, and the exsisting alfalfa plants will hurt you. Your ph is kinda low, & it takes a while for most lime to activate..... Without rain, you can do everything perfect and still get poor results.
Would a clover work out for you, they might grow better in your exsisting conditions & establish itself a bit better?

how well are you going to prepare the seed bed ? are you going to inculate the seed? is there going to be a nurse crop planted with it? what is you planting zone? if you area is dry try a drought tolerant variety, oats make a great nurse crop. what is the fertility and ph of your feilds? remember when planting a nurse crop with alfalfa it takes less seed per acre. in the area i am in we plant in october of the yr and cut first cutting in april after that a cutting every 28 days is possible for 10 months out of the yr. of course we have irrigation to use and the crop gets a foilar fertilizer about ever 4:58 AM

In an off-season move, and after camping out only 10 months, Head Coach Marc Trestman and wife decide to sell.
Photo by: Zillow / @properties Exterior of Chicago Bears coach Marc Trestman's Winnetka mansion. The 5,600-square-foot custom house was placed on the market after less than a year of residence. See the Zillow listing.
And to play fair, Trestman did bring some stats to reckon with as one of only four Bears coaches to win their maiden game. People were bowing down by week 15: his eight wins knocked on the heavenly 1956 record (nine) for a first year coach. But before all that camera time the man needed some slick digs and settled with his wife in this 6-bedroom, 5,200-square-foot Winnetka mansion. It suited up just fine. Until it didn't.
Ten months later, Trestman and wife Cindy want out. Ten months. Not to be contradictory or point out a smirky irony, but this coach is the one and same author of the motivational book Perseverance: Life Lessons on Leadership and Teamwork, wherein he preaches tough love tactics for, you know, persevering. Ah, but perhaps what felt like a dream house was an infatuation. Real estate agent Milena Birov of @properties reports that, "The house works well for them," they just want something bigger.
It's a new, upscale construction, 18 miles from downtown Chicago on a 0.33-acre lot and built by Heritage Luxury Brothers, a company with over 100 custom residences in Winnetka. The listing price is hiked over half a million — $550,000 — above the 2013 summer purchase of $2.937 million. Nice perks though, including a third floor loft space, home theater, wine cellar (always a plus), Cherry wood library and a sport court built for champions-in-the-making.
The couple is house hunting, so it looks like Trestman is in for the haul. Right?
Asking $3.495 million. Check out the Zillow listing.

Harvest Potatoes
Wait about ten days after the tops have died back, then dig potatoes by loosening the soil along the edge of each row with a garden fork, taking care to avoid damaging the underground tubers in the process. If you do nick any by mistake, eat these soon, as they won't keep well. Potatoes will last longest in storage if they are cured for about two weeks in a dark, humid, 50-60 degree location, then stored in a dark, humid, and cooler location (but no lower than 40 degrees).
Fill in Empty Spots with Rye Grass
As summer vegetable harvests finish, unless you are following with a late season crop, cultivate the beds and sprinkle the seeds of annual rye grass as a cover crop. Lightly rake the seeds into the soil and keep the bed moist until seeds sprout. Annual rye will keep growing until late fall. Although it usually dies over the winter in most parts of New England, it will protect the soil from erosion over the winter and can be turned under in the spring.
Check the Compost Pile
To keep your pile active, turn it and sprinkle with water if the weather has been dry. Set up some bins made from circles of wire fencing in an out-of-the-way spot to collect fall leaves that will break down slowly into leaf mold.
Fertilize Lawns
Early September is a good time to give your lawn its main feeding of the year. For an established lawn, choose a fertilizer that does not contain phosphorus (the middle number of the analysis is zero) unless a soil test indicates a deficiency.
Divide Daylilies
Late summer and early fall is a good time to divide overcrowded daylilies or those you want more of. The popular repeat-blooming daylilies such as 'Stella de Oro' and 'Happy Returns' will bloom best if divided every few years.Properties in Bewdley, Worcestershire between £650,000 and £700,000

Forty years ago, when President Richard Nixon made an unannounced visit to the town of Xenia, Ohio, he said,  in terms of destruction, just total devastation, this is the worst I have seen.”
A mile-wide tornado, rated F5, obliterated a large chunk of Xenia, 40 years ago today. The disaster killed 34 people (including two Ohio National Guardsmen who died days later in a related fire), injured an additional 1,150, destroyed almost half of the city’s buildings, and left 10,000 people homeless.
Forty miles up U.S. Route 42, in London, the Xenia tornado was losing steam, but still did over a million dollars of damage to downtown London, including extensive damage to the Madison County courthouse and its clock tower.
A week after the tornado, damage was still being assessed in London.
“I don’t know how many homes were damaged. Uptown many buildings’ roofs have more damage than meets the eye,” said Jack Kunkle, Madison County’s Civil Defense director to The Madison Press on April 10.
As the storm progressed north, a mobile home in Canaan Community Trailer Park did a “somersault” in the high wind, landing on the owner’s car.
Further up U.S. Route 42, in Unionville Center, Perry Snyder found a sheet of letterhead stationery from Xenia Cab Co., a patio umbrella, child’s game box and pieces of plywood. One sheet of plywood was still wedged in a nearby treetop. Snider told The Plain City Advocate in April of 1974 that he could look in the sky and see numerous flying objects in the sky and dropping to the ground.
Even further north, in Marysville, then-five-year-old Titus Hostetler found a checkbook from a Xenia family in his front yard, 60 miles away from Xenia.
The Xenia tornado was part of a storm system now known as “The Super Outbreak.” It remains the most violent tornado outbreak ever recorded. Within an 18 hour period, 148 tornadoes were confirmed in the American mid-west, with 30 classified as F4 or F5.
The death toll from the Super Outbreak reached 319.
A new display, curated by Frank Slagle, at the Madison County Senior Center helps to keep the memory alive of that devastating day.
Pieces of the Madison County Courthouse, salvaged from the courthouse lawn following the tornado, are on display.
The Madison County Senior Center is located at 280 W. High St. in London. The center is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, and until 9 p.m. during Bingo on Wednesdays. For more information, contact the Madison County Senior Center at (740) 852-3001.

I’m still recovering from my first experience of past-life regression, as a client in 1985. Hypnosis directed toward self-discovery was that life changing!
Later I would go on to become a consulting hypnotist who specializes in past-life regression to remove frozen blocks of energy. Now my clients are recovering.
Recovering nicely. Recovering from stored-up trauma from this life and previous lifetimes.
Energy Spirituality is the system I have developed overall, an interlocking set of many skill sets, including Soul Energy Awakening Past-Life Regression. Or simply Past-Life Regression for short.
You see, during 43 years as a facilitator of personal development, I have become passionately interested in how much people can grow as a result of removing STUFF, then filling up with what really expresses that individual’s soul now.
Past-Life Regression Can Remove STUFF That Limits Life Now
“STUFF” is my (hopefully unintimidating) name for stored emotional and energetic debris at the astral level — a level that corresponds to the subconscious mind.
STUFF comes in many varieties, but the most important thing about it is that STUFF can always, always, always be healed. As a holistic healer, I have pioneered some professional skill sets for cutting cords of attachment, removing psychic coercion, upgrading facade bodies, and other big bang for buck-type healing.
In my experience, though, certain types of STUFF, are best removed with Past-Life Regression: Recurring patterns emotionally or behaviorally; health problems that medical professionals are not able to help; and attraction/repulsion problems with sex, money, love relationships, fears, etc.
Karma, STUFF, and Past-Life Regression
There is a strange and mysterious relationship between karma and STUFF removal, particularly large frozen blocks of stuck energy from the past. Soul Energy Awakening Past-Life Regression — That’s the full, fancy name for what I do with hypnosis — produces notable results related to karma. Could healing now prevent troubles later? Still an ongoing topic to explore…
What’s already clear? Past-life regression can do so much to nourish the soul. Beyond that, for certain kinds of STUFF removal, nothing can match the effectiveness of past-life regression.
In today’s post, I would like to inspire you with possibilities. What happens when your healing journey includes past-life regression hypnosis? What can be achieved within that field, when the hypnotist aims to identify and remove frozen blocks of energy?
Could even be, the important “past-life” frozen blocks for removal can sometimes come from this life. Yes, earlier in this very same lifetime. Not as flashy as when a past-life regression session involves an incarnation centuries ago. Not as flashy, merely productive….
The Happiest Day of My Life
Some clients need only a session or two for enormous improvement due to the removal of frozen blocks. Such a client was “Masa.” (Not his real name. All names in this article have been changed.) (Except mine. ;-))
When he first entered the healing room, Masa looked incredibly dapper, in that way I associate with certain Japanese businessmen.
We were in Tokyo, Masa and I, along with a fabulous interpreter, “Taeko-san.” Without her, of course, there would have been no hypnosis.
Masa was extremely dignified, with impeccable posture and an even more impeccable grey three-piece suit. Anxiety was the problem he came to solve. You would never know from his body language that anxiety could remotely be a problem. I vividly remember the calm, methodical way this man folded his suit jacket over a chair, then removed his exquisite vest and placed it on the chair as well. No wrinkles for this guy!
Soon Masa was lying on a sofa. (For the depth work of Energy Release Regression, I prefer a reclining position rather than the usual hypnotist’s recliner.)
Very soon, Masa was in a deep trance. Soon afterwards, Masa made contact with a childhood incident that had created some horrible stuck frozen blocks.
As a curious little four-year-old, Masa-san opened the door to the family car. Discovering that he could get in, he sat in the driver’s seat and began to play driver.
Somehow he must have lifted up the emergency brake, because the next thing he knew, that little boy was riding down “a great big hill,” moving faster and faster until he “crashed” the car.
In external reality, I’m guessing that neither the hill nor the crash were too huge. Probably it was a bit like some of my early driving lessons with a standard shift, where I kept sliding backwards because of the “Unbelievably steep incline” of a pretty darned flat parking lot.
Anyway, this runaway car ride was a serious horror for Masa. Excellent, to this healer! I used dedicated techniques that allowed this client to explore the stuck energy in his gut, then smash up that frozen block forever. Afterwards he filled himself up with clean new energy, representing a fresh beginning for him. The aura equivalent of wrinkle free!
By the end of his session, Masa looked as perky and dapper as ever. Okay, he positively glowed. If anything, his three-piece suit looked more suave than before. I’ll never forget what he told me next, through our interpreter Taeko:
“This has been the happiest day of my life. It is better than the day I got married. It is better than the day my first child was born. It is better than the day my other daughter was born, too.”
Preparation for Depth Regression Work
Now, I don’t want to give the impression that all my past-life regression clients have just a couple of sessions. In Japanese, yet.
No, they’re usually in English. Sometimes clients have just one regression. For cumulative benefit, though, many of my clients choose to do a series of many sessions of past-life regression.
However, I’m simply giving a short survey here so my other anecdote will involve another client who also had just a very small number of sessions.
So far, Elizabeth has come to me for only three sessions of past-life regression. The first one was the wild one.
Elizabeth’s goal was to release anger. The first incident to come up for releasing was from her childhood. This lifetime. Big sister snatched away Elizabeth’s toy and threatened to break it. Together, Elizabeth and I moved out a rough, red lump in her throat.
A second frozen block resulted from an incident where Elizabeth’s mother smacked her in the head.
Feeling powerless, the little girl’s inner self formed a sandy energy. It, too, was stuck in her throat. Big relief to move that one out, for sure!
Moving out that frozen block was especially important because of a process-related component. As often happens with abuse suffered in childhood, Elizabeth’s consciousness split off from the immediate scene. She felt as if looking down from the ceiling.
Without some degree of re-living the trauma, this nuance about attention might never have come to light.
Who would have thought to ask about it? Besides, the particular nuances of such an experience are unique, as is the residue of stuck energy related to it.
For a client to live in a state of wholeness, I believe it can be extremely helpful to move out STUFF in the form of major frozen blocks. This particular one didn’t just contain stuck anger. Subconscious and hidden, this frozen block kept alive a kind of recipe, or mechanism, for how to split off from reality.
While that frozen block remained, it would trigger a response in comparable situations: “Feel angry but powerless? Here’s how to find relief. Split off from your present surroundings.”
Without that frozen block, Elizabeth’s subconscious mind simply contained a vague memory about being hit in the head. Quite a difference!
Ironically, frozen block removal isn’t an ice-cold, detached experience. Instead this way out of habitual detachment (or other dysfunctional ways of coping with problems) does require a very brief, re-experience where the past-life regression facilitator is present and actively monitoring the session. This is, at least, the model I use for healing with hypnosis and regression therapy.
“Facing the fear, with expert help,” it could be called. When a frozen block is removed for good, a new kind of peace becomes possible.
Denial, you think?
Back at Elizabeth, one by one, anger-related frozen blocks were released during her first session of past-life regression. This courageous new client moved out similar residues of trauma from incidents that would continue to live in her subconscious mind — in the form of memory only.
When guided to fill up with energies that resonated with her soul now, that was the easy part. Elizabeth was good at both parts, the releasing and the necessary filling up.
As a practitioner, I can’t emphasize enough how important I think it is to release stuck energies in the form of frozen blocks. Storing a memory is quite different from keeping trapped energetic residues that continually re-imprint the subconscious mind 24/7 for the rest of a person’s life. Although the subconscious mind keeps a detailed record of every life event and perception, stuck energies are another matter entirely.
Collaboratively moving into one frozen block at a time and thoroughly demolishing it, this session was turning out to be quite routine, I thought. We were doing the usual process of combining intense memories from the client with dedicated skills for moving out those stuck energies, then filling up.
Except, oops, then came “Vance.” Elizabeth began to re-experience herself with Vance. She was 27. In this incident, still this lifetime, she was having a love affair with him.
Maybe “love” is too strong a word. Vance was definitely having sex with Elizabeth. Love may not have been involved, exactly. However, at the time she agreed to be with him because it made her feel close to somebody, which she desperately needed at the time.
Vance amused himself with Elizabeth while she stared up at the ceiling, waiting for “It” to be over that so that she could go to sleep.
“I don’t know how to love” was the gist of one of her frozen blocks from having sex with Vance this first time. “Loneliness” was the essence of another stuck energy.
As the incident progressed, Elizabeth found herself splitting off from the immediate scene, detached in a way that she had first learned to do with the physical abuse during childhood. Only now sex became part of the mix.
Not exactly a good thing, right?
The Forgotten Love Affair
As more frozen blocks were removed during this session, what a surprise! Turned out that Elizabeth had allowed an ongoing affair with Vance for many months.
Again and again, she went through the motions with her loveless lover. Routinely, once the mildly unpleasant business was underway, Elizabeth would detach inwardly. In consciousness, she would rise up to the ceiling and wait until the guy was physically satisfied.
Not good for one’s sanity, having such energies stuck, right? For this client, the frozen blocks had been medicated into numbness but never been removed. Nor could they be without a dedicated skill set for that purpose.
Bring on skills for permanent removal of frozen blocks! Turned out, it wasn’t especially difficult to free up Elizabeth. Her subconscious mind, given direction, had known exactly where to go in regression, which memories to choose.
Discovering the affair was surprising to me, of course. In my first session of past-life regression therapy, I book an extra hour so we can get to know each other and the client can be thoroughly prepared to receive the best results.
Having gathered information about Elizabeth’s history before she went into hypnosis, I already knew a bit about Elizabeth’s love life. At least, I thought I knew.
Elizabeth had told me that the first and only man she had ever slept with was “Roy,” now her ex-husband.
Ooooops.
The end of any past-life regression session requires discussion. Returned to the conscious state, my client always discusses with me what was learned, what was released, comments about the fill-up part.
Always, we consider what might be the implications of today’s healing. This time, I was especially curious to learn about my client’s reaction.
Elizabeth appreciated that she would have less anger now. She also looked at me with wonderment and relief in her eyes. Consciously she hadn’t remembered a thing about that “love affair” with Vance.
How Frozen Block Removal Can Change Repression
When psychotherapists talk about “Repression,” they mean just such experiences as forgetting completely about a long-time, loveless, sexual affair with someone like Vance.
Generally repression is a life saver. How convenient that we human adults don’t wake up each morning and (perhaps while brushing our teeth?) remember every past trauma, each old disappointment, all the miserable upsets of every single lifetime!
Without good old repression, would those memories fly by in chronological sequence? Or perhaps in order of worstest firstest?
Still, repression can limit life enormously. It’s a big deal to suffer through a hideous mockery of a love affair. For months.
Well, it’s a bigger deal to move that knowledge out of storage in the subconscious mind.
Most important — for this holistic healer, at least — it is vital not just to dredge up old memories but to move out the associated frozen blocks. They greatly worsen the impact of memories.
Besides containing toxic emotional contents, there can be process- or mechanism-related components to a frozen block.
In my opinion, Elizabeth’s splitting off from reality was that dysfunctional type of process that could be un-learned after release of the inner mechanism, the frozen block.
Sure, frozen blocks are formed in the subconscious mind and auric field during trauma. That doesn’t mean the frozen blocks have to remain.
Elizabeth told me later that, as a result of this one session, she was able to discontinue her anti-psychotic medication, doing this under her psychiatrist’s supervision. Years later, she is still doing great, off the meds with her doctor’s blessing.
Moving out frozen blocks of energy isn’t the standard skill set for hypnotists or hypnotherapists, nor is it even common practice within the specialty of regression therapy.
As a mind-body-spirit practitioner since 1971, I find that popular understanding of energy literacy is growing exponentially with each passing decade. As more people learn to read auras for themselves and their clients, I believe that it will become common knowledge how major traumas create frozen blocks that become stored in the subconscious mind.
Some forms of energy healing are easy to do for oneself, once appropriate skills are developed. Others cannot be done alone but always require the active presence, and skills, of a professional.
Blog Readers, when you think about your desires for personal growth, it’s worth considering frozen block removal. From past-lives long ago. Or from past days of this particular incarnation.
Let your subconscious mind choose the memory, teaming up with a professional at past-life regression. It’s “The meal you cannot make at home.”
I have seen living proof that this kind of intense experience, under hypnosis, can create miracles of healing. Just ask Elizabeth or Masa, who is now noticeably more wrinkle free on the inside, thanks to past-life regression.
Thanks here to Dr. Heather Friedman Rivera, a past-life regression therapist who has taken a leadership role in the field of past-life regression. I’m so honored that today she published the article here as a guest post at her blog, devoted to past-life regression.

BACKGROUNDER
MOUNT AGASSIZ SKI AREA In 1958, Parks Canada leased approximately 142 hectares to a private operator for the development of a ski area in Riding Mountain National Park.
In 1961, Mount Agassiz Ski Area (Mount Agassiz) opened with a few ski runs.
The ski area grew during the 1970s, with the addition of more ski trails, two T-Bar lifts, snowmaking equipment and an expanded day lodge. The most significant expansion occurred in 1979 when a double chairlift was added and additional ski trails were developed.
In 2000, the ski area went out of business. The buildings and other assets were left at the site.
The 2007 Riding Mountain National Park Management Plan indicated additional leases would not be granted for the purposes of downhill skiing in the park and the Mount Agassiz area would be rehabilitated.
Following the decision, regional stakeholders brought new information and perspectives to Parks Canada regarding the future of the Mount Agassiz site. Parks Canada committed to examining the matter further, including commissioning a feasibility study.
The feasibility study suggests that reopening Mount Agassiz Ski Area is viable challenge due to limited markets, competition from existing ski hills, and high capital and operating costs. Some stakeholders continue to express a strong interest in reopening the site and would like the chance to assess the opportunities, risks and requirements to develop and operate a sustainable operation at Mount Agassiz.
Parks Canada decided to re-examine the Mount Agassiz decision and proposed an amendment to the national park management plan to allow entrepreneurs an opportunity to develop a proposal for a multi-season operation at Mount Agassiz. In January 2012, Parks Canada conducted extensive public consultation of the management plan amendment. Overall, public support for the amendment was strong.
In June 2012, an approved management plan amendment was tabled in Parliament which states that Parks Canada will “consider financially sustainable proposals for the redevelopment of a ski hill operation at the Mount Agassiz Ski Area, including multi-season recreational activities.”
Parks Canada has now launched a Request For Proposals process to invite potential submissions to reopen the Mount Agassiz Ski Area in Riding Mountain National Park for a sustainable winter or multi-season operation.
The entire RFP process will take one year. Proponents will have nine months to submit their proposals, and Parks Canada will review submissions within three months of the submission deadline.
Mount Agassiz Ski Area continues to be listed as a Commercial Ski Area pursuant to the Canada National Parks Act, S.C. 2000, c. 32, in Schedule 5, section 36.- Reviews

Pillars of Control
The Coliseum, which honors its namesake with cool Roman column graphics, is housed in a small MXR-style brushed aluminum chassis that will fit even the most real estate-challenged pedalboard. Although there are plenty of reverb pedals out there with features like stereo ins and outs, and 10 different parameter controls, the Coliseum offers simplicity. There are just two knobs—Level and Tone—plus a mini toggle switch that selects Room, Spring, or Grand Hall. ModTone’s designers seem aware that most players are conditioned to set a reverb level on their amp and leave it there, rather than tweak it on the fly. So it’s impressive to see how much range the Coliseum delivers with a streamlined and easy-to-navigate control set.
Face Off
With an Ernie Ball/Music Man Axis Sport in hand, I tried out the Coliseum with a variety of Fender amps. To start, I paired the Coliseum up with a silverface Vibro Champ, a silverface Princeton Reverb, and a ’63 Vibroverb reissue. With the Coliseum set to Spring, Level around 1 o’clock, and Tone around 10 o’clock, my vintage Vibro Champ twitched with new life and sounded a lot like the tiny Fender I’ve always wanted. Comparing the Coliseum against my Princeton Reverb and Vibroverb reissue offered other insights. The Coliseum’s Spring and Hall settings got me in the same ballpark as the reverb-equipped Fenders, but there were times when the Coliseum’s reverb sounded richer than the Princeton’s onboard reverb. It may just be a matter of preference in this case, but for my money, that’s a mighty impressive feat on the Coliseum’s part—and fellow musicians in the room were inclined to agree.
The Grand Hall setting is a lot of fun, and this is where players used to the limitations of onboard amp reverb can spread their wings. With the Level around 12 o’clock, I got a subtle, almost slapback delay effect that fits well into traditional rock ’n’ roll and classic rock settings. But when maxed, I was treated to an extremely lush cloud of reverb with a long decay time that sounded great with Eric Johnson-style open-voiced triads and intricate, volume-swelled chords. Usually when I play those types of atmospheric figures, I like to add delay for ambiance, but the Coliseum was so full sounding on its own that delay was almost redundant.
With the Coliseum’s Tone rolled off, I got an ultra-warm sound, and when I turned the Tone way up, it almost sounded like a church organ. This latter sound is fantastic for chords and arpeggios in slower, quieter frameworks. In both extremes, the Coliseum was extremely musical and never sounded artificial. The Grand Hall setting was even useful with single-note lines that would typically sound messy with a reverb this cavernous.
The Verdict
The Coliseum is an excellent reverb pedal that could be the perfect complement to a reverb-less vintage amp or take the place of a lackluster amp reverb. Its small size and relative affordability make it doubly appealing. And given its range of reverb effects, it has to rank among the best bang-for-the-buck reverbs available today.
Buy if...
you want an affordable reverb pedal with a wide range of ’verb types that can fit on even the smallest pedalboard.
Skip if...
your amp has your reverb needs covered.

Good, but terribly laggy
Even with the graphics set to the lowest quality and no toehr programs running, this game still got terribly laggy for no discernible reason. It's rather annoying to be on top of the spammer situation and the next thing you know half of them are banging away at the walls of the ban bin.
Graphics are fairly simplistic here, but they get the job done well enough. Gameplay is pretty easy to get to grips with, and if not for the lag, would probably have been pretty easy too. More upgrades and different types of spammers could have been interesting too, although I understand this was just a fun little game for Denvish Day.
It's a fairly fun idea, and implemented well it's just such a shame that the lag lets it down.
Rated 4 / 5 stars
Nice, BUT...
Nice, but the game is lagging and i cannot do more than 500 score .. it was lagiing even when i select the lowest graphics.
Rated 3.5 / 5 stars
Good
GOOD: It was fairly origional, creative and entertaining if you have some time to burn.
BAD: It was a little laggy and kind of got a little repetitive after.
IMPROVEMENT: Well, the only advice I can give you is try to fix the lag.
OVERALL: It was a fun simple game especially if you want to burn up some free time. Good job.
Rated 4 / 5 stars
Tag for later remake...
Nice, simple, and clean. Loved it.
Too bad about the lag, though.

HARTFORD, Conn., April 17 /PRNewswire/ -- The Connecticut BioBus will travel to the State Capitol on Thursday, April 24 to conduct mobile lab science experiments with visiting students from Wilbur Cross High School, New Haven, and offer tours for other children visiting for "Bring Your Child to Work Day" at the Capitol and Legislative Office Building. The students will perform a sophisticated experiment from the BioBus curriculum, Genetically Modified Organisms. In this experiment, they will isolate DNA from samples of food brought from home and then use a scientific technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine whether their product contains genetically modified plants. The students will also participate in the Genes in a Bottle experiment, generously donated by Bio-Rad Laboratories, in which they will isolate their own DNA and learn about molecular biology, from cell structure to genetics to the chemistry of life. The Connecticut BioBus will be premiering its newly installed SMART Technology interactive learning tools, to streamline and enhance teaching and learning of biosciences experiments. The BioBus will be located outside the Capitol on the south side grounds and will be open to visitors from 9 AM through 2 PM. Visitors to the BioBus will be invited to participate in the Genes in a Bottle experiment while supplies last. "We are proud of the BioBus and cordially invite the public to pay us a visit," said Sarah Berke, director of the BioBus Educational Programs. "These programs generate interest and enthusiasm in science and technology careers among young students and ultimately help to develop and strengthen the workforce of tomorrow." Founded in 2001, the Connecticut BioBus is a 40-foot, custom-designed mobile laboratory with sophisticated equipment and technology. BioConnection is an equipment loan program that enables Connecticut teachers to bring advanced biotechnology to their classrooms. The Connecticut BioBus is a program of CURE (), the leading organization for promoting life science initiatives throughout Connecticut. The mission of CURE's award-winning BioBus Educational Programs () is to be a key bioscience education resource in Connecticut igniting enthusiasm, understanding, and support for science and technology. The Programs, which are offered free of charge thanks to the continuing support of sponsors, have visited more than 445 schools, reached more than 60,000 students, and trained more than 775 teachers.
SOURCE CUREWellington Phoenix striker Mirjan Pavlovic is unlikely to be seen at the A-League club in the near future.
The Phoenix released a statement this afternoon which said: "Wellington Phoenix footballer Mirjan Pavlovic has a medical condition which restricts his ability to play professional football.
"The club will be making no further comment on this till such time as the condition is resolved."
Pavlovic has been out on loan with New South Wales premier league side Sydney United FC but no word has been given on his potential return.
The 23-year-old signed with the Phoenix on a two-year deal in 2010 after a brief stint at fellow A-League club the Newcastle Jets.
In 26 games for the Phoenix, Pavlovic has scored two goals.As much as we want to seem accepting of all people and their differences, sometimes there is no way to get around those differences. For example, social status is a very important factor. Social status determines the clothes you wear, the car you drive, the restaurants you visit, the drinks you buy, the places you go have fun at, and it even determines your health status. Sure, I'll hang out with wealthier people than I. Sure, I'll give my fellow broke college friends a few bucks. Sure, I'll dress up fancy and pretend to fit in, but I don't have the money to splurge on clothes, food, and other luxuries. Social status does matter. I know my wealthier friends won't invite me to specific events due to the fact that I cannot afford it. On the other hand, I won't invite someone who is completely broke to events most would consider "cheap." If you can't afford to attend an event with a friend, why be friends? Sure, you can partake in free activities, but nothing is ever free and money will always interfere. Let's talk cultural or moral differences. A white millionaire might have hired someone to teach him etiquette and can be on the top of the VIP list at any social establishment. On the other hand, an African American male who earns minimum wage has to wait in line at these social establishments. It matters to these people who they associate with. The white man's status might be lowered; the African American's might be as well for "trying to fit in." There is judgment, there is a difference. "Social Status" - "is the Matter"It does matter to everyone, regardless of how high they hold their morals and open-mind. I am accepting of all races, all religions, all shapes and sizes, but some topics we wish did not impact our lives, greatly do. It's not that we choose to accept these societal norms based on status, but they are there and we cannot deny the difference. I need to have friends and family members of the same social status to find an equilibrium in every other judgmental aspect. If we put the social status aside, we can focus on other activities, plans, goals, and ways to spend our time. Money is an issue, it always has been, and unfortunately, plays a very important aspect in our everyday encounters.Revenge

While Penn remains on the UFC's active roster of fighters, he hasn't fought in well over six months and does not have a bout scheduled. The legendary Hawaiian mixed martial artist would like to return to 155 pounds for one last title run, but many onlookers believe Penn has nothing left to prove and has taken enough damage over the years.
Competing at UFC 31 in May 2001, Penn began his MMA career more than a decade ago, which makes him one of the longest tenured UFC fighters still looking to compete inside the Octagon today.
As Penn's long UFC career winds down, let's see where he stands among the active fighters with the longest running and uninterrupted stint in the world's top MMA promotion.Our open style photobooth is available for weddings, private parties, corporate events, product launches or any other function that you're throwing.

Thanks for continuing to check in with us on the blog, even though we’ve been a bit absent of late. Big things happening at the studio (an impending location move is upon us!) that have been keeping us a bit preoccupied lately, along with enjoying this beautiful spring with our clients! We are so fortunate to live in a place that has seasons, but with weather that’s not too crazy, thank goodness! I love that we can photograph in similar locations all year long but get totally different looks, depending on what time of year it is. Springtime brings with it green grasses and beautiful wild flowers (before things dry up and become what we like to call “summer amber”, not “dead” :-). This session with the Schroeder family was one of those perfect spring sessions, and the fact that dad is my (Stef) cousin made it even more special. We’ve been lucky enough to photograph them since they were expecting big brother B (even when they didn’t live locally!). Love the relationship between these siblings and so grateful we get to call the Schroeders family!!
Happy.
Some of my favorites from Sarah’s lovely downtown senior portrait session. She decided for an old glamour look for her senior pictures so we headed to an old hotel in downtown Sacramento. Her wardrobe was perfect!!!
Thanks!!
Where do I even begin about the Knebel family? The circumstances which prompted their interest in having family portraits made, as soon as possible, are still so sad for me to think about. Elizabeth’s mom had very suddenly and unexpectedly passed away, leaving them devastated and realizing how very precious every moment of life really is. It takes an effort to have family portraits made, and we all have a million reasons why we will wait until next month, next year, or maybe never–too busy, too complicated, too much weight still to lose, and the list goes on. The Knebel’s realized all too abruptly that the time was now, which is what brought them to us. From the moment we met them, it wasn’t about being sad at what they had lost, but rather embrace and celebrate what they have in their beautiful, fun-loving family. What a great lesson to be learned, on so many levels. Since their family portrait session, I feel fortunate to say that I consider this family not just clients, but friends. Please meet the hilariously funny, loving, and very real Knebel’s!
Our journey with Crissy and Anthony began a few years ago with the birth of their son, Gabe. When we heard they were getting married we were of course thrilled they wanted us to photograph it. It’s a special treat to be photographing a wedding for people we know so well, so it was no surprise their engagement session was a joy. I felt like a fly on the wall watching these two on a long date. We started at the brew pub where Anthony proposed and had a beer (or two), then it was off to the lake. Crissy was just coming off knee surgery and was a real trooper during our long stroll in and out of the water. Thank you both for including Stef and I in this special time in your lives. We are excited to hear what the future holds for you.
Today is our Reilly’s 12th birthday!! And breaking news in the past few hours…the 14th grand baby on the Hays side of our family is going to share a birthday with his cousin. Such a fun day! To my brother-in-law and sister-in-law today–treasure every moment, as it will go by in the blink of an eye and before you know it, you too will have a 12-year old. The past 12 years have in ways felt like minutes, but in others like an entire lifetime. We have been blessed with two amazing and completely different daughters. Reilly, our firstborn, is so smart, determined, and always mature beyond her years. A perfect student and competitive gymnast, Reilly is always up for the next challenge; she definitely keeps us on our toes! Take these portraits, for example; a few nights ago, she informed us she wanted a photo shoot the next day. She immediately started tearing apart her bedroom, choosing outfits. At that particular moment I wasn’t exactly in the mood to style her session, and will admit, I wasn’t into it at the moment. Morning came and she had clearly not lost momentum, as she plugged in the curling iron and sat on the stool in the kitchen, beckoning me to curl her hair for her photo shoot. I curled and sent her and James and their way to the studio (I have learned from experience that things go much smoother if I stay home for these sessions!) I have to admit, I was very pleasantly surprised when James started showing me the images. These images represent more than just my 12-year old daughter; they represent our daughter becoming an independent young woman. Looking back, I’m glad I wasn’t “into it” that day, because had I been, these images may have reflected too much of me and not enough of Reilly. Happy birthday Reilly! We love you!!All books are in boxes. I filled 13 more today. It has been a dirty work. So much dust was everywhere. R came again to pick up the stuff that I discarded and that she can sell. The revenue goes to Africa, Ghana. I also gave her my coffee machine that I never used. I filter my coffee. I'm not such a fan to use a machine for every little task.
My part is done for now.
Tomorrow strong men will come and they will move all the boxes, the 3 tables and the Indonesian chest. 3 shelves will survive the move, too.
I know that I'm not lazy, yet I felt reluctant to pack. So I wondered why. My issue was that I always feared to put too much stuff in the boxes. I care for the backs of those who do this heavy job. I'll tell them tomorrow to open the boxes and to make 2 out of 1 if they are too heavy.
Sometimes I wondered if I were crazy to schlep so many things in bags to the new flat. Yet it made sense. The rooms are full of boxes only with the books.
Tomorrow I'll go to yoga first.The Mysore classes are too good, I don't want to miss a single one.
My E is so nice and he'll be on time in the flat to open the door for the packer. I can join a bit later.
My work starts again when the flat is empty. Then I can clean it. And I can unpack the boxes in the new flat. That is only a few I can unpack as we still need shelves.
I had to check it. Exactly 20 years I lived in the flat that we're leaving now. It has been my first flat with 2 rooms. And I so loved my little balcony.
A bye-bye ritual will happen......probably a last photo shooting in the empty rooms......

It's easy to put your back out packing and shifting so you are wise to be cautious. Can't wait to see a few pics of your new flat. How did you find it? What made you want it? We've just rented a flat in the South of France starting October - so exciting. Discarding every day :-))
Care for the back is important, there is a way to pick heavy stuff, but sometime too rush to think to do the right way, it is a nice view, hope you move to a better one, enjoy mysore.Look Inside | Enlarge Cover

Did.In lyrical prose that brings each remote and alluring locale vividly to life, Walker takes us on a thrilling natural history expedition to witness firsthand the supporting evidence Hoffman has pieced together. That evidence, he argues, shows that 700 million years ago the Earth did indeed freeze over completely, becoming a giant “snowball,” in the worst climatic catastrophe in history. Even more startling is his assertion that, instead of ending life on Earth, this global deep freeze was the trigger for the Cambrian Explosion, the hitherto unexplained moment in geological time when a glorious profusion of complex life forms first emerged from the primordial ooze.In a story full of intellectual intrigue, we follow the irascible but brilliant Hoffman and a supporting cast of intrepid geologists as they scour the planet, uncovering clue after surprising clue. We travel to a primeval lagoon at Shark Bay in western Australia, where dolphins cavort with swimmers every morning at seven and “living rocks” sprout out of the water like broccoli heads; to the desolate and forbidding ice fields of a tiny Arctic archipelago seven hundred miles north of Norway; to the surprising fossil beds that decorate Newfoundland’s foggy and windswept coastline; and on to the superheated salt pans of California’s Death Valley.Through the contours of these rich and varied landscapes Walker teaches us to read the traces of geological time with expert eyes, and we marvel at the stunning feats of resilience and renewal our remarkable planet is capable of. Snowball Earth is science writing at its most gripping and enlightening.From the Hardcover edition.

Let’s say money is no object this holiday season. And you just want to forget about inexpensive Christmas gifts and go all out and buy the most expensive gift for everyone on your list!
While I was shopping the deals on Amazon yesterday, I started browsing the most expensive Amazon Christmas gifts and found it very amusing and entertaining.
In case you just happen to be looking for some ideas (or you need a break from holiday shopping and need a laugh), here are the most expensive Amazon holiday gifts by department to ship to your friends and family this year!
Most Expensive Gift Ideas
- Baby: Elite Serenity Bath Tub: $84,000.00. The person who wrote the review thinking they bought an oil drain bucket for $84 is entertaining.
- Beauty: Photo Therapy Machine: $25,999.00. The day I checked, it was on sale for 13% off, so if you’re in the market for one of these, I guess you should buy it on sale, right?
- Clothing: Russian Sable Fur Coat: $46,500.00. These coats are on close out, so you’ll save almost $40,000!
- Electronics: LifeSize Room Video Conferencing Kit (No Phone): $10,649,998.94. No phone? For that price, can’t they throw in the phone?
- Grocery and Gourmet Food: Sticky Fingers, Scone Mix Original – 12 Pack: $9,005.38. I’m a big fan of buying in bulk; if you calculate the unit price, it brings the cost down to $1,500.90 for each one.
- Home, Garden, and Pets: 1.5″ Rhodochrosite Carved Crystal Skull: $4,800,566.00. Nobody on my list specifically asked for for a crystal skull, but I’m sure it would make a good stocking stuffer!
- Jewelry: Certified Diamond (Oval, Fair cut, 15.19 carats, G color, VS1 clarity): $789,780.00. Thinking of proposing? You can usually get a better deal on diamonds online, right?
- Industrial and Scientific: N82S212N: $348,018.75. The only description is a General-Purpose Static RAM, so I’m guessing it must be popular enough that it will sell itself.
- Musical Instruments: Bob Dylan Hand-Signed Series – Set of 7 Harmonicas: $25,000.00. My three year old asked for an instrument for Christmas. Do you think he’d treat these harmonicas with love?
- Music: Introducing the Beatles: $125,000.00. It’s in vinyl, so if you are planning on giving this as a gift, maybe you’ll want to combine it with a classic turntable too.
- Office Products: Pez Outlaw, Life on the Run – Movie Rights: $315,000.00. I noticed they are also selling the book rights too, but it looks like that will set you back another $315k.
- Shoes: BALLY Mae Bowling Bag: $3,195.00. Why is the most expensive pair of shoes a bowling bag?
- Software: Avocent DSView – License: $140,866.48. Software to provide “data centers with secure, centralized management for physical and virtual IT assets.” Ok. Next.
- Toys and Games: Sports Play Modular Playground: $50,441.40. Skip the swingset, you can put an entire playground in you back yard. However, with over $7,000 in shipping charges, it looks like this playground won’t qualify for Amazon Prime free shipping!
- Home Improvement: Meyda Tiffany 8 Arm Chandelier: $360,000.00. There’s free shipping on the chandelier, but I can’t tell if they will install it for you.
- Video Games: DSi TekCase in Pink: $99,999.00. Since there are two color choices, you might as well buy the black version for $53.89.
- Watches: Men’s Portuguese Tourbillon Mystère Watch: $88,800.00. I love the fact that if you buy 2, they’ll send you a $25 Amazon Gift Certificate!
Just for clarification, I did have to skip some of the most expensive gifts, since it appeared that sellers were trying to list a maximum price just to be at the top of the list. Where possible, I excluded those to try and find the actual most expensive gift ideas.
Ok, now that we’ve had some fun checking out the expensive Christmas gifts, let’s head back to reality and focus on our frugal holiday gifts for family and friends.
If you had an unlimited budget this holiday season, which gift would you give to someone on your list?
That’s a great list – I’ll take one of each. I wonder if anyone has actually purchased one of these items at that price…
What great gifts! I could think of many other uses for my monies. I guess if you have that kind of money just hanging around you might like some of theses items.Sijun Forums :: Viewing profile Log in to check your private messages Sijun Forums Forum Index Viewing profile :: captainneil Avatar All about captainneil junior member Joined: 08 Jan 2001 Total posts: 1[0.00% of total / 0.00 posts per day] Find all posts by captainneil Location: Everett,wa,usa Website: Occupation: student Interests: 3d,apinting,drawing,music,sculpture,metalworking,family,school,learning, Contact captainneShare this on Facebook Tweet this on Twitter Share this on Google Plus Share this on LinkedIn Print this article Email this article Increase size things turn exciting...

I'm Jaya. Single and 35, pregnant with first child. The BD broke up with me the day before I confirmed the pregnancy. Looking for support. Have just made the decision to do it on my own. He is slowly accepting that he will be a father, but may not support us at all, except what is required by law. I'm scared that this will be a very lonely, difficult phase of my life. Researching my support networks, reaching out to friends.
Hoping someone will come help after baby is born (due in Mid-Late Oct 2011). Sister is on board for 10 days or so, but I need to find a roommate or someone who is willing to be a help so I can shower and shop and poop, and such. (I hear those things are hard after the baby is born). Getting on Medicaid now and starting financial planning. I need to simplify my life and prepare for this new chapter. Starting to lift out of the heartbreak and depression and feel excitement about the new life inside. I know the baby is one amazing being, to want to come in through these circumstances.
Planning a natural, unmedicated, possibly water birth. I'm very much into natural and organic lifestyle. My work is in holistic healing.
Luckily, I'm feeling pretty good now in my first trimester (almost 8 weeks at this writing), exhausted, but no morning sickness, just delicate queasiness sometimes.
Anybody else do pregnancy single?
Thanks for reading! Blessings,
Jaya: Doha Gateway

When it comes to high school football, like many things in Western Pennsylvania, we're proud of our provincialism.
Pittsburgh is a big city with small-town values. We never forget where we came from, which is why we gravitate back to our beginnings for football.
It's why Joe Namath returned to Beaver Falls to have his jersey retired and Dan Marino's hangs in Central Catholic's locker room, why Hopewell's stadium is named for Tony Dorsett and Penn Hills' training center for Bill Fralic, why Darrelle Revis hosts a youth camp at The Pit in Aliquippa and Steve Breaston and Ryan Mundy one at the Wolvarena in Turtle Creek.
There is an allure to the lore, the Friday night tradition of witnessing the game's greats before they become great.
What makes Western Pennsylvania high school football so special? It's the fabric that connects a community, linking one generation to the next. It's your family, friends and neighbors — sometimes all of the above — playing together one last time.
That's why Trib Total Media covers prep sports, especially football, with the same passion with which you follow it.
The Trib has devoted the resources to provide Western Pennsylvania's indispensable coverage of high school sports.
We brought you a comprehensive, 152-page football preview section, and will have 29 reporters covering games Friday night.
They will feed updates to my new iPreps blog for continuous live coverage online at blog.triblive.com/iPreps.
This column will continue to be featured as the Skylight Spotlight segment on WPXI-TV.

MIL? A high-level of brand integrity and a diverse product mix, coupled to a closely managed retail expansion programme designed to ensure the brand’s pulling power as markets mature.
Not too Big, Not too Visible
Part of Prada’s current advantage is that in key growth markets, like China, the brand isn’t yet too big or too visible — especially in comparison to some of its luxury peers. With 21 stores in China, Prada has half as many stores in the country as Louis Vuitton, which has 43, and around a third the number of stores as Burberry, which has more than 60 stores.
As a result, Prada is better positioned than many luxury brands to tackle the rapid maturation of what, only a few years ago, was very much a status-led market. Indeed, whereas highly-branded leather goods were once a dependable ticket to huge sales growth, 2012 has shown that luxury labels can suffer from being too visible, even in fast-emerging markets.
For example, Louis Vuitton, which some analysts have described as overexposed, lost some of its lustre with Chinese consumers in 2012. Last week, Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer of LVMH, which owns the brand, stated in a conference call with analysts that “at this point in time we miss demand from Asia,” reporting only a 3 percent revenue rise in the group’s leather goods division, 2 percentage points lower than analyst expectations.
Planned Retail Expansion and Margin Benefits
A key driver of Prada’s success is the company’s ambitious but meticulously planned retail expansion in both mature and emerging markets. In the 2012 financial year, Prada Group, which also includes Miu Miu and Church’s, opened 78 new stores and plans for another 200 over the next 3 years, reflecting a gradual shift away from the wholesale channel which commands lower margins and offers less control over the brand’s retail experience.
“[We do] not have any secret ingredients; the success of the group is the result of a strategy, that we have been pursuing consistently over the years, which is focused on geographic expansion of directly operated stores and on unwavering commitment to quality and style,” said an official spokesperson for Prada when asked about the company’s formula for success.
“The focus on retail, moving progressively away from wholesale, is not a matter of margin: it's an unavoidable choice if you manage true luxury brands. We are expanding the presence of our brands where we deem they are under represented, not just in emerging markets, but also in the more traditional ones where it's crucial to have a strong presence to capture the flow of travelers,” the spokesperson added.
But, compared to other luxury brands, the risk of Prada’s overexposure is lower because of its diverse product mix. Indeed, unlike other luxury brands, Prada is not built around dominant signifiers, like Louis Vuitton’s monogram bags or Hermès’ scarves and leather goods.
Creative-Business Partnership
Perhaps the most important factor behind Prada’s success, however, is the powerful partnership between Mrs Prada, and her husband, Patrizio Bertelli, the company’s chief executive.
Together, they manage to deftly maintain the balance between creativity and commerciality. Mrs Prada creates instantly recognisable seasonal design signatures and creative concepts that command the respect of editors, while Mr Bertelli finds a way of translating her creative vision into products that carry this energy forward and get the hearts of consumers racing.
The proof is in the pudding. A wide spectrum of consumers, from gallerists to investment bankers to young starlets keep coming back to Prada season after season.

“The conversation ended with the boss informing the employee that if black people are taking any type of civil service exam, they are given more points then white people taking the same exam, just because they’re black. To which the employee replied ‘What because they’re stupid they get extra points? That’s so unfair! Stupid people are just stupid people!’”

(WVLT) -- More than hundred new jobs are coming to Blount Co. On Wednesday, Surface Igniter LLC, a pioneer in the development of the silicone carbide igniter, announced it will move its headquarters and manufacturing operations to Maryville.
“It is truly refreshing to work with such professionals as we have in this decision to move our plant from Puerto Rico to Tennessee,” said Surface Igniter Chairman of the Board George Hanna. “It is not an easy decision to make, but they have made it as painless as possible."
Surface Igniters the leading manufacturer of hot surface igniters for heating, cooking, clothes dryers, and BBQ grills, according to the Blount Partnership, who made the announcement at a special event Wednesday morning.
"When I can meet with decision makers from city, county and state, at a single meeting, it is truly impressive! We look forward to establishing our company in Blount County, and becoming a good citizen in the state of Tennessee,” said Hanna.
Work will begin almost immediately on their new 55,000 sq. foot building, 1709 Henry G. Lane Street, Maryville. Surface Igniters plans to hire 54 people right off the bat and doubling that number over the next three years.
The company will be hiring maintenance and furnace operators within the next two weeks and additional positions in October and November.

Fans of Evans' "The Raid: Redemption" will more than enjoy seeing the sequel's extended beat downs and bloody carnage, along with the addition of new badass characters such as "Bat Man" and "Hammer Woman" who engage the movie's hero, Rama, in a spectacularly choreographed must-see hallway battle that rivals the hallway fight scene in the Korean version of "Old Boy."
However, although the visuals have improved over the first movie (thanks in large part to the movie being shot on RED Scarlet-X and RED Epic cameras), the plot and storyline are convoluted in this sequel.
Leading man Iko Uwais is a great physical actor who excels at martial arts action fight sequences, but giving him more dialogue in the sequel was also not a great idea.
In fact, if there's one major flaw with "The Raid 2," it's Evans proclivity for having too many talking heads scenes with an assortment of tough guy mobster characters rambling on ad nauseum trying to explain their motives and agendas.
Unfortunately, as slick and cool as these mobsters appear in "The Raid 2," no amount of swirling camera movements, atmospheric lighting and colorful set design can cover up the painfully obvious fact that we aren't watching Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci or Ray Liotta chewing up that scenery with great dialogue.
Nevertheless, Evans does pay homage to the works of auteurs such as Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Nicholas Winding Refn and Takeshi Kitano, not to mention Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather" trilogy.
If "The Raid" was Evans' equivalent of "Mean Streets" than "The Raid 2" is his "Goodfellas" complete with plenty of virtuoso cinematic flourishes and epic fight sequences that will satisfy most fans of the genre.
"The Raid 2" opens in theaters on March 28.Carnival Cruise Lines Invites Fans to Kick Back, Have Fun and 'Live the Carnival Breeze Life'

I rarely ever play Standard, but played just enough events to know that my beloved Br Control deck would wreck everything except Caw Blade, which is obviously a bad thing for this event. I borrowed a bunch of Vampires from some friends before leaving NC for some leave over Memorial Day and didn't play any magic until the event.
My Standard list, which nobody should care about because the format blows, can be found here almost at the bottom of the page:
I decided to play about the same thing that put me into the T8 in Charlotte, despite having access to all the cool blue cards or anything else I wanted, because I was familiar with all the intricacies of the deck and thought it would do pretty well. I didn't expect to see so many similar decks, despite running different colors. I guess that's what I get for being out of the loop for a couple weeks. I made a lot of changes to my at about 12:30 the morning of the tournament and didn't get to test any of them. They all sounded good on paper and most seemed pretty decent. I'm not sure that 3 Mirran Crusader is the right number, a lot of the time I just wanted Serra Avenger. I went up to 22 lands and decided to forego Chrome Mox and Aether Vial and pretty much just start at 2 mana anyway. Bitterblossom and Batterskull are amazing when they hit the table. I didn't have really have much in the board for the UWx SFM decks and wish I would have just picked up a Manriki Gusari or whatever the hell they're called before hand. I went with War and Peace over Body and Mind in the main because of the massive amounts of damage I was doing to myself. Turned out to be pretty ok.
Here;s my Legacy list that I didn't do anywhere near as well I had hoped with, but almost all the matches went to a close game 3. I also made 2 match losing misplays with it which would have put me in the money. Such is life.

I didn't really take any notes and I threw out my pad with everyone's name on it after the tournament.
Standard R1: Paul Lake with Fanau Shaman/Birthing Pod
G1. I don't remember much other than I won and Paul put off pretty big creeper vibe.
G2: T2 Lotus Cobra sticks and he ramps into a T4 Frost Titan followed by a T5 Metamorph Titan. I lose
G3: It's pretty close and I have a Highborn, Bloodghast and Viscera Seer but don't have the land drops to abuse the combo. He lands Obstinate Baloth and has the ground pretty clogged up when he Fauna Shamans up a Wurmcoil. EoT I sac Ghast to scry and drain him for 2 showing Act of Aggression! I take his Wurmcoil and swing with it putting me back to around 10, then sac it to reveal a second Act of Aggression! I take his Baloth and swing with it and a token I think, then sac the Baloth. He plays another Baloth and blocks my deathtouch token with it. Eventually I get there.
After the match I go over to Hannah Murray's booth to see if she's gotten a chance to start on my Mishra's Factories yet when Paul walks up and starts bitching about how his opponent was so lucky and a complete retard for not abusing the Highborn/Seer/Bloodghast combo. I inform I didn't have the land drops to abuse it or I would've. Paul makes it into the category of MTG playing tools as well as being a creeper.
1-0
R2: David Thomas with Caw Blade. He was a decent fellow and we talked several times between rounds over the next 2 days.
I don't really remember anything except I ended up fighting through 2 Gideon's and Day of Judgment, or maybe it was the other way around, in G3.
2-0
R3: Jacob Baugh, Fauna Shaman and Vengevinges, paired down against a 1-0-1
G1 He mulls to 5 for the third time on the day. I win.
G2 He mulls to 6 and wins.
G3 He mulls to 6 again and I win
3-0
R4: Jon Agley with UR Splinter Twin
G1: I keep a pretty aggressive hand with a Lacerator and another one drop as well as a Ghast and Highborn and a Dark Tutelage. It gets there.
G2: 2 Lacerators in my opener with a Highborn and another 3rd Lacerator on the third turn does the trick.
4-0. Woot! For not playing standard I think I'm pretty good at this game.
Legacy R5: Corbin Hosler with Fish
G1: He's on the play and gets the nuts 3(ish) Lord draw and swarms me pretty fast.
G2: I win. Don't really remember anything about it.
G3 He my StP on his LoA gets misstepped. I misplay by not playing SFM ASAP and I think it ends up getting forced. In the end I die to my own BB.
4-1,
R6: Pat Sullivan with Zoo
G1: I flip 2 Mirran Crusaders and a Vindicate to Bob and take a bunch from my BB. He pushes through.
G2: I get a Jitte on Faerie tokens and eventually transfer it to an Avenger. I'm somewhere around 2 when he plays his own Jitte and I gain 4-6 life in response. I get a Sword of War and Peace and equip it to the Avenger to get there.
G3: We both go to 6 and I keep a greedy 1 fetch, StP, Inquisition, SFM, Bob, and BB. He plays Nacatl. I gamble, knowing he's playing Wasteland, and grab a Scrub to StP the Nacatl. He plays another land I think a Goyf. I don't draw a land and play Inquisition seeing both Jitte and Null Rod as well as a Kird Ape and Wasteland :( I take the Jitte and get Wastelanded. I don't draw another land and die very quickly. Lesson learned.
Pat was a real nice guy and we talked a couple times throughout the rest of the tourney. Shortly after the match I walked up on him, AJ Sacher (who crushed me in the T8 of Charlotte), and someone else talking about guy who was real cool. AJ said the guy had written a report and then lost his train of thought when he saw me and headed for the pisser. I asked if they were talking about me and Pat said they were. I told him AJw was probably gonna tell them that I had written a report and said that he wasn't a total douche bag like I had expected. He laughed and said that I must have been familiar with AJ's work.
4-2,
R7: UWr Stoneblade, Ken Adams
G1: I keep a hand with 3 StP and I think a SFM. He's on the play and drops a Grim. Not what I want to see at all but it's ok for now. I fetch a plains off Flooded strand to StP the Mancer and he puts me on Uw Fish. The plan is working! He drops another Lavamancer and I StP it again. Believe it or not T3 goes exactly the same as one and two. He checks my yard to see both other StPs and Lavamancer #3 gets added to the exiled pile! Eventually I get there.
G2: We go back and forth for a while. Thoughtseize him seeing 2 Vendilion Cliques and some other stuff. I take something else. He doesn't play the Clique at the end of my draw step and I draw and play Avenger. He curses himself and I waste a land to put us both at two despite having SoFI in my hand. I wanted to keep him off Jace and figured I would draw another land before he hit 2. I didn't another land... ever. He Firespouts the ground, killing Bob and something else, maybe a revoker and we race until I have to block the Clique. I lose with him at 3.
G3: He's gets a pretty solid hold with a Lavamancer and Manriki to kill all my equipment.
4-3
R8: Some tool playing Fish
He offers to draw so we both make day 2. I think about it but decide that I need every win I can get if I want to make some money and decline the offer.
G1: He wins the roll and wrecks me.
G2: I return the favor. He offers to draw again and I decline the offer despite the temptation. He drops a LoA and a leveled CC. I respond with SFM for Batterskull and we're off to the races. Eventually he has to block with his LoA but draws another Commander. I Vindicate the first one and drop a SoFI for the game. He extend my hand, without a comment because he's distraught, and he refuses to shake it with a "Naah man, whatever." Oh well.
5-3. I make day 2 in 25th place and bit deflated but with high hopes for the next day.
Day 2
R1 Legacy: Anthony Avitolla RWU CounterTop
G1: I win the roll and drop a SFM on T2 for a Batterskull. He plays Pithing Needle on his second turn. Eventually I'm able to get there anyway.
G2: I again play a T2 Mystic for Batterskull and it dies. I can't get a third land for the life of me and he drops Vedalken Shackles while I have 2 SFM, Bob, Vindicate, Mirran Crusader, SoWaP, and something else. I don't draw a land decide that it's much better to chuck the sword than give him Bob or a Mystic. He's digging pretty hard with his top the whole, after countering a Revoker earlier. I draw a land Vindicate the Shackles giving me the ability to actually play this game again. He assembles Counter top after Bob resolves. He spins the top to draw something and I'm able to land a Revoker, to which he tries to respond by topping and I remind him it's not in play right now. His blind CB flips don't get anything the rest of the game and I pull it out.
6-3
R2: Pat Cox with Zoo (he won the whole thing)
G1 Zoo does it's thing and I board in all my good hate for it.
G2 We both mull to 5, which is obviously better for him, and I keep with a Fetch and a Wasteland and a Mirran Crusader. I fetch up Scrub hoping to not get blown out by Wasteland again, turns out he doesn't play them. He plays a Loam Lion. I inquisition and take the only non-land card in his hand: Pridemage. I play a Mystic for Batterskull and he has the removal. I drop a Meekstone, which he has to read, and take another hit from the Lion before sending it to the fields. I play Revoker naming Pridemage! Hooray now his only out to Meekstone is K Grip, which I don't even know if he's playing, or burn and another Pridemage. He plays a 3/3 Nacatl and swings with it. At the end of my turn I find out he is indeed playing K Grip, as a 1 of... how lucky, and his guy untaps. I send it farming with the lion and he drops a Goyf. this whole time I'm sitting on 2 Crusaders and an Avenger just waiting on a second white source while my lands are Scrub, Volrath's Stronghold, 2 Wasteland, 2 Swamp. Very frustrating. He Lightning Helixes my Revoker, hits me with Goyf, and Helixes me for the game.
6-4
R3: Ari Lax with ANT
G1: He asks me if I know what he's playing and I say either ANT or High Tide and he goes on to tell me how miserable of a deck High Tide is while I'm mulliganing. I don't have any discard or hate but keep it anyway mostly out of stupidity. I have no pressure and he goes off.
G2 I board in a ton of hate and he notices that I'm prepared while asking if I'm playing TS. I tell him that I probably should have had some in the board and he deduces that they're main. I mull to 4, I think, and keep 2 lands, Revoker and Canonist. I drop Canonist on T2 followed by Revoker on LED, Bob, Revoker on Petal. He's at 6 with lethal on the board, I'm at 18 due to Bob flipping Revoker, he bounces Canonist at EoT and plays his entire hand, not able to use the LED he plays, to Infernal for the Tendrils at 18. We both comment that despite hating Standard we're looking forward to the tournament returning to the stupid format.
6-5
R4 Standard: Micheal Rooks, GR Eldrazi Tokens and enchantment to sac for 2 damage.
G1 He does a good job of muddying up the ground pretty quick with tokens but I'm able to get him to 12 before I can't swing through for anything. The situation looks pretty grim with my little Bloodghast and Highborn against 3 GR manlands when I rip a Seer and combo out on him in two or three turns.
G2: He gets 2 Lifestaff a Mortarpod and the enchantment that lets him pay 2 to hit something for 2 when he sacs a creature and I'm just not able to push through the life gain.
G3: I bring back the Manic Vandal I sided out as well as the 4th and beat him after he has sac 5 permanents, plus tokens, to kill my Obliterator.
7-5
R5: Eric Williams with UWR Splinter Twin/ Caw SB
G1: I win by always killing the Twin before he untaps.
G2: He lands a Sun Titan and swings with it once to bring back 2 Cunning Sparkmage. It's enough.
G3: He gets a Batterskull early and I can't draw a red source for the Manic Vandal in my opening hand. I get 5 Swamps before finally getting a Lavaclaw reaches which gets Tech edged before I can use it. I set up the drain combo to keep myself alive and gets a Sword of Feast and Famine on his skull then drops another Batterskull. Needless to say it doesn't end well for the bad guys.
7-6
R8: Kenny Mayer with Dark Blade. Playing for a shot at T32 and $500
G1: I keep an aggressive hand and get Inquisitioned turn one taking my Dismember, my only removal. I drop a Pulse Seeker instead of Lacerator and he plays SFM for Batterskull...FML.
G2: I sideboard wrong but at this point I'm kind of on tilt and Kenny seems like a good guy. I just really want to hit him with Obliterator a couple times and hope he doesn't draw a Jace. I get Inquisitioned again and eventually he gets a Jace and kills all my dudes. Jace gets up to ultimate, eats a Lightning Bolt and he plays a Mirran Crusader. I attempt to scoop but Kenny says let's just play it. Sure. He equips Crusader with SoFaF and I beat Jace for 2 with a Manic Vandal. He wins.
I tell him congratulations and he comments that he'll probably be 33rd anyway, to which I respond with "You could've scooped to me if that's the case." I wish him luck and bounce so I can get out of the garage in under 8 hours.
7-7
I didn't make any money but I had a good time and met a bunch of cool guys. It made me smile when AJ told me he didn't win a match day one and dropped. I also laughed pretty hard when I found out Kenny Mayer actually did make 33rd, though I was really hoping he would make some money on the weekend. I'm disappointed with my Legacy showing, but tow of my losses were to the winner and a T8 competitor so I guess it's not that bad. Maybe I'll make it into the Charlotte Invitational and redeem myself.

And while it is a busy week with writing posts, visiting other blogs, reading the special coverage at ArmchairBEA.com, joing Twitter parties, and, of course, entering GIVEAWAYS! it is also a great time to remember why we love book blogging - the community. I'm looking forward to reconnecting with some bloggers that I have lost contact with through the year as well as meeting new bloggers.
It is free and easy to participate, just follow these steps.
1. Go to ArmchairBEA.com and register
The event runs Wednesday, May 27 through Monday, June 1. I think with a weekend in the middle of it will make it easier for those who work to participate and I hope there will be a Twitter party or two planned during that time. They have chosen a theme for the week: DIVERSITY. I think you will find that there is a lot of diversity among book bloggers. I have met bloggers through the event from every walk of life and many different countries. Some blog only about Classics or translated literature, others focus more on specific genres or target audience (i.e. kid lit). It is fun to see all the different ways people blog about books.
2. Start working on your posts (it is a HUGE time saver to schedule your posts in advance)
Seriously, with all the parties and blogs to visit, you don't want to be writing your posts during the event. This year's event is a bit shorter, but it will still be exhausting and you want plenty of time to visit the other blogs (that is really the point of the event). You don't have to write on each topic each day, but for each topic you do write on you are entered into a drawing to win prizes from the supporters (remember to submit your link to the linky every day). The topics are already posted (follow the link to get post ideas for each topic) so you can get started now.
Wednesday: Introductions & Library Love
Thursday: Visual Expressions & Social Media
Friday: Character Chatter & Blogging Q&A
Saturday: Giveaways & Book to Movie Adaptations
Sunday: 2015 Wrap-up
Monday: Survey
I highly recommend doing the introduction post and they have already posted a list of questions to do your own self interview.
If you don't have time to work on your posts in advance, then consider writing short posts. Really, people will probably thank you for writing a paragraph or two on the day's topic. There's usually about 500 participants which is a lot of blog reading.
3. Have Fun!
The event is all about having fun and interacting the community. Try to visit a few blogs each day and leave a comment. Try to make at least on Twitter Party, but be warned they can be CRAZY with a bunch of people talking at once.
Don't stress and do what you can do. Don't worry about the right or wrong way to participate.
I hope I will see you next week!Officials with the Transportation Agency of Monterey County are engaged in a $300,000 study focused on roundabouts.
Currently, there are about 20 different intersections throughout the county being looked at for possible roundabouts. All 12 cities in the county have areas that county transportation officials are studying.
Among those are Highway 68 and 17 Mile Drive, as well as Central Avenue and First Street in Pacific Grove.

Amid this sweet Sweet 16 action on a Thursday night, we've got coaching rumors swirling about.
News, too.
And leave it to Iowa State's athletic director to send along a positive message regarding that team's coaching situation. Jamie Pollard broke the news -- via Twitter -- that Fred Hoiberg would be going nowhere for the near future. And very well the long-term, as well.
Here's what Pollard tweeted Thursday night.
Excited to share with #CycloneNation that Coach Hoiberg has agreed to a 10 year, $20 million contract to stay a Cyclone! Release forthcoming— Jamie Pollard (@IASTATEAD) March 29, 2013
Hoiberg's name had recently been floated as a candidate for the newly opened position at Minnesota. So much for that.
"When I returned to the university three seasons ago, it was a dream come true,” Hoiberg said in a."
Hoiberg has won 23 games in each of the past two seasons and has taken the team to the Round of 32 in both campaigns, the first time the program has done that in more than a decade. The school says the full terms of the contract will be released "at a later date."Professional Footballers’ Association issues advice to players on homophobic language

M.M. asks from Denton, TX on July 30, 2007
Would You Take a Child to a Funeral Home?
I am facing an upcoming decision and wanted some advice.
Would you or have you ever taken small children to a funeral home? I have a very difficult decision coming, my grandpa(who my children are close to) is probably not going to make it through the week. He has been on a ventilator since surgery 9 days ago and is fading everyday.
We will be traveling to Michigan when he passes and I am not sure what to do with my children. We have a very big family and there will be 2 full days at the funeral home. Other family members in the past have brought their children but I am leaning toward not taking my children at such an early age.
My 19 month old son will not remember it or know where he is but my 4 year old daughter is very mature and will definitely know. I don't have anyone to watch them if I don't take them so then I would need to stay back at the house with them and not be there to support my family.
Has anyone been in this situation?
Thanks,
M.

I'm sorry your family is going through such a difficult time. My only suggestion is that perhaps a family memember in Michigan has a trusted friend that could babysit your children during the time that you are at the funeral home. That is what we did when had an out of town funeral. That way your children are with you, but aren't placed in a situation that they aren't old enough to understand or handle.
D.B. answers from Dallas on July 31, 2007
Another thing you might want to consider is getting some childrens books that discuss death to read with your 4 year old daughter ahead of the trip to help her understand what has happened. I did this when we had a death in the family when my daughter was 3 and it helped. I believe I found them at Family Christian Store.

My FIL passed away last year when our son was 2 1/2. He didn't have a viewing, but he did have an open casket during the ceremony. My dad took our son around the cemetary while we had the funeral.
My DH & I didn't feel that it was necessary for him to see the body. I didn't want me son to remember his pawpaw in his casket.
I believe it's a personal decision though!!!
J.W. answers from Dallas on July 31, 2007
my best advice would be to be aware of the feelings of your other family members - my grandfather passed away in november and then my great aunt passed away in february though it was very nice to have my girls around before and after the funeral i was sensitive to the feelings of others and felt it would be inappropriate to have them at the funeral home, the funeral, or the burial (my oldest just turned 3 and the youngest was born 2 weeks before my great aunt passed away) - if they are welcomed to come and you feel they won't be disruptive or distracting to others then bring them - if you were to bring them to the funeral home would you really be able to be supportive or would you be giving the kiddos all your attention - funeral homes can also be crowded with others viewings going on - others may not be as receptive to young children being there - i know this is a very hard time - i am so sorry - my prayers are with you and your family through this difficult time
K.R. answers from Dallas on July 31, 2007
My daughter is 5 and my son is 3. My father pasted awhile on May 4th. My husband stayed home with the kids and I went to Chicago. You are right about your daughter. It would be traumatic and confusing because someone she's close to is going to look very strange, completely unresponsive, and will not open his eyes. My daughter is very bright and she knows that she is not going to see Grampa again. That was upsetting enough. She and my son very distress to see me so upset just trying to pack and make travel arrangements. It was traumatizing to my son because I could tell by the look on his face when he would look at me. As I was packing, he didn't say anything but he would come to me and hug on my leg as I was folding my clothes.
Your grandfather is still alive and regardless of how he is kept alive, he's not gone. When he does die or is taken off the ventilator, it will hit you and the rest of the family that he is now truly gone. You will have a hard enough time handling this situation yourself. And it's better for your children to know that he's not going to see them for a long time. That he is in a special place called Heaven and he'll be waiting to see them later.
I'm sure that you probably have some great pictures of your grandfather with your children. That's what they need to see, not an embalmed body at this stage of their lives.
My daughter stills asks about when is Danny comming home. Danny was our dog. She has pictures of him and her. And occassionally she will ask why is he not coming home. So we talk about heaven again. She has even asked recently if she could go see Danny in Heaven for a little while. Trust me. Your children do not need to be at the funeral. They will learn about death soon enough. I am a Christian who knows that God spared my life a few years ago and I know without any doubt he did it and he did it so my children would not grow-up without their Momma. Someone going to heaven to them should only be a wonderful place and image in their minds with reassurance that they will go there eventually too. The real sight of a dead body would only scare them unnecessarily.
N.F. answers from Dallas on July 30, 2007
The age is different but when my grandfather died my son was 6, my family is very close as well. When we arrived at my grandparents house my son went to all the rooms until I asked him what he was looking for and he responded he was looking for Pipo (my grandfather). I explained that he is not here anymore, that he is in heaven but still lives in our hearts, and he says I know, but where is his body I want to see him. That was when I decided he was ready to go see him at the funeral home. My son was a ray of sunshine, he said a prayer in front of my grandfather and offered kisses and hugs to my father, my grandmother, my aunts and my cousins. The other day while speaking to my grandmother she mentioned how much it meant to her to have him around. Again the ages are different, but I I believe you should ask your daughter what she wants to do, explain the situation and let her make the decision, if she truly is an old soul, as my son is, she will be able to tell you what she wants to do.

My DD has been to three funerals in the past 1.5 years - we have lost 4 grandparents in that much time, but she did fine at all. Just sense their feelings and let them stay in an adjacent room if need be with a friend. Sorry for your loss.
T.O. answers from Dallas on July 30, 2007
It is up to you to feel out the situation with your kids... but here's my opinion...
Your kids are too young to few the body or wait through a long ceremony.
However, I was just at a funeral/viewing in March and at most homes, there's a large lobby area and a refreshment room outside of the viewing area and the funeral service. There were lots of younger cousins and toddlers running around the halls and in the refreshment rooms. Relatives took turns spending time with the young ones... a pleansant relief for the relatives... while the adults went to the viewing and spent time with the bereaved.
At the actual service, there is bound to be teen cousins around that don't want to sit through the service, but hang out in the lobby with the younger ones.
I think it's good to have them there and explain where you're going, why you're sad, etc etc but don't make them sit through it.
If you don't have a large family with younger cousins then leave the kids at home with a sitter or trade off with your husband.
R.C. answers from Los Angeles on July 30, 2007
My SIL passed away suddenly last year and our children were 2, 5, and 7 at the time. During the viewing they all sat in the back with some family members and my 7 year old asked to walk up to the casket so he could say goodbye. At the funeral, they sat with other members of the family while my husband and I sat up front with his parents. My in-laws said having them around really helped during such a rough time for them. I hope you make a decision that works best for your family..

Question - how can I stop frosting from melting? More so the vanilla frosting? I have noticed that once I put my cupcakes in a cake pan with a lid for storage the vanilla/white frosting tends to melt after a day or so. It does not seem to effect the chocolate. Any idea's? Should I not be storing them in a cake pan with a lid, should they remain in the fridge until ready to serve? So many questions....
Thanks!
Ashley
What kind of frosting are you using? Is it an all butter buttercream, does it have crisco, or is it a whipped frosting?
I keep my cupcakes in the refrigerator until about an hour before I use deliver them. Leftovers go back in the fridge, and get used within a couple of days.
I've never had a problem with my frosting melting, but when I put toppings or candy on my cupcakes and leave them out too long, the candy does melt.
I usually use a buttercream, but when I am lazy, I use vanilla frosting in the can. and it seems to be what's in the can that will begin to melt. Guess I should just stick with making my own frosting.
) Or keep them in the fridge until time to serve......
Thanks for your help!

Conditions forPretty simple if you are a bull: You want the market down big today. Not only that, but you want the futures to be off badly tomorrow and the stock market to get hammered at the opening and then stay down, perhaps dipping at 1:30 right into the Fed statement.
But have you ever noticed it is never like that? That it always seems to do this kind of thing where it doesn't stay down but perks up and that it actually comes into the meeting with a head of bullish steam or is at least rallying into the release? Remember, the market was up big yesterday, so it would have made a ton of sense to sell off today as those in fear of the Fed bolt the market. That's the jockeying for position that should be happening.
As much as we like, we can't figure out who is making these bets. Shorts? Longs? Who is pushing the market up ahead of what could be a statement that might drive us lower?
Of course, the bulls want the decline ahead of the meeting so badly, because then it is obvious what to do. We would know if we get "no taper" that we could buy with impunity and watch it go higher if we were down going into it. The market just confounds the most people possible. And if we had sold off hard enough today, then you could buy the market after the statement, because the big, bad event would be behind us.
Now, let's layer in another element of lunacy: the banks. The banks need the bond-buying to end. They need the yield curve to have some inflection. But they are acting exactly the opposite of how they should be if the comments I wrote earlier about the Clorox (CLX)-Colgate (CL) contingent are right. Bank of America (BAC) should be screaming if the Clorox/Colgate mob is going down, because that means the economy is accelerating, which means the Fed will stop buying bonds and let interest rates go higher, which is how the banks make more money.
But just as the market refuses to stay down to make things easier for the bulls after the statement, the banks refuse to rally, even as they should.
Just another sign that the stock market is not nearly as rational and is far more emotional and anti-empirical than so many think it to be.Growing Up Garth
Have you ever been such a huge fan of an artist that you spend your entire life following their journey and buy online cheap generic viagra I would sing his songs (loudly) everyday on the canadian health care school bus and somehow avoided any mocking. I remember recording Garth's concerts on our VCR at home and watching it over and over again. The way he would look to cialis canadian pharmacy the crowd with such amazement, was the same way I look at him. I've suffered several health issues in the past, but keep going strong and find refuge in Garth's music. He touched on subjects decades ago that are just now getting the viagra on internet prescription online spotlight for himself, to soak up all the time he could with his girls. To be on a wave that high and step away for time with your children says a lot about his character and canadian viagra india priorities.
Hopefully I will get to see this amazing talent in person. I know I’ll be sobbing the entire time, as I remember listening to each one of his songs through my tape player, my first (and best) investment at the age of seven. I’ll remember singing with my friend on krystiangacek.pl the bus and jumping in the horse tank on those hot summer days on the farm.

Modernising and reinforcing Estonia's anti-tank capabilities forms part of the country's national development plan for 2013-22, with the Estonian Cabinet deciding on 6 June to authorise the Estonian MoD to begin negotiations with the United States to purchase the missiles.
A spokesperson for the MoD told IHS Jane's the country is seeking to purchase "Javelin anti-tank missile systems from US stocks as surplus military equipment. The procurement is going to be made through the Foreign Military Sales programme as a government-to-government sales agreement."
The country is planning to buy 80 Javelin ATGWs, and hopes to sign a contract with the United States for the missiles before the end of 2014 - although noted that talks are only in an early phase at the moment. With negotiations only just beginning, the MoD was unwilling to discuss the country's budget for the purchase due to commercial sensitivities.
In Estonian service the Javelins will replace the country's existing stocks of MBDA Milan ATGWs, which will then be kept in reserve. "The systems are to be used at the Defence Forces infantry battalion level, as well as in the Defence League's territorial defence units," the MoD spokesperson added.
Estonia has previously been suggested as a Javelin export customer, with the Israeli Spike missile also considered a contender for the country's ATGW requirement. However, the spokesperson confirmed that Javelin was currently the only option being considered, and that there would be no competitive tender for the requirement: "According to EU and Estonian regulations we're not required to apply the Public Procurement Act if we buy defence equipment from another state. We are not looking at any other systems at this moment, nor are we having a public procurement. "

Shortly after noon Wednesday behind closed doors, Gov. Rick Scott signed a bill that bans the slot machine look-alike games operated by Internet cafes, amusement arcades that are used up to 1,000 storefront operations across the state.
The Florida Legislature overwhelmingly passed the bill in the weeks after dozens of people were arrested in a illegal gambling, racketeering and money laundering investigation into Allied Veterans of the World, which operated about 50 of the Internet cafes, most in Northeast and Central Florida.
"You looked at the multi-state criminal conspiracy that Allied Veterans was involved in, they cracked down on illegal gaming. They've done the right thing," Scott said.
The new law will take effect immediately, but state officials say they will leave enforcement of the new law to local law-enforcement officials.
The storefront operations targeted by the bill currently allow customers to play sweepstakes games that simulate slot machines. But critics contend the new law will also lead to the closures of senior arcades.
Sen. John Thrasher, R-St. Augustine, said this isn't about large-scale raids on businesses.
"I've heard from some law enforcement officers that they'll go around if they're in operation they think they're doing illegal activities. They'll give them a warning, give them a chance to adjust," Thrasher said. "(This is) about sending out a message to folks that what constitutes gambling in the state of Florida is illegal. And when it is illegal we're going do something about it."
Because hundreds of businesses are expected to close as a result of the computer gaming ban, officials admit the law may put thousands of people out.Retail-isation of Barclays continues
News on Tuesday that Barclays had acquired the deposits, mortgages and business assets of consumer bank ING Direct UK, subject to regulatory approval, is consistent with the marked attempt to rebalance the group away from investment banking since retail banker Antony Jenkins took over as CEO.
IFR Editor-at-large Keith Mullin
Through the acquisition, the bank picked up £10.9bn (around US$17.5bn) of deposits at par along with a £5.6bn mortgage book at a 3% discount.
With customer deposits of £113.9bn (US$182bn) as of June 30, the acquisition certainly isn’t a game-changer for Barclays in a numbers sense.
But it comes a little more than a week after Jenkins stacked the group executive committee away from investment banking by splitting his old retail job into two and appointing both incumbents (Valerie Soranno Keating, CEO of Barclaycard; and Ashok Vaswani, former CEO of UK Retail and Business Banking now responsible for retail and business products and services) to the group ExCom.
That’s certainly a radical transformation from Bob Diamond’s ExCom, which had himself, Rich Ricci and Jerry del Missier from the investment bank in the inner circle. To my way of thinking, that was about right since the CIB division made and continues to make the majority of group profits.
Since taking over, Jenkins had made broadly positive noises about the importance of the investment bank. But when he appointed Soranno Keating and Vaswani, he said the changes “reflect the importance of our retail businesses for Barclays and will make for a better balance between business and functional representation on the Executive Committee”.
Streamlining is one of those ominous words that are invariably used as a codeword for cutting
I don’t know about better balance: of the four global business-line heads on the 10-strong committee; two hail from the retail and business banking side (sharing 41.5% of revenues and 38% of pre-tax profits between them using interim 1H12 numbers); Tom Kalaris, CEO of Wealth & Investment Management, has less than 6% of revenues and 2.7% of profits, while Ricci is now the only representative of the corporate and investment bank, which generates close to 53% of revenues and 59% of profits.
That’s not better balance; that’s unbalanced and it certainly bodes ill for the investment bank in terms of Ricci’s room for manoeuvre and ability to influence outcomes.
Streamlining (read: cutting?)
At the same time, Ricci has been tasked with streamlining the corporate and investment bank. Streamlining is one of those ominous words that are invariably used as a codeword for cutting. Jenkins has already said he would exit activities that cause reputational risk. It’s not clear specifically what he means by that – outside areas such as tax advisory, which has been widely criticised as facilitating large-scale tax avoidance. But cuts to the CIB are widely expected.
As for Ricci’s shake-up of the CIB at the end of last week, it all seemed sensible enough. The big winners were Frenchman Eric Bommensath, head of the newly combined FICC and equities global markets businesses; and Tom King, most recently head of EMEA investment banking and co-head of global corporate finance and M&A.
Bommensath has taken over the global equities mantle formerly held by Jerry Donini as well as responsibility for global distribution, a role formerly held by Guglielmo Sartori di Borgoricco who is leaving the bank. How Bommensath structures the team beneath him will be key. A fixed-income man through and through – and a derivatives specialist at that – he’ll need to put some decent firepower in place to make sure equities doesn’t get crushed under the weight of the FICC platform.
That firepower won’t be in the form of Donini, though, since the former head of equities shifted to become COO of the CIB in a move that kind of looks like one of those face-saving moves to avoid him having to report to Bommensath.
Investment banks have never been quite sure about regional heads in a globalised industry with tribal product alliances and alignments
King has been singled out for greatness. A 20-year Citigroup man and M&A rainmaker, he only joined Barclays in October 2009 but he was promoted into the waiting room of deputy head of IB before he takes over from Skip McGee in 2013 when McGee’s day-job shifts to running CIB in the Americas away from his current slot as global head of investment banking. McGee, the former Lehman man, will keep his hat in the IB ring, though, by taking over as chairman.
I wonder whether King will continue the streamlining of the investment banking group that McGee had kicked off in April when the corporate finance and M&A groups were merged under the trio of Tom King and Ros Stephenson (formerly co-heads of corporate finance) and Paul Parker, global head of M&A.
The merger made sense, as M&A execution was previously managed separately from corporate finance, which housed the industry sector and coverage teams.
Ricci has gone for a matrix of regional CEOs working alongside – or is that against? – global product heads. Investment banks have never been quite sure about regional heads in a globalised industry with tribal product alliances and alignments. (I also wonder about the sense of shifting McGee, a classic Wall Street investment banker, into an operational management role).
The rise of three regional CEOs will certainly engage more of Larry Wieseneck’s time. In another April change, Wieseneck had moved out of his former role as head of Global Finance & Risk Solutions (ECM, DCM, leveraged finance and loans) to become head of strategy for the CIB in a role designed to ensure better alignment between businesses and regions.
With only four of the 13 people sitting on Ricci’s CIB executive committee sporting functional business-line responsibilities versus three with regional responsibilities, it’ll be an interesting balance. And to that point, having Larry Kantor sitting on the CIB ExCom as head of research with a direct line into Ricci is an anomaly relative to how other investment banks are structured.
Most research heads fall under the global markets function. I wonder if that’s the way Barclays will go as it continues to move forward. If so, that’ll make the region/product split 3-3. Could be a classic divide-and-rule construct.

this incredibly interesting and quite damning Star Market that Vulture did. Girlfriend’s career is in trouble. So what does your momager do when things are circling the drain? RELEASE THE JOLIE.
Fug file: Photos, Hot Right Now, Katherine Heigl
Her hair is too blond. She’s all one color (but I guess we should be YAYing that her skin is not orange??) Her style just makes her look OLD. And leah? That’s just funny!
Agreed. The combination of her hair color/style and lipstick makes her look 50. There’s nothing wrong with that in itself if you are 50. But when you’re not even close, it’s not good.
Lea Thompson looks freaking hot.
Lorraine is my density.
And I’ve NEVER understood all the love for Katherine….
But her dress is pretty.
I think that dress is on sale over at Fredericks of Hollywood.
Agreed. The dress looks cheap to me. She is objectively pretty (like 99% of Hollywood) so I really don’t get why she insists on dressing like an octagenarian. I have also decided that this whole leg thing is pretty funny, but please please please don’t let this become some kind of trend.
Katherine’s dress is pretty, her hair is awful and the leg is too much. (I should add that I loathe Katherine Heigl, so that’s about as high praise as she’ll ever get from me).
I love Lea Thompson.
I disagree with you, Jessica. It is neither pretty, nor fine. The dress looks cheap, like it’s made of the same polyester fabric that usually lines dresses from Forever21. And why is no one commenting on her bronzer? Granted, these pics do not quite do it justice. Check out Lainey’s pics here, and tell me this is good makeup!
She always looks like someone’s crazy aunt–which would be great if she actually was an older, eccentric lady, but I am baffled as to why a young, attractive women would choose “crazy aunt” as a stylistic basis.
Crazy DRUNK Aunt…She always emits this old, lonely, rich, drunk vibe to me.
That hair is going to give me nightmares tonight. And I think the dress is terrible too. It looks really cheap. Like she’s attending a prom where the theme was bargain basement.
I’m currently in the throes of growing out a very short pixie cut. My hair looks just like this actresses and I loathe it… on both of us.
Otherwise, I like the dress…. in the first photo. I don’t have a clue who this actress is, but I love your line “Release the Jolie.” Heh.
I feel sorry for Heigl for all the hate thrown her way, so I tend to cut her slack even when I know she doesn’t deserve it. This dress, however, looks like cheap jersey and her hair and makeup were borrowed from drunk Sharon Stone. Drunk Sharon Stone would have worked that slit with confidence and verve, whereas poor Katherine here looks kind of sheepish (as she should).
Yay, Lea Thompson!
Meh, Katherine Heigl
I read this headline as Lea Michele. Just assumed – where there are dramatic poses involved . . .
I just can’t with that hair (and frightening face), it just voids everything South, good or bad. I don’t even want to form an opinion on it.
Dude what is up with her face? I really dislike Katherine Heigl, but she used to be pretty. Here, she looks way older than she is.
LeaT for the WIN!
I’d like to see Heigl’s dress on someone else.
Katherine’s dress looks good! This is such an improvement for her, well done. The HAIR on the other hand is horrible…. yikes.
Lea T is fab.
Juliet would so not approve what her mother is doing here
Lea is so hilarious in that shot, you know she’s totally sending LeJolie.
Katherine. sigh Are we sure wasn’t trying to LOOK like her mom, rather than be dressed by her? How does someone who is…in her 30′s (?) consistently look my age or older?? (I’m 50+)
Sheesh.
Lea is AWESOME!! Love her!
As for The Other One in the cheap black Halloween dress: When you’re disrespectful, don’t expect anyone to help you look good.
it’s amazing to me that she is keeping that hair color voluntarily…it’s obviously not for a role (since apparently she doesn’t have any..), so why would anyone continue to color their hair such an aging, unflattering shade of blonde if they dont have to??….
I’d like to see her with light brown hair. Dark brown hair would be too severe on her.
Actually, I was sort of surprised at how much I liked the dark hair she had in One for the Money.
Oh my god… I have seen this exact same dress on The Sims 3. And actually her face and hair look so… off that for a second I wondered aloud to myself why the fug girls would put up screenshots of someone’s bad Katherine Heigl’s Sim.
does anyone else think katherine’s face looks kinda dirty, similar to la lohan’s with all that fake tan? and also her face is like 10 shades darker than her legs. if youre going to tan people, make it look natural, and UNIFORM.
I think we can give her the benefit of the doubt here… I always imagine that all the photographers are screaming at her (and all actresses on all red carpets) to show some leg, etc.
I think the rise of Elizabeth Banks was the final nail in the coffin for Heigl’s career.
Not fond of Katie’s dress but I bloody love her shoes and must have them immediately.
YES!! I was entirely distracted by them!
She should have worn something busier to distract from whatever happened to her face.
She needs longer hair again. She just looks old & bitchy with this length, something that the styling she does of it DOES NOT help
Katherine Heigl had nothing going on to begin with. Lea looks fantastic.
I can’t stand her; she just seems like an asshole. So maybe I’m not cutting her the same amount of slack as I’d cut someone I like, but I agree with those who say this looks cheap and her hair is awful. It’s totally 80something hair – thin and shapeless and an awful color.
Blast-furnace hair. That botoxy forehead cries out for bangs. Dirty-face makeup. And a cheap looking dress.
I love the dress & would happily wear it myself! FAB to the dress!
My gut reaction is just: Katherine. Put. It. Away. Nice try, but no.
Heigl has *always* looked better as a brunette, but she’s otherwise very generic looking and her personality is just loathsome. I enjoyed the Star Market immensely.
Heigl looks wack.
Lea looks fabulous. She’s working it!
That hair is awful but the dress isn’t terrible. However, I always get kind of squicked by all the Heigl hate. It just smacks of “ok, pretty blonde lady, don’t have any personal opinions and, by god, if you do for heaven’s sake don’t share them with anybody. Your job is to tow the party line and look pretty and, god, you can’t even do that right half the time.” I have never heard her say anything that has made me go “oh god, Katherine Heigl? I hate that bitch.”
What LizC said. I don’t get all the Heigl hatred. She demanded what she was worth and spoke up about stuff she did not like. To me, it sounds like she’s got a brain and likes to use it.
I sit possible for a woman to be a douchebag? Get over yourself.Combining.

Start vs. Sit: See Who Has the Best Match-ups.The National Association of Manufacturers this afternoon sent a “Key Vote” letter to the U.S. Senators supporting an amendment by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to block the Environmental Protection Agency’s regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. Sen. McConnell has proposed the Energy Tax Limitation Amendment to S. 493, the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act, being debated on the Senate floor now.
Excerpt from the NAM letter: nation’s.
Sen. McConnell explained the amendment in floor remarks earlier today. (Text and video) A separate news release from his office presented the remarks of 15 Senate Democrats criticizing the EPA’s overreach.
Key vote letters are developed by a committee made up of manufacturers of all sizes and are used to rate a members’ support for manufacturing during a session of Congress.
Also this afternoon, the full House Energy and Commerce Committee voted 34-19 to report out H.R. 910, the Energy Tax Prevention Act, which has the same language as the McConnell amendment. In the portion of the committee discussion we watched online, Chairman Fred Upton (R-MI) spoke about the damaging impact EPA regulation of greenhouse gases would have on manufacturing and manufacturing jobs. We thank him.
P.S. Three Democrats joined the House Republicans on the committee in voting for the bill: Reps. Barrow (GA), Matheson (UT), and Ross (AR).

It was originally known as the Mariners Harbor Houses Playground, for the adjacent housing project. Both the playground and the housing complex draw their names from the neighborhood of Mariners Harbor in northwestern Staten Island.
Mariners Harbor was once synonymous with the oyster industry on Staten Island. Before the turn of the 20th century and the subsequent pollution of the harbor, the community had a thriving oyster trade (both fishing and harvesting) and a successful ship building and repair industry in the waters of the Kill van Kull.

Food news from around the web for your weekend reading.
Fri, May 29, 2009 at 02:01 PM
First though, I didn’t have the opportunity to do a gardening adventures update this week. I think that I’ll be doing them every other week from now on. I think there will be more to report. If anything extraordinary happens in between updates, though, I’ll let you know.
------------------------------
Restaurant News reports that McDonald’s and Wendy’s are exploring cage-free eggs. I suppose this is a step in the right direction, but cage-free doesn’t necessarily mean that the chickens are living happy lives, and they are just exploring it at this point.
W Economist reports something that might be of concern. Investors in more affluent countries are buying land in poorer countries to grow food – food that can be sent directly back to the richer countries. Sometimes, they are buying water rights,.

Preserving and canning are back in style reports The New York Times. (If it’s something you’re interested and want to take a baby step into it, see my post yesterday about small batch strawberry jam preserving).

And finally, this made me laugh hysterically, but I don’t know how many other people will find it as funny as I do.

We were not a little gratified in having the op- portunity of promulgating to the world d correct
accouul of the Lite discoveries in the interior of th s xouutry, undertaken and accomplished by these enterprising travellers-Messrs. i lovell and Hume. Our Satisfaction, however, \v«s considerably damped on perusing the comments of our contemporary upon that occasion. He might have coutented himself with p,.yiug every proper encomium to the Gentle- men more immediately interested in the publication of his strictures, without embracing the opportunity of lampooning a Character, that happens to be placed iufiutely beyond the reach of such enveuomed but powerless missiles. Why does he not turn over a new leaf? Will he never grow wise, after all our pains to bring about a reformation ? We are almost resolved against giving any more of our time to such a sulky and sullen pupil ; but as he ventured to speculate last week upon a certain subject, we have a desire to put him right once more, and then see what course he will steer. As we are about to set off on a voyage of discovery, quite new to us, we crave the charity of the considerate Reader, well knowing that om- contemporary will only lend us the same helping hand as thesailor did the Jc\v,who sent the poor fellow to the bottom without mercy. As we are not going further then Western Port this trip, we shall take into account a few plain facts, and endeavour on the journey to amuse ourselves with proving, ass.lisfactorily as circumstances will permit, the short-sightedness of all these fine spun theories that came into the world from Macquarie place, on Thursday norning last. We will en- deavour to explain that the Surveyor General has jiot " sweepingly disposed" ofthat immense tract of country willi which he is thoroughly acquainted, and which he was well warranted in ollicially pro- nouncing to be " uninhabitable and useless for all the purposes of civilized niau." Surely he would never have hazarded such a "sweeping" assertion upon vague surmise; and, fortunately for our pur- pose, this Oflirer's testimony is corroborated by that of other Gentlemen equally respectable, and equally official. " Actual observation has proved (to use lhe words o<" oir contemporary) that a considerable extent of country in the same la itiide, and nearly in the same longitude with the ¡mm.use tract" passed over by the late travellers, although " Eng- lish-like in point of climate," is not " the finest in point of soil ; neither is that part of the island blessed with "an admirable port, anda river not in- ferior iii magnitude to any yet known in the Colony." '* These unparalleled advantages for the formation of a new settlement,' ' never could have eulered the minds of Messrs. Hume and Hovell-such sophistries can only have existence in the fertile imagination of those who would the other day colonise, at one dash of the quill, the Southern Island of New Zea- land-and now, torsoolh, without any satisfactory grounds, would argue the adoption (in our time too !) of steam-boats, so lhat they might charmingly whiff across the straits ! That Messrs. Hovell and Hume may have passed some fertile plains, we will not attempt to deny-and indeed who eau? but that they «»countered the river spoken of in such ardent terms by our contemporary, as well as " the beautiful tract of country near Western Port," must be doubted, whilst the united autho lilies of Captains Murray, Barrallein, and Tuckey, goto establish the contrary position, iii which they are supported by the Surveyor Geucxal, who most
laboriously investigated Western Port so far back
even as 1805.
As regards capabilities, Western Point is. wholly destitute ; whilst, on the other hand, its,incapabili- ties have been repeatedly ascertained, jin casting our eyes over the map,' at first view, its situation appears to command the north side of . Bass's Straits ; and the Surveyor General (whose profes- sional talents and industry are well known), would have been highly culpable, had he even inadvertently overlooked the many advantages that now, all at once, burst in upon our yet benighted contemporary. With the exception of Po t Philip, which was ne ctssarily abandoned for want of water as well as proper anchorage, by Colonel Collins, in 1804, no other inlet or port prißiuts itself to the eye of the mariner, save this notorious W estera Port. Bass's Straits were so named after the Doctor that made
the discovery. Western Port was examined by Dr. Bass; and subsequently, in 1801, it was mi- nutely surveyed and sounded by Captains Murray and Barrallein. As the French have expressed more than common anxiety relative to this island, and no doubt intended to plant a Colony in some nook or other, could they only have met with the object of research, the discovery-ships, under Baudin, tried the merits of this "admirable port ;" but the Commodore was ill repaid for his patient investiga- tion. In 1804, Captain Tuckey, and other Officers attached to the expedition under Col. Collins, while in the neighbourhood (Port Phillip), were enabled to report, most decisively, on its demerits; which, had the case been otherwise, would have prevented, at that early period, the colonizationof'Van Diemen's Land. Governor King, however, not content with the explanations that he considered unsatisfactory, in the year 1805, directed that the harbour, as well as the surrounding country, should undergo another scrutiny: in the course of which the expedition had ample opportunity to gain all the information that could possibly be desired, either by the Colonial or Home Government, as to the probability of either the country or harbour being adapted to a settle- ment, or considered a safe port. Upon this occa- sion, the Gentlemen (the fact we state upon the highest authority) actually walked round the bay, which contains about 100 miles, and only saw two or three insignificant rivulets, leaving a river, not inferior in magnitude to any yet known in the Co- lony," entirely out of the question ! ! ! But, as we have no desire to impugn the veracity of the Gentle- men from whose journal so many inferences have been drawn, it might not be impossible, as the country in the immediate vicinity is said to be extremely low and swampy, but that the tremendous accumu- lation of fresh waters from the snowy mountains, in the Australian Alps, may have forced a passage, in the lapse of 20 years, into some one ot the un- explored or undiscovered parts of this "admirable harbour !" We would now refer the still incredu- lous, if such there are, to Captain Horsburgh's published account of Western Port, which has made more stir in the world, perhaps, than our con- temporary is yet aware of. If this work will not suffice, let a reference be made to the printed as well as written reports of the distinguished Officers already adverted to; one and all concur in exclaim- ing against the capabilities of this port, by forcibly observing " that Western Port appears to lay in a deep bight; to be of dangerous access; to be open at one entrance to the winds from the West, whilst the other is equally exposed to the Southern gales ; that there is not a solitary sheltered cove in it ; that the tides, rising from 10 to 13 feet, run with great rapidity ; and that, at low water, the greater part of the shores of the port is altogether inaccessible from the bounding mud flats; and that the whole of the upper pari of the port, opposite the large
island (seeu by Messrs. Hovell and Hume) is also dry-a boat channel to a small suit water inlet ex- cepted; that fresh water is uncommonly scarce, no running waters being discoverable in any part of the main land-the streams, having their source in swamps on the E. and N. E. sides of the main land, being also excepted, as they are accessible, at high water, to large boats." Should this authentic in- formation be thought unworthy of credit, no doubt our contemporary will be good enough, in his next number, to describe more accurately all the nauti- cal advantages Western Port appeared to hold out
to Messrs. Hovell and Hume. From what we have read, and what we have heard, in conjunction with the map now before us, all idea of ever fixing a settle- ment at Western Port, must be abandoned at least for another century. Should a vessel only happen to miss the exact latitude, with the wind on, it would be impossible to avoid destruction ; and the commauder of a vessel might as well think of safely mooring in the open sea, as securely riding at an- chor in this said "admirable port !"
As relates to the " sweeping" animadversion of Mr. Oxley, it must be taken for granted, till proved to the contrary, that a personal acquain- tance only could have induced, or in fact war- ranted the Surveyor General in passing so de- cided, and doubtless correct an opinion. Why should our contemporary venture on attempting to shake (he lestimouy of so laborious and zealous au Oificer, wheu that Geutleinan condescends no1 to contradict I he statements put forih by our contem- porary? Let him be kind enough to look at Mv. Oxley's printed proceedings in 1817, and he will ascertain that the Surveyor General's most Western part is connected with the personal observations ol Mr. Brown, made on the summit of Mount Brown, on the East side of Spencer's Gulf.
In their diagonal route from N.E. to S. W. to- wards Western Port, it is not by any means impos« sible that Messrs. Hovell and Hume, after crossing the meridian of 147° 30', might have passed some tracts of good country ; but then it should he re- collected, thal the distance between that meridian and Western Port is quite trifling; and that such ti'aCts are im.ccessible, unless by that po'it. It might not altogether be pardonable in us to attempt a correct estimate of the extent of fine country passed over, on this occasion, in the vicinity of Western Port, without further information on the only part of the subject that is confessedly obscure to our comprehension, bul which, we are fluttered, these enterprising travellers (who, again we rei- terate, deserve so much applause), for the preserva- tion of their own reputation, as wlII as for the information of the world at large, will most readily render public more voluminous details, or place in our hands a copy of their journal-and also favour us, pro bono publico, with a map of their route which will have a tendency to solve many enigmas, as well as to consign over to the shades of neglect and reproach, the names of Bass, Murray, Barral leiu, Baudin, Horsburgh, Tuckey-with a host of
oihers !
By the production of the map it might perchance
turnout, that thagreat river spoken of, does not fall into Western Port ; and should that not be the case, which we must'as yet discredit, for mere as- sertion is of no esteem in such important matters, we might be the humble means of pointing- out some other more probable point of discharge.
We now hasten back to town from the trip with which we have indulged ourselves--and feel neither fatigued nor embarrassed by til« explorations un- der», ken for the benefit of the Community.
After the authorities we have called in to the es- tablishment of truth, we need observe little upon the absurdity of speculations that can only be termed ' idle fancies.' It is said, that " the tide of settlement will turn ;" we should be glad to know when ? That our contemporary has a desire to see that distant period may be safely concluded from the circumstance of his calculating upon " living to see one or more weekly steam-packets plying be- tween Western Port and Port Dalrymple !" We are led to enquire, where is the boasted sapiency of the present men of letters flown to-those that have been reared to the bar? Where is the individual, in the possession of his rational faculties, that could be induced to believe that a lady or gentleman, or both, for the sake of visiting Tasmania hy land, would in the first place, set out for Bathurst-one week's journey ; from thence proceed to the Lach- lan-another week's recreative jaunt ; and then enter upon the third stage Western Port, which would take up 21 d^ys longer-making, in the whole, five weeks ? anil after all, these intimidated creatures must venture across the * treacherous deep,' and run the risk of being longer on this short trip, than they would actually have been in setting out from Port Jackson--generally a run of only 7, sometimes 4 or 5 days ! The cheap, as well as the expeditious and safe manner of inland travelling, is also to be liad in remembrance ! Long life to our confident contemporary, for we have no hope of welcoming the arrival of that "steam packet"day, unless our then bald and obsolete pate, like an old statutebook with.» new covering, b kindly sheltered from the chilly blasts of the Australian Alps by the important addition of a wig !

It is our sincere desire, in which we are certain of being joined by every well-disposed inhabitant, that the bush-rangers throughout the Territory will avail themselves, unhesitatingly, of the extraordi- nary extension of mercy graciously exercised by the (joveunor in Chief, published in our last, and return to that service, from which industry, hones'y, and sobriety, eau at all be expected to yield any lawful relief. But, should offenders be so dreadfully hardened in crime, as to disregard the present and only remaining hope of pardon, we huve no hesitation in affirming, tint against such char«clers, be they many or few, the doorol mercy ought, for ever, to be cíosi-d ! The Proclamation, most assuredly, is a death-blow to the present in- creased number of run .w..ys, and a more sound political act Ik.r not yet emanated from the present Executive-it is decisive iu its nature, and must prove bemfici, 1 .n its influence. It is our opinion, that every prisoner, upon his st-cond or third of- fence, should be drafted to Port Macquarie for a limited period-in which case hope m y still ani- mate tlie outcast to a reverence for virtue, and there- by induce a proper return to civilized life, on the stage of which a transformation might be exhibited. But, in the e\ent of men persisting in crime, after this almost \vas>e of mercy, we would urge ba- nishment to Macquarie Harbour for the re- mainder of their sentences. ' With some characters
severity is only mercy-the bare thought of the last-mentioned penal settlement makes the heart of the most desperate to palpitate with dread !

Our contemporary, good naturedly enough, an- nounced the embarkation of His Honor the late Judge Advocate in his last. But we could not avoid observing, at the s.ime time, the inadvertent inconsistency of our competitor ; for, while in the act of censuring the vahdictory addresses loo com- monly in estimation amongst us, he commits the very same oileuce, by addressing a few '. parting words" to our late Premier Judge! We always thought our contemporary \v«s only a new hand in the Colony-and of recent importation-but he ap- pears tobe so well acquainted with the character of the late honorable Judge-ships that we are begin- ning to imagine our conjectures, as to that p iut, must have been imnn.turely formed. In reference to His Honor the late Judge Advocate we have no- thing to urge-we rejoice that His Houor escupid the vicissitudes of shipwreck, and got clear off from a Colony, which must have considerably deteriorated in His Honor's opinion, during the last few days of his unavoidable detention here that originated in adverse circumstances. It is our hobby-horse to give every one their desert, which induces us to mention, most honorably to the character of Judge Field, indifferent as heis allowed lo have been mother respects, that it was an invariable maxim with him to owe no man any thing, and willi this principle in operation, Jud¿;e Field was most exact and honora- ble in his payments-¡nid we believe no one in the Colony can libel that Character by alleging he de- parted this Australian lifo in a poor man's debt or that he defrauded the hireling of his wages-or that he omitted, in the hurry of business, to pay the poor barber for curling and powdering his wig ! No, no ; so far Judge Field's honour is unim- peachable.

In short: Good quality field, well organised, fast 10k.In full: Race set-up is very good, handy sports centre close to start/finish, excellent organisation, and the race attracts a quality field, so good for pulling you around for a fast time. There is an incline at 3.5k but this is followed by a very gentle downhill/flat section which takes you through to 8k, before a few more turns and then a final k to the finish.I'm really not that bothered about scenery when PB-chasing, but the support on course for a local race was pretty good, and the whole set-up is very well run. I also like the field size, large enough for a bit of atmosphere, not so large that you get the queues of a mass event. (The toilets seemed to be a particularly hassle-free experience compared to some races!)PB bagged, would run again!Date of review: March 23,:, 2013Glowing? Not these pregnant celebs
By Rachel Burge
Filed under: Advice And Health
Pregnancy is a wonderfully exciting and magical time - but it can come with a few unwanted side effects! Even the stars suffer with swollen legs, aching backs, tiredness and morning sickness - and in some cases far more serious conditions, such as pre-eclampsia.
Celebrity pregnancy ailments
Kate Winslet: Swollen ankles and back ache
"Before I was pregnant I thought I knew exactly how I would feel - confident, blooming and sexy - the way celebrities are expected to feel,” admits Kate.

Gov. Jerry Brown on Wednesday signed Assembly Bill 484, moving the state aggressively toward new English language arts and math tests aligned with the Common Core State Standards, a set of rigorous instruction goals that become law in 2014-15.
“I’ve said from the beginning, California needs tests that measure how ready our students are for the challenges of a changing world,” state Superintendent Tom Torlakson, one of the bill’s primary architects, wrote in a statement. “Today, we have taken a huge step in that direction by creating an assessment system focused on improving teaching and learning and by sending a clear signal about our commitment to this urgent work.”
Students in third through 11th grade will pilot the new Smarter Balanced Assessment in spring, taking either a math or English test. Districts can pay to test both English and math, or to give old standardized exams in addition to piloting one Smarter Balanced Assessment.
Students will also be given the old standardized science test in fifth, eighth and 10th grades until a new science test is developed, officials said.
For two years, the law allows the state to bar use of test results to measure student performance and or to create an Academic Performance Index – the primary tool used by the state and the federal government to assess annual progress toward improvement goals.
Those test results are required by federal law – and the state’s plan to scuttle them evoked a warning from U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan that California could lose federal funds if it fails to provide them.
Initially, California had planned to test the new assessments on about 15 percent of the state’s eligible students – a figure recommended by the test creators. But the state expanded its field test plans after Duncan announced the federal government would grant waivers from federal testing standards for schools where students are piloting the new exams in 2014.
But California’s plan far exceeded the parameters of the waiver offer, prompting Duncan to criticize them publicly and the state to announce it wouldn’t seek permission for its changes.
The plan puts California out of compliance with federal testing mandates, risking losing federal funding. Department of Education officials were not available for comment due to the government shutdown.
“Raising standards to better prepare students for college and careers is absolutely the right thing to do, but letting an entire school year pass for millions of students without sharing information on their schools' performance with them and their families is the wrong way to go about this transition,” Secretary of Education Arne Duncan wrote in a statement in September.
Officials in Tustin Unified are supportive of the state’s plan. The district gave about one-third of its students pilot tests last spring, and were surprised at a lack of computer skills in younger students, with students struggling to copy and paste or highlight text in the assessment.
“We really appreciate this year as a reprieve from the STAR so we’re able to focus on this shift,” said Kathie Nielsen, chief academic officer in Tustin Unified.
“Our kids didn’t have as high a level of technology skills as we wanted,” Nielsen said. “They’re the computer generation so you assume they can do all that.”
Garden Grove Unified officials reported similar challenges after pilot testing at six schools, particularly with typing skills.
School districts across Orange County are also working to upgrade technology infrastructure and purchase laptops and tablets for student use.
Garden Grove Unified district is in the midst of purchasing computers and tablets and upgrading its technological infrastructure using one-time $9.5 million in state funds provided to help implement Common Core State Standards, Stevens said.
Tustin Unified is working toward a 1-1 device-to-student ratio in fifth to 12th grades using funds from a bond measure expected to generate about $135 million over the next 30 years to upgrade technology and support science, engineering and math programs.
“With technology you’re always cautious because little glitches always come up,” Nielsen said. “Both the way (students) take the test and the content of the test are very different so we’re working hard to prepare.Mendota Heights, MN (PRWEB) April 29, 2013
Intradyn, the leader in simple, affordable appliance solutions for automated email archiving and retrieval, today announced an upgrade to its email archiving operating system software. This software powers the company's popular line of email archiving appliances, including the RazorSafe Appliance and the Orca Virtual Appliance.
The Intradyn Archive Operating System (AOS) version 5.2.1 provides collaborative eDiscovery amongst multiple archives. This provides for large deployment scalability as well as allowing an individual user to share search results with other users, decreasing the load on the email archiving server(s) and tremendously assisting users with collaboration.
AOS 5.2.1 release brings significant improvements to the Intradyn Orca Virtual Appliance. In particular, the Orca Virtual Appliance can now be implemented in the Microsoft Hyper-V environment. “We released the Orca in a VMware environment less than a year ago, and now our email archiving technology is also available to Microsoft shops.

Waste Promotions Officers from Anglesey County Council with Sandra Jones and Llangefni Communities First ‘Young Explorers’ Group.
As the sun comes out so do our summer clothes and a group of environmentally aware children in Llangefni, Anglesey got together recently to hold a ‘Fashion Swap / Ffeirio Ffasiwn’ to make the most of their unwanted clothing.You might recycle all your unwanted clothes, giving items to charity shops, but the Waste Promotions Officers at Isle of Anglesey County Council are organising events to help you swap quality clothing, handbags, jewellery and shoes.Running a ‘Fashion Swap / Ffeirio Ffasiwn’ is easy, with just a few basic rules: everyone brings at least one item of clothing, you decide on a set amount of time to look at the items (without making claim to any items) and then you declare the ‘Fashion Swap / Ffeirio Ffasiwn’ open and everyone takes what they want."Our Young Explorers group focuses on environmental issues, and we have been very well supported by the Waste Promotions Officers, Tyddyn Môn textile recycling, Keep Wales Tidy and Tidy Towns.The children were very hands-on, organising the ‘Fashion Swap / Ffeirio Ffasiwn’ and worked very hard during the event. We all enjoyed swapping items and hope to do it again as a project soon," said Sandra Jones, Project Officer at Llangefni Communities First."A community ‘Fashion Swap / Ffeirio Ffasiwn’ is a great way to reuse and recycle your clothes, accessories or beloved treasures. We are hoping more groups will contact us and we can help them, host events," said Elin Jones, Senior Waste Management Officer at the Isle of Anglesey County Council.

Sorry, a bit sleepy here.
A filter would allow the OP to use a more normal aperture. It is only one solution to the problem.
Yes, it would. The problem is that an ND filter would also reduce whatever light the flash emits by the same amount. So if you used a 3 stop ND filter (allowing f/16 to change to f/5.6, a 3 stop aperture increase), you would have to increase the flash's power by the same 3 stop's worth (8 times the output power) because the light that the flash emits is also reduced the same amount by the ND filter.
there is something amiss here, and misleading.
If the foreground is underexposed by 3 stops you have three options to balance the exposure:
+3 stops of flash to balance the shot
+3 stops by opening the aperture, no flash and blow the background.
+3 stops of aperture, -3 stops from filter, + 3 stops of flash
Yes the filter is reducing the amount of flash reaching the sensor, but the increased aperture is cancelling that effect. Although the flash is illuminating the background it has a diminishing effect on the distance. You could juggle with the aperture, shutter speed, iso and flash output to get the exact balance required if the background were closer - so long as there was some separation.

Languages Spoken by Dr. Kent & StaffChange at power giant will be felt from Utah to L.A.
Delta • The.
Since L.A. delivered its directive in late April, the focus at IPP, which has a staff of 485 workers, has been on ways to develop natural gas-fired power generation so it can be in place by 2025, IPP spokesman John Ward said. "The future of the coal units will be addressed later."
The IPP was built in the west-central part of the state in the early 1980s near Delta by 23 small Utah municipalities at a cost of $4.5 billion. It began generating electricity in June 1986. The plant originally was designed for four generating units but only two units were built. Still, the IPP rates as the fifth-largest coal-fired power plant in the West. It also is one of Utah's largest polluters, based on the most recent Toxics Release Inventory by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Plans for a third unit, once anticipated to go online in 2012, were canceled several years ago after the City of Los Angeles declined to commit to buying the power because of its desire to eventually wean itself from coal-fired generation.
Ward points out, however, that in order to keep IPP's existing coal units operating after Southern California municipalities make their switch, new customers for the power the units produce would have to be found.
And that may prove increasingly difficult.
Coal's share of electricity generation in the United States has fallen from 50 percent to 40 percent in the past decade, in part because of the rising influence of environmental groups and elected officials opposed to its use.
"Coal is old and dirty, and that plant (IPP) is no exception," said Evan Gillespie, who on behalf of the Sierra Club helped push Los Angeles to sever its ties to coal-fired power generation. "There are cleaner alternatives available wind and solar."
Gillespie doubts that IPP's coal-fired generation will find a ready market if it still is being produced after 2025.
He pointed out that IPP owns the transmission lines that carry the electricity it generates to customers in Southern California. But once 2025 rolls around, even if IPP fills some of the lines' capacity with electricity generated from burning coal, there will be no buyers in California who can take it. "I don't know where that electricity will be able to go," he said.
Shutting down IPP's two existing generating units would be a blow to Utah's coal mining industry, said Dave Tabet, manager of the energy and minerals programs at the Utah Geological Survey.
"But you also have to take into consideration that a lot of the areas that are being mined are slowing being depleted," he said. "Some of those mines in production have only 10 years of reserves. So they may be closing anyway. If that were to happen,it would be a lot less of a blow than if those mines had to shut down because IPP stopped taking their coal."
As envisioned, construction of the proposed natural gas-generating unit capable of producing anywhere from 600 megawatts to 1,200 megawatts would begin in 2020 and be completed by 2025, Ward said. The size of that unit, though, will depend on how many of IPP's owners choose to support its development.
The Intermountain Power Agency, which oversees the operations of the IPP on behalf of its 23 municipal owners ranging from Logan in the north to the City of Enterprise in the south, hopes to have that question answered by this fall.
Blaine Haacke, general manager of Murray City Power and vice chairman of the board of the Intermountain Power Agency, said there are several options on the table.
"Nothing is set. Nothing is concrete. Nothing is ready to announce," Haacke said.
Ward noted that the municipalities in California that take IPP's power also use its transmission system to deliver wind-generated electricity to customers from facilities such as the huge wind farm outside Milford.
"They may want to develop additional renewable [generating] capacity in Utah," Ward said.
Fred Pickel is the ratepayer advocate at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. And he agrees that the nation's second-biggest city may want to look for cheaper sources of electricity large-scale wind or solar facilities. That would allow it to use the IPP location as a hub for alternative-energy generation to help lessen the economic impact on consumers that will result from the switch away from coal to higher cost natural gas.
Pickel has estimated the cost to Los Angeles of eliminating its purchases of electricity generated from coal by 2025 instead of 2027 will be about $500 million, or $5.21 for every person living in the city.
Although the cost of producing electricity from renewable resources and natural gas have declined in the past five years, the cost of integrating renewable resources into the city's electric distribution system is uncertain, Pickel said.
"We have about seven years to explore alternatives before specific permitting and construction actions must be taken to meet the accelerated 2025 deadline," he said.

“It’s a nice, romantic Friday night in Springfield. So sit back and relax and let the music take you where you want to go,” Brickman told the audience after his first song, “Dreams Come True” from his 1997 album “Picture This.”
The two-hour long show offered fans, many of whom traveled from Connecticut to see their musical hero, an evening of dazzling solo piano, vibrant vocals and the warmth and humor that has made the holiday tour a seasonal tradition for the past 15 years.
“I’ve been lucky enough to have hits, and I’ll be playing them tonight,” Brickman told his audience about what they were about to hear for the evening – a show that featured his many romantic songs and others reflecting the spirit of the holidays.
The hits included “The Gift,” from his first holiday album and “Valentine,“ a big hit with country star Martina McBride, as well as a slew of others such as “After All These Years,” “Destiny,” “Peace,” “By Heart,” “Coming Home for Christmas,” and “Never Alone” which he recorded with popular country artists Lady Antebellum.
Brickman used the tour to introduces songs from his two newest releases, both on sale as Target exclusives – “All Is Calm,” yet another holiday album in a catalog that includes some six holiday titles, and “Romanza,” a romantic disc of music inspired by Italy.
When the announcer came on to introduce the show, he made a reference to “Jim Brickman and friends,” and the popular musician brought along several with him.
This year’s special guests included popular favorite vocalist Anne Cochran, a hometown friend from Cleveland where the two grew up, as well as singer Benjamin Utecht. Brickman told the crowd when asked where he finds talent to perform with him, he jokes that he often looks to the football field, referring to Utecht, a former NFL Super Bowl champ who retired in 2009. Rounding out the guest list was electric violinist Tracy Silverman, who Brickman has described as “Black Sabbath meets Santa,” and who rocked out on stage in several solos on a violin he fashioned to look like a guitar.
Along with the hits, there were plenty of Christmas songs, too. “Joy To the World,” “Winter Wonderland,” “Let It Snow,” “Do You Hear What I Hear,” “First Noel” and a host of others were performed solo by Brickman or in combination with his guests in solos, duets and ensemble pieces.
Among the highlights of the evening included a series of songs that Brickman said he “learned from” growing up and that were an “early influence” on his music, including “Green,” a song originally sung by Kermit the Frog,” as well as “Sing,” from the popular Sesame Street television show, and “Somewhere Over the Rainbow,” “Rainbow Connection” from “The Muppet Movie,” and “When You Wish Upon A Star.”
The holiday highlight of the show was the performance of a new song written by Brickman entitled “Fa La La La La,” which in an interview with The Republican the artist said he wanted to write a Christmas song that had a classic, old-time feel to it. He and all of his guests performed the song and invited audience participation in singing the chorus of “Fa La La La La.”
Brickman promised his audience his music for the evening would be an “antidote to all the chaos going on,” and indeed, it was.A real estate group says sales of existing homes took an unexpected plunge from December to January, falling to the lowest level in nearly 12 years as buyers waited for the government to boost the U.S. housing market. The National Association of Realtors said that sales of existing homes fell 5.3 per cent per cent from $199,800 a year earlier. That was the lowest price since March 2003 and the second-largest drop on record.
President Barack Obama has Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico and Republican Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire.
Vice President Joe Biden says the economic stimulus program aims to "drop-kick" the economy out of its deep recession. The vice president vows he'll make sure the $787 billion "gets out the door quickly and wisely." He's been meeting with top members of President Obama's cabinet to discuss the plan. Biden also warns that he'll use "the moral approbation" of his office to make sure the stimulus money is put to good use. He says the measure is meant to create jobs and rebuild the infrastructure. During his speech to Congress last night, President Obama said Biden would be keeping an eye on how the stimulus money is spent.
After stagnating under the Bush administration, domestic programs could soon be flush with federal money. Congress' Democratic leadership is moving to pass a $410 billion spending bill that would boost spending for domestic government agencies by eight per cent on average. That's on top of the $787 billion stimulus package that already won the president's signature. As President Obama prepares to give Congress an outline of his 2010 budget, the House is taking up the bill that includes a 21 per cent boost for a program that feeds infants and poor women and a ten per cent.
The Treasury Department says the nation's biggest banks are being granted immediate access to further support from the government's $700 billion financial rescue fund. Treasury officials say the new support will be provided through the government's purchase of preferred shares of the bank stock. Those shares can be converted into common shares of bank stock, a change in the rescue program designed to give financial markets greater confidence. The Treasury Department also provided details of how a new stress test will function to ensure banks have enough capital to survive a downturn that would be even more severe than the current recession.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is again spurning speculation that the government may nationalize Citigroup or other big banks. When asked about Citigroup by the House Financial Services Committee, Bernanke said nationalization "is when the government seizes the bank and zeros out its shareholders," adding, "we don't plan anything like that." But Bernanke says it is possible the government could end up with a much bigger ownership stake in Citigroup or other banks. In the case of Citigroup, Bernanke said "we'll see how their test works out and what evolves." he was referring to new "stress tests" that regulators will start conducting on the biggest banks to judge whether they can hold up if the recession were to worsen. per cent from the same month last year. The department says more than 235,000 workers were fired due to January's cuts. Companies from a wide range of sectors announced thousands of layoffs last month, including Home Depot, Boeing, Pfizer and Caterpillar.
Executives of the biggest oil companies are telling Congress that expanded drilling off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts will produce needed oil and gas and generate thousands of jobs. Shell Oil President Marvin Odum says oil will remain a major source of energy in the coming decades and be a transition to other energy sources. Odum told the House Natural Resources Committee that development of the country's offshore oil and gas will produce jobs and help in the economic recovery. An executive from Irving-based ExxonMobil estimates 76,000 jobs would be created from new drilling in areas that until recently have been under a Congressional drilling ban. Critics argue it will take years before new leases would be issued and any oil would be produced from waters that have been off-limits. They argue drilling would have little impact on short-term economic recovery.
Top executives of Chrysler met met with the administration panel, said a Chrysler official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were private. Struggling to survive, Chrysler and General Motors have received $17.4 billion in federal loans. They are seeking an additional $21.6 billion to keep operating during a difficult recession and a major plunge in auto sales. Auburn Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler has received $4 billion in loans and wants another $5 billion in federal aid and the approval of an alliance with Italian automaker Fiat Spa. The company said in a February 17th progress report to the Obama administration that it needed the loans to stave off a liquidation of the company. The automaker lost $8 billion last year. President Obama's Auto Task Force is trying to restructure GM and Chrysler by March 31st. expected to meet with GM executives on Thursday. General Motors has said it could run out of money by the end of March and needs $2 billion in March and another $2.6 billion in April to stay in business.
The Small Business Administration is closing its Business Assistance Center tomorrow. The SBA opened the assistance center in the Houston SCORE Chapter office on South Gessner in September following Hurricane Ike.
Dallas-based AT&T says Houston businesses are better-prepared by disasters than in 2007. The study says 82 per cent of Houston companies have a business continuity plan—up from 78 per cent last year. Thirty-five per cent also require vendors to have a plan in place.
A pilots union says it's preparing to disrupt the operations of American Airlines, but will stop short of a strike if it can't get a new contract. Union leaders declined to say exactly what they might do, other than to say they would wait until federal mediators declare negotiations at a standstill. The Associated Press reports that could take months. Officials at Fort Worth-based American say they're "fully committed" to negotiations led by federal mediators. They blamed union leaders for the lack of progress on a new contract. The Allied Pilots Association opened negotiations by seeking raises of more than 50 per cent over several years. American responded that its labor costs are higher than other U.S. airlines, but the company has not made a counterproposal on wages, according to the union.
The San Antonio Express-News announced that it'll cut its staff by 15 per cent. It also says it'll leave dozens of jobs unfilled as the newspaper battles the slump that has pummeled it and other daily newspapers across the country. Publisher Thomas Stephenson says wage and hiring freezes, buyouts and smaller job cuts haven't been enough to offset the continuing revenue shortfall at the Hearst-owned newspaper. He says the paper now will eliminate 135 jobs and leave 30 open positions unfilled. Editor Robert Rivard says 75 of those positions will be eliminated from the newsroom March 20th. Stephenson says the Express-News also will make changes to its press runs, move all downtown San Antonio workers to its headquarters near the Alamo, and change its health and benefits packages to reduce costs.Earnings
CenterPoint Energy reports a 19 per cent drop in fourth-quarter net income. Th Houston energy provider blames igher transmission costs and impacts from Hurricane Ike. CenterPoint reports net income of $87 million on revenue of $2.8 billion. That compares with $108 million on revenue of $2.6 billion for the same period in 2007.
KBR, a former Halliburton subsidiary, says its fourth-quarter profit climbed 24 per cent, helped by strong results from most of its divisions, including its government and infrastructure and services units. Earnings increased to $88 million from $71 million a year ago. Results included a charge of 12 cents per share related to the resolution of a government investigation. Earlier this month, KBR pleaded guilty to bribing Nigerian officials to obtain contracts valued at more than $6 billion. Houston-based KBR, an engineering and construction services company, says revenue rose 42 per cent to $3.39 billion. Analysts had forecast revenue of $2.96 billion.STARKVILLE — Oktibbeha County supervisors have passed a resolution to let the public know it will borrow $5 million when needed to support an economic development opportunity.
Supervisors took the action this week at the urging of the Golden Triangle Development LINK, a local economic development group. The county would borrow the money by issuing bonds.
Local residents will have.
“Whenever the state level sees you want to put skin into the game, they’re willing to assist in a greater way. I think in today’s economic development market, you have to be creative. This gives us major flexing power for infrastructure and other elements needed to attract game-changing developments.
“This shows a buyer (a county) is ready and you have all the tools required. These economic bonds put us in the position so we can be creative and allow us to put our name on the marquee and say we’re open for business,” he said.Palomar College

College Novels
Collection of Susan Burke
This exhibit showcases examples of the many popular college girl novels
published during the early 1900s. These books, set in fictionalized versions
of the eastern women's colleges, Smith, Wellesley, and Vassar, were aimed at
an audience of girls and played a part in popularizing the idea of higher
education for women. Scholars in Women's Studies, History, and Popular
Culture see them as significant records for study.
The books are from
the collection of Susan Burke, adjunct librarian, who has gathered them over
the past couple decades from flea markets, thrift shops and book stores. In
addition to their merits which invite scholarly attention, these novels are
a heck of a lot of fun.

The NYPD is searching for two men who assaulted and robbed a 60-year-old man on the stairs of the Brighton Beach subway station. Brooklyn News is reporting that the suspects are at-large.
The incident happened Wednesday at 1 p.m. when the victim was attacked by two unidentified males. The Brooklyn News described the assault:
As he walked past, the suspects grabbed his legs from behind, throwing him on the steps, causing him to slam his head on the stairs. The suspects then proceeded to kick and punch the victim throughout his body.
The suspects picked up the victim’s cellphone and fled west bound on West Brighton avenue.
The victim was taken to Coney Island hospital and treated for minor injuries.
The NYPD released the following images taken of the two suspects.

Dr Willie has advised us that Morgan Stanley appears to be on the ropes. THE FIRST OUT YOU GET THE BEST DEAL.
If you are in the penumbra your money is at complete risk given the new rules in the MMA market that are designed to prevent bank runs. The southern Euro tier countries have limits that range from $400 to $1,500 max withdrawals a day coupled with draconian currency and PM border controls. If your money is in the bank you will not be able to get to in. comment Belgium, Finland and Germany are still sort of ok but going into recession.
With this in mind and know the present regime would love to stay in power, if MS goes down and takes a few other banks with them the DC crowd will declare a bank holiday. Here is how Susanne Posel describes the potential scenario.
On Friday there is banking shut down with the blame shifted to a Flame like virus. Its a false flag like the tests done at Nat West and RBS in UK and Ireland
On Monday the banks reopen with the assurances that there is nothing to be concerned about—virus problem solved
72 hours later martial is declared since the problem was not the virus. It was and will be the systemic failure of the banking system in the US and maybe Europe.
That 72 hours will be your queue to close your accounts and remove yourself from the banking system. Taking cash from your account and buying any form of supplies you need to get phyzz purchase will top off the tanks.
Remember, the first ones out get the best deal!!

Anyone care to guess when the public will be privy to know the actual status of Morgan Stanley’s condition (that is, if MS really is in trouble)?
Silvergood1 says:
After the elections!……best guess

Hapa says:
While the big money is still in the system, it won’t crash. The gloves come off after the election. They need to secure another four years of legitimacy (control) for Obama, before they can do the nasty.
SilverSlicker says:
It is coming, no doubt. It should have and would have come and gone by now but the Fed’s propping of the global banking cartel has simply extended the inevitable. Food, water, silver and heat are the order of the day here folks. If you don’t have a wood stove, get one. If you live in the city, move out or at the very least, get some protection. When the banks start to withhold your dollars, that’s when things start to get interesting. When people’s children are hungry and have no more clean diapers, that’s the tipping point. People thought I was nuts in 2009 when I spoke of these scenarios coming in the near future but now those naysayers are beginning to smell the coffee. I hope it all never happens and I turn out to be wrong, nothing would make me any happier than that.
snowrider says:
Unfortunately SS if it does not happen the hellish influence over our lives will continue. The time has come where TRUTH must be exalted above every lie, above every deceitful act, and above every illegitimate influence so justice can be served! To the point if a War Crimes Tribunal is necessary, by all means make it so! The untold suffering of millions has been going on for years and the time has come for those who are responsible to be required to answer to the claims that TRUTH demands from each and every one of them.

I think taking our money out of the banks and physically holding PM is the key, in my humble opinion.
snowrider says:
The pantry is full, tanks are full, PM are buried 12 paces due north from the old oak tree, living over 200 miles from any major city…., lets see now, did I miss anything? Oh yeah!!! Got a Bible, just in case that old relic happens to be more that a myth as many supposedly intelligent people claim. I guess I need to read Daniel and Revelation again so I can see if what is in there is actually coming to pass. You know, can’t buy or sell without some kind of a mark, some dude who is a economic whiz kid, a leader who conquers others without going to war, I think this has something to do with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Then there is the false prophet, the beast, and the antichrist…., dad-gum all this doesn’t sound good. And then there are the ones who will be beheaded because they would not compromise their principles….??….!! OK enough of this, I going to watch the Matrix again. Neo to the rescue!!
PowerBall says:
QE3 allows them to do some more can kicking plus another round of bailout for the usual TBTF. My vote is they’ll do more can kicking especially if this happens before the November election.

buddy_boy8403 says:
Scary stuff. I hope this never happens. I’m pretty new here and just started looking into this stuff a couple months ago – can someone explain how a QE3 is a bad thing?
PatFields says:
The structure of the monetary scheme GUARANTEES a system-wide failure. The sheer magnitude and rapidity of exponential currency and debt growth (16 Trillions ‘fed’ into banks across the world ‘charged’ to The People …, to mention nothing of Euro-zone and Chinese ‘infusions’ on the backs of THEIR Peoples) is the silent economic nuke detonation that everyone sees but doesn’t recognize for what it is. It’s the blinding explosion of the world’s currency scheme.
My own suggestion is to research prices of common goods during the mid to near-late 1800s, when all money was metallic and those silver-centric prices had evolved to their most rational ideal. We’re going to be trading in metals again quite soon, so a fair apprehension of ‘real’ pricing will be an invaluable bit of ‘intelligence’ to guide our path forward.
Otto595 says:
First time on the forum. Love all the info.
Isn’t the rush to declare the doom of Morgan Stanley a little far fetched? I mean, people were clamoring to declare that JP Morgan will be going belly up at the end of July. No one seems to be talking about that anymore.
AGXIIK says:
Otto 595 welcome to the forum I think the reason MS is thought to be in failure mode is that its financials are a mess, stock price is down a lot and some top employees are selling stock and exiting the bank. This is not a precise formula for determining of MS is going to fail but when we lost several major banks in 2008, each time the CEO and the government were talking trash about how strong the bank was, the top rats were planning their exit. Many of the TBTF banks were still triple A rated until they closed. Dexia bank, a Belgium bank, failed less than 2 months after it was rated AAA. Dexia was 1.5 times the size of the Belgim GDP. Ouch!
Another large bank CIF, was nationalize yesterday by Hollande and the French government. It was struggling and given the final boot in the butt when Moody’s downgraded it to the fatal Caa1 rating. It was the second largest mortgage banking firm in France. I think it was kind of like Wacovia, AIG and FNMA all rolled into one We’ll see the repercussions on Monday and if this sets off a bank run or more failures. MS is just one of the biggest banks with the largest exposures to Euro debt, CDSs and derivatives It is also pretty weak with an enterprise value of negative $200 billion and a debt to worth ratio that would make a billy goat puke. If the Greeks tipped to default or another bank with substantial counterparty connections to MS went bust, this could kill the bank.
Besides which, all the other TBTF are like sharks circled the blood in the water. Every one of these big banks would love to feast on the carcass of MS if for no other reason that they would buy assets on the cheap, probably avoid the debt of MS and shore up their own crappy financial house so that they could delay their day of reckoning. To Big to Bail means the largest bank wins because they are now a part of the government and have to be propped up at any cost JPM is one of those types. September and October will be interesting months for the banking community.
buddy_boy8403 says:
I have to ask the obvious question here — I don’t bank with MS. They hold none of my notes or assets (that I’m aware of) so if they did crash, how would it affect me? I’m sure there would be some residual effects… and it might be that they do hold some of my notes and I just don’t know it. I’m curious as to how this will affect me. I feel if businesses are irresponsible and have to close their doors, then that is what they need to do. Are some suggesting that MS is too big to fail? I think I’ve heard that line a time or two about other companies (AIG, GM, etc).
jj83 says:
What is MMA? Are you referring to Money Market Funds?
AGXIIK says:
Affirmative JJ83 MMA is money market account. That is what my former banker LOL, Fidelity called them. My words are unprintable. But there is a move afoot by the Fed et al to limit the amount someone could remove from their own MMA in a financial crisis or run on a bank. I don’t recall the law or acronym but since the $2.7 trillion in MMAs are all that are holding the TBTF banks together, a run would destroy them Watch what Spain does as the have lost about 20% of their bank account capital base through August to see what we will do IMO
allinagau says:
I verified what I heard on the internet. Morgan Stanley stock was $63.37 5 years ago (Aug 2007), now $14.80 — that’s -76.11%. Citibank was $468.80 and now $29.65 for -93.68%. B of A was $50.68 now $7.91 for a -84.39% and that’s with Warren Buffets money. JPM is -17.12, HSBC (HBC) I guess in US is -51.83%. Barclays is -76.11% and Goldman Sachs -40.50%. The S&P is -5.05% for the same 5 year period.
This is some serious losses in capital and they must have Mr. B feeding them a lot of green to keep the doors open. It is going to get messy out there. Hang on to your stuff.
AGXIIK says:
Allinagau whatever happens its going to be big When Paulson and Soros sold ALL of their bank holdings it tells me thebig rats are running for the tall weeds.
allinagau says:
@AGXIIK I notice that ING and TD Ameritrade advertise on this site. ING is sucking wind as they are down from $$40.67 to $7.18 in the past 5 years. TD is only -7.44. The volume has been down so much that these brokers are also having a hard time. I had money in ING at one time and they are terrible. Words cannot describe how badly they handled transactions so I left and went on this adventure.
I actually thought the idea of going All In was to get off the grid. Now I see all of these PM IRA’s popping up of course after I paid taxes on the money pulled out. My whole belief system has changed the last couple of years as I learned what all the crooks are doing to us. It is amazing how clueless the population is. I live in a small town about 70 miles east of Pittsburgh and hope the collapse isn’t as bad here as the big cities will be a mess.
It seems to me you have been at this for awhile. Once I started looking for info it was everywhere. The Fed has to be buying stocks as they rise when they really shouldn’t. The Fed has pumped money like crazy here and Europe and with the volume so low it just baffles me why people can’t see this. Oh well, I’m preaching to the choir. The big sewer rats are definitely running for the weeds to get out of the way and make another fortune of course.
Keyser Soze says:
allinagau: As it turns out, TD just increased its dividend last week, and Scotia Bank announced that it is taking over ING for just over 3 billion
AGXIIK says:
Allin I cashed out some of my IRA earlier this year and will take the tax hit. Then I did an SDIRA for me and my wife. I could not stomach paying 50% in taxes but I have to manage and monitor the SDIRA and it’s a narrow paper trail track. That means I’m not off the grid due to this reporting. But I did save a ton in taxes and the phyzz I bought from Doc is well buried. If the goon squad came looking for me I would sell that stack, take the hit and disappear.
The school of thought that one should take the tax hit by cashing in and buying phyzz on the cheap is sound. I did a bit of both. If PMs go up 100% you are still right where you were after the cash in tax hit. Same dollar value and now your phyzz is totally off the grid. Anything more than a 100% bounce in price and you are on the good side of the trade.
What’s more, ever since the complete and total corruption of the banking and central government was disclosed by Ann Barnhard, Jim Willie, Doc and Jim Sinclair,(I’m slow on the uptake) predestined inflation is cooked in the equation along with the corruption. If the government corrupts our meager stock of currency by criminal means then I fight back by means that only I will know.
I seriously doubt if the IRS will ever see me again. KWIM?
ING—haha—a big smelly overleveraged Eurobank destined for the boneyard. They hold my mortgage too. I await the day they come begging to me to pay them off at 50% on the dollar. I wish.
allinagau says:
AGIIK It broke my heart to pay the tax but I wanted out. I am absolutely convinced this stuff is going sky high. The economics of PMs is rock solid. There are way to many insanely wealthy metal guys just shaking their head at the debt bubble. One of the questions I asked myself right before I went all in was — when was the last time I saw or heard of a coin dealer having financial problems running a legit business. Zip, NADA, Zero so that gave me the final push. So I see where this train is heading and I’m just in for the ride. I wanted out and was tired with their corruption. So let the games begin and thanks for the info. ING will probably lose your paperwork when they go belly up just like Well Fargo with Wachovia. It’s going to be a paperwork nightmare. They probably won’t even call you and I think credit reporting will eventually be a historical event. Take care.
Hapa says:
I’ve decided to cash out almost all of my IRA and will pay the 10% penalty for early withdrawal, since I won’t be 59 1/2 until Nov 2013. I decided I just can’t wait. I’m using some tax credits from prior years from real estate losses, so won’t have to pay much tax. I’m getting more phyzz now (next week), and other infrastructure items for my Kauai farm. I’m hunkering down in paradise, ready for the island to devolve further into 3rd world reality (not far to go).
I figure silver will eventually rocket and will power whatever future might be in store for me. This last withdrawal completes the draining of all bank accounts into cash, phyzz, and other basics. It feels real good. It’s taken a year to engineer. I stopped paying the hefty mortgage and we’ve got BofA tied up in knots with their faulty title transfers from Countrywide. After 20 years in Hawaii, with squatters rights you get free title.
I’ve still got two gorgeous properties for sale, a nine acre piece with 1/4 mile stream (895k) , and a 5 acre ridgetop piece with live-in barn (649k). All infrastructure is in, located an 8 minute walk down the road to our sandy beach. No need for heating your home this winter. Cocos, banana, papaya, hunt your wild pigs on the property, head down to the beach for your luck with a fishing pole. Anybody interested to give me fiat now? Will take phyzz too
Don’t forget to bring your 30/30, as who knows what this place will devolve to once the boats and planes stop running. Anyways, it’s my best shot and I’m here for the ride…
The Doc says:
@Hapa – ‘hunkering down in paradise’…sounds like you have it made. I don’t think it likely you will regret your decision to withdraw your IRA early and pay a 10% penalty…particularly if silver achieves the levels I believe it will over the next few years.
If you’re interested in using SD Bullion to source your metals purchase from your IRA withdrawal, I’ll make sure our bullion team gives you a great deal and makes it worth your while.
-Doc
Hapa says:
Thanks Doc and thanks for an excellent blog that is helping people to get motivated and understand PM and all that the paradigm entails. I am only recently signed on and am shocked more people aren’t aware of the opportunity.
As much as we can prepare ourselves, there are contingencies likely to come up that were never considered. Oh well….we can only do the best we can and the chips will fall where they may.
I’m not looking forward to the changes, but know that society has earned the wake up call many times over. I feel bad for those that have been living in ignorance, but we all seem to have our own karma
All the best to you and yours in this great time of change…

The Garden Isle’s my favorite island. Have fun. It sounds like you got it wired.
The last big silver spike took the price from $8 to $48 in roughly 3 years. 500%.
That same factor would be good this time around. The Casey Chart says the next really big silver upleg could start in April 2013. I think his prediction is pessimistic in date and price but the math seems to check out.

High on Dartmoor beside the watery wildness of Cranmere pool, eight miles from the nearest road, you can hear only wind and the trickle of springs. Listen harder and you might notice swaying grass, your footfall and your own breath. Here, in remote south-west England, there is neither sight nor sound of the modern world.
The undulating marsh stretches to the horizon, its contours broken by occasional granite tors that rise like megaliths from the peat. A raven might fly high overhead and break the thrum of quiet with the rasp of its cry. A lone buzzard mews its mournful reply. These sounds are the voices of a landscape that has remained untouched for thousands of years.
This is where author Henry Williamson came while writing his 1927 classic Tarka the Otter. Williamson knew this animal had evolved millions of years before us, and he was attracted to its wild, eerie mystery. He became an expert otter tracker and visited this isolated tangle of river sources to write about what he saw as otter country.
With its powerful imaginative spirit, Williamson’s celebrated story and its crystalline images have left a legacy. Now in Devon there is “Tarka Country”, a “Tarka Trail” and the “Tarka Line”, a railway branch that runs from Exeter to the north Devon coast.
Otters were nearly wiped out in the 1970s as a result of pesticides being washed into the streams, but now, if you look beyond the “Tarka” merchandising, you don’t have to search Devon too far before you can find signs of the real thing. These shy creatures are cherished all over Britain as one of the country’s greatest conservation successes, and in Devon there are more otters per square mile than in any other county in England.
I spent a year in search of this elusive animal in the wild, and was repeatedly reminded of Williamson’s descriptions of this unspoiled county with its lush green, water-filled landscape. The pure rivers that rush down from the granite outcrop of Dartmoor are primordial otter country where, during the worst period of pollution in the past century, just a few otters remained safe.
These surviving animals were able to recolonise the south-west of England and these days, though still rare and classified as vulnerable, the wild otter is being sighted here more and more frequently.
Spotting otters requires a few straightforward techniques: when I began to search in a stream near my Devon home, I always snuck out alone, removing any temptation to chat and cause the sensitive wildlife to flee; I always went in the same clothes, chosen because they did not rustle or catch the light; I wore no perfume or other cosmetics – otters have an acute sense of smell; I took no crackly snacks as otters’ hearing is superb and I found a spot close to my stream, disguised by the thick trunk of an old oak.
To maximise my chances of a sighting, I positioned myself facing a sweeping view of the water, where the stream poured into a meander of the main river and over its wide tidal mudflats.
You need sharp eyes to see an otter, and the aid of binoculars can make all the difference. As predators, otters are designed to be invisible both in and out of the water; their brown fur seems to merge with the shade and texture of their background. A dry otter’s coat looks like the colour of mud. A wet otter, on the other hand, can look as black as liquorice, as silt-dark as the water in which it swims.
In the water the otter leaves a rippling wake, and this might be the first sign that it is there. An otter is so buoyant that its rudder – the long tail it uses to steer – may also bob to the surface. If the otter is busy fishing under water, it cannot hear, smell or see a silent watcher, and it may be too preoccupied to notice anything unusual when it surfaces eating its prey. This is when we can sometimes carefully creep a little closer.
But where to look for signs? Otters have long made use of the bridges we humans have built because they protect sprainting sites (places where the otters leave their spraint, or droppings, as scent marks). In the shelter beneath a bridge, scent communications remain intact for longer. We can use this to our advantage. Spraint is a sure sign that otters pass by regularly.
Appearing like dark smudges left on a mound beside the river, the spraint is often placed on the most prominent part of a rock at the edge of a stream. It has a sweet smell resembling jasmine tea and contains a concoction of chewed-up fish bones.
Otters habitually patrol along the same familiar routes, scent marking with spraint as they go. If you are lucky and there is silt or sand at the edge of a river, you may find tracks. Otters have five webbed toes, although the otter is so light on its feet that often only four show. The paw-print is the size of a small dog, and the toes are widely spaced in a crescent around the front of the paw, each with a distinctive teardrop shape tipped with a claw.
It was only after I had learnt to identify all these otter signs that success came. I had seen spraint by my stream, found tracks and, during one evening foray, I recognised a fishy-otter smell rising from a bundle of grass. When I looked more carefully, I discerned a small, worn pathway made by otters as they passed, leading up from the wide tidal stretch where the river curled around farmland on the opposite bank. This was the otter’s regular round.
As the tide rose I propped myself against the oak trunk and waited. I may have been there an hour or more but the time seemed to blur. A tawny owl cried out, geese flew in formation to their roost, a fox barked. Then I heard it; a single, high-pitched whistle floating over the water. The otter’s call.
Remaining very still, I anticipated the characteristic trail of bubbles the otter leaves as it swims beneath the surface. Sounds of water-birds lifted through mist as the light fell. The otter had disturbed some moorhens. Then, there it was, on the lip of the water, mud-coloured, so close to the river in shade and shape it was barely distinguishable. The head surfaced first but, then, something strange – it morphed into two otters.
They hauled out, shaking like dogs, scattering water droplets from their whiskers. I could barely breathe with excitement. They loped together along the edge of the river, backs arched, skinny and alert. Then, as suddenly as I had seen them, they melted into the reeds of the marsh with a subtle shift. I was left alone, my heart dizzy and my hands shaking.
For the first time I had seen the creature I’d known was there but had never before glimpsed so near to home. The greatest surprise was that the encounter was as memorable as any far-flung safari adventure, and worth far more to me.

All the fluffy news about those nutty celebrities
Hanna Montana, aka, kid star Miley Cyrus is engaged to be married to her boyfriend Liam Helmsworth.
The 19-and-a-half year old Cyrus is sporting a 3.5 carat diamond ring, which Helmsworth presented. y proposal to her last week. “Life is beautiful,” she then tweeted, meaning, we presume, she was on her way to an Italian film festival. The couple have been dating 3.5 years when they met on the set of “The Last Song.”
The big question is, will this be a weirdo Hollywood wedding, or more traditional fare where the DJ is informed that if he plays Achy Breaky Heart he will wake in the hospital with Achy Breaky Legs?
Review in Brief: “The Avengers is the best movie ever. And, it’s really funny. You have to go see it dad.”Review in Brief: “The Avengers is the best movie ever. And, it’s really funny. You have to go see it dad.”
On the subject of former kid stars, Amanda Bynes has plead not guilty to a drinking and riving charge stemming from an April arrest in Hollywood.
Bynes, it turns out, could not have possibly have been driving under the influence because she does not drink. What is not explained is why she then refused a breathalyzer or a blood test. But rest assured, it’s all the cop in questions fault, asking President Obama on twitter to, “Please fire the cop who arrested me.” When the time Amanda Bynes emerges to tell you how you have to vote otherwise live your life, remember she thought it was the Presidents job to fire city officers.
Amanda, he can’t help because a)he’s the President of the United States and this is a local matter and b) your not Raven.
Former Happy Days brat Erin Moran, who played Joanie on the iconic show, as well as starred in run-off show Joanie loves Chachi, is broke and lives in a trailer. It’s reported that Moran lost her California home last year, and she and her husband live in a trailer park in Indiana.
You’d think there would be all sorts of money, what with celebrity being a commodity itself these days and seeing as Happy Days still shows on re-runs and sells DVD’s, &tc., and you’d be right. But CBS Studios and Paramount Pictures has kept the money, offering that the talent has no clam on the coin.
Suit has been filed and Moran, along with co-stars Anson Williams, Marion Ross and Don Most are looking for something in the neighbourhood of half-a-million dollars.
Perhaps Moran will be upgrading to a double-wide in the near future.
John Mayer is not exactly a gentleman, famous for his discretion. Of Jennifer Aniston he is said to have wrote Heartbreak Warfare (push it in and twist the knife again. Watch my face as I pretend to feel no pain”) and Jessica Simpson he recently called “sexual napalm.” So when Yet another ex, that sweet Taylor Swift, writes a song about him, all fair &tc., right?
It (writing the song) was a really lousy thing to do… I will say as a songwriter thatI think it’s kind of cheap songwriting… I think it’s abusing your talent to rub your hands together and go, “Wait till he gets a load of this!”
Coming from a man who recently was recently on the cover of Rolling Stone and expounding at length about masturbation in the included interview, talk of other people rubbing their hands together and abusing their talent sounds just crass.
Bob Welch (1946 - 2012)
Back when Fleetwood Mac’s Rumors owned the album chart and airwaves, For Mac guitarist Bob Welch had his first solo album on the charts. For my money at the time, French Kiss was the better album. Featuring the hits Sentimental Lady Ebony Eyes, French Kiss was a Welch’s biggest hit.
Sadly, Bob Welch shot himself in the chest this week at his California home. He was apparently suffering a medical condition and left a note.
Rest in Peace Bob Welch.

User submissionOne of the biggest reasons for Miami’s victory in Game 2 Sunday night was a dramatic inside improvement in the Heat’s defense.
After San Antonio dominated Game 1 with a 48-36 edge in points in the paint, Miami turned it around in Game 2 with a 44-34 edge, including only four San Antonio points in the paint in the fourth quarter.
Miami didn’t allow San Antonio an inside basket after Manu Ginobili’s running 7-footer with 8:17 left.
The late surge confounded Miami forward Chris Bosh, who was surprised when he learned about the turnaround.
“I didn’t even know we kept them out of the paint, to be honest with you,” Bosh said.
But Bosh said the Heat were determined to keep the Spurs away from the basket in Sunday’s game.
“It’s always important,” he said. “It’s one of the first priorities in our defense, but against this team it’s extremely tough because they spread you out and they don’t hesitate to shoot when they get opportunities.”
It wasn’t pretty. But the defending champions took the challenge to stop San Antonio’s interior game, leading to their eventual victory.
“We had to do a better job with that, contain the pick-and-rolls and the two-on-twos to give our backside defense more help and more opportunities to make plays,” Bosh said.
Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said the Heat did a much better job defending the Spurs inside as the game continued.
“We were struggling with it in the first quarter,” Spoelstra said. “It seemed like every time we looked up, Tony Parker was in the paint or (Tim) Duncan was in the paint. It’s much easier said than done.”Jalen Weaver's Story
If Jalen Weaver could pass a bit of advice to future Comets it would be, “don’t blink.”
His time at Olivet College has flown by. “It leaves me feeling like I’m not ready to move on! I’m thankful I have one more year left,” he said.
Weaver, a junior.
Some of Weaver’s favorite memories to date revolve around his experiences with the track team. Not just because he loves the sport, but because of the irreplaceable friendships he has forged with his teammates.
“My freshman year, we took this trip to Chicago for cross country,” he said. “It was our first big college race with more than 500 athletes participating. To take it all in with your friends, and to be just as wide eyed as the people next to you, was quite an experience!”
It’s apparent sports play a significant role in Weaver’s Olivet College education. He plans to continue tapping into his love of the game at the end of next year when he’ll pursue graduate school and a career in physical therapy.
Believing his experiences as an athlete will make him an empathetic physical therapist, he knew this was the career for him the summer before his freshman year.
“Whether it's throwing a fastball or walking up a set of stairs, I understand the frustrations and stress that an injury brings,” he said. While in high school, Weaver sustained a track injury that required therapy. “Their ability to get me healthy so quickly had me hooked; I knew this was what I wanted to do. I can now place myself in my patient’s shoes. I think they will be more at ease because of that, and I will be a more efficient therapist.”
From day one, Weaver has worked with Nick Juday, chair and associate professor of Health and Human Performance, to ensure he’s taking the classes that will optimize his potential of getting accepted into the best graduate programs. Juday and John Wilterding, Ph.D., professor of biology and chair of the Natural and Physical Science Department, also discuss various physical therapy programs with Weaver and connect him with alumni who have been through the process already.
Their collective work will help make Weaver’s transition from undergraduate to graduate work seamless.
“Nick and John are excellent teachers, but where they really impacted me was outside the classroom,” said Weaver. “They took an interest in me that was unparalleled to anything I had experienced before. Their care for me isn’t exclusive; they show every student the same level of interest. Professors like them make Olivet special.”
In response to his work both on- and off the track, Waver was named to the 2013-14 Capital One Academic All-America Division III second team and USTFCCCA All-Academic team.What a difference a year makes.

Lawmakers across the nation are continuing their campaign against the National Security Agency and the federal government’s expansive surveillance powers.
ALL YOUR PHONE CALLS ARE BELONG TO US: The NSA collects “meta-data” including call duration and location, for all Americans at all times. That violates at least three amendments to the Constitution, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday in California.
State lawmakers in New Hampshire and Arizona introduced legislation this week pushing back against the federal government’s warrantless data collection programs.
The bills are modeled on legislation drafted by the OffNow.org coalition, a state level organization challenging the federal government’s warrantless electronic surveillance activities.
In New Hampshire, HB1533, sponsored by two Republican state representatives, Neal Kurk and Emily Sandblade, and Democrat state Rep. Tim O’Flaherty, would prohibit a state official from searching a portable electronic device without a warrant.
Any official caught in willful violation could be charged with a Class-A misdemeanor, which under New Hampshire state law means immediate jail time upon conviction, along with a possible fine and probation.
HB1619, also sponsored by Kurk, “affirms a reasonable expectation of privacy in information from sources including, telephone; electric, water and other utility services; internet service providers; social media providers; banks and financial institutions; insurance companies; and credit card companies,” OffNow.org said in a statement.
The bill makes an exception for federal agents to collect data without a warrant, but bars state agencies from receiving and using the information in court..
Tennessee state lawmakers Sen. Stacey Campfield, R-Knoxville, and State Rep. Andy Holt, R-Dresden, introduced companion bills earlier in the week that would ban state officials from providing material support to an NSA code-breaking facility at Oak Ridge.
The bill mirrors similar legislation introduced Jan. 15 by two Washington state lawmakers seeking to deny material support and state funds to a NSA listening post at the U.S. Army’s Yakima Training Facility.
OffNow.org’s legal reasoning behind supporting the states refusing to help NSA is based in the Supreme Court legal precedent of the anti-commandeering doctrine, which recognizes that states can refuse to comply with federal laws and programs.
The principle is disputable under the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, however, which defers authority to the federal government in the event a conflict over power takes place between the federal and local governments.
OffNow.org has been able to find legislative allies not only in New Hampshire, Arizona, and Tennessee, but also Oklahoma, and Indiana.
“Sources close to the Coalition indicate lawmakers in several other states will introduce the act in the coming weeks,” said OffNow.org in a news statement on Thursday.
The organization, however, is not alone in its efforts.
At the federal level, Digital 4th — a coalition of the American Civil Liberties Union, Heritage Action for America, Americans for Tax Reform and the Center for Democracy & Technology — has been working to motivate lawmakers to update the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986.
The law, which allows federal agents to subpoena 180-day-old stored electronic communications, has been criticized for being outdated and unable to protect consumers’ privacy rights.
The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, a federal privacy watchdog, published a report on Thursday that concluded the NSA’s phone records collection program was illegal and should be terminated.
The White House rejected the PCLOB’s conclusion, standing firm in its belief that the program is lawful.

Researchers from the Karolinska Institute, Sweden, followed >45,000 men for an average of 18 years. The study participants' body mass index and smoking status were recorded at the age of 18. Overall, the researchers evaluated 1.7 million person-years for the study, evaluating the men's health and mortality. During that time, 2897 of the participants died.
The data showed that obese, teenaged nonsmokers held the same doubled risk of premature mortality as heavy smokers. The early death risk for heavy smokers with obesity was increased 5-fold.
Mothers in chaotic households run a higher likelihood of becoming obese, according to a study published in the February 2009 issue of the Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved. The researchers defined household instability as a "tenuous home environment" that includes stress over issues like financial insecurity and being able to keep children fed.
The investigators analyzed data from the Fragile Families and Wellbeing Study, in which 1449 mothers and their children in 20 US cities were analyzed between 2001 and 2004. The mothers evaluated were an average of 28 years old, and 40% of the children did not have fathers living in the household. The 2000 US Census was used to determine poverty in a given area.
The results showed that mothers with the most unstable households in areas largely untouched by poverty were more likely to be obese (odds ratio = 1.8, 95% confidence interval 1.2- 2.26). In children, however, the instability of the household was not a factor in overweight or obesity.
Regular lifestyle counseling added to pharmacologic therapy for obese patients provides significantly higher weight-loss success rate numbers. Researchers recently found that telephone counseling is just as effective as face-to-face counseling in promoting lifestyle changes in patients with obesity.
A study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine (February 17, 2009) evaluated the efficacy of 5 delivery methods for a program to help obese patients make lifestyle modifications. Obese patients (n = 376) taking 10 mg/ day of sibutramine (Meridia) were randomly assigned to the 5 groups.
The researchers found after 6 months that the patients who underwent high-frequency telephone (n = 76) or faceto- face (n = 74) counseling from a dietician not only saw similar weight-loss results, but also lost considerably more weight than those subject to the other intervention methods.
Other methods included low-frequency face-to-face counseling (n = 76), high-frequency e-mail counseling (n = 74), and no dietician counseling (n = 76). In all of the groups, the researchers observed significant improvements after 6 months in waist circumference; lipid, glucose, and insulin levels; blood pressure; weight-related symptoms; and quality of life.
As the number of overweight and obese Americans grows, so does the incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), new research has found. The disease, which consists of large numbers of fat deposits in the liver, affects about 20% of Americans.
The incidence of fatty liver disease keeps increasing, though it is hard to say just how much, according to Brent Tetri, MD, a hepatologist at the Liver Center at St. Louis University School of Medicine.
"We do not yet know the full extent of the problem, since it is a 'silent disease' with few symptoms," said Dr. Tetri. "A lot of people do not even know they have it until the damage is very severe."
Damage from NAFLD can vary. Some patients with the condition have no issues as a result, whereas about 25% of patients develop inflammation called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). For a third of that group, NASH can bring on cirrhosis-level liver scarring that sometimes results in organ failure, which necessitates a liver transplant, or death.
Because the incidence of fatty liver disease is directly correlated with lifestyle, the condition can be reversed with proper diet and exercise if it is caught early, said Dr. Tetri!!!

Best point and click game
Best point and click game I have ever seen on newgrounds, more gory than The Visitor and Orchestrated Death, but story and gameplay shold be better.
Rated 3.5 / 5 stars
Basically..
This game is quite fun and more of the horror type of games as it creates the sense of suspense through music and some extra music effects such as the 'heart thumping' sound.
Well, the only problem is that the suspicion, time momentum and the repetition of actions in this game. Which therefore affects this game in not having a reality and easy to complete. As you can see, there are a few points that needs to be questioned on, so that we can greatly favor your work.
1) The repetition of switching on the air-con. rack or window, wouldn't it surge the suspicion of the doctor?
2) When during a scenario where you have made the two couples fought with the man fishing, when are they going to stop arguing?
3) If that alien has got telepathy powers, why is it that it does not know that it is different from the humankind at the first place?
4) Apart from the game, don't you think it is better to make us lose and restart the game?
5) Why are you giving us hints, if so it may be the difficulty of the game. However, why is it so hard to find out how to solve each aspects of the game?
Thus, it is better for you to make the game harder and prolong the game plot. The thing is, where is the climax of this whole story? Extend your difficulties by compromising the time limit for each scenario. That would surely help. But anyways, I thought that this game is still fun, so I give you a rating of 7/10. Well done! Bt the way.
We would have a higher satisfactory for your upcoming game so, I hope you would devote more time in it. If you continue to strife on, you would get quite a good result in newgrounds so all the best! Good luck!
Thank you for all kind of words and questions, I really appreciated it.
Rated 3.5 / 5 stars
good game!
very nice game. i realy enjoyed and i can't wait for the next one!Absinthe Films is set to blow minds with Dopamine…

Encryption is not a panacea for security. If you are not in control of the environment (the hardware, the operating system and all software running on that system) then you have no control over the security – regardless of what encryption schemes you may have in place.

Simon and Garfunkel missed the boat when they recorded “Scarborough Fair” in 1966.
If you really want someone to be a true lover of thine, you need to woo him or her not with parsley, sage, rosemary or thyme, but basil.
Fragrant and peppery, with a hint of sweetness, basil is the ultimate summer herb. Its green, glossy leaves are exceptionally pretty and it doesn’t take a particularly green thumb to grow it -- just a well-drained spot in the sunshine. Plus, you get a lot of bang for the buck. One of the most prolific and forgiving herbs, basil plants keep producing all summer long if you’re tenacious about pruning the stem leaves every couple weeks and pinching off flowers before they go to seed.
Another reason we love it: Basil grows just as well in containers on your porch and kitchen window sill as it does tucked in alongside its best friend Mr. Tomato in the garden.
Though we tend to associate the ancient plant with Italy and other sunny Mediterranean countries -- basil is Greek for “kingly” or “royal” -- it’s actually native to India and Southeast Asia, where it’s been cultivated for some 5,000 years. And it’s not just a culinary darling; throughout history it’s also been used for medicinal purposes. Folklore holds the plant as a cure for scorpion bites, and it’s also thought to have a calming effect on upset stomachs. It’s also used to scent shampoo, soap and perfume.
This seems to be a particularly good year for basil gone wild: While PG Backyard Gardner Doug Oster reports his ’Genovese’ basil -- a bright-green, extremely tender variety with a reputation of making the best pesto -- has been going to seed in the hot weather, food editor Bob Batz Jr. says his plants’ leaves are as large as his hand. Sumptuous bunches have started to come in good at Thursday’s Market Square Farmers Market, some measuring a foot or more, for less than $5.
The most common varieties you’ll find in markets and grocery stores are the big-leafed sweet basil and Thai basil, which offers a slightly stronger taste and smaller, narrower leaves and purple stems. Yet there are so many more varieties with unusual scents, different colors and exotic flavors just waiting to be discovered and devoured.
The wonderfully fragrant ’Lemon basil,’ a hybrid of sweet and African blue basils, tastes of citrus. ’Thai Siam Queen’ is reminiscent of anise. Tiny-leafed ’Spicy Globe’ basil is exactly as billed -- a variety that grows into a small, round bush instead of leggy stalks and is extra spicy on the tongue. ’Cinnamon basil’ smells and tastes like, you got it, cinnamon, lending itself to fruit and baked goods such as pumpkin pie. ’Round Midnight’ basil has glossy deep-purple leaves and a mild licorice flavor.
Can you see where we’re going here?
It’s the perfect partner for a variety of summery foods.
While basil often is showcased in Italian recipes (pesto sauce originated in Genoa in the Liguria region of northern Italy) and is a mainstay in Vietnamese and Thai cuisine, it’s actually much more versatile. Depending on the variety, it’s as suitable for sweet treats, soups and salads as it is for savory dishes, making it summer’s go-to herb
Pesto is probably the most popular dish made with basil, so we’ve included instructions for a terrific Grilled Summer Pesto Pizza in the recipes compiled below. You’ll also find a pair of drinks -- one alcoholic and one that you can serve the kids -- a pasta dish, a recipe for basil oil (perfect for salads and drizzling on bread) and for dessert, a cool and creamy Basil Gelato.

Cantaloupe-Basil Agua Fresca
PG tested
Agua fresca (Spanish for “fresh water”) is a light, non-alcoholic drink served by street vendors and in eateries throughout Latin America. They’re made by combining fresh fruits, herbs and even flowers with sugar and water -- a nice, fruity drink to cool off with on a hot day.
I’ll admit it: This isn’t the most appealing drink, looks wise (my daughter told me it looked like snot). Color aside, it’s actually pretty refreshing. “Kind of like unsweetened lemonade,” my son told me.
Choose the ripest cantaloupe you can find -- it should feel heavy for its size, and be fragrant.
1 cantaloupe, peeled, seeded and cut into cubes
1 big handful fresh basil leaves, plus extra for garnish
1½ cups water
Juice of 3 limes
2 tablespoon granulated sugar
Fresh mint, for garnish
Add cantaloupe and half of the basil leaves to a blender and blend until completed pureed. Hold a fine-mesh strainer over a large bowl and pour the puree through, using a spoon to press all the juice out of the pulp at the end. Combine the cantaloupe juice, remaining basil leaves, water, lime juice and sugar in a large pitcher. Stir well to combine. Taste and add a little more sugar if desired. Store in fridge for an hour or so before serving.
Pour over ice and garnish with extra basil leaves or fresh mint.
Serves 4.

Grilled Summer Pesto Pizza
PG tested
Thin slices of zucchini stand in for the cheese in this healthful vegan pizza. You’ll end up with more pesto than you need. Use the extra to dress pasta or spread on sandwiches.
The original recipe called for one big pie, baked in the oven, but I made individual pizzettes on the grill. I also added a few tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese to the pesto.
For pesto
4 cups (packed) fresh basil leaves
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup pine nuts, toasted
1 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh garlic
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 to 3 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese, or to taste
For pizza
1 ball whole-wheat pizza dough, homemade or store-bought
Flour for dusting
Extra-virgin olive oil
3/4 cup good-quality marinara sauce
1 large zucchini, thinly sliced and grilled
1 medium yellow onion, cut in half lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 8 slices
1/2 cup pitted kalamata olives, coarsely chopped
For toppings
2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts
1/4 cup thinly sliced packed basil
Garlic powder, optional
Red pepper flakes, optional
Prepare pesto. Put basil, oil, pine nuts, garlic, salt and parmesan cheese in a food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped, then puree until the mixture is smooth, stopping to scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. if not using immediately, cover and store for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator. Return pesto to room temperature before using. by holding the ends of parchment paper. At a height of about 6 inches above the grill, flip circle of dough onto the hot side of the grill grates. Quickly peel off parchment and close lid. Grill pizza for 2 to 3 minutes, or until it has good grill marks. Turn the pizza with tongs and move it to the indirect side.
Cover dough with a layer of marinara sauce. Arrange grilled zucchini slices in concentric circles on the dough, leaving a 3/4-inch border bare. Arrange onion atop the zucchini, then scatter olives on top.
Slide pizza back onto the hot side of the grill and cook until crust is golden brown and toppings are hot, 2 to 3 minutes.
Remove pizza from grill with tongs onto a cutting board. Using half the pesto, immediately drop teaspoons of pesta all over the top. Spread it over the topping with the back of a spoon or with a cake spatula. Sprinkle with pine nuts and sliced basil. Use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to cut the pizza into 8 slices, and serve hot with garlic powder and red pepper flakes, if using.
Serves 3 to 4.

Pasta with Uncooked Tomato and Fresh Basil Sauce
PG tested
The only thing you have to cook in this recipe is the pasta. The sauce is perfect for summer -- full flavored, but still light. Choose a good-quality olive oil and make sure the ingredients are at room temperature when you toss them with the pasta.
6 ripe plum tomatoes (about 1 pound)
3 to 4 cloves garlic, minded
1 cup shredded fresh basil leaves, loosely packed
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon salt
Freshly ground pepper to taste
1 pound pasta, such as linguine, spaghetti or vermicelli
2/3 cup grated parmesan cheese
Wash tomatoes and pat dry. Cut out cored and discard. Cut each tomato in half horizontally and gently squeeze out the seeds.
Dice tomatoes into 1-inch pieces and place in medium bowl. Add garlic, basil, parsley, olive oil, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper to taste. Toss well. Let marinate at room temperature for at least 2 hours. If you marinate it longer, put it in the refrigerator, but bring to room temperature before serving.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook pasta until al dente. Drain well in colander and return to pot or a large serving dish.
Immediately toss parmesan cheese on pasta. Pour on the sauce. Toss well and serve immediately -- you want it warm rather than hot.
Serves 4.

Basil Gelato
PG tested
Frozen desserts don’t immediately come to mind then you think of basil, but that’s a mistake. There’s something about the combination of the herb with lemon that’s just so pleasing on the palate. This gelato recipe is super-easy, and the perfect way to cool off on a humid summer evening. Be sure to properly cool the mixture in the fridge before churning -- I was too impatient to, so my first batch churned and churned but never froze. Argh.
2 cups basil leaves
2 cups milk
1 cup heavy cream
3/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1/4 teaspoon salt
6 egg yolks.

Do they have a logical, easy to understand file structure?
Do they offer the user complete control over the UI? By that I don't mean themes. I mean letting me choose exactly how I want each element to look like.
Do their apps start in an instant?
Even though most of AmigaOS's features were implemented in other operating systems, it still has some interesting features not present in Windows/Linux/OS X. hadn't been informed.
Once the barge is classified and obtains a Coast Guard inspection certificate, it'll take roughly 17 days to travel to its destination between the Chukchi and Beaufort drilling sites, Slaiby said.
SHELL EAGER TO START
Shell recently approached the U.S. Department of the Interior to see if it could begin some pre-drilling work in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas before the barge arrives.
"That's so far inconclusive. We are still talking to Interior," Slaiby said. He said he didn't want to discuss the request in detail. "That's between Shell and Interior."
Federal officials declined to discuss that request but say Shell won't get its drilling permits until the containment system has been tested in the water. No drilling can occur without the special barge, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, which oversees oil spill response and issues well drilling permits.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, on Thursday told reporters she hopes that the Department of Interior will be flexible in its dealings with Shell.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told The New York Times recently that he expected to make a final decision on whether to issue Shell its drilling permits by Aug. 15.
A SLOW MELT
Sea ice in the region is lingering a couple of weeks longer than normal, according to Kathleen Cole, the National Weather Service's sea ice program leader in Alaska.
"We still have quite a bit of ice in the northern Chukchi Sea and in the western Beaufort Sea," Cole said Thursday.
The ice is thicker and melting slower than usual, but it's not record-breaking, she said. First-year ice is 9 to 11 feet thick, she said.
Last year was the anomaly, she said.
"Last year the ice went away very quickly and it was open and gorgeous," Cole said.
This year, ice is closed in around Point Barrow, and vessels that normally bring supplies in the summer are still awaiting their window, she said.
"I think the first shot they'll have to get around the point, not just Shell but the boats doing the restocking, will probably be in around two weeks," Cole said. Normally, vessels can get around Point Barrow by mid- to late July, she said.
The ice will move north, away from the coast for a spell, but will then close back in, an oscillating pattern that is familiar in the Arctic, she said.
She said she communicates several times a week with Shell. The company has a ship in the area already studying ice conditions and gives its data to her office.
Greenpeace's icebreaker ship, the Esperanza, also is in Chukchi near where Shell hopes to drill, researching the sea beforehand. Photographs sent from the ship show a seascape dotted with icebergs.
"We've observed sea ice, bearded seals, and a minke whale at the location where Shell hopes to drill this summer. Extreme conditions here in the Arctic mean that an oil spill could not be cleaned up and would devastate this pristine environment," Jackie Dragon, Greenpeace's lead Arctic campaigner, said in an email from the ship.
Smith, the Shell spokesman, said Greenpeace's rhetoric is unfortunate. He said Shell's oil spill response plan is unprecedented with "world class, proven assets that we look forward to never using."
AIR QUALITY
Shell also continues to work on a third issue, its Environmental Protection Agency air permit for one of its drilling rigs, the Noble Discoverer.
It notified the EPA in June that generators on the Discoverer for the drilling equipment couldn't meet pollution discharge standards set under the already approved permit. Shell is seeking a waiver so it can operate this year while it applies for a new permit. Smith said that overall, Shell is well within the cap on the air permit but those particular generators can't meet specific limits set for them. Shell expects to resolve the matter soon, he said.
The Noble Discoverer and the Kulluk, Shell's other drilling rig, remain in Dutch Harbor, where they stopped for supplies. It'll take them four to five days to reach their Arctic destinations.Leroy Black, 93, Claysburg, passed away Monday at HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital of Altoona.

Mission of Burma
The Sound the Speed the Light
(Matador)
US: 6 Oct 2009
UK: 12 Oct 2009
Since reforming in 2002, Mission of Burma has consistently avoided the most common pitfall in the biz: a once-influential band reunites and sullies their good name in the process. And living up to such landmarks of American post-punk as 1981’s Signals, Calls, and Marches and 1982’s Vs. is no cakewalk. Those albums sound as vital today as they did upon their release and if they aren’t in your arsenal of music… well, check them out now because you’re missing out. Mission of Burma is the thinking punk’s music—their rhythmic intensity, instantly recognizable style, and mix of noise and melody are unlike any other. The apt title of return album ONoffON had its moments. The Obliterati from 2006 nearly reaches the height of the band’s early material. Now, with the release of The Sound the Speed the Light the band rolls out another solid, if slightly unspectacular album. It’s certainly no spoiler though.
The album begins with “1,2,3 Partyy!”, a charging, humorous burner with classic Burma shredding from Roger Miller. Drummer Peter Prescott stabs the beat, accenting the action with the hostility and restlessness that makes the band’s music so propulsive. Clint Conley’s bass forms the bedrock for Miller and Prescott’s explorations while offering a measure of calm. The song surges and spins like the classic “This Is Not a Photograph” from Signals, Calls, and Marches. Parallels could also be drawn to the aggressive second track from The Obliterati “Spider’s Web”. However, after the roiling “Possession”, the gentle picking of the intro to “Blunder” announces that this is a record with a different wrinkle—a softer one.
The fourth tune “Forget Yourself” confirms the notion that Burma wants to tweak it’s formula ever so slightly on The Sound the Speed the Light . This is a more introspective, gentle Burma. The song lumbers at what amounts to mid-tempo for the band and even flirts with falsetto at times. It retains an unmistakable Burma quality, but almost caresses the ear before gathering steam for a Miller solo that destroys any semblance of gentleness. The somber mood returns later on the album with the track “Feed”. These softer moments aren’t terribly unsuccessful, but they do come off a bit awkward in spots. Given that this is the third album since their return, however, one can’t fault the band for trying something a little different.
Many of album highlights “SSL 83” and “So Fuck It” operate in the zone where Mission of Burma truly excels: the instrumental sections where their knotty, precise attack can writhe and slash. It’s in these spaces where Burma take the song into unforeseen territory and exhibit their considerable dexterity and tightness. The hypnotic quality of the Miller’s guitar work and the stop-start sections cut as sharp as anything in the band’s discography on “SSL 83” and “So Fuck It”.
Even when the band rips through a song sans an instrumental section as they do on “Good Cheer”, they are more than capable of keeping things unexpected and fresh. The track alternately staggers and sprints, adding gravity and heft to the proceedings in a way that isn’t easily predictable. Only repeated listens reveal when the band is about to lift off it’s frame and hurtle forward. There are times when this band sounds unstoppable, and “Good Cheer” is certainly among them.
“So Fuck It” includes the type of resigned kiss-off expected from an band used to battling: “I often wonder what I’m worth / But I won’t take shit from you or anyone else / So fuck it!” It’s a moment of that old Burma angst that boils just underneath the band’s best work. And it’s how Mission of Burma sounds best: pissed off and chargingPros, anyway) will be the new, full Retina display support.

Alter Bridge guitarist reveals five songs he's learning
He may be a multi-million selling guitarist but Mark Tremonti's attitude to his instrument is no different to the rest of us: "I'm always struggling to get better – I'm never complacent," he tells Guitarist.
Mark is as much a student of guitar technique as he is a songwriter. His tremendous growth as a player in the last five years is a testament to how these two vital elements have complimented each other.
As a player that never stops listening to others and in pursuit of new technique approaches, head of issue 335's in-depth feature on the making of the new Alter Bridge album ABIII, here he tells us about five tracks he's currently got in his sights to learn...
1. Robben Ford - Up The Line (Blue Moon, 2002)
"Robben Ford's phrasing is insane and his licks are just so different. I've got better with my ear to be able to tell where someone is going when they play but he takes it to pentatonic box areas that people don't usually play in.
"He comes up with clever little licks that you just wouldn't normally do in your little pentatonic box. He'll take you all around - things I never would have found or thought of myself. You can listen to every band that plays pentatonic stuff in the world and you still won't find one that does some of what he's doing."
2. Rock Bottom - UFO (Phenomenon, 1974)
"When I learn a song from someone like the Robben Ford I try to then balance it out by learning something that's a bit more about what I do. So I'm learning this from Strangers In The Night which is great. I'm just starting to dabble in Michael Schenker's work for the straight ahead rock 'n' roll."
3. Lenny - Stevie Ray Vaughan - (Texas Flood, 1983)
"I want to get back into learning some more Stevie Ray Vaughan because I was learning his stuff and then realised everyone else in the world was doing it. It wasn't going to be anything new. But I've been thinking about going back and relearning Lenny because I love that song."
4. Larry Carlton - Blues For TJ (Collection, 1991)
"I'm thinking of dabbling in some Larry Carlton too, and if I do that I'll have to offset it with some new..."
5. Black Label Society – Crazy Horse (Order Of The Black, 2010)
"It's devastating. I love it. Zakk Wylde is great - just pure brutality a lot of the time. It's good to learn from a guy like Robben Ford for that soft touch then dig in and try to keep up with Zakk. It's about a balance of influences because if you follow one guy too much, you'll start sounding like them."

Board of Trustees at the agency’s Dignity Gala to be held on March 15 at the Grand Colonial in Hampton. Alternatives is a nonprofit organization providing residential, employment, and support services to individuals with developmental disabilities, mental illness and other special needs, as well as the homeless.
“Sam has shown a commitment to the agency and its mission for more than 20 years,” said Alternatives President, Nancy Good of Kingwood. “When Sam joined the Alternatives Board of Trustees we had a budget of about $1 million, but with his help our budget has increased to nearly $15 million and the scope of services to people with disabilities has increased proportionally.” Under Sam’s leadership, the agency experienced tremendous program expansion into new service areas and branched out to serve communities in Hunterdon, Warren, Somerset, Middlesex and Monmouth counties.
Prior to moving to Hunterdon County, Sam and his wife Dell resided in their native Texas. Sam enlisted in the Air Force and joined Johnson & Johnson after attaining an Honorable Discharge. While with J&J, Sam served in several financial positions within the company and attended the University of Texas in the evenings. He eventually retired as Vice President of Finance from Johnson & Johnson Consumer Products in Skillman. Sam & Dell have been involved in the community for many years. In the 1980’s, Sam served as an American Cancer Society Crusade Chair in Middlesex County. Dell served on the Alternatives Dignity Gala Committee for many years. They continue to be active in the community and at United Methodist Church in Flemington. They are blessed with three sons and 11 grandchildren who share their enthusiasm for volunteerism and community spirit.
Alternatives will celebrate the Dignity Gala on Friday, March 15, with a 90-minute cocktail reception, dinner and dancing. In keeping with Sam’s Texas roots the gala will have a Western theme complete with a mechanical bull and a roping demonstration. A silent and live auction for items such as golf outings, excursions, tickets to sporting events and gift certificates to restaurants will be available throughout the evening. Tickets for a cash raffle are available to the general public now and tickets will continue to be sold until the drawing at the gala.

This was my ticket to riches in a train made out of shame, hypocrisy, and mostly cotton! Big things were predicted…big things! So now that the initial week is over and the hype has died down a little, let’s see how much I netted!
So my royalty amount is $4, multiply that by zero, the number of shirts sold, and remember to adjust for taxes and…hang on, ZERO?
Zero. Zero sold.
I suppose I should be grateful. In a way, this should be a life-affirming moment, where I realize things aren’t as bad as I thought. Like that scene in The Dark Knight, where the citizens of Gotham won’t blow up the barge of convicts, this is a great moment for humanity even if it’s lousy for the Joker (me).
Also, it’s not like I sunk any money into this venture. I posted the thing on Spreadshirt, linked to it in various places, and just waited for the money to (not) roll in. So there was no cost to me whatsoever.
Except…wasn’t there? Because I also put it on my Tumblr, and tagged it with multiple nerdy tags to get attention. Sure enough, it got picked up some (108 notes, which isn’t great, but isn’t bad) and I looked at some of the Tumblrs that reblogged it. I looked at them. Oh god I looked at them.
Folks, people really like that Cumberbatch fellow.
I saw a lot of “WANT!” and “I CAN HAZ?” but apparently no one WANTed enough to actually HAZ, even though there was a link to the shop right there. I realized that posting to Tumblr was a double-edged sword: it provided some traction to the image, but it was traction to a community that is solely defined by its willingness to post images to each other. Tumblr fans don’t need a shirt. How would anyone see it; they’d have to leave the house! But a picture of a shirt? That’s like a million times better. For Tumblr’s purposes, reblogging the picture and adding “WANT” at the bottom is exactly equivalent to buying it and wearing it around your friends. Similarly with Twitter: retweet the image, say how awesomejelly it is, and you’re done.
I’m kind of curious now to know how well Two Things and Oh God Don’t Sue shirt sites actually do. I’m not saying my experience means it’s impossible to sell shirts on the web (after all, someone bought this from me) but I wonder if Tumblr and Twitter really do eat into the market.
Still, it’s not like I didn’t get anything out of it. I got this great thread on BoardGameGeek! Look at the reply that includes an “Um”, a “you forgot”, and “fail”! I was overcome by that one and had to lie down for a bit afterwards. There’s also this:
1) Videogames are totally mainstream. Geeks play them, but so does everyone else – this should be replaced by boardgames.
2) Zombies are passe
3) Buffy is Meh
I like this because I was wondering why I hear so little about zombies these days. Turns out they’re passe!
Don’t think I’ve been daunted, though, because I am undaunted. My plans for version 2.0 of the Big Damn Frakkin’ T-Shirt continue undiminished. And I’ll keep you updated on future sales, provided there are any.
UPDATE: There’s now a Bigger Damn Frakkin’ T-Shirt.how do you open the sims card?

Fortunately, the storms held off and the state-of-the-art facility took center stage.
While students have been taking classes for two weeks inside, the public got its first glimpse of the 31,000 square-foot building that is home to several certificate programs like nursing, respiratory therapy and phlebotomy, among others. Simulated labs and hospital rooms mimic “patients” having real-life situations from cardiac arrest to a woman giving birth.
But before attendees looked inside, WC President Dr. Kevin Eaton, Frank Martin, Board of Trustees Chairman, and Bob Glenn, WC Foundation President, said a few words highlighting the many people who helped make the $6 million project possible.
“This is another huge day for Weatherford College,” Eaton said. “We always strive to put the students first and this building accomplishes that.”
Eaton then touted the raising of $2.4 million in the Foundation’s capital campaign, spoke about how the project came in under budget and on-time and praised past and present board members for their vision of what they want WC to be. He added that with furniture and equipment, the cost of the building was less than $188 per square-foot.
“Our mission is to provide effective learning opportunities that enrich the lives of our students and the communities we serve,” Eaton said. “I truly believe that all of the capital projects we have completed over the past four years have done just that.”
Martin agreed and said that every accomplishment the college celebrates just proves that WC is a place to be recognized.
“[This is a] quality place to get educated,” he said.
He then introduced two Allied Health students, both married with children, who are taking classes at the college - Shannon Coble and Dennis Maguth.
Coble is in the LVN to RN program and said how grateful she was for the innovative new labs. Maguth, a sonography student, said the “Cadillac of a building” gives him a sense of pride.
“As we come up the hill and see the Don Allen Health Science Building, there’s a great sense of pride,” he said. “It’s a great time to be a student.”
Glenn took time to give special thanks to Jerry and Vickie Durant, whose $400,000 donation was the largest the Foundation received toward the new building. He then presented the Durants and also Allen (the building’s namesake) a framed collage with photos of the facility.
After taking a couple of ribbon-cutting photos with both the Weatherford Chamber of Commerce and East Parker County Chamber of Commerce, attendees were then invited inside to look at the various labs and classrooms. Students were on hand in each room to talk about the particular benefit of that area.
At the “hospital,” for example, lab assistant Mary Knickerbocker controls each of the SimMan patients - life-like mannequins that blink, talk, cough and interact with the students based on what they instructor wants them to focus on that day.
“We have four adults, one child and a birthing one where a woman has a child,” she explained. “There is even a crash cart if that’s the situation the instructor chooses.”
One particular “patient” was set up for students later in the day to work on who mimicked hypothermia, complete with blue fingertips and a blue nose. When students arrive, Knickerbocker will program the patient’s reactions from a computer screen.
“This helps them with their clinical experience and take what they’ve learned in the classroom and apply it,” Knickerbocker said. “It’s better to make a mistake in here than in the real world.”
There is also a basic skills area where students can request medicines and supplies for patients when needed, just as they would do in a hospital.
Another upstairs lab area simulates a triage in an emergency room. During Thursday’s tour, a student was sewing up a wound on the stomach of a mannequin. There were also clinical areas for patient consultations for those who may work in home health and doctor’s offices. Downstairs, phlebotomy students can learn to draw blood from patients with “arms” that are attached to fake blood bags.
During the tour, several students from the various Allied Health programs touted how much better the new labs were and thanked everyone for attending and contributing to their future.Guest

Gloo - A Data Project Management Tool
Presented by: Trent Ha.SILVER CITY — The Gila National Forest will be conducting the first training session for the Southwest Forest Fire Fighter recruitment program Dec. 17-21. This session will be exclusively for students, both college and high school (given that a high school student will be 18 years of age by graduation), and will focus on firefighter and camp crew positions. Candidates must bring a current student ID card. Additional training opportunities for interested non-student candidates will be announced after the holiday season.
Southwest Forest Fire Fighters have a long and distinguished history in the Southwest. The concept of "call-when-needed" fire crews can be traced back to the Mescalero Apache Tribe and the "Red Hats" fire crews that were organized in the spring of 1948 to address increasing fire activity on tribal lands. As a highly successful approach to fire fighting, Southwest Forest Fire Fighters crews eventually branched out to all able-bodied individuals who knew how to swing an ax and use a shovel. Strong work ethics and pride in a job well done keep crews in use each fire season and with forests experiencing ever-increasing fire danger, crew members can expect to be called to duty frequently.
To qualify for the Southwest Forest Fire Fighter recruitment program, candidates must attend the introductory session on Nov. 30, from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. at the Gila Supervisors' Office, 3005 E. Camino del Bosque in Silver City. Candidates must also attend all of the 40 hour class on Dec. 8, 9, 15 and 16 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Dec. 21 from 1 to 6 p.m.
The introductory meeting is expected to last an hour. the introductory meeting and the 40-hour training class will not be accepted into the program. (575) 388-8201.Ex parte McCardle – Case Brief Summary
Summary of Ex parte McCardle, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 506 (1868)..
Disposition
Dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
Notes
In this case, Congress withdrew the right to hear habeas corpus cases only when the Court got a case under the Act of 1867 on appeal from a lower court. The Supreme Court would still have been able to hear an original petition for habeas corpus filed in the Supreme Court.
See Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee for a constitutional law case brief in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that it has appellate jurisdiction to review decisions of state courts involving issues of federal law.<<

Favorite
While only a Washtenaw County Parks & Recreation park
since 1979, the 127 acres comprising County Farm Park have been owned by
Washtenaw County since 1836 when the land was purchased to construct a poor
house and an insane asylum. Subsequently, the Washtenaw Infirmary stood on
the site from 1917 until the late 1970s when it was demolished. In the
1970s the northwest wooded area was operated as Park Washtenaw by the City
of Ann Arbor. WCPARC made basic improvements to convert the entire site into
a park in the early 1980s and in 1991 the Recreation Center
opened.
Today, County Farm Park is known for its rolling
meadows, varied terrain, and upland woodland (Britton Woods), which preserve
both the rural character of the 19th century as well as elements of
presettlement vegetation and wildlife. Native hardwoods, trilliums and other
wildflowers, numerous bird and small animal species all coexist here. WCPARC
devotes considerable resources and staff time to maintain the variety and
diversity of the park landscape. Park Horticulturist Kathy Squiers plants
and maintains the gardens to provide a wonderful show of color most of the
year. This past spring 23 trees were planted to compensate for the
destruction of ash trees caused by the emerald ash borer. Periodically
invasive species are removed and the welcome assistance of volunteers helps
to control invaders like garlic mustard.
Something for Everyone
Undoubtedly, one of the most popular aspects of County
Farm is its looped trail
system, a major organizing element of the master plan developed by local
landscape architects Ken Polakowski and Terry Brown. The trail system
provides panoramic views of the parkscape without the intrusion of the busy
city just outside the park. The main system consists of a 0.6-mile inner
loop and a 1.1-mile outer loop. In addition, a 1.4-mile parcourse exercise trail
features 18 stations to enhance your workout.
Two park pavilions are located in County Farm, one near each
of the main entry points at Platt Road (east) and Medford Road (west). The
Main Pavilion and surrounding area became much more interesting
this summer with the installation of a new discovery playground
and accessible community gardens in June. The playgrounds farm
theme is evident with its bright red barn play structure, windmill, farm
animals, water-play troughs and a safety surfacing pattern reminiscent of
field crops. Raised beds, table planters, and trellis boxes provide
opportunities for gardeners with physical limitations. Response to this
project, which involved considerable community input, has been quite
enthusiastic. Project Grow manages the accessible gardens as well as
existing community garden plots just north of the Main Pavilion. On the
other side of the park, the Medford Pavilion, erected last year to replace its well worn
predecessor, is a great place to have a sandwich before a restorative
amble through Britton Woods.
If you havent visited County Farm Park recently,
come take a stroll through this special urban oasis.

As an essential component of SDL Customer Experience Cloud, the platform will simplify translation and global communication for businesses of all sizes by providing direct access to language capabilities from within their customer experience ecosystem. The solution allows organizations to directly engage with consumers across the globe at every stage of the customer journey, allowing them to capitalize on global market opportunities and drive international revenues.
The SDL Language Cloud is the first cloud-based language platform to offer the full spectrum of translation options – human, machine and specialist machine translation – providing a solution for translating all content, from highly branded campaigns to websites, support content, user reviews and instant chat. With this platform, marketers benefit from the ability to engage customers around the globe, across every touch point, in the right language, providing a culturally relevant and seamless experience for the buyer. Brands can now create content and experiences and weave them together into the local language at the point of creation, delivering communication where the customer wants to see it, in the language that they want to see it in.
“Organizations today need to address customers around the world across a growing portfolio of content, throughout the buying cycle,” said Dominic Kinnon, CEO of SDL Language Solutions. “In order for brands to break these communication barriers with their intended audiences, language needs to be a critical factor in their global customer experience strategy. The SDL Language Cloud provides a solution for all of these needs by simplifying translation for organizations and offering a combination of human and machine translation options and local language interactions with customers, regardless of geographic region.”
Today’s multicultural, always-connected and digitally savvy society demands a comprehensive translation and localization strategy to drive customer engagement across the globe, fostering brand advocacy and loyalty, opening up the opportunity for brands to focus on international expansion and business growth. Findings from a recent Common Sense Advisory Board study, “Can’t Read, Won’t Buy,” demonstrate that 75 percent of online shoppers are more likely to buy products from websites in their language and 74 percent are more likely to purchase from the same brand again if the after-sales care is in their language. Language is now a critical success factor for organizations and, now more than ever, there is a need for technology that provides seamless, accurate and personalized content – in the right language.
SDL Language Cloud is a complete cloud platform that makes translation technology and services easily accessible to everyone. The solution provides on-demand access to translation services and APIs for integrating human and machine translation capabilities into any application. In the coming months, SDL Language Cloud will expand to include subscription access to machine translation and terminology for use in the translation process, collaboration tools and innovative solutions to transform translation efficiency.

They extended their partnership to 61, before the introduction of Imran Tahir put the brakes on.The Proteas leg-spinner, who finished with two for two in two overs, inflicted the first breakthrough by trapping Puttick leg before wicket for 24. Three deliveries later he sent Levi (36 off 25 balls) on his way with a wide delivery that he crashed straight to Hardus Viljoen at mid-off.The rain arrived at 69 for two and the players never returned.Cricket South Africa (CSA) Acting CEO Jacques Faul congratulated the two franchises on sharing the trophy. “It was unfortunate that the weather dampened both attempts to play the final as it has done to many of the league matches as well but there is no doubt that the two most consistent sides reached the final. They have both played highly professional and entertaining cricket and they are to be commended for that.“I would also like to thank one of our many new sponsors, Momentum, for their massive contribution to the success of the competition. The national selectors took note of the high standard of play and this is reflected in the number of new caps announced this week for the Proteas’ squads to play New Zealand.”The teamsbiz.
When the lockout ended, Caron remained in a Spoked-P, an injured player and an afterthought.
After the Chris Bourque Experiment came to an end Thursday when Bourque was placed on waivers and ultimately sent back to the AHL, Caron will finally get that opportunity to prove he can stick in the NHL.
“I wanted to come here this year and keep going,” Caron said. “Obviously it didn’t go that way. Going down to Providence, I wasn’t that happy about it, but there was nothing I could do. But now I’m here and it’s a new start. I have to use this next month or so.”
It’s unclear when Caron will enter the lineup. Coach Claude Julien said he hasn’t decided who will play Saturday vs. Philadelphia.
Caron has played better of late with Providence, recording seven points in his last nine games there.
“From what I’ve been told, he’s been pretty good the last five, six games,” Julien said. “He’s a player that’s been here, got some experience. You send a guy down, bring a guy up. We like him on our team and we’re going to give those guys an opportunity to show that they belong here or they don’t.”
Caron got in 48 games last season and had some solid stretches, including seven points in four games in early March. He was out of the lineup for the first five games of the playoffs, but returned for the final two.
. He’s done that and it’s giving him that opportunity to prove he can do that.”
SODERBERG CHATTER: The Bruins may bring Carl Soderberg to the team once the Swedish Elite League season ends.
Soderberg has been Bruins’ property since 2007, but has chosen to stay in Sweden since then.
At this point it’s not definite that he would come to North America, meaning Julien is not counting on anything.
“Pretty well been a name on a list,” Julien said of Soderberg. “I’ve got the reports on him like everyone else. When you have a player coming, you’d like to have some information on him. So that’s all I had on him.”
Milan Lucic said it’s Soderberg’s loss to not be in Black and Gold.
“We have a good time,” Lucic said. “He’s missing out.”
LUCIC LIKES REALIGNMENT: Vancouver native Lucic is a fan of the realignment that is expected to go into effect next season.
The plan calls for new divisional alignments and home-and-homes with other team in the league.
It means the Bruins will face Western Conference teams — like the Canucks — twice a season.
“I never understood why we went to Chicago every other year, and even Detroit every other year,” Lucic said. “I never understood that where it’s an Original 6 battle, why we didn’t play them twice. It’s going to happen next year so it’s going to be cool to go into every building every year.
“I know the fans are going to enjoy it, and for me I’ll get to go home every year, even though they don’t like me as much there anymore. To be able to go home and play every year and play in front of my family in Vancouver will be fun.”
Lucic is not as big a fan of the new playoff format, which will be all within the division for the first two rounds, similar to the old Adams Division days.
“I’m kind of on the fence with that,” Lucic said. “I like it for the first round, but after that I think it should be reset. It’s going to increase rivalries, whether we have rivalries with them or not. More likely than not it’s going to be an Original 6 team in our division, whether it’s Detroit or us or Montreal or Toronto. It’ll make for some interesting outcomes coming up the next two years.”

The display was curated by Ron Costley, who was responsible for the book’s design and who oversaw production. For those who didn’t get a chance to see it, here are just a few snapshots accompanied by Ron’s text.
Published in three fine editions by Faber and Faber in 1991 on behalf of the AIDS Crisis Trust, Hockney’s Alphabet was the result of a unique creative and charitable endeavour. In an attempt to raise funds for those living with AIDS, the poet Sir Stephen Spender invited a number of British and American writers to contribute original texts to accompany letters of the alphabet specially drawn for the Trust by David Hockney. The partnership seemed a natural one: Spender and Hockney had begun a friendship when the poet was buying Hockney’s etchings while he was still a student at the Royal College of Art.
Among the writers who responded to the invitation were Gore Vidal, Iris Murdoch, Norman Mailer, Ian McEwan and a number of Faber authors including Seamus Heaney, William Golding, Ted Hughes and Kazuo Ishiguro.
The alphabet created in a variety of media including collage, ink and marker on laser copies was reproduced by offset lithography using up to twelve colours. Hockney’s approval of proofs was obtained at every stage. The resulting anthology was published for the Trust by Faber and Faber and in the US by Random House.

And this was supposed to be the minor leagues of stock car racing?
When it comes to NASCAR, the lines between the majors and the minors are blurred. Nextel Cup stars such as Earnhardt regularly race against the up-and-comers and on-the-way-downers in the Busch Series.
And no one finds it that unusual - though it's akin to Alex Rodriguez and Barry Bonds stopping by to play a few games in Triple A every year.
"I like it because we can come down here and be real successful," said Earnhardt, who won the season-opening Busch race Monday - less than 24 hours after winning the Daytona 500 on the same track. "It's just fun. Until they say we can't, I'll keep doing it."
NASCAR has no problem with its top drivers taking part in Busch races, knowing they bring in more fans and sponsors to the series that normally provides a warmup to the big event every weekend. The stars even have their own name: Buschwhackers.
The 34-race Busch season includes 26 events that are run in the same cities as Nextel Cup races, usually the day before to bolster the weekend schedule. (The Busch race at Daytona International Speedway was completed Monday because of rain.)
The other eight Busch races serve a different purpose for NASCAR, going to tracks - including Nashville, St. Louis and Kentucky - that haven't landed a prized spot on the Nextel Cup schedule. Call it the consolation prize.
Gordon, who finished third Monday, said the Nextel Cup regulars add a little glamour to the developmental series. He has a three-year deal to run 25 Busch races annually, in addition to his regular job.
"It's great for the sport," Gordon said. "If not for the Cup guys coming down, the Busch Series would struggle. They wouldn't have the sponsors they do now."
There are other benefits.
"We can teach the young kids what the next level is like," Gordon said. "A lot of the guys in our series came from the Busch Series."
What do the stars get out of it? For many, it's a chance to start building their own race team. Earnhardt, for example, co-owns a Busch operation with stepmother Teresa Earnhardt. Martin Truex is the team's fulltime driver, but Junior plans to take part in at least two more Busch races this season.
Then there's Johnny Sauter and Kasey Kahne, Nextel Cup rookies. They'll do double duty this season with a full slate of Busch races - a way to gain twice as much experience in a year's time.
There's nothing the Busch guys like better than beating the Buschwhackers. It didn't happen at Daytona, but the regulars did knock off the interlopers in six of the past nine companion races a year ago.
"It ups your game," Busch driver Jason Leffler said. "When I went down to the truck series for a couple of years, I didn't have as many good guys around me. I got into a rut. When I came back and did a couple of Cup races at the end of the year, I was like, "Holy cow. This is tough.' Those guys are the best. You have to do the best you can to stay with them."
The Busch Series serves up an interesting mix on race day. It's a chance to see drivers on the rise, such as 2003 champion Brian Vickers, who won the title at age 20 and earned a fulltime Cup ride this season.
Then there are drivers such as 33-year-old Jason Keller, who are trying to make a living in Busch while clinging to the hope of a promotion. With more and more 20-somethings getting a chance to race in the Cup series, he knows the window of opportunity is closing.
"Everyone has different agendas down here," Keller said. "Some guys are using it as a stepping stone. Some just use it to play around on a day off. Then there's guys like me and David Green, who are trying to use it for our fulltime job."
Busch officials have tried to level the playing field by requiring all teams to be in the inspection line before the first Cup practice on the morning of a Busch race. If nothing else, that eliminated the perception that Cup drivers had an advantage by getting in a practice right before the Busch race.

Source: DVD ActiveAt a marathon meeting with the Committee on Education, the leadership of POTAG was adamant on their demand for 2013 and 2014 arrears of research allowances.
However, the leaders eventually accepted the pleas of the members of the Education Committee to use dialogue to resolve the impasse and prevail on the government to pay their allowances.
DAILY GUIDE’s sources said that POTAG members have agreed in principle to sign the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) brokered by members of the Education Committee.
The sources told the paper that the polytechnic teachers in the MOU want to see practical steps being taken by government to pay their arrears before they would go back to the classroom.
The polytechnic teachers also called for a timeframe by which government would pay their arrears.
They appealed to the authorities to fully consult them on matters relating to the determination of their salaries and allowances.
The committee is yet to present the MoU to the Ministry of Education for action to be taken.

After a rain delay of an hour-and-a-half at Pocono Raceway on Sunday, Jeff Gordon and the No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet team turned the bad luck they'd experienced all season into good luck when they got by a in incident involving the front runners to take the lead just before a caution came out on lap 98 and drove around the track under caution until more rains came to end the race for good.
"The way our year has gone, we'll definitely take it," Gordon said.
I'd never seen the sea part like that.
His Hendrick Motorsports teammate, Kasey Kahne, limped around with a flat tire on his No. 5 Chevrolet under the final caution until the race was called to finish second. Mark Truex Jr. was third in the No. 55 Michael Waltrip Racing Toyota.
"We knew that restart was going to be key," No. 24 crew chief Alan Gustafson said.
Pole sitter Juan Pablo Montoya in the No. 42 Earnhardt Ganassi Racing Chevrolet and fellow front row starter Denny Hamlin in the No. 11 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota exchanged the lead several times in the opening laps before Hendrick Motorsports took control of the race on lap 15.
The No. 88 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet took the lead on that lap and was joined by HMS teammate Jimmie Johnson in the No. 48 Chevrolet in second position on lap 35.
Earnhardt fell off the pace for a broken transmission while leading the race on lap 50. He headed to the garage for repairs, handing the lead over to Johnson.
"It started missing some shifts and then going through the tunnel, it broke fourth," Earnhardt said. "Then trying to go back into third, it broke."
Johnson dominated the remainder of the race, leading most of the remaining laps with the exception of cycles of green-flag pit stops.
NASCAR scheduled a competition caution for lap 20, but an incident involving the No. 18 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota of Kyle Busch on lap 19 served as that caution. The yellow flag didn't wave again until the No. 51 Phoenix Racing Chevrolet of Kurt Busch hit the wall on lap 86.
The race restarted with Johnson in the lead and Kenseth alongside in second, but almost as soon as the green flag waved, Johnson's car got loose and Kenseth hit the wall. Johnson was able to continue, but was shuffled back to 14th in the running order.
"I'd never seen the sea part like that," Gordon said.
During the incident, Gordon was able to move into the lead, and Kahne followed to take the second spot. Rain returned during the caution, ending the race for good and giving HMS a one-two finish.
"The Hendrick Motorsports cars were really fast," Kahne said.
Brad Keselowski finished fourth in the No. 2 Penske Racing Dodge, and the No. 14 Stewart-Haas Racing Chevrolet of Tony Stewart rounded out the top-five.
The win puts Gordon into wild-card contention in the Chase for the Sprint Cup.W571 (Risperidone 3 mg)

Selfie Pe Selfie: One Year Of Acche Din With Modi
May 16, 2015
Newslaundry Hafta – Episode 15
May 14, 2015
did you tell #NAMO that he would be getting his ‘glass of water’? …… o.O
bas dosti bani rahe 😉
He knows public ‘dostana’ samband nahi banati… joote maregi… chickened out.
Seriously – he got not balls! He’s the real “bhagoda”!
All paid campaigning.
We all know who is a true “Bhagoda”. Its your Arvind Kejriwal who left Delhi because summer was coming and it would have been hard for him to give 24 hour electricity as well as 2 hours of water supply.
Mansi… That’s hilarious. … Seriously how come you managed to find that he has no balls? Kaise dekha?
That ‘dosti’ part is usually a threat used to convey implicitly the exact opposite. That is what Modi was doing in that interview. Why would anyone want an uptight Karan Thapar as a friend is beyond me.
you should look at his Kapil Sibbal’s series of interview to know what modi means
hahahahahhahah!!!!!!!!!!!!
ROFLMFAO!!!
THIS IS LITERALLY THE BEST COMMENT I’VE READ ON DISQUS SO FAR.
you made my f’in day man.as soon as i finished reading,”bas dosti bani rahe ;)”i burst out in laughter uncontrollably,& took me some 5 min to calm down.
Can’t believe how clever it is.Mad props to u.
#killedit
i was knowing it from the day when ndtv was involved
so bloody what !!!
we all know why he chickened out ……… cuz it was a live interview in front of audience, eh !
Retarded Cong+AAP NArendra Modi knew it was lvie when eh signed for it.. This 2G pimp channel @ndtv hoodlum asociation was secret he found out rightly cancelled
Yes there was confusion over it. Earlier it was believed to be free to stream for everyone but NDTV started to claim exclusive rights. It lead to the cancelation.
What has he got to be afraid of? So what if it’s NDTV or anyone? If he has nothing to hide then he should be willing to speak on any channel.
May be if one channel has exclusive rights to an interview, they can cut and manipulate the interview which ever they wish to. And other channels cannot show the right version. Barkha dutt of NDTV has done it a countless number of times. I am just speculating what do I know.
what part of the term ‘LIVE’ didn’t get to your grey cells!?
So you are saying. People would have only watched the live event. And no clipped rebroadcast of the interview would have happened and even if it did no new people would have seen it. Is that your contention? In that case I am a duh and You are the illuminated one. Man these online intellectuals don’t know what to do with them.
so u r saying that Modi should never come on a live interview?
No I am just clearing up the misunderstanding that a live interview is any better than a recorded one. With that context any leader will be compelled careful about the editing that goes on post interview. Hence an association of the interview with a clearly biased channel is understandably a cause of concern.
Is “retarded” a fancy words for modi bhakts… It is the modi followers, who made me away from BJP…
Well lots of AAp trolls hang here, Modi has attended a lot of conclaves etc for a live question answer rounds, but unlike Arvind Kejriwal who failed to govern even a small state like delhi, modi has a state to run, he also manages a Pan India National Party, He has schedules and he is a busy man.. The interviews of Ak won’t even be able to gather much audience, so Piss off apptards
Last one year .. all I see.. modi going to rally .. when Kejriwal went to dharna for 2 days, BJP said who will govern the delhi if CM sits on dharna …… Kejriwal governance was the best governance a common man can have …If you live in delhi and went to any government office at his time.. you would have known that………..without majority,either you compromise or you stand on your principles…. If 41 vote against in assembly NO ONE can run government be it MODI or Kejriwal… Remember Atalji government fall in 1998. ….. AK does not need people brought in buses and trains….if you are bjp troll then it is okay .. but if you are a person …have some sense.. if someone is trying to change the SYSTEM which we all curse….support him, yes he is not perfect but his intentions are ..he is ready to change … he is intelligent and can govern better than many CMs in India(akhilesh, hooda, chawan, raman singh and others) …. I rest my case … dont reply anything stupid again please…
‘Retard’
is the appropriate word for the likes of you
i see.. please dont jump from the roof….. Tell modi to open a mental hospitals ,.. I think many of his trolls may need that till elections are over…
Tiger don’t need to fight with pigs…… in the mud…
Yeah, so Modi is self proclaimed tiger who wouldn’t talk/debate any other Indian counterpart – so all other Indian’s are pigs?
SWAD AA GIYA,BHAI,HINDI UNDERSTOOD….?
Jo dar gaya woh mar gaya
modi is lion and lion never fears he attacks from front not from behind.modi is a phenomena all over india few bastard muslims in garb of hindus and muslim fucked hindus bastards are against him but cant do any harm as he is loved by 110 crores hindus we discard 15 crore muslims
If that was the case then BJP in Gujarat have seen number of corruption charges coming out. But on the contrary BJP ruled states are considered as well governed states in India. Dhube ji wanted to get AAP ticket since CONgress didn’t given him ticket after his services for them.
Ye 2000 cr. ka rational to bata dena dube ji..
This rajneeti vishleshak is a jackal in lion’s dress, he is similar to Aashutosh and Abhinandan of newslaundry-supporter of maoist KAAP-sorry AAP
dubeyji kejriwal k ralli me dharno me kitna kharch hogi.unko paise kahan se milti he woh to kayi saal pehle naukri chod di,na koi vyapar, na koi kheti.fir bhi gaadiyon k kafile k saath ghoomte he.un ko paise denewale sood k saath vapis nahi lenge kya.kejri ne to anil ko yoon utha k kitna fayda pahunchaya.kejri kitne sarkar k ghotalon k record tod denge kuch andaj laga sakte ho kya
ghanta lion jo sirf pahad pe khada hokar dahadta h jangal me samne bolne me phati h uski public speaking karne me public ka paisa udha raha h ….aur lambi lambi fhek raha h …..Ek chai wala chala raha h hamare desh ko jisko constitution ke baare me kuch pata tak nahi …
It’s sad that your lion is too scared to take live questions! Maybe he doesn’t want you to find out what he truly is: a chicken!
Lion doesn’t attacks it’s liones who attacks. Lions r hopeless
jo dar gaya woh BHAG gaya ..facebook
Your tiger is too dirty compared to the pigs!!! Mud seems to be cleaner than your tiger! Your chickens name must be tiger!!
Just waiting to see Modi as PM… but fear that after elections, will he also become MMS… no interviews and all …. I hope he give interview to some journalist .. he may chose his preference .. all journalists are waiting ..
This is absolutely wrong propaganda that Modi does not give interviews-he has given numerous interviews which are available online.
people like you are totally brainwashed…you are no better than a jehadi terrorist.
will love to see the fight between AK and Modi.
Just waiting to see if modi has guts to fight from varanashi.
ooh ho, why only Vanarasi, why not challenge Modi from any place he fights, you aaptards already found a way to quit the idea by stipulating varanasi when modi have’t even decided where to fight the election, if Mr. AK is who he says he is, then why such stupid stipulation, if modi does’t fight from varanasi, u aaptards will claim victory, thats all u do, we all remember the remove the police dharna where AK so proudly claimed victory when two constable were sent on a paid vacation for 2 days…lol u fake politicians
NaMo is a common Goonda, attacking murdering weak people, including pretty girls (soni etc; -app filed in court for sex VCD – to avoid if you say this is false we can provide link). he is gutless and is avoiding – in Gujarat you goons/ rowdies have fixed everything shamelessly misusing law.
NaMo is leaking in his pants ever since AK got a big reception in Gujarat at rally recently, ask him to come to Delhi / Haryana/ UP.
I would like to see fight beetween equals.. One is a 3 times CM with a proven record, and another is a Drama CM who chickened out in just 49 days.. One who is a symbol of good governance, and other who is queen of Drama.
BTW I m still waiting for that “Action against Shiela” Whatever happened to those 350 pages of Proof against her. Looks like anticorruption cruisader is not that much incorruptable after all…
Your 3 time CM Modi real proven record was Looting. Kejriwal quit as BJP colluded with Congress to continue corruption the reason they are in politics. Kejriwal came to govern correctly without corruption and that was blocked by your corrupt parties, So he will rule with majority dont worry, your paid media, surveys will not fool public. NaMo it is said was shivering and peed on seeing list of questions to be asked and that they could not be fixed with you blackmoney which you xxx LOOT.
Any proof of the things that you are babbling?? why dont u go to court, afterall u have your govt at the center.. Do u think CBI, when forced to move in certain direction will be unable to damage someone if he is not exceptionally clean?? For 12 years, Narendra Modi has been hounded left and right but still he has not been found guilty.. He has been elected thrice by people of gujarat, and that says more than enough about his capabilities and unblemished record.. these paid tv interviews are nothing but paid interviews…
Just look at the list of interviewees.. does MadhuT think that there is no congress PM candidate?? Why is he not invited?? If MadhuT think a convicted criminal can become PM of this country then that shows authenticity of these interviews..
आशुतोष श्रीवास्तव/ Ashutosh Srivastava: Babbling, Blind and a fool is you Ashutosh as your Modi was invited first by NL, but the chicken that Modi really is chickened out on seeing the list of questions to be asked by audience and NaMo knew he could not control and all his shenanigans
would be out as no blind supporters like you in majority.
When BJP is B-team of Congress to ensure they Loot India and only in public speak against each other, but vote together to keep corruption in, so what use is courts – AAP will take you out of political system and show the world how dirty your party is. SC let off Modi as he bribed the SIT chief recently with gifts and a prime Lok Sabha ticket to leave his name out, don’t worry it will be fixed as all criminals have to be punished.
……………………….
*Ashutosh Have you No shame or do you not think before you ask questions? Now you asked for proof,
pls don’t answer with fake questions about wikileaks etc; else we will have to provide you with real truth.
**BJP goondas that they are have shown their cheapness in collusion with corrupt officials & police and you confidently say go to them to complaint when you have fixed them with Dirty Bribe money?
NaMo like a Rat avoided meeting AK too as he knows his lies would be framed for world to see, apart from some blind Gujjus.
BJP fixing of surveys/ police/ election officials, media, its goondaism has shown its weakness and its scared and knows Modi will NOT become PM as BP will not get majority, but someone from a 3rdparty.
……………
Answer these questions honestly if you have the courage:
See why AAP cannot be B-team of congress as made out by your Looting brothers in Bjp.
1. Arvind Kejriwal (AK) defeated Sheila Dikshit, finished Congress in Delhi, but Bjp claims AAP is B team of Congress.
2. Kumar Vishwas is contesting against Rahul Gandhi, but AAP is B team of Congress.
3. AK called CM of Haryana a ‘Dalal, property dealer, but AAP is B team of Congress.
4. AAP Government filed FIR against Congress union ministers Moily, Murli Deora and Sheila Dikshit but BJP claims AAP is B team of congress.
5. AK said Ambani bribed Congress to increase gas prices but Bjp claims AAP is B team of Congress. (It’s a different issue that NDA govt of Vajpayee & NaMo gave gas reserves to Ambani in return for commissions in bulk then and every year since, but Bjp avoids this issue).
6. AAP formed SIT to probe Congress role in 1984 riots, but AAP is the B team of Congress !!!
7. AAP exposed the Damad of Congress Robert Vadra, but it is B team of Congress !!!
……………….
Further Facts why BJP is B-team of Congress:
1- No case against Congress by NDA regime at centre but BJP claims to be against congress.
2- No case against Gadkari by Maharashtra Congress govt though numerous proofs shown on TV for over 2 weeks, yet BJP publicly claims to be against Congress in public.
3- No case against Vadra and Ashok Gehlot by Vasundhra Raje, yet nautanki BJP is publicly against Congress.
4- No strong candidate by BJP against top leaders of Congress but BJP is against Congress.
5- Both are against RTI and transparent funding but BJP is against Congress.
6- Both are against independent CBI, independent judiciary, decriminalization of politics and strong Jan Lokpal, but BJP is against congress though they vote together.
7) No case by MODI against corrupt Gujarat Congress MLA’s which you guys scream about at election time, yet BJP is against Congress (in public posturing).
8) Bjp and Congress blame each other, point fingers in public to fool voting public, but have same agent in many dubious deals.
Bjp used Congress agent who floated Geo global for NaMo, both never speak in public about this nor point fingers at each other as both are Looting together.
……………….
Now answer these list of scams (by the way do you or someone in family also get some of the dirty money or are you plain blind?):
1)Pls tell why NaMo did not have LokAyukta for so many years – it was only to escape being caught in scams & Looting unlike his brother Yedyurappa -right.
2)Gujarat MLAs see 5000% growth in assets in just five years. ..
3)CAG report of 16.500 crore Looting in 2012, he removed oppn forcefully, did not allow discussion and got his corrupt Bjp MLA’s to debunk it.
4)again.
6)How Adani got contracts for supplying power despite being the most expensive bidder. He got bid against all norms.
7)Is it not a fact (many videos by Ndtv etc) that development of Gujarat is exaggerated with huge debts to show off. Is it not a fact that only posh areas in cities & towns get 24 hours water and 17
districts .?
8)Is NaMo not throwing crores to fix Opinion polls / Surveys in Bjp favour from the 2,500 crores he recd from Corporates blackmoney, who will later Loot India with him if he comes to power?
9)Is it not true that Ambanis/Relaince is Looting Gujarat for the huge bribes they pay NaMO & BJP and NaMo prefers only Corrupt industrialists?
10)Is it not true that NaMo claims to be a Brahmachari, when in fact against Law he many yrs ago when in RSS married a small girl ‘J.
AK left CM post in 49 days as Not like your Looting corrupt people, he came to govern (not riots, looting, fixing) and implement a better life which your BJP and its elder brother Congress did not allow as ganged up to vote for corruption – forget stupid avoiding reasons, public posturing different, private different.
Tiger and paper tiger…spot the difference….lol…Feku’s 60,000 strong Internet slaves are going all out.
Jhund me chalne walon ko aaptards kaha jata hai….
wow , bhag mochi bhag……….madhuri key peechey
mere doggy ka naam hai tiger
So Modi is a PIG, nice to know BJP chelas have recognised that.
Got schooling from Mani Shankar Aaiyar on comments, I see.
This is Abhinandan Sekri, don’t hide yourself you Maoist and Chinese agent. Modi is free style fighter; but He will set the rule. Get used to it, you Urban Naxals.
Dear Manish, what did you see in Abhinandan Sekri calling him Urban Naxals? The programme was fixed with Mr Modi in consultation with him, if Mr Modi did not turn-up, how come Mr Sekri has become Naxalite?
Don’t you think, if Mr. Modi has agreed in principle to have an interview, you can go on saying anything, set any arbitrary rules for the interview. An interviewee has all the right to set the rules, didn’t you heard that P Chidambaram did an interview with TIMESNOW, saw it before telecast (to make necessary changes, if any). Interviewee has all the rights to cancel his/her interview with anyone, he/she finds unfit in anyway. Anyway, when it was an open forum interview, why was NDTV was talk about exclusive broadcast. Modi taught them a lesson in his own way.
Till then I would wait and watch for Modi’s and Madhu Trehaan’s clarification on the issue. And I hope Madhu will apologize for her mistake.
He has done many such live interaction unlike your RG and Arvind Kujliwal.
yes, I have seen few on YouTube where he left just after 5-10 minutes without answering questions.
Even your Kokowal also ran away when he asked tough questions.
Hahahahaha again ran away from interview????? cant believe this guy..
I heard it was cancelled because organizer refused to give pre-determined questions to modi…
God save India from these loosers…
ya, and they gave it to Kejri dalal, u know business intrest.
Yeah Dalal like Nitin Gadkari & Yedurappa
God is saving India, just keep watching. Namo Namo
bro get a life!!..you are brainwashed.
Your right. Are you aware Mod; ..No way you Modi will become PM, find a place to hide in Gujarat before you lose that too.
Ever thought why Kejriwal would give his interviews to only Rajdeep and Barka Dutt? And why they dont grill him?
because of bunch of dumbos like you this country is in current state, but you guys will never acknowledge
AK has also given direct interview to aajtak, timesnow, news24 etc.
If you want I can post youtube link.
modi has given lot of intervies earlier.in each every body tried to grill him about guj riot but failed
You are a joker & truly AAPtard!! You seems too dejected. Dont worry he will give exclusive interview to Arnab Goswami soon
AAP running out of funds.. with their Abhinandan Shekhr stooge sitting in NL … so thot of generating thru NaMo popularity… NaMo stung them badly. I am glad he opted out.
we Indian will not let AAP go out of fund. I will stop watching movies and will donate the saved amount.
Don’t claim we Indians,we indians don;t want a pro communist leader. those youngsters and ideologue who support AK haven’t seen the India pre 1991. there were no jobs, no electricity, no nothing, AK will bring those times back, and we Indians don’t want to go back 30 yrs by bring a leftist leader who want;s to bring chaos in this country
Feed the hungry with the money. Not those who are hungry to suck the blood of our country (AAP)
traitors anti national anti social who conspired to hijack our democracy are chickened out after modi declared as pm.he will cleanse india from all these parasites leeches
As if Modi has not appeared at any live event before. He has done plenty of them, in front of an audience, and in one particular event Madhu Trehan even asked him a question. Which was usual stuff that do Muslims have a place in his vision and blah blah.
This was going to be no different. Madhu, I am sure would have gone on and on about secularism. It is good that he cancelled.
Ha Ha, or that he knows Newslaundry is run by an Aam Aadmi Chamcha.
NamoChickenedOOt, we all know u r a paid agent of AAP so STFU
If he is scared of live interview ..why is he coming with chai pe charcha – part 2..the lion of india
Dude have seen India today conclave or Hindustan times event (were he rip a part Rajdeep) ? its on you tube, it was live and jurnos for all media channels where there even Madhu was there just see that how he answer each one then only you will know why people call him lion.
NDTV, and to a certain extent CNN IBN are the only two legitimate and non biased channels. If that’s your problem, to hell with it – you can go watch your Congress/BJP owned paid channels (Zee Tv, India News, ABP etc.)
Modi just doesn’t have the balls to face the questions live. “Bhaiyon aur behenon” “Bhaiyon aur behenon” karna aata hai use bas bhashanon mein. Loser!
NDTV and CNN-IBN -> Legitimate and non-biased??? Has the sun risen in the west? Kya likha hai yede?
Bhai yehi do channel hai jisse AAP pay karti he…isliye AAPtards k liye these two are unbiased. JAGOO GRAHAK JAGOO…
Nahhhhhhhhiiiiiiii!
Jato aaptards jago!
And what about aajtak??
TIMESNOW best news channel.
So, can we expect a direct interview of modi at TimesNow
lol ndtv and cnnibn most pro conggi anti hindu and anti modi biased channels lol . we all know burkha dutt. also sargrika and her husband who abused modi and called him dog.
NDTV and CNN IBN are not biased? Go through the past 1 and a half decade of their reporting. List all major scams that came out in the UPA. List down the ones exposed by these two channels that were against the UPA. Then tell me this.
“Bhaiyon aur Behno” ke jagah pe “Dallo aur Randiyo” pasand karoge kya ???
NDTV & CNN-IBN non biased? What are you smoking? Its like saying Laloo & Kalmadi are the cleanest politicians in India. LoL
Karan bhai need puri nahi ho gayi lag ta hai ” NDTV, and to a certain extent CNN IBN are the only two legitimate and non biased channels.” Jokes of the day
Chillout guys it is just a satire on Congress News Network(CNN) and Nehru Dynasty TV(NDTV).
Kejriwal and doesn’t have balls to face Arnab Goswami. AAPterds will go there loyal dogs like CNN IBN and NDTV agents of Nira Radia
This is called misinformation Aurnab has done lot of one to one live interviews with Arvind Kejriwal. Instead the only politician who had the spunk in his balls to come out victorious in a Arnab non stop nonsense noise. AAP has taken a principled stand of not going to Times Now when it carried motivated misinformation campaign against AAP . But let me ask how much live debate did Narendra Modi take part with Aurnab ? Zero means he has no spunk left to handle Aurnab.
If you have time then please google Modi’s interview with Arnab you will get your answer. In the end are you anyway related to Kapil Sibal since you use his famous Zero in your comment. 😉 😛
If an AapHole will run away its a principle decision, Ha Ha Ha, you too r AapHole
Hahaha…LOL ||
NDTV AND CNN IBN non biased
I HEARD THERE ARE A FEW GUYS WHOSE BRAINS ARE LIKE BATS THINK UPSIDE DOWN. I HAVE FOUND ONE. NDTV AND CNN IBN LEGITIMATE CHANNELS? THAT IS LIKE SAYING THE CHILD BORN TO UNKNOWN FATHER OF A PROSTITUTE IS THE MOST LEGITIMATE BY BIRTH. GO GET A BRAIN SURGERY DONE TO TURN YOUR THINKING RIGHT. I AM SURE YOU MUST BE A CAUSE OF GREAT CONCERN TO YOUR PARENTS.
Even Madhu ji who is the owner of Newlaundry have shown again again that they are indeed prestitute.
Yes she too is unveiled.
Press tittle now indent infield.
This is the biggest joke of the century…. NDTV is known to have been the worst TV news channel, and its not just because of hatred against Modi spewed by them over the last decade or so… Forgot Radia tapes?
C H U T I A samjha kya AapHole ?
Heared Kejri dalal run away from TimesNow channel ?
Chal chood naa AapHole, rulayega kya ???
BHai CNN IBN to ambani ka channel hai, to woh unbiased kaise ho gye, Modi aur Ambani to bhai bhai hai Ak ke hisab se,,,,,
crores of modi supporters wishes have been taken into consideration by modi ji . 😀
Wish he do some interviews also … be with any journalist …. want to see his views…. election rallies does not really gives an overall ideas…. There, all politicians can only speak rhetoric statements….
want to see few direct interview. Rally will not influence middle class people.
Only rallies, detailing his plans shall influence the middle class. Definitely not contrived debates by anti nationals. Once again thanks to Mr. Modi for listening to the wishes of Crores of his supporters, especially from the middle classes, who have seen through the propagandas of the Madhu Trehan’s et al (C/o NDTV).
Well, he doesn’t say anything as “we’ll do……” except we’ll remove congress, make India progressive.
He only says what we can if we do this and that. One can say he has got a vision but details of the mission are still missing.
to avoid being asked truthful questions and as BJP/NaMo could not bribe interviewer with gifts/ blackmoney.
ROFL…..
Lalu ji a PM contender…ha ha ha Double ROFL
Akhilesh…ROFL
This is a very very Good Decision by Modi to withdraw….
M O D I – a future PM – yup! feared his bones will be sucked out. Had a good opportunity to face tough questions and present himself. Lost it. Good luck Kejriwal… you’ll face tough questions, but everyone knows you don’t mince words and speak your mind… look forward.
This is what happens when you involve corrupt media organizations like NDTV with Narendra Modi. There will be no compromises with corrupt media running with political laundered blood money.
Ha ha ha….. involving corrupt media, to BJP & modi kaunse dhud ke dhule hue he. Yadurapa ko modiji rallyo me apne bagal me bithate he aur 2 din phele hi bjp ne paswan ko apne dal me samil kiya he. Sachai ye he ki modiji ki guts nehi he public ko samna karne ki
Courts trashed the cases against Yedurappa. What about your Porn website host Somnath Bharti. Please remember your Messiah Bharti ji every time while surfing internet or checking your e-mail you see a spam since he is among the top spammers.
#yo.NAMO.you.SUCK.big.TIME
Chickened out again? LOL. Sachhai, kadwa, and all
I only see minnows in the list. No Sonia, no Rahul. I am not surprised Modi cancelled. Why waste time with those who aren’t contenders?
Are chor bhai kya time waste? Kahan chori karni hai?
Sab paisa Govt kha jaati hai bhai. Chori karne kuch nahi bacha.
It Means he is no different then RG/Sonia/Congress.
A Democratic Party US Presidential Candidate debates with his counterpart from the Republican Party in the US. Does that mean they are no different from each other?
The reason behind cancellation is that you r promoting it as talk with PM candidate…How the hell lalu can be PM candidate when he cant even fight for MP..
AapHole ?
The reason behind cancellation is that you r promoting it as talk with PM candidate…How the hell lalu can be PM candidate when he cant even fight for MP…
Exactly. If NL wants to keep saying AK is a PM contender, it is NL’s trickery. Good decision by Modi. Me, I can’t contain my joy!
So you consider “Rahul and Sonia” as strong contenders eh? Really? You need balls to face tough questions in a live interview – the way Kejriwal does. Modi has been chickening out since forever, and mind you -it’s no waste of time. We need to know his answers to tough questions the way we put so many to Kejriwal – let the nation know if he actually has some answers or will it all be paid campaigning?
Arvind Kejriwal rarely gets the tough questions. And he responds with rhetoric. The 48 day government proved what he can (not) do. Modi is specifically targeted with 2002 everywhere. You can see the enormous difference in the line of questioning for Modi and anyone else. There is only one chap who has managed balance. That chap is Arnab Goswami. A interview with him will be far more credible than one where NDTV is involved. This itself shows how low NDTV has fallen in terms of credibility thanks to the murky deals it is associated with, the Radia tapes, the openly pro-Congress bias it shows… Congress ke taraf se defend kar dena!
Ruhi ji please tell me what his view on Pakistan, China or India’s foreign policy. Whats his answer on terrorism. Whats his vision for youth of India who need jobs considering 70% of Indian population are under 35 years. Please enlighten us by telling us his economic vision. These are called tough questions. Just by repeating same rhetoric of , Mere Koi Aukat Nahi Hai, Ambani won’t help.
MODI POLICY EVERY BODY KNOWS IN INDIA AND NOW ABROAD TOO , I.E. FEKU LEFT RIGHT AND CENTER. BJP IS ALL GASSSED OUT BY TOXIC MODI GAS.
Come someday to Gujarat and see the Vadodara’s bus stand, it even better then your cities airport. Please don’t tell me you don’t have an airport in your city. Let me tell you when someone has gas problem. 1. When they don’t eat 2. When someone just sit whole day rather then doing any physical activity. Rahul Baba have the worst parliament attendance in UPA-2 government which clearly he has lots of Gas. I am not considering reason for him since he and his mom made lot of money on all the scam under UPA’s rule. Whereas Arvind babu sat on Dharna against his own government. Then we all know about his failed fast after which he has to form AAP party. So Kejriwal has more gas then any other politician. Thats the reason behind his Khu Khu, he use it as cover fire to relive his gas. No wonder he is talking about Reliance Gas issue. 😛 😉
Kejri can do drama of Live interview on congi dalal channel Ndtv and IBN.
english mein interview karwaoge toh yahi hoga na !
hindi mein leni thi na uski ……. KEH KE :/

If NDTV is so currupt and paid then why the hell BJP sends its spokespersons in ndtv debates ??
becoz irrespective of one’s liking or not, its a democracy and every1 has a free will.As a responsible party BJP has to send its spokesperson to put forward its view.
You know its not like irresponsible and idiotic AAP when they decided to boycott when tough questions were asked to them.
The reason behind cancellation is that you r promoting it as talk with PM candidate…How the hell lalu can be PM candidate when he cant even fight for MP.
lol serves good to NL surrogate intvw for NDTV.. Infact Modi got enormous messages from his fans to cancel this event as this was to place him along with small time politicians..
^^ never seen such a lame excuse to avoid tough questions
well dont say never.Same excuse was given by AAP when they boycotted major channels.
Atleast here the biased of NDTV towards Namo is well known.
Acha ye batao aaj tak modiji ne kitne public debates me participate kiya he…answer he ek bhi nehi. Aur yehi sachai he
The reason behind cancellation is that you r promoting it as talk with PM candidate…How the hell lalu can be PM candidate when he cant even fight for MP
Please find your answer by using Bing or Google. Don’t presume before doing your research my friend.
Dear, I tried on google.. Latest one-on-one interview link of Modi of more than 10 mins I could see was of 2011. Could you please share some links? I generally use Google. Don’t have much liking for Bing. Also, I could find Arvind Kejriwal’s interview on almost all the news channels of around 40-70 mins & obviously latest..
I also don’t like bing. Please search Modi’s interview with Reuters. And also during Gujarat election his interview with Rajdeep.
for us modi supporters its a happy day. modi got thousands of messages to cancel this event cause ndtv and lalu were involved
When your loser Kejriwal can form government with CONgress on AAP supporters fake survey why can’t Modi can cancel his interview on request of his fan on twitter and Facebook.
I was one of them. one, others in the list were no ones, AK being closest. two, ndtv was involved 6 months on any live 40-50 mins one-on-one interview…Neither heard of any?? Ain’t that questionable?
Good Modi dumped NDTV, Paid media. And standing in queue with these Jokers and criminals,doesnot suit his image. He is a Mass leader. NL should have taken in interview alone or with other neutral media channels like HT,not with NDTV
NDTV impact! It would have been terrific hit if you could have kept NDTV out of this.
Tell Subramanian Swami to keep away from NDTV studios too..
many rumours are that modi has cancled their program bcoz of NDTV.. is it true or is there are some conflcts with modi which is the cause of cancelation of programme?
read this,
Good now we can have a descent debate without a PR agency advised corporate sell-out. Arvind is good at taking live questions without refining and filtering and answers in Hindi right from the heart. Looking forward to this event with great hopes
I don’t think you are talking about the same Kejriwal who reiterates the same thing, “mera kya jata hain, yeh janta ki ladai bain”, “main janta ke pass jaunga” endlessly.
Why not, after all who has he got ? no one, not even a corporate hand like few PM’s-in-waiting have Adani’s and Ambani’s. Arvind is entirely dependent on “Janta”. And we must not forget the day people retract support from Arvind’s movement, there won’t be any “Arvind” or “Kejriwal”.
Everyone knows, AK is propped-up by Ford Foundation and he receives donations from all Corporates including Reliance.
I won’t buy that argument because the media and cong, bjp would’ve went gaga if there was even a slightest evidence of Arvind taking money from Reliance. I mean its very low on mind to think that Reliance has paid Arvind to defame Reliance. That’s like applying petrol on hands and then touching a flame.
Arvind is only good at accusing and bringing up Ambani as the answer to every question. I’m tired of hearing him scream ‘Ambani corruption communalism!’ in every speech and interview.
I understand, but I’m happy that Arvind Kejriwal is the first politician to even spell the name “Ambani” openly. And I hope we realize that if he talks “bullshit” about Ambani, Ambani and RIL can sue him for his entire LIFE.
RIL is already suing him. Kejriwal blames Ambani for everything but has yet to produce even ounce of proof. He never goes to court over his allegations because he knows he will be proven wrong and embarassed and his reputation will take a hit.
For example see that the judicial probe in Delhi Khikri case has indicted Somnath Bharti and given clean chit to the police. Thus AAP’s image has taken a beating. Even if they scream that judiciary is also Ambani’s pet no one will believe them. This self-riteous attitude that everyone who is not with you is a crook will only anger people.
Even Gadkari is suing him in that subtle way, I’m talking about a real suit filed in court which is taken seriously and followed up thoroughly which both Gadkari and RIL won’t do. Because they don’t want to play with the flame having their other hand burnt. And about the Bharti case, every sensible person knows that Bharti was right and was within his limit.
every sensible AAP person knows that Bharti was right and was within his limit.
Ambani will be playing in hands of Kejriwal if he puts a defamation case. AAP wants people to sue them to garner more publicity out of the case and show AK as a messiah of anti corruption. I am sure Ambani will go to court after the elections.
You are wrong my friend Subramanium Swamy already raised the Reliance gas issue much before your Kujliwal. Giving some numbers without naming the bank is not a proof. I can say that 12345678 is Kujliwal’s swiss bank account
Arvind ko kyun badnaam kar rahe ho? Wo to “Bahut chota aadmi hai” cough, cough “Aam Aadmi jab khud uth khada hoga to singhason apnay AAP dolnay lagengay” cough, cough
Wah yaar, mujhe laga ki Modi wave hai par Arvind jyada lokpriya hai, kamaal ke follower hai aap Arvind ke
Mein hoon kaun? Kya aukat hai meri? Aam aadmi, daba kuchla hua hu mein. Kya aukat hai?
Arre deewano, mujhe pehchano, main hoon kaun, main hoon PAWN!!!
GREAT!!!!!!! Two minutes silence for NDTV. However, I do wish Modi chooses a more neutral TV channel to give an interview. Will be awesome.
My sources tell me, there is going to be an interview with Modi in TV. Just sit back and relax.
GOD SAVE THE INTERVIEWER FROM THE MODI TOXIC FEKU GAS.
..still better than the Fekriwal repetitive shit. I can play a record instead of him.
Something like Aap Ki Adalat.
Here newslaundry’s connection with NDTV, made modi is cancel this program. Upset with newslaundry joining hands with anti india media channels… Modi had done a right job!!!!
Modi is absolutely right in not patronizing media outlets that are known to be corrupt.
Very well done Mr. Modi. NDTV is a biased media house run by Congress. Any association with them should be bulldozed.
And good to see the comment section open to public after the initial blackout by NL. Time they learn to accept criticism also.
By that logic, no congressi should agree to be interviewed by Pioneer or Niticentral..
Your assumption is incorrect. NDTV has been personally hounding Mr. Modi with fabricated lies. You can judge the way they report even a neutral news to cash on Modi’s chrisma. Had it been just newslaundry, I would hv never appreciated the cancellation. Niticental is openly known for nationalistic and right wing ideology and they never spread lies. Pioneer, I dont think showers praises for him.
Okay, so why does Subramanian Swami not boycott NDTV too? If he has no problems with the channel why are moditards getting so upset?
I am only talking about Modi. Only he shouldnt associate himself with NDTV. As for Mr. Swamy, he is not victim of smear campaign. BJP spokesperson r welcome to appear in NDTV’s debates.
Haha..Modi associates with all sorts of crooks. He invited Subrato Roy during swearing ceremony last year. I’m no fan of NDTV, but the channel is no worse than IBN or TimesNow.. Sagarika Ghose and Arnab were as badly involved in smear campaign against Modi as Barkha Dutt. It was TOI group which only recently lied about Modi and gave him ‘Rambo’ nickname. At least, NDTV has Ravish Kumar..the other channels don’t have anyone of that calibre..
Modi backed out because when this event was announced, NDTV wasnt anywhere in picture. Its personal choice to accept the invitation. But all the participating parties should be declared. Its not about sharing stage..its about personal attacks by NDTV presstitues and he has all the freedom to choose his stage.
Moditards have misunderstood the deal. Its a web event by Madhu and NDTV has broadcasting rights So basically NDTV will only be broadcasting the webfeed on its channel which is similar to broadcasting his speeches which it regularly does. NDTV is not a participating party and NL is only trying to generate some revenue by selling the feed to NDTV. I regularly watch all news channels, and believe me, Barkha Dutt has been very gentle compared to Arbab or Sagarika as far as smear campaign against Modi is concerned. Only Nidhi Razdan has been guilty of Modi hate, but she doesn’t own the channel.
there is something called public sentiments. i was so angry to hear modi was giving interview to ndtv. also being called in same leage as lalu . its cause of lakhs of supporters feelings. thats why modi cancelled it.
I agree, but who is in the same league as Modi? No one.. Rahul is a dumb kid, all other parties are regional parties, AAP’s base has not progressed beyond Delhi. So who do you think deserves to have a debate along with him?
and they have included lalu as a pm candidate he can’t even get into parliament. lol he is barred from it lol how in the hell can he become pm even if get gets 500 seats lol
You are wrong. The flyer only says ‘Candidate 2014′, not PM candidates. Its obvious that they have invited only heads of political parties. Since Lalu is boss of his party, he fits in even though he may not deserve to be in.
lol they are promoting it as pm candidates from so many days. lol saw their tweet saying one of pm candidates modi have cancelled lol
Yes you used the right word “Deal”, thats the issue. SM is free for all. In this case NDTV was exclusive partner and has been selling d same fact to cash on him. Where as in other cases feed is available to all channels and not particular to one.
Media partnership should hv been declared before roping him.
IMO equating Modi to convict Lalu, who isnt a regional player, is not at all called for.
Anyways thanks…was good debating.
Newslaundry partnered exclusively with dalal media and expected Modi to attend…choo chweet. Hahaha…Sab ki Dhulai karne wale ki dhulai ho gayi.
Arvind is one where we have hopes. Other all parties hopeless
if liar pathological liar is your help, then god bless India
Plea respect Arvind and call him Lier Kejri. there is nothing on which he has taken a you turn.He has no locus standi on any issue
I abhor most of his views regarding issues of national importance. The whole political ideology cant be based on mere one point.
Good that he canceled. Look at your list of Candidates. Liar AK, Comrade Mamata, ‘Secular’ Akhilesh, Criminal Lalu. You expect him to participate given the line up you have?
communal mass-murderer Modi…yes that fits perfectly…better than the ones you mentioned
Under Arvind Kejriwal’s rule hundreds of people died because of cold in Delhi. He promised them cold shelters for people living on street, what about that also my friend? I am not gonna post about CONgress murder list because it will touch lakhs.
Why does Modi give NDTV revenue by advertising on their channel then? Bhagwa chaddies need to come with better excuses.
such a shame
Good decision… Lame on the part of Newslaundry to involve NDTV….
Now without NaMo the viewership would be reduced to one fifth. Expected better background research from NL on NDTV’s perception by Modi.. Btw how in the heaven in Kejriwal a contender for PM.. to add salt to the injury Lalu and Akaless are being compared to Modi… too much to ignore. Without Raul baba there cannot be an even competition.. I do’t expect Modi to lower his level to that of the drama queen aka Kejriwal
First you don’t have the guts to call Sonia or Rahul, then You pit a PM candidate VS a rabble-rouser, Dharna Freak / a convict / 2 non-performers and then crib why Modi ditched at the last moment, you learnt the ropes from NDTV to humiliate Modi rather soon…
common yaar….. thik hai maan lo ek baar ke liye ki the remaining attendants for the event are very bad…. they don’t deserve to be called at this event… but this is a platform where he could have projected himself in a better way in front of the people of the country…. no matter how inappropriate the other speakers are.. no matter if the chanel is biased or not… if you have guts and will to answer tough questions on a public platform, come forward and answer them….. all this talk mans that when modi wud become PM of our country will he ban these so callled biased channels.. you are a godd speaker… so plzz come forward and answer some tough questions publicly.. dont give excuses
LOL… Happy this has happened….. go sulk newslaundry
if modi keeps on ditching interviews he will remain a PM-in-waiting !!!
not surprised …….. he cant handle tough questions in front of live audience. so he quits !!!
Modi only speaks to the Ambanis while selling chai to them..hopeless fellow. Can’t take straight questions!
During chai pe charcha he was speaking to everybody except Ambanis. Nice try.
All drama to make emotional fools out of public. Still feel uncomfortable answering 2002 riot questions. You can see his discomfort. Quotes AB Vajpayee often but fails to quote that Vajpayee said- Rajdhrma was not obeyed!!” Just playing the nationalism card..while hobnobbing with Ambanis and Adanis
Supreme Court;s SIT has given clean chit to #NAMo. But some fools like you cannot see that. Ppl like you justify the title #Aaptards.
Within next 24 hours, even Mamata and Lalu will back out. Mark this comment!
Do any of you moditards dare to tell Subramanian Swami to not be a guest on NDTV shows?
Why wait till 10th to share reasons for cancellation?
thank god. modi is already on tv 24/7. this would have just created
controvercies on each and every word he speaks. kutte ka baccha, burka,
blaw blaw. i dont think indian elections has anything to do with issues
Hahaha… so NL is now crying like a baby when the fault lies with them.You partnered with NDTV and as MC says as “Surrogates” and expect NaMo to dance on your tunes.
AAP-Congies now have their pant twisted. Kejriwal openly say media is bikau, accepts invite from MSM sponsor, the Cong of Media i.e. NDTV! “newslaundry” alone would have been best.
As usual NaMo Does it Again!!! Cancels Facebook Talk Show!!! may be he
thought this better than running away from the Live show!!!
Abe LKB, better than ur U-TURN BABA #BachchonKiKasam #AAPTards #LiarKejriwal
Modi in a sensible interactive session, I thought it was too good to be true. I guess I was right. genocide sponsoring, ambani ass kissing coward.
Kudos to Modiji for cancelling this event.
The Line-up of candidates looks like a line-up in Tihar Jail with Corrupts & Naxals. Why join such a Farce.
The guy from Ford Foundation, a Corrupt Convict fresh out of Jail, a guy who sat & watched 100s of cold-blooded riots in UP all lined-up. It was a good decision by Modiji to have cancelled this.
If NDTV was involved from start NaMo would never have given it. Why should he promote channel which is involved day night in conspiracy against him. Good decision. Now no interest in these wild dreamers and pathetic leaders who has ruined their respective states.
Ha ha. So the NDTV surrogates and Tejpal protectors got a tight slap from Modi.
Was looking forward to Modi being interviewed… but well nevermind.
That said it’d have been great if Lalu could’ve been replaced with Nitish Kumar. Also, I, personally, would have liked to see Jayalalitha. Criticize all you will about the Tamil sentiment stuff that erupts up in the run up to a resolution against SL in the UN or on the issue of Rajiv Gandhi’s assassinators, she herself *has* a development agenda in Tamil Nadu as well, even if not as extensive as Modi.
Modi has never been known for bravery or honesty. He can talk behind multi shields of Z-Category security, can never face JLPB or RTI, dare not answer about IPL fixing, Yashodaben, stalking!
In fact this is the nature of RSS, mother of Jan Sangh and BJP, never participated in 1942 or 1947 revolution and joined in recruitments for British instead of helping Subhash Chandra Bose! In fact Govalkar criticised Bhagat Singh and others for having laid their lives for the country!!
Nothing can be expected by those whose history if full of treachery and helping terrorists in VVIP style, where their minister escorts them and they make money on soldiers taboot!
In fact Modi claims traders to be taking more risk than soldiers and this Baniya has never paid homage to martyrs as he has no knowledge if martyr’s memorial exists in India!
Lastly BJP is duplicate of Congress as certified by Shatrughan Sinha and Arun Shourie!
Dont rant like AAP-Zombies.
Do you know AAP is propped up by Ford-Foundation and gets donations from all corporates including Reliance?
Do you know Sonia Gandhi personally sent a letter asking for AK’s cancellation of Transfer out of Delhi?
Yes I am aware, Modi begs donations from Pakistanis, joins hands with terrorists, corrupts, criminals like Vaiko, Hafeez, Paswan, Yeddi, works for Ambani for commission, threw out Yashodaben, followed another woman and hands in gloves with Vadra, dare not criticise him!
thank you modi ji you listened to your supporters. no association of any kind with anti national ndtv. 😀
BHAGODA
BHAGODA
Kejru? 😛
i wrote on facebook and emailed so many times to cancel an event with ndtv and which has people like modi. jai modi . 😀 respect increased . he listens to us 😀
Would have hated to see modi’s name with lalu and co. 😀
Tu aur aaja.. yahan comment kr ke bna sbko chu.. Paid Social Media comment.. teri hi sunta Modi to meri bhi sunta Modi.. Kitne sawaal kiye wo to btae ni..faekne k liye aajata h jgh jgh
abe jehadi troll . jehadio ki koi nahi sunega. he listens to people of india. we all were against him giving interview to somebody who is associated with ndtv and be in same leage as lalu and akhislesh. modi got thousands of messages about it. 😀 now you can burn lol
Keju ne kitne answer diye hai bhai Pata hai
Rajiv ji he reads his Facebook page as well as twitter response. In his speech in one of the college he spoke about the things students asked him to speak through Facebook. This is called a true leader who speak about the things people what him to speak.
The level of the event is evident when NL says that Lalu Prasad Yadav who is a scam convict and cannot even contest the election is a PM candidate. Glad Modi opted out, he listened to his followers. Though he shouldn’t have opted to appear in the first place. NL is just crying foul coz their tactic of getting a Modi interview for NDTV failed. Possibly not much rokda to come in now 😛
Ndtv tried to be intelligent . tried to use newslaundry to get modi interview they were craving for lol . slap on face of ndtv. . congrats all modi supporters we did it 😀 Jai hind
Lol! Serves you right. One thing is certain, Modi listens.
listens to his supporters for sure. 😀 my respect for him increased . 😀
Awesome decision! Paid Media who has been campaigning against Modi and its party members has been taught a good lesson.
I have seen many interviews where Jaitely, Amit Shah, Parikkar’s time has been wasted by anchors and their prepped audiences by asking questions only on 2002 & snoop gate. No body want to talk about development and future vision
Lol on same day modi kicks ndtv he gives interview to dainik jagran. the largest newspaper by daily circulation in india 😀 superb
modi did right. why should he be with akhilesh/laloo/ kejri etc. those who will get 10 seats nationaly against Modi who will get 200+. also ndtv is the congress party funded/mouthpiece biased minority channel. modi should not associate with them
A true nationalist will never share dias with these anti-nationals
Good Decision by Mr. Modi clubbing him with Lalu & Kejri & then broadcasting it live on a channel that has hounded him
big blow to burkha and co. lol
Newslaundry, atleast now pay attention to mood of the majority of the people. Shed your arrogance. You need to send the right message and get back that trust people had in you (Although trust can never be the same again).
how is lalu a pm candidate when he can’t even fight any election lol how ????? lol
lalu can’t even enter parliament. and these crooks are promoting him as a pm candidate. lol along with people who can’t even get 10 seats on their own . lol
Good that Modi cancelled it. Don’t want cronies like NDTV and News Laundry.
MADHUJI
, YOU MADE MISTAKE TO INVOLVE THE MOST DIRTIEST CHANNEL( MAY BE PAID)
OF INDIAN SUBCONTINENT “””NDTV”””.MODIJI WILL NEVER FORGIVE WHAT “””
NDTV””” AND THEIR INFAMOUS BURKHA DUTT, NIDHI RAZDAN, VISHNU SOM,
SREENIVAS JAIN ETC DONE TO HIM WHEN EVER ANY ELECTION TAKES PLACE THESE
DIRTY JOURNALISTS COMES WITH PROGRAMS TO PUT SALT ON THE WOUNDS OF
MUSLIMS AND NOT ALLOW TO HEAL TO GATHER THE VOTES FOR CONGRESS PARTY.
HE WOULD HAVE COME TO YOU FOR YOUR WEBSITE MAGAZINE. BUT NEVER TO
DIRTY”””””” NDTV”””.
Thanks Modiji for respecting our sentiment there should be no association with a channel like @ndtv a 2G thug and abusive channel.
bechara paid ndtv….modi ignores that cong agent yet again.
News Laundry should do a show with all convicetd criminals Laloo yadav Pappu Yadav RashiD ALvi these r prospective PM. Jokers of NEws lanudry tried to eb smart by secretly adding Narendra Modi’s name.. And what freaking story Narendr aModi found out u had asociation with 2G pimp channel @ndtv he cancelled it like is expected from him
Heartfelt Thanks to Shri Narendra Modi ji for acceding to a genuine (more importantly valid) request of Crores of his supporters.
It hurts…but it serves you right. It was unethical to try hiding ur media partner & sponsor details. I am sure the sham report u all would come up with(obviously vengeful)….a vicious & cheap-jack write-up, the one similar to u published to rescue debauchee Tejpal.
RG, Sonia and Modi refused interview…..lots of things are common among them.
Lol!! It is Modi’s freedom of choice isn’t it?? It is HIS willingness that counts.. now please stop crying fellas
its gud that modiji opted out of the programme. NDTV is the most corrupt media house. and nautanki raja kejri and lalu taking part in the programme itself is a mockery.
Why he is running away .. Bhagoda Mod!
Sidhi Si baat he modi ki Himat nehi he public ko face karneki
NaMo cancels News Laundry interview in last moment. Only Arvind Kejriwal can take any questions from media
Namo has taken a wise decision.
What a total screw-up by Newslaundry. Involving NDTV??? Enjoy your conversations with the Laloos and the Paltiwals Great title as well “Candidates 2014″. Frankly the only reason to come to this site these days is for the genius – Anand Ranganathan.
As much as I enjoy RJD Leader’s wit & entertaining conversation style, how does NL brand its show with him as candidates 2014? UP CM a candidate too? Please reflect if this amounts to NL being deliberate in its mis/mal-communication or NL being prescient unlike LS Speaker, Judiciary, etc? Please set right the title & context. Especially NL that nit-picks journalists & journalism that is ‘by & large’ much appreciated! Credibility counts.
Also, Madhuji, totally unfair to club NaMo with Arvind, Mamta, Akhilesh and Lalu. Was NaMo informed about this?
The real truth is here . Modi is was informed abt exclusive broadcast rights provided to NDTV. I myself was against this. I have seen so many twitter supporters of Modi requesting him to boycott this event since NDTV had maligned him for years. He isnt against free media as he demonstrated today by giving interview to Jagran News.
Chicken
Why the details will be shared on 10 March? Share it now. Madhu, you will loose my “following” with this.
The way Newslaundry has reacted its quite clear that details may or may not be correct. There might be a temptation to get back to Modi by cooking up a story for not showing up.
It was obvious that he will cancel since you joined hands with NDTV. There is some role played by the Niticentral in it because earlier it was believed to be open session which could have been broadcast by anyone. This was the line taken by the Niticentral but as soon as it was clear that only NDTV has the rights to telecast it, everyone knew that Modi will cancel it.
When every single online supporter of yours is tweeting to you asking not to appear on NDTV event. It was simply not possible for him to ignore them.
Lallu can’t contest elections for next 11y and how can be a candidate? Are you fooling Junta? newslaundry has become another NDTV and CNN IBN
You invite Modi to interview where convict Lalu yadav who can’t stand in elections is a candidate of what ?? Are you guys gone crazy ?? or shall i say just pressitues ??
Aaj tak nehi hua ki modiji ne koi bhi public debate me participate kia ho, sachai ye he ki public ke samne bhasan dena aur public ke question ko face karne me bahut antar he. Aur modiji dargaye he. PM ke liye ye aadmi fit nehi he….
I am surprised that you are surprised at this. Didn’t we all anticipate this knowing that he has consistently avoided `free’ press & extempore questioning? WOuld have been nice had he fielded some good & great questions, unscripted ones, of course.
Modi screwed like you at the last moment is royal. Save your lies of AK’ calling chor chor from the rooftop for the AAPtards .
Guys at NewsLaundry facepalm for you guys. The real truth is here… . Modi wasnt informed abt exclusive broadcast rights provided to NDTV. I have seen so many twitter supporters of Modi requesting him to boycott this event since NDTV had maligned him for years. He isn’t against free media as he demonstrated today by giving interview to Jagran News.
one thing.. I don’t know about this particular news nut niticentral is full lies ,a mouth piece of BJP
Feku rats out,again???
YAY !!!!!!!!!!!
no more 10hr speeches…..:-D
#ORIGINALBHAGODA IS BACK!!
very disappointed!
how can a youth trust such person who doesn’t even dare to answer our question.
Even the NL comment sectionneeds namo to get comments!!! Ha ha ha programmed aaptards r pathetic
So He Ran Awat, Yet Again!!! As more & more days pass by, it is becoming obvious that NaMo is just a Scared Little Cat.
Does Narendra Modi wants to be PM for whole Nation called India or want’s only to be PM for his cheer leaders ? This is called chickening out. I support Arvind Kejriwal because what ever may be the hostile environment he honors commitment, never design questions which he want’s to be asked , never duck’s questions how ever uncomfortable it may be, always ready to explain his position , accepts if any mistakes from his end, speaks with clear information & if does not know it tell he has no idea & will come back on it as he gets info. Main aspect is he never chickens out. That’s why Arvind Kejriwal is my PM candidate for India since he is ready to be accountable for his actions. Where as Narendra Modi runs away from accepting accountability .
Yeah except Modi running govt for last 13 Years that too is quiet successfully than other CMs of India. And No AK don’t chicken out from interview he actually thrives on them, he chickened out Delhi Govt. but that hardly matters. Main thing is that you should not chicken out from iterviews. Search “Arvind Kejriwal interview on News X” on youtube and you will know what I am talking about.
he’s better off selling tea if he cant take direct questions…modi is no better than rahul i guess..
Narendra Modi has really caught on with the national mood by shunning these congress stooges subsisting on crumbs thrown by it. I, on behalf of majority of Indians, salute you for acceding to our request of shunning such parasites.
It is newslaundry which has stooped to lick the feet of the world’s most corrupt media and politicians and you expect Modi to get tainted in keeping the filty company? Newslaundry bhik saktha hai but not Modi.
I admire Madhu Tehran a lot even when she is critical to Narendra Modi but I wrote her email about giving same platform to Lalu and Modi is not right. Newslaundry did the unethical thing by not disclosing that NDTV was the media partner of the event.
Why Modi runaway from this show? Reason in one line: Angrezi nahi aati usko. Ha ha ha. Bhag gaya dar ke isliye. Man of low caliber, zilch knowledge, pathetic coward, shame on him and besharm sycophants.
Really…..Wat abt ur grand parents….They were also pathetic cowards who new no english……..
Unfortunate it happened, Mrs Trehand and modi would have been very interesting and insightful interview. Organizers should have been more careful around managing protocol and sensitivities.
Congratulations to Shri Narendra Modi for cancelling the interview that was scheduled on behalf of NDTV. News Laundry paid the price for hiding the truth about who are the real persons behind the whole drama. In any case, who will watch rest of the interviews now? TRPs will be lowest now without NaMo. So Sorry…for loss. Now you can defame NaMo on daily basis and earn your bread and butter like your partner NDTV did it for last 12 years. RIP
The Congress Media House’s well earned (dis)repute has now been etched in folklore for eternity. Period.
shame on newslaundry and arvindkejri – both have hidden links – shame shame!! arvindji – u are a pathological liar
Madhu, its high time that you hired a moderator for the comments. Many are not even dignified to be mentioned on your website.
newslaundry and arvindkejri have hidden links – shame on newslaundry and shame shame on arving kejri who is a pathological liar
test message
Hey can you guys also add Tejpal to this list of candidates. Since you guys have a thing for him and you already have one Tainted person in the list of people. Guess what? He will give the congress perspective.
Kab tak chaatogee Kejri aur congress kee
Why you partnered with the most corrupt channel Ndtv ? besharam saale.
a solid kick to the back of congi and AAP bstrds
While Congress minister Salman Khursheed loots in the name of disabled, the specially abled have placed their faith in Narendra Modi. #isliyeModi
INDIAN MEDIA SHOULD B CRUSH……..as HM say,before
Good. The proxy interview for NDTV is finally cancelled.
Without Modi it would be a just another interview of a bunch of non-performers and crooks…which no one would care about.
_
If NDTV is in loss, go figure it, you can’t use Modi to make money. If you want Modi, bring Sonia and Rahul, instead of some crooks and aaptards.
Newslaundry is a great idea and so was this social media based interview but I hope Newslaundry introspects. it was so naive of Newslaundry to ignore this natural conflict of interest, by partnering with Ndtv, .part of the monster called MSM which you set out to expose in the first place and to call Kejrwal, Mamta and Lalu as contenders in the official promo is just purely unprofessional and an act of mis-leading the people. The promo sondes like a personal tweet or comment on a FB from Abhinandan .Where was the professionalism in preparing the promo, Irrespective of the popularity (or lack of it) of other interviews, i hope you guys, instead of protesting recognize the truth here.
This shameless episode of trying to Bring Modi on same platform as a Criminal, A Moron Anarchist, a Nobody who is somebody’s son and in association with a channel which has corruption charges against its it and its chief editor makes is clear that Madhu has lost control over Newlaundry to a serial abuser and Rapist supporter family Sekhari.
I will urge Madhu to leave Newslaundry and start her own platform where she can practice her fearless journalism without any favors. This site now is a lost case. For us now Newsloundry= NDTV. Either u disassociate with Sekhri the Rape supporters or we disassociate with u. 1-2 yrs on any live 40-50 mins one-on-one interview…Neither heard of any?? Ain’t that questionable? Latest one-on-one interview link of Modi of more than 10 mins I could see was of 2011. Also, I could find Arvind Kejriwal’s interview on almost all the news channels of around 40-70 mins & obviously latest..
U r typical AAPtard who are both IGNORANT and wll trained LIARS.
You clearly dont want to mention the famous interview with Reuters in 2013.
Plz share the link. I may be less-informed..But, don’t tag words like ignorant & liars with me.
Sear on Google “Modi interview with Reuters” and u will get 100s of results. and since u r less informed dont make UNINFORMED comments.
And since u r uninformed i will like to inform u that Modi had an Interview with Dainik Jagaran TODAY. Read that as well
Why I called u lier and ignorent? Because u r support a serial liar Kejriwal.
Please go through my above comments. My less-informed comment was in response to your so-highly informed message..But, need to know if you could really provide me some links & logics, similar to those I have provided in the above comment to Rukmi. However, I guess the way you are free to speak the way you feel(like you said liar Kejriwal, etc.), I too should be given a leverage to atleast put my point of view & that too showing some etiquette s. I am a supporter but not a blind follower like many. I have condemn the decision of subsidies & resignation. But, these does not make me feel that they are not worth it. Also, I feel they too are inexperienced, but a far better option against Congress & good for being in opposition(as compared to Cong) if Modi comes to power & you will have to admit that a wave of change in politics is becoz of them.
Also, Modi is a PM candidate. More & more long & genuine interviews are expectations from public to be sure who they should support for sure. Why nobody has answered on my above 3 lines of first comment & have been bombastic on the last 3 only?
Well, do some research, before dishing out such stupid nonsense… otherwise one is bound to believe that you are either liar or ignorant.
hmm.. so it’s about research.. If you have really done so.. Kindly share.. I’ll share few links. Please go through them. I am ready to vote for Modi..but not by force..by choice please..Need to be convinced & thus need his one – to – one chats to know more..:
Few Must Watch You-tube Videos – Political Battle & Agendas- AAP & BJP. (I feel no need to mention Congress)
Why this video was not aired on any news channel or not revealed in newspaper??
Press Conference of Team-AAP – allegations/doubts on earlier intentions of Modi.
Press Conference of Dr.Subramanium Swami – allegations on AAP & Kejriwal.
See & decide who has got more substance & logical reasoning.
Full Interview of Arivind Kejriwal in CNN-IBN (Before Delhi Assembly Elections) –
This one shows he ‘walks the talk’. I doubted why he is providing subsidy on
water & electricity which was not the part of manifesto(subsidy). That is in the manifesto & reason well explained.
Full Interviews of Arivind Kejriwal in AAP Ki Adalat (Before Delhi Assembly Elections) – India TV
Cut-paste edited parts of these interview are being sent to defame him & AAP.
Please have a look on complete video & decide yourself.
Arvind with Arnab Goswami on Times Now
Ques & Ans – Arvind Kejriwal(AAP) & Javed Akhtar(Congress) – Aaj Tak
Interview with Arvind Kejriwal(AAP) – Thrashed Rahul – Aaj Tak
Always have a look on complete video/interview to know the real truth & intention of any person/party.
A parted/cut-copy/modified video may lead to wrong impression of anyone & can be easily done in today’s technology.
Be educated, not only literate.

A Common Man. 😛
what a joke of a candidate list. none of the 4 left have even confirmed lok sabha nominations! they r NOT candidates. Modi has taken the best decision in cancelling NDTV event. ndtv is a unethical paid channel.
Modi confirmed his seat?
How is Lalu Prasad Yadav a candidate for LOK SABHA? Is NewsLaundry over n above the constitution and judiciary in India?
And by the way the neutral NewsLaundry has not yet responded to this :
no prizes for guessing why he cancelled
NL already shared this information if you were smart enough to look. Modi and his team took 1 month to figure it out?
What a reply….NL shared this information but never clarified.You know the reason very well but still crying foul….how smart ppl you are…..your smartness is on peak when you call AK,AY and Laloo as PM candidates.AK himself says they will 100 seats at the most.May be you have insight information that congress will support him at center too.AY not contesting this poll…Laloo cant even file nomination…I still have best wishes for Mamata Ji…How very smart ppl you are.
Have you take some pain in reading media crooks article.It is self explanatory.Would you need more clarifications? Read this:
btw you never replied by what logic laloo is a pm candidate
worth a look –
This was a set-up, pure and simple.Reading some of the comments below reveals a shocking mind set of Indians today.Most, if not all members of NL are ” expatriates” and transplants from different political shades, trying to find refuge in a new outlet, self proclaimed fiberals from Delhi’s bohemian pseudo=secular circuit.
Sonia’s AAP Media outlet along with Sonia’s Congress Media outlet both disappointed with Narendra Modi’s patriotic decision to boycott these spewers of unadulterated garbage. Respect Mr. Modi for listening to crores of your supporters.
Dear Sir, what is time of streaming, Will it be interactive? I am at Delhi, pl register my name.
Good one !! NDTV you suck big time !!
why shud modi join you? you are fool idiot moron not to know him?he is PM of india now.he is darling of crores of indian.he cant be fooled by a biased prejudiced slave media and presstitutes
Happy that Modi is not coming to this show which has anything to do with NDTV..he has given interview to other media houses ..n sharing his view with people where it matters the most..
So he ran away again…
He gave interview to Danik Jagaran which has more readership than all MSM combined. Giving interviews to English news channel journalists is not a benchmark of anything. English news channels are irrelevant – Modi’s rise has proven the irrelevance of English media that has been running anti Modi campaign for last 12 years. Let them continue to bark. Jab sher chalta hai to kutte bhokte hain. MSM congi journalists will keep on abusing and Modi will keep on rising. Modi does not need MSM – MSM needs Modi.
He probably prepared the questions and answer for that interview. No proof to the contrary. Modi can;t handle being questioned. Always on the run like Forrest Gump. Except uglier and with worse delivery. Also sponsors genocide against Muslims.
Manish Tewari, stop hiding behind pseudonyms
if NDTV is involved it’s better to stay away from it. It’s rabidly pro Congress sponsored channel. It’s a grand plan of Congis and AAP’s team Abhinandan sekri to create controversy of this interview with Modi. It’s good that Modi dropped out of this interview.
What on earth newslaundry and Madhu trehan was thinking putting Modi with Lalu, mamata, kejari. Modi is in different league altogether in terms of development and governance.
Why ON NDTV Guys many other channels were there
Did someone mention – Mukesh Ambani / Gas Price Hike / Karan Thapar / Joy rides in Adani Plane
Some people trying to imply that Madhu Trehan has been somewhat trapped by the naxals. But after her support for the fingering rapist, I have little sympathy for, or belief in, her professed neutrality.
Thank God Modi’s name is no longer appearing in this list of dimwits. Amazing decision, Modi never fails to impress.
I’m sure Modi wudn’t have withdrawn unless NL has hid certain facts like the program was tie-up btwn NDTV – NL. NL’s A Sekhri is a friennd of AK and that motley group of AAPtards. Modi did the right thing by not appearing with bunch of losers… or anarachists like Kejriwal!!
Just curious- where is Lalu contesting from?
Even Laloo wants to know.
Laloo cannot contest election, he is a convicted leader. Must read this to know the trap setted up in this interviews :
Why Narendra Modi did not participate ? =>
Narendra Modi run away from studio during interview by Karan Thapar
Muslims are taken for a ride by Congress because the only thing they can do is divide and rule, which muslims are stupid enough to accept and never work as a nation – instead it is always our comb vs, the world!
Narendra Modi wanted to Escape, but sadly this time he was in Plane could not chuck reporter.
Muslims are a real curse for India. All muslims should live on one island, then they will be happy (because they find fault with all) and the world will also be happy (rid of these people)
The New Tag Line: This is Newslaundry reporting from the North Lawns of NDTV.
New tag line: Modi running scared. Afraid to face tough questions from an independent news house. Modi to be new poster boy of Nike for running away from Madhu Trehan. Cant wait for him to be PM, then he can run away from serious issues as well. Jai Ho!
Sachchai sunke jalan to hogi hi. Beta Burnol laga lo. Pehle Islamabad ko sambhalo phir hindustan ki sochna. ye tattoo na to independent hain, na news channel / website hain aur sab ka ek hi house hai wohi 10 numbri. Aur 3 mahine baad yeh sab bhag kar tumhare yahan hi aane wale hain (Jhootistan).
Koi bhi ho Modi to Sher tha na uski Fat kaise gayi , Manch se to bada daharta phir raha hai , isse to Lalu bhi jyada himmat wala hai kam se kam interview face karne ki …….
Modi ji has acceded to the request of Crores (majority) of Indians to boycott the dubious media outlets which has led to heartburn amongst all Congress factions. He has shown that he is different from others and will not allow Congressis like Kejrifalse, funded by fraud foundation (CIA), to derail/ruin this great country. Thank you Modi Sir.
Modi was scared , he might be asked abt spying snooping on madhuri ..
Well one thing is clear. A Media House’s well earned (dis)repute has now been etched in folklore for eternity. Even DD can now claim to be more credible.
After Narendra Modi has opted out, please change the name of the program to ‘Candy-Date and Lollypops 2014′. Feeling sorry for you Newslaundry, alas had you not involved NDTV through a back door entry !
THE REAL BHAGORA darpoke kahike
Bechara Chaiwala………Bhag gaya dar k
Modi had given commitment to facebook for interview, not for this fraudulent formulation of clever clubbing with kejriwal and a convict among others. He did a good thing by turning down Ms Trehan’s cunning tactic..
Madhu Trehan’s Newsminute interview confirms the “Deal With It” line. Claiming that the fringe is setting the tone of interactions when she herself fails notice that she and her laundry have been exposed as the real fringe and are refusing to accept this fact. The frustration of these hypocrites is so glaring that even the sun is likely to feel envious of the glare.
We don’t need such PM candidate who does not have courage to face the Public
He is seeking to be Indian Prime Minister. He doesn’t have to face Pakistani Public.
New tactic I see being used to dub everyone who asks a question against or on Modi. Call them A Pakistani! We’ve only lost a match against them boss. Don’t feel so bad about it. We’ll win in the World T20 😛
What is obvious cannot be a tactic.
Indeed Manmohan face cameras (press conference) thrice in 10 years , looks like Modi will break this record by attending none..
I really wanted to see Modi’s Interview…. Disappointed .. hope he do some interviews …be with any journalist.
Maybe Newslaundry should have had Anand Ranganthan do the interview with Modi. A BJP friendly face probably wouldn’t have given Modi second thoughts over being interviewed live. I’m rather surprised that his fans are cheering this cop-out, since they would have liked him no matter what the questions or how he performed in this interview. Why not ask him to stand the test of a ‘biased’ interview with NDTV/Newslaundry?
I used to like modi…but seems man is no different…get some balls modi…tough he still might win these elections…but my vote is for kejriwal now
I used to dislike Modi but after his acceding to request of Crores of Indians to boycott this lot, I have become his biggest fan. He has shown that he is different from others and will not allow Congressis like Kejrifalse derail/ruin this great country. Thank you Modi Sir.
You claim to do “sab ki dhulai” but you are so dishonest that you deleted my following remarks posted just a few hours back. You are unable to listen to your criticism. Here it is again just in case you have even a little sense – “Modi had given commitment to facebook for interview, not for this fraudulent clubbing with kejriwal and a convict out on bail. Modi did the right thing by refusing to succumb to Ms Trehan’s cunning tactics..”
modi is a coward
feku ki aukat nhi hai live interview dene ki!
wasupp succkers
@abhinandan ya we won’t understand
Why Dont modi just tells his Source of funds for Rally ? EveryBody knows he is booking Dozens of Trains , Bus for Paid Public …. Why He need to do that ?
Why BJP have to hire ABCO and paid 400 crores to it for Modi makeover ? isnt he man enough to make his own image ?
At least NDTV is an unapologetic supporter of Congress but this Newslaundry is one of those hypocrites which simply is a blot on free media. Ashamed that I used to like them earlier.
1.Why BJP have to hire ABCO and paid 400 crores to it for Modi makeover ? isnt he man enough to make his own image ?
2.Why Dont modi just tells his Source of funds for Rally ? EveryBody knows he is booking Dozens of Trains , Bus for Paid Public …. Why He need to do that ?
Why not an entrance exam(atleast IAS level) for all the PM candidates
Modi
Rahul,
Arvind,
Mulayam,
Mamta,
Nitish…

Congressi Kejrifalse paid Rs. 350 Crores to Anil Ambani owned BSES out of the pocket (as subsidy) of the Delhi Tax payer and, instead of reducing power charges by 50% as promised, further increased the power purchase cost of the consumers by 25% for the future. What was the quid pro quo for this loot by Kejrifalse and AAP.
This Ambani stooge Kejrifalse, instead of providing 700 litres free water, increased the water charges of all consumers by 30%.
Arvind immediately Ordered CAG Audit of BSES and FIR on Ambani and 5 FIR on Sheila Dixit .Once that Audit would complete . More than 500% recovery would be Done from Ambani’s . Centre wont let Arvind complete the process .
Free Water was prototype , an initiative . Once All Water Mafia Captured . condition got better . Congress + BJP +Ambani didnot let Arvind Act on this .
-Why BJP have to hire ABCO and paid 400 crores to it for Modi makeover ?
-Why Dont modi just tells his Source of funds for Rally ?
Why did Kejrifalse stop the ACB from filing FIR against CWG Prime Suspect (370 pages proof before elections) Shiela Dixit. Just because he is a good friend of her son and his party mate. Similarly why was Ambani’s name missing in the Gas Supply FIR. What was the quid pro quo for these transactions. will the fraud foundation rep Kejrifalse answer. Delhi is paying 30% more for its gas because of this.
Arvind Order Fir Agaisnt Mikesh Ambani and Virrapa moily .. Can Modi Do it ?
Why Dont modi just tells his Source of funds for Rally ?
Modi order FIR against Barack Obama (Owner of Fraud Foundation). Can Kejrifalse do it?
share the link for your news
Here see I’m waving 370000 pages of proof. Now don’t say you don’t see it. Else you will be confirmed as a corrupt congressi of the Kejrifalse faction.
ROFL FIR against obama hahahahaahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Can’t you lie more convincingly? A look through your previous comments shows that you’ve been a fanboy of Modi long before he backed off from this interview. What was the need for you to say you used to dislike him before this? You could have just as well begun by saying that you like the taste of Modi’s c**k and so everything he does is praiseworthy, and it wouldn’t have made a blind bit of difference.
thanks Akshat , answer his incomplete data with right data
First get up from behind Madame’s backside and open your eyes and close your mouth as it is it is already full of fresh european shit. Spread out the output to other Kejrifalse faction members of the Congress. Thereafter cough a little bit to ensure that when false allegations come out of your fraud foundation mouth you are able to convince at least the five year olds. Bloody Congies.
Does any of your freshly sprouted crap answer why you blatantly lied to show support for Feku? Does any of my comment suggest to you that I support Congress or Kejriwal? True to your payscale, you’re armed with nothing but ad hominem.
@akshat … bhai ye kabhi hua tha “Modi ordered FIR against UN Secretary General and Barack Obama” ….?
The name is Baasha…Maanik Baasha. And yes, that is just more frivolous crap paid to be posted by Sachin’s overlords from the BJP.
Jawab nahin hain to crap. wah bhai congressi (AAP Faction).
You have been left speechless with up to date facts of the corrupt kejrifalse. Can you counter any of the facts amounting to 370000 pages. If you can’t, shut your trap.
Eagerly waiting for AK…..
I want BJP to answer one straight question.Why BJP did not act on Bofors scandal even after ruling for 6 years at the centre.Can they give a convincing answer to this question. If they say they had acted then who is the beneficiary of that scandal. Can Modi anwer that?I am asking this as a neutral person.
Unwise of Newslaundry to reduce itself as frontal of NDTV and partner of AAP. Credibility as neutral critic of media seems to have gone to ashes.Modi has taken the right step.
Thumahere hisab se to India news ya Zee news hi sabse unbiased channel hoga kyu??
Can @madhutrehan explain how Lalu Yadav, who is technically ineligible to even be a MP, be in list of projected PM Candidate
Also when Akhilesh Yadav is not even in the race himself, its his father who is, then what for the interview being conducted for. Was not it the biggest farce.
modi has taken lot of question from audience even from madhu tehran forfot ht summit…cnnibn summit or ficci or cii…modi has answered hell lot of question…or even in sri ram college in delhi he answered student not like rahul gandhi who ask back to student what u will do?? tell me wht u will do?? he even was present in fergusson college pune…recently and answered question from student..whic they ask more meaniful question than journalist…like will u apolozise for 2002..etc…and he is national leader he has to take rallies in whole of india..today he was in bihar…what lalu mamta or kejriwal are national leader ?? are they taking rallies whole of india???are they targeting 272 seat??…would they cross even 20….and when newslaundry will take mms interview or sonia gandhi…and modi interact with lots of people…whether it is google hangout or on facebook…didi sonia rahul or even kejriwal ineteracted that way…?? typical media propaganda…and its good modi denied interview…as ndtv said they have right to telecast interview and no other channel will telecast it…even though it is Facebook event and news laundry and ndtv are sponsoring partner…Google media crooks…to know more….
Yaar modi ko suun suun kar tumlogo ki bhi fekne ki adapt padgayi he
SHRI Narender Modi took sensible decision to cancel . Rest of the candidates have no locus standi when compared to Modi. Arvind Kejriwal has misused ANNA agitation and he is catapulted to polical arena by Media electronic and print. Lalu is barred hence cannot be a candidate.Akhilesh cannot govern a state , where is question of national leadership. Mamta at best is confined to WB.How can any of these come close to Modi who is in the process of taking India to newer heights with strong governance. For snybody to stop Modi from becoming PM is next to impossible. I have all the respect for Madhuji and NL. I am not sure what made Modiji to agree for such a format at first place. He was supposed to be first speaker .How naive ? All following speakers would get a chance to rip through his interview.Would a sesson politician like Modiji would have agreed to such a trap. May be full details were not made available when the event was conceptualised or these very delibrately kept as secret .How NDTV , arch critic of Modi is sponsoring the event. Does it mean that ownership of NL now rests with NDTV ? If it iso Madhuji you will have reconsider your association with NL.And as far as Modiji is concerned he has once again proved that he his a leader par excellence and astute politician. This brings to my mind great saying of great thinker G.B Shaw ” I learned long ago , never to wrestle with a pig.You get dirty and besides, the pig likes it.” Modiji did exactly that. It is very sad that NL and Madhuji appeared to be part of this nefarious design. Nevertheless it would be interesting to see rest of the interviews. Madhuji will make it a real event. For Madhuji taking on Modiji will have to wait. Millions NL fans will wait gor thst.
where to ask ques to AK
Why isn’t newlaundry sharing the reason for Modi’s cancellation. Why wait till 10th March 14. Using Modi for getting cheap publicity ? Without Modi’s participation, this proghramme is going to be a non starter and if atall it happens will anyone watch it ? Madhu trehan spent all her life abusing Modi. She had NDTV giving her company. My guess is when Modi learnt that NDTV is a partner of NL in this programme Modi backed out. And Modi is absolutely right. Why should he be part of a show which has the Modi basher NDTV as a partner. Congratulations Modi team.
Then why accept it in the first place. Either his aides screwed up or there is something else. He may have wanted authority on screening the questions which NL may not have agreed. Modi is known to avoid answering embarrassing questions.
Had Niticentral been running the chat with Facebook instead of NL, Modi would have attended.
Obviously, Niticentral is not associated with Radia tapes and that is also the BLACK DAY of INDIAN JOURNALISM, NDTV does.
So it would have been a good forum. Architect of one Black day meets the Architect on another.
I said the color of the day BLACK because I do see other colors as well but if someone is BLINDFOLDED with HATRED, for him/her its BLACK everywhere
so what color would a person who blindfolded with Hatred see? That color i am assuming is what Modi sees. So i will rephrase my previous response – Architect of THE COLOR MODI SEES THROUGH YOUR EYES meets the ARCHITECT of THE COLOR YOU SEE OF KEJRIWAL. It still does not take away from the fact that it would have been a good forum
NL deliberately trying to club Modi with a jailbird, an anarchists and a perpetrator of 120 communal riots since last one year. Modi did well not to participate in this event. The Trehans, the NDTV’s, the New laundry’s etc want publicity using Modi. Without Modi this programme is going to be a big flop. And very well deservedly so.
that is one view..the other view is a jailbird, an anarchist, and a perpetrator of 120 communal riots are being clubbed with a mass murderer who was supposed to lead the program.
and possibly he misunderstood program for pogrom and hence accepted.
Do you even believe in constitution of India and Judiciary system?
Oh sure! I am waiting for them to open their eyes. Aren’t 3 murder cases open on amit shah?
Idiotical avoiding of this sort of argument mixed with Lies, by BJP only, shame on you.
two examples, NaMo has more, see my other full comment, answer them.
Vajpayee Govt with Modi entered into deal for bribes and looted more than 30,000 crores in just one deal and you shamelessly talk big..
Kargil was a created war as BJP Govt gave in to Terrorists, not necessary as just months before elections and to fool people and win. All of you want to win to LOOT further and will Sell off India slowly within next few years to Chinese or someone who pays you right amount.
The basic premise is the problesm- ‘Top Cotenders -Mamta, Lalu, Akihlesh, Arvind’
top contenders for what?
The entire media was part of systematic vilification campaign against Modi for the past 12 yrs, in the garb of their JOURNALISTIC WISDOM and FREEDOM.
Now that since Sept’2013 Modi has addressed around 270 small to large gatherings, he is overly occupied by striking the chord with common man of this nation, the same journalists are now NOT ALLOWING him to use HIS FREEDOM to cancel the event.
NDTV’s Neeta Sharma has covered over 300+ hours of air time of Shorabuddin GENUINE (not fake) encounter case but it was never told that Shorabuddin was extortionist, the cache of 200 AK47, grenades and other ammunition were found from his backyard. 30 minutes before his encounter, he received/made multiple calls to Karachi.
That NDTV, which was running high in the patronage of Corrupt Congress for past 10 yrs, time has ripen to pay back for all their misdeeds.
NDTV ran the story for 2.5 days that Narendra Modi will be arrested soon, the moment he appears in Gujarat office of Special Investigation Team ( SIT), appointed by Hon’ble Supreme Court. Later on Barkha Dutt comes and with no apology and remorse says that, before running the story, she didn’t verify the facts.
Its a pertinent to point out that entire NDTV story was based on fictitious, non-existant date & the fact remains that Modi appeared before SIT, interrogated for 8 hours and same SIT had given him CLEAN CHIT by none other than ex-CBI Director Mr RK Raghvan, a person known for his integrity.
Should Narendra Modi ever associate with such channel ?
None of the above mentioned are candidates,except for Modi,none have been officially named,by these logic why don’t u call me on the show,even i have ambitions of being a PM.
I’d really like to hear why he cancelled. I was eagerly awaiting an interview with him. I hope he addresses some of the questions he’s being asked in a future interview.
where can I submit my questions for Arvind Kejriwal
What were the pre-conditions that Modi imposed for the Interview before he ran ?? This Feku has an even worse record than Manmohan when it comes to a Two way dialogue or question and answer session.Looks like Modi’s motto is : The number one enemy of development is QUESTION !! Shut up !! Be happy !!
Cant imagine a two way dialogue with manmohan in it. The problem that modi has is that the media loves 2002 too much and wont let go of it. I mean even a 40-60% mix of 2002 issue and the rest of the topics would be ok. Usually its a 95-5% mix and then it no longer an interview, its more like a witch-hunt. And I can see why he doesnt want to participate in a witch-hunt.
Now that the Jokepal is falling apart at the seams…..
The truth has a strange way of coming out…
As if NITIN GADKARI was in the confession box and you were standing besides him.
I wonder Robert Vadera never came and told you that he is using the black money of Dawood Ibrahim in all the DLF projects, Rahul Gandhi never comes and tell you that his family has stashed away BLOCK MONEY in foreign bank generations back.
Didn’t you counter Nitin Gadkari that Atal Bihari Vajpayee won elections 7 times on BJP ticket and no one ever questioned his honesty.
Is NL really going ahead with the rest of people. Does anyone really want to hear Akhilesh Yadav or LPY ? AK was getting a little boring is starting to get interesting now that he is getting started on the communal politics things which is quite revealing since they are so close to Congressi thought.
If AAP does become mainstream in LS2014 I would not be surprise if Rahul quits Congress and begins to lead AAP.
And really NL should have known that Narendra Modi would not join if was behind this in anyway. What were you guys thinking ?
I really hope Madhu Trehan does a good job and takes AK to the ropes by asking him on why he quit the government in delhi instead of investingating into the CWG scam and also on Robert Vadra. The whole of DLF and Varda dealings happened in delhi so as the CM he did have the jurisdiction to investigate into the matter.
Funny that you are so hoping to see AK being grilled but have no qualm about Modi chickening out of the interview. At least we have a leader in AK who is not afraid of facing tough questions.
you are an idiot or you are just an idiot.. idiot .. The question can be asked by anybody not reporter .. Idiot
WOW! Mention Modi and people just go bonkers. LOL..
AK quit as he was not corrupt and did not become CM to make money via bribes like BJP /Congi & others. He quit as BJP/ congi colluded to continue corruption and no point in running a Govt without full majority, which is okay for corrupt parties. NaMo is one of worst and most corrupt politicos, using goondaism, misuse of police & state power and you avoid asking why he refused to come on seeing the questions he was to be asked as he could NOT fix interview.
(cont) and AK didnt do any investigation. Why ?
MH – Please see this !!
People at NDTV and/or NL are bloody fixers and sold out. Had Modi gone on to attend, it would have been a huge disappointment to millions and millions of people.
Modi did absolutely right… first of all, how did NDTV came into picture? Why should Modi entertain this channel which has been spreading all venom against him since long time, who knows this fact more than newslaundry? Still newslaundry feels it OK to partner with NDTV ?
You can’t call it Candidates 2014 anymore, because the only real candidate for the General Elections is Narendra Modi.
modi has given so many interviews.now a days he gives his model in every public rallies in simple language so that even common man can understand it.he may be little wel versed in high profile terminology but his ideas are more realistic and practical.
You cant get Modi with NDTV as exclusive partner of the show.. NDTV tried all its unethical journalistic norms to target him from last 12 yeras and they continue even till date. NDTV never shown such an interest for 100s of riots before/after riots of 2002 . This shows their intent very clear. I was shocked and upset why Modiji giving interview to NDTV. But he corrected himself lately though.
Vivek the questions will be asked by facebook people not NDTV ..you are such a dumb guy
any association with NDTV by Narendra Modi will let down many of his admirers. we have seen how Madhu Corrupt Trehan was picking the friendly questions to Arvind Kejriwal
Madhuji , reply honestly , are you on the verge of Joining AAP. If you do nothing wrong in it. Whole friendly interview suggest that. But you were inner you , at times
NDTV had exclusive right to this program. And that was not acceptable to Mr. Modi. Thank you dumb fellow for letting me explain this simple thing to you.
When did Akhilesh Yadavji become a top contender for PM’s post? Why was our Amma from Tamilnadu left out?
If that be so, his closest rival would be none other than his own father Mr Mulayam Singh.
Perhaps decided by Madhu Trehan & Barkha Dutt after several rounds of closes door meeting.
Respected Madhu Trehan , many like me consider you and NL to be one of the few honest media channels. This is duly reflected in the NL statement ” Zero toleranced for unethical jouranlism ” But do you think this image is intact after partnering with NDTV. I followed your peice on NDTV event held at Rashtra Pati Bhavan. Were you successful in securing permission to host an event at R.P Bhavan ? Or is it that now you have partenered with NDTV which gives you access to North Lawns sorry Mughal Lawns of RP Bhavan . Smart move. But it is colossal loss for readers like me who condsidered NL to be torch bearer and considered NL statement sacrosanct. Hume nahin malum the isme bhi Kejriwal hai. Readers aap ki kya rai hai? Is it desth of NL we cherished? And birth of new NL controlled by unethical media ?
May be Madhu Trehan would’ve started her journalistic career 30 yrs earlier than Arnab Goswami but still she needs to learn more with less greed. Arnab’s encounter with Rahul Gandhi was way better than what nautanki Madhu was doing with Arvind Anarchist Kejriwal.
Congress has ruled this nation directly or indirectly for the past 60 out of 67 yrs since independence and BJP has ruled ONLY for SIX YEARS that too led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, yet AAP party wants me to believe that corruption of Congress from Jwahar Lal Nehru regime to Manmohan Singh regime is same as 6 yrs of BJP’s corruption ( if att all there was any corruption led by Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee)
Our PM candidate is afraid of a news channel! watta loser.. wat kinda leader will he become.. we all know media is manipulative, but atleast AK and others still got balls to face em. unlike modi who keeps on running away and let his puppets give stupid excuses for him.
That’s why. Though he later retracted and agreed for smaller house.
If you want to be a leader, first and foremost thing is to come and face the questions and if he has any problem with channel then also he should come forward and state clearly the issue, it is a live show and nobody is shutting his mouth as people are also sitting on the other side. This is his arrogance that he thinks himself as PM before election. We will decide after listening to him what he can become.
Which questions he didn’t face, he was part of HINDUSTAN TIMES summit, India Today Conclave, Think India Conclave, addressed SRCC Delhi students Chai pe charcha etc etc.
However,.
What credibility TARUN TEJPAL has even if anyone refuses to give interview a day he molested and raped his junior colleague, who is of same age as of Tejpal.
BTW, what I know all media houses are already bought by Ambani.
One word – Fattu!
Media fo face karne ke liye imandan hona padega. Himmat chahiye. Monologue me 56″ jaise bakwaas kisi kaam ka nahi. Desh kisi aise ke paas nahi jana chahiye jise interview dene me itna darr lage.
Interview dene Lalu Yadav bhi aa rahe hain, unme darr nahi hai isliye desh LALU YADAV ko denaa chahiye jo corruption ke case mein CONVICTED hain …
After anointment of CONGRESS UNIVERSITY OF SECULARISM to give SECULAR/COMMUNAL certificates, refusing to come on NDTV sponsored program has become LITMUS TEST of who is courageous and who is not.
Narendra Modi is coward because he doesn’t deserve of any freedom, liberty and discretion to refuse any media interview.
Since Lalu Prasad Yadav has agreed for the invitation, therefore unlike Narendra Modi he deserves to be Prime Minister of India, though he doesn’t even qualify to be any member of Rajyasabha or Loksabha after being CONVICTED in corruption case of fodder scam.
For the past 67 yrs since independence Congress has ruled this country directly or indirectly for the past 60 yrs. BJP had got an opportunity to serve this country ONLY for 6 yrs, that too led by none other than Atal Bihari Vajpayee, leader liked across party line and impeccable integrity. In 5 decades of his public life, not even shred of allegations of corruption against him.
Corruption allegations on Congress goes way back to Jawahar Lal Nehru time, when his own son-in-law accused him of heading corrupt Govt. . This is followed by Indira Gandhi, Rajeev Gandhi, Narsimha Rao and now Dr. Manmohan Singh.
Now Arvind anarchist Kejriwal want us to believe that corruption of 60 yrs of Congress is same as (if at all) corruption of BJP in 6 yrs that too led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
AAPtards moron.
If anyone other than Satya wants to know the extent of LIES, MANUFACTURED LIES, CONCOCTED LIES this one is good case study.
NaMo has experience, solution and vision for development and governance.
Modi is the best choice for PM.
There are several interviews of NaMo with journallist are available in youtube.
Yes all manipulated, paid or where they asked only those questions acceptable to him and not strong questions about his corruption, goondaism, misuse of police/ state power. BJP is other face of Congress, both have looted country, have no governance except they try during elections to fool people, win power and LOOT.
What exact initiative should we expect from RJD with the changing political scenario of the country ?
Narendra Modi knew from questions list sent the truth would come out, has No guts to face real questions and only where he is asked what he wants to avoid his goondaism and extreme corruption. BJP bhakts/ chelas talk of others to avoid their corruption. Under Vajpayee & NDA Govt. they had further corruption, everyone knows now due to AAP how Vajpayee, his bjp minsters in collusion with Modi stole 30,000 crores of KG. basin money by giving contract to a one week old company Geo global led by a Congress colluder in other deals and their BJP govts paid the company’s investment too shamelessly from public funds and for bribes gave another Gas reserve to Ambani, today we have huge prices of gas and all essential commodities.
NaMo / BJP stop big talk and paid wave, you could Not win students election last week in Gujarat. BJP is other face of Congress. If you are really honest Vote AAP in coming elections, they may have problems but they will solve it (Congress/ BJP etc; for donkeys years have more problems).
NaMo/ BJP supporters trying to avoid shamelssly, Answer these few please:
1)Pls tell why NaMo did not have LokAyukta for so many years – it was to escape being caught in scams & Looting.
4)agains.
7)Is it not a fact (many videos by Ndtv, AAJTAK, ABN etc) that development of Gujarat is exaggerated with huge debts to show off. Is it not a fact that only posh areas in cities & towns get 24 hours water and 17 disctricts .?
10)Is it not true that NaMo claims to be a Brahmachari, when in fact against Law he many yrs ago when in RSS married a child girl J.
Are you aware Modi j; which is why he did not attend/ avoided. YUK
..No way you Modi ji will become PM, find a place to hide in
Gujarat before you lose that too and yes pay your bhakts some of that huge Loot for protection and for hiring trains, buses, giving expensive food, some cash to get them to come to your meetings and claim what a huge crowd. Modi ji does not understand how people come to AAP meetings in revers – no trains, no buses, no food and instead of taking money they give money to AAP to wipe out NaMo, congi and his ilk.
The only qualification of above post is, being democratic nation, everyone has freedom of expression and few cynical misuse it and then it is called freedom of expression which is bereft of any truth, facts, morality.
I really hope you know what you say, as I am definite you are not.
You are contradicting yourself and every understanding of:
1)You say “few cynical misuse it”: Why only cynical should misuse? If you dont agree with facts and against NaMo who is getting ready to Loot India -does it become cynical. YUK
2)You say “freedom of expression which is bereft of any truth, facts, morality”: Why the hell sir and since when is freedom of expression of truth – in fact its usually other way round but occasionally it can be what you say.
is it Not true NaMo is Corrupt to core, a criminal who misuses system to escape law like fixing SIT chief with bribes to be discharged by court for now, fixing opinion polls and generally Lying to mislead people and speaking/ behaving like a Goonda type.
Murdering/ attacking RTI activists inclduing one recently who tried to expose his corruption.
and on and on it goes, facts all in public domain not nonsense as made out by Bjp people.

Seriously? [review for score balance]
Well, this piece has nothing added to it, compared to the rest of the series, so there was no chance of getting a better score from me. Yes, you have done some plot (Doodle was going to his Kung Fu lesson), but we never saw him learning anything.
While attempting poorly to do Kung Fu might have been worse, I'm not so sure. Perhaps having things in there, such as whatever katas that you think would be required in Kung Fu lessons would have been helpful. Animating them would certainly give the episode more depth.
Backgrounds have been added in places, which is nice, though I would stress that if you're going to add them, make sure that you add background to every scene.
The drawing of Doodle does fit with the way that you've got the white loose fitting martial arts dress, but the massive gap in the middle, exposing Doodle's midriff was unnecessary. Cover that up, try to take care of additional lines where they should be erased and you'll get a good looking piece.
Finally, subtitles, to go with the vocals would also help - I'll suggest the standard black stripe across the bottom of the screen, with white writing for the subtitles.

Researchers: Flu vaccine more effective for women than for men
The flu vaccine is generally less effective for men than for women, scientists said in a study Monday, tracing the effect to higher levels of testosterone that curb the immune response.
It has long been known that men are more vulnerable than women to bacterial, viral and parasitic infections, but scientists have never been able to clearly explain why.
It was also known that men don’t respond as strongly as women to vaccines against yellow fever, measles and hepatitis, said the authors of the study, which appears in this week’s Proceedings of the American Academy of Sciences.
The new research, using samples from 34 men and 53 women, suggested that the cause could be traced to testosterone: only men with higher levels of the sex hormone demonstrated the lower antibody response to the flu vaccine.
Among men with lower levels of testosterone, the immune response was “more or less equivalent to that of women,” said a statement from Stanford University, whose researchers collaborated with others at the French governmental research organization INSERM for the study.
Previous studies on animals and in cell-culture experiments had previously suggested a link between testosterone and immune response, which creates inflammation as it battles the invasion of a pathogen.
This latest study doesn’t indicate a direct link between testosterone and the lowered immune response. Instead, the immune system’s reaction was reduced by the activation of a group of genes that are also linked to a higher level of testosterone, explained Mark Davis, immunology professor at Stanford University.
The researchers also considered an apparent evolutionary paradox — wondering how natural selection could favor a hormone responsible both for characteristics such as strength and a taste for taking risks, and for weakening the immune system.
They speculated that in prehistoric times, men’s roles as hunters and warriors tended to expose them to more wounds and resulting infections.
A decent immune response to these infections is an evolutionary advantage, but an overly abundant one — which can occur in certain diseases including some virulent forms of the flu — could prove more dangerous than the pathogen itself, they said.
Thus, perhaps men with less aggressive immune responses tended to be better able to survive, the researchers said.

"The United States Geological Survey Department has confirmed that there was a 3.2 earthquake about 3 miles northeast of Greeley shortly after 9:30 p.m. Oklahoma had a 5.6 magnitude earthquake in 2011 and the USGS and OGS identified the injecting for disposal of waste water use in the fracking process as a contributing factor for the earthquake. They also have the same problem in Texas. This is yet one more reason to vote yes for a two-year timeout for fracking in Loveland."
"There has never been a recordable earthquake near Greeley in any type of recorded situation, yet a 3.7 magnitude earthquake hits Greeley after all the countless fracking has happened. We need to vote 'yes' on the moratorium."
Sgt. Bergdahl
"Amazing news Sgt. Bergdahl in the Army, Afghanistan prisoner for five years finally released today. Welcome home and shame on the commander-in-chief waiting five years to get him home. So shameful, but welcome home and a huge parade and turn out should be for Bergdahl and his family."
Snowden
"Edward Snowden is a national hero. The results of his illegal actions have already prompted changes in federal law to protect citizens' privacy from the government. His was a non-violent act that brought the world's attention to illegal and unwarranted acts of spying by our government. The law and government are not always on the side of the people. Bravo."

In the 21st century, music production is all about technology. Compositions that would have taken a whole rack full of hardware to produce decades ago can easily be created today on a single laptop with the right software. That's where Ableton comes into the picture - they released the first version of their digital audio workstation, Live, in 2001 and it quickly became the industry standard. Today, Ableton Live is up to version 9.1, and it's still the top choice for music and audio professionals all over the world.
With its history of powering pro studios that create media for the recording, film and TV industries, it's no surprise that Live is the bread and butter of the Ableton lineup. You'll find several versions of the software here, and you don't have to worry about growing pains if you'd rather try one of the basic editions before going all-out: there are upgrades available so you can easily step up to higher versions.
If you're a hobbyist or just looking to get a feel for the basics of Live, check out the Intro version. It's the perfect way to try the essentials of Live 9 before committing to a bigger investment. On the other hand, if you're ready to go all-out from the start, you can also opt for the Standard edition or even the incredibly powerful Ableton Live 9 Suite. Don't like the idea of waiting for shipping? No problem: each version of the Ableton Live DAW gives you the choice between a boxed copy and a download, so you can get it the way you prefer.
To make the most of Live, you'll also want to consider the Ableton Push Software Controller Instrument. It's more than just an average pad controller: Akai and Ableton teamed up to design the Push specifically for Live, so it gives you better control over the DAW than a generic controller could. Any studio that works extensively with Ableton Live should seriously look into adding a Push to its setup.
There are plenty of reasons why Ableton Live has been such a successful DAW, including a fluid, easy-to-use interface and specialized views that make your creative workflow feel natural and inspired. If you've been agonizing over which DAW to use in your own studio, you can rest assured that Ableton software is a solid choice for any musician.

Warne's killer look and Mallya's pride
James Alter
26 April 2011
IPL week two in review: Gayle joins Royal Challengers, Dhawan's luck and Sehwag maths
IPL week two in review: Gayle joins Royal Challengers, Dhawan's luck and Sehwag maths
The Comeback
Two days after Royal Challengers Bangalore owner Vijay Mallya
tweeted his excitement at Chris Gayle joining the squad
, the coolest cat in cricket took the field and smashed his way to his first IPL century, the second-fastest in 2011, and secured victory over his former team, Kolkata Knight Riders. It was thrilling stuff, and proved a dramatic change in fortunes for a side that had dropped three matches in a row. In 55 balls, Gayle biffed 102 runs – the last four of which came after he instructed Virat Kohli to play out five balls in order to get him back on strike. “God is good. I think the crowd enjoyed the big sixes, I get cussed a lot when I don't get them,” said Gayle afterwards.
The Innings
After four indifferent innings in which he managed 72 runs, Virender Sehwag demanded a green-tinged wicket and duly got it. After being asked to bat first by Adam Gilchrist, Sehwag unleashed a ferocious innings that left Kings XI Punjab smarting at the decision to field. Having loaded into Praveen Kumar, Sehwag took a backseat as David Warner sped ahead. Then in six balls Sehwag leaped from 37 to 50, before he launched David Hussey for three successive sixes. Attempting a fourth, he picked out deep midwicket and walked off with the same poker face he wore when he came to the crease.
The Stat
Dissecting a Sehwag innings in Twenty20 by virtue of statistics is about as useful as a chocolate teapot, but one number tells a story: there were just four dot balls in his innings against Kings XI Punjab on Saturday evening. Yes, four.
The Warne effect
After a stellar first two matches, during which he purchased wicket drift and turn, Shane Warne’s slump in form coincided with that of his team,
Rajasthan Royals
. After two defeats to Kolkata, Warne was left fuming at a press conference during which he called out his mates for playing poor cricket. It had no effect, and Rajasthan lost their next game. And so Warne took it upon himself to lead from the front. Against Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Warne removed Brad Hodge with his fourth ball and stymied the batsmen with his bag of tricks. Keeping one over for himself, Warne returned for the 16
th
over and duly snuffed out the big wickets of Ravindra Jadeja and Parthiv Patel to finish with exemplary figures of 4-0-16-3. Bowled, Shane.
The Welcome
During that same match, Warne welcomed former Rajasthan team-mate Jadeja with a 109kmph bouncer, seam-up. Jadeja, after two seasons with Rajasthan, had sought to leave the team for greener pastures before being banned for a season, and clearly Warne hadn’t taken well to the youngster’s intentions. While Warne gave the player he once dubbed ‘Rockstar’ a vicious stare, the big screen flashed the word ‘Lethal’ in bold letters.
The Catch
Mumbai Indians have really worked on their fielding, under the watchful eye of Jonty Rhodes, and the results are coming. Kieron Pollard has taken some stunners this season, but the catch that trumped them all was held by Rohit Sharma. In the 13
th
over of Chennai Super Kings’ chase at the Wankhede, MS Dhoni contrived to leading edge a ball from Pollard that pitched outside leg stump. The ball ballooned away toward third man, where Rohit sprinted and dived full stretch to come up with a blinder. With that, Chennai’s reply petered away.
The Assault
Mumbai had recovered from 70 for 4 to 148 for 4 after 19 overs against Deccan Chargers in Hyderabad, thanks to a splendid partnership between Rohit and Andrew Symonds. The former Deccan team-mate batted well and ensured Mumbai were poised for a late surge. That came in the 20
th
over, bowled by Daniel Christian. The first ball, a full toss, was pummelled over long-off for six; the fourth mowed over midwicket for six; the fifth swung over square leg for six; and the sixth hit straight back for four. Twenty-four has come off the final over, and an attainable target had turned into an imposing one.
The Gambit
Having seen Bharat Chipli drop David Warner, the last man standing, Deccan captain Kumar Sangakkara gave the ball to Shikhar Dhawan. It was a brave decision, considering Dhawan had never bowled a ball in 49 prior Twenty20 matches. It was a clever one as it denied Warner the pace he loves. After getting rid of Warner second ball, it was also a successful one.
The friendship
Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman have recorded many a match-turning or saving partnership for India in Tests, but this weekend there was no such familiar territory, playing both in the IPL and not with their home teams (as they have done for three seasons). It just didn’t quite seem right. As it turned out, Dravid put Laxman out of his misery by swooping in to collect the ball and then nailing a direct hit to run out his good mate by a yard.

By Steven Cohen (The Huffington Post) - July 23, 2012
Just as the movie massacre in Colorado reminds us that the assault weapon ban has not been discussed in the presidential campaign, the intense storms and heat this summer remind us that climate change is a phrase that seems to have been banned on the campaign trail. The ability of powerful economic interests to control America’s political agenda is not news, but the degree to which facts and science are willfully denied seems to be getting worse.
Climate has never been an easy issue for the American political system. We do much better with problems that have a geographic home, can be seen and felt, and have an immediate visible impact. Toxic waste, oil spills, and hydraulic fracturing can be seen and their impact is immediate. On the other hand, climate change is caused everywhere and its impact is in the future. Before climate science became the target of ideological idiocy, the American right developed market-based methods of moving away from fossil fuels. One of the most creative methods was something called cap and trade. The idea was to raise the price of fossil fuels in order to speed that day that renewable energy could compete with fossil fuels on price. Not a bad idea and we came pretty close to adopting that policy with the Waxman-Markey bill in the U.S. Congress.
Unfortunately, the Tea Party arrived, the climate deniers gained legitimacy, and cap and trade was renamed Cap and Tax by the nuts that took over the U.S. House of Representatives. While both Obama and Romney know that global warming is proven scientific fact, neither want to mess with these folks and go “off message” during this volatile and uncertain presidential campaign. Precious time is being lost, and more and more greenhouse gasses collect in our planet’s atmosphere.
Climate change was never going to be an easy issue, and as the point of crisis has arrived, one of the problems has actually been the occasionally shrill voice of some of our climate scientists. They correctly see the danger of climate change, but do not see the political dangers that can be posed by sudden economic change. Some advocate policies that would imperil the world’s economy. There is no question that we need to transition to a fossil fuel free economy. The issue is how, and at what pace? An immediate reduction of fossil fuels to the levels suggested by some climate scientists (for example, 350 parts per million) would reduce economic consumption and production, set off a world-wide depression, and stimulate mass political instability. Politicians concerned about retaining power would never allow the world’s economy to be slowed down to prevent climate change and so there is no chance that such a sudden and dramatic reduction in fossil fuel use would reach the political agenda. Given the technology of mass destruction that can now be deployed during periods of extreme political unrest, the impact of human-induced climate change must unfortunately be compared to the impact of human-induced warfare.
While the transition to a fossil fuel free economy must be gradual and implemented with care, it still must come. Public policy in this country, Europe, China, India and Japan must start moving in this direction. While international meetings such as the recent one in Rio hold out little hope of leading this transition, other arenas hold out more promise. Many local governments, such as the C40 cities led by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, have begun active efforts to reduce carbon generation. Corporations all over the world are becoming more energy-efficient and increasing their use of renewable energy. In our own country, during fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011, a total of over $100 billion of incremental government resources were allocated to renewable energy research and development. While these resources were short-term, investment continues outside the U.S. and the price of solar power continues to come down while the price of most fossil fuels continuing to rise.
As David Leonhardt wrote recently in the New York Times, the focus of climate policy in recent years has been to lower the price of clean energy rather than raise to price of dirty energy. Cap and trade, carbon taxes and other forms of regulation are being supplanted by policies that directly promote renewable energy. This is a strategy that I have been discussing for some time, and while it is not technologically feasible now, it will be before too long. As oil and coal become less plentiful and more difficult to extract and transport their price will rise. As renewable energy technology develops and is adopted, its price will fall. Eventually, renewables will be much cheaper than oil and coal. Fossil fuels will go the way of the tape cassette. This still requires government intervention, but does not require command and control government regulation or a carbon tax. While those policies remain a good idea that would speed the transition, they are not an absolute necessity. The government interventions required are investments in the basic science and engineering of new renewable energy technologies and on tax incentives to encourage individuals and businesses to adopt these developing technologies.
Which brings us back to presidential politics and the sounds of silence from the White House. As the country has turned more and more against government, the Democrats have essentially adopted the policy perspective of the Reagan administration and the Republicans have continued to move as far as possible away from the idea that government has a legitimate role to play in a civil society. The national political center has moved dramatically to the right. The problem for the both parties is that the world is not getting simpler: environmental sustainability, the global economy, the aspirations of impoverished people, the communications capacity of the Internet, terrorism and the growing technology of destruction both create and possibly help solve a set of vexing problems. Unfortunately, these problems cannot wait for the hidden hand of the free market to be solved. Government has a key role to play. Not the big bumbling government associated with the federal bureaucracy, but a leaner, more agile government that knows how to partner with the private sector to solve problems.
I am fortunate to live in a city that in a struggle for survival has learned how to do just that. It makes lots of mistakes, but New York City’s very active government is in a growing partnership with a wide range of private for profit and nonprofit organizations. And our Mayor continues to campaign for gun control, public health, and environmental sustainability nearly every day. But national polls tell us that these themes are not likely to resonate with voters in November. And mistrust of the competence of the federal government continues to grow. Proposing a “moon shot” renewable energy initiative and goal is simply not in the cards this fall. I know that a national political campaign is probably the last place one would begin a serious discussion about the significant challenges facing the United States of America, but how about an election eve victory speech? Or maybe a State of the Union Message?Flower Sun and Rain: Murder and Mystery in Paradise (Nintendo DS)

In this slidecast, David Cerf from the Active Archive Alliance describes five Big Data trends for 2014.
"2013 has been a breakthrough year for active archive deployments, and with shrinking IT budgets, exponential data growth, and longer retention periods, there are no signs of slowing in 2014. In fact, the current climate is driving the need for more cost-effective long-term storage solutions more than ever. The market has matured to a point where accessibility and performance are essential to long-term data storage, making 2014 the year active archives will become a more mainstream best practice. Members of the Active Archive Alliance – including Crossroads, Fujifilm, QStar, SGI, and Spectra Logic - have compiled their top five predictions for data storage as it relates to active archives in the year to come."
