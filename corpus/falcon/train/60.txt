Abstract
Background
Over 5,488,000 cases of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) have been reported since December 2019. We aim to explore risk factors associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients and assess the use of D-dimer as a biomarker for disease severity and clinical outcome.
Methods
We retrospectively analyzed the clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of 248 consecutive cases of COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China from January 28 to March 08, 2020. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to explore risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Correlations of D-dimer upon admission with disease severity and in-hospital mortality were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the optimal cutoff level for D-dimer that discriminated those survivors versus non-survivors during hospitalization.
Results
Multivariable regression that showed D-dimer > 2.0 mg/L at admission was the only variable associated with increased odds of mortality [OR 10.17 (95% CI 1.10–94.38), P = 0.041]. D-dimer elevation (≥ 0.50 mg/L) was seen in 74.6% (185/248) of the patients. Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis were ruled out in patients with high probability of thrombosis. D-dimer levels significantly increased with increasing severity of COVID-19 as determined by clinical staging (Kendall’s tau-b = 0.374, P = 0.000) and chest CT staging (Kendall’s tau-b = 0.378, P = 0.000). In-hospital mortality rate was 6.9%. Median D-dimer level in non-survivors (n = 17) was significantly higher than in survivors (n = 231) [6.21 (3.79–16.01) mg/L versus 1.02 (0.47–2.66) mg/L, P = 0.000]. D-dimer level of > 2.14 mg/L predicted in-hospital mortality with a sensitivity of 88.2% and specificity of 71.3% (AUC 0.85; 95% CI = 0.77–0.92).
Conclusions
D-dimer is commonly elevated in patients with COVID-19. D-dimer levels correlate with disease severity and are a reliable prognostic marker for in-hospital mortality in patients admitted for COVID-19.
Background
Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is the disease caused by 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2, a novel β coronavirus of group 2B [1]. The illness ranges from asymptomatic or mild infection to severe respiratory tract infections in humans such as those seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Presentations include fever, coughing, dyspnea, watery diarrhea, myalgia, severe lymphopenia, prolonged coagulation profiles, cardiac disease, and sudden death [2, 3].
Since the emergence in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019, COVID-19 has increased rapidly in China and progressed worldwide. On January 30, 2020, WHO declared the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). As of May 27, 5,488,825 cases have been confirmed globally, including in Americas, Europe, Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, and Africa, and 349,095 deaths have been reported [4]. Coagulopathy was reported, and D-dimer elevations were seen in 3.75–68.0% of the COVID-19 patients [2, 5, 6]. Previous studies in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients have shown that D-dimer level is higher in severe cases and may be used as a prognostic biomarker [7,8,9], and D-dimer > 1 μg/ml is one of the risk factors for mortality in adult inpatients with COVID-19 [6]. However, the role of D-dimer in COVID-19 patients has not been fully investigated. In this study, we showed D-dimer levels in patient groups stratified by clinical severities, imaging staging, in-hospital death, and assessed the role of D-dimer as a biomarker for disease severity and clinical outcome.
Methods
Patients
We enrolled patients of confirmed COVID-19 referred to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, China), a designated center prioritized in treating critical illness, from January 28 to March 08, 2020. Confirmed cases were defined as those with epidemiological history, consistent with two clinical manifestations, and microbiological evidence (respiratory or blood specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay or virus gene sequencing) according to the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline (6th ed.) (in Chinese) published by the National Health Commission of China [10]. Symptom onset is determined by the earliest clinical manifestations consistent with COVID-19, such as fever, cough, dyspnea, muscle pain, diarrhea, and fatigue, recorded in medical history taken upon admission. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, cancer, hematologic malignancy, chronic liver disease, acute coronary syndrome, surgery or trauma within 30 days, and patients without D-dimer testing upon admission. We retrospectively collected demographic, clinical data, laboratory parameters, chest CT imaging, and prognosis through electronic nursing and medical records using standardized data collection form. This study was approved by the institutional ethics board of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (No. WDRY2020-K048).
Laboratory and imaging methods
Complete blood count, coagulation profile, renal and liver function, creatine kinase, electrolytes, myocardial enzymes, CD4 and CD8 cell counts, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were collected routinely on admission. D-dimer level is tested using immunoturbidimetric assay with reference range of 0–0.50 mg/L (Sysmex, CS5100). Doppler ultrasound and CT pulmonary angiography were done for any patients with high clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis (PE/DVT). Chest CT scan was done for all inpatients.
Severity assessment
Clinically, severity of the COVID-19 patients was classified into mild, moderate, severe, and critically ill according to the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline (6th ed.) by the National Health Commission of China (Supplement table 1) [10]. Radiologically, the area of affected lungs consistent with viral pneumonia in each patient’s first chest CT after admission was measured and classified into ≤ 30%, 31–50%, and ≥ 50% of total lung area. According to oxygenation index (OI) at admission, patients were grouped into 4 groups (group 1, OI ≥ 400 mmHg; group 2, OI 300–399 mmHg; group 3, OI 200–299 mmHg; group 4, OI < 200 mmHg). The scores of SOFA, qSOFA, ITSH for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), CURB-65 for community-acquired pneumonia and Wells’ rule [11], and the revised Geneva score [12] for assessing pulmonary embolism (PE) risk for each patient were documented.
Statistics
Continuous data accorded with normal distribution and homogeneity of variance were expressed as mean ± SD and compared by independent samples t test or expressed as median (25–75th percentile) and compared by Wilcoxon rank sum test. Categorical variables were expressed as number (percentage) and compared by Chi-square tests or Fisher’s exact test. To explore the risk factors associated with mortality, univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used. Considering the total number of deaths (n = 17) in our study and to avoid overfitting in the model, we excluded variables from the univariable analysis if their between-group differences were not significant and if the number of events was too small to calculate odds ratios. Therefore, we chose age, SOFA, qSOFA, ISTH-DIC score, CURB-65, lymphocyte count, and D-dimer as the seven variables for our multivariable logistic regression model. Correlations of D-dimer with clinical staging, chest CT staging, oxygenation index, and in-hospital mortality were evaluated by Kendall’s tau-b coefficient analysis. To assess the predictive value of D-dimer for mortality, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted with calculations of the area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS (v.22.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
As a designated referral center for the novel coronavirus infection, all the patients hospitalized were confirmed with RT-PCR. After excluding subjects using the exclusion criteria, we included 248 consecutive inpatients between January 28 and March 8, 2020, in the final analysis. The mean age of the 248 patients was 63.0 ± 13.4 years, ranging from 27 to 88 years. The average time from symptom onset to admission was 11.5 ± 5.1 days. Nearly one third of the patients had comorbidities, with hypertension being the most common (31.5%), followed by diabetes mellitus (17.7%). Mild to moderate cases, severe cases, and critically ill cases accounted for 36.3%, 43.5%, and 20.2% of the patients, respectively. Average length of hospital stay was 30.8 ± 12.4 days. Using the revised Geneva score, none belonged to the high probability group for risk of PE. Four patients belonged to the high probability group using the Wells’ rule. Fortunately, they were ruled out of PE/VTE by Doppler ultrasonography and CT pulmonary angiography. Seventeen patients died during hospitalization. D-dimer elevation (≥ 0.50 mg/L) was seen in 74.6% (185/248) of the patients.
Since all patients with normal D-dimer (< 0.5 mg/L) at admission survived, patients were grouped into D-dimer levels of < 1, 1–2, and > 2 mg/L in the univariable and multivariable logistic regression models (Table 1). In univariable analysis, age, SOFA score, qSOFA score, ISTH-DIC score, CURB-65, lymphocytopenia, and elevated D-dimer were associated with death. When these variables were included in the multivariable logistic regression model, D-dimer greater than 2 mg/L at admission was the only variable associated with increased odds of mortality [OR 10.17 (95% CI 1.10–94.38), P = 0.041].
The comparison of demographic and clinical characteristics between the normal D-dimer group and elevated D-dimer group are shown in Table 2. Major laboratory markers and chest imaging features upon admission were recorded (Table 3). 35.5%, 31.0%, and 33.5% of the patients had affected lungs of ≤ 30%, 31–50%, and ≥ 50% of the total area. The predominant changes seen were ground glass opacity (54.0%), followed by patchy consolidation (21.4%), fibrous stripes (12.9%), and irregular consolidated nodules (11.7%). 67.7% of the patients received oxygen therapy, including nasal cannula/face mask (52.0%), non-invasive mechanical ventilation (10.5%), invasive mechanical ventilation (5.2%), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in one patient. Anticoagulation therapy was prescribed in 34.3% of the cases.
The distributions of D-dimer levels among patients with different clinical staging, chest CT staging, and who survived and deceased during hospitalization are presented in Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4. On admission, D-dimer levels significantly increased with increasing severity of COVID-19 as determined by clinical staging (Kendall’s tau-b = 0.374, P = 0.000), chest CT staging (Kendall’s tau-b = 0.378, P = 0.000), and oxygenation index (Kendall’s tau-b = 0.392, P = 0.000). Median D-dimer levels showed an about 7-fold increase from moderate to critically ill patients (4.76 [2.02–13.30] mg/L versus 0.6 [0.33–1.49] mg/L, P = 0.000), a 5-fold increase from patients with ≤ 30% affected lung area to ≥ 50% change (3.93 [1.28–12.31] mg/L versus 0.6 [0.33–1.42], P = 0.042), and an over 9-fold increase from oxygenation index groups 1 to 4 ( 6.17 [1.75–14.20] mg/L versus 0.64 [0.46–1.39] mg/L, P = 0.000). All of those who did not survive had increased D-dimer level upon admission. When compared between patients who survived and who died during hospitalization, a significantly higher D-dimer level was detected in non-survivors versus survivors (6.21 [3.79–16.01] mg/L versus 1.02 [0.47–2.66] mg/L, P = 0047).
A 59-year-old male diagnosed with COVID-19 who presented with fever, coughing, and hemoptysis. Chest CT upon admission showing ground glass opacities and patchy consolidation (a). He had an elevated D-dimer level of 9.43 mg/L. Wells’ score, Geneva score, and CURB65 score were 7, 7, and 2 respectively. Wells’ score suggested high probability of pulmonary embolism. CT pulmonary angiography (b, c) and Doppler ultrasonography (d) were then carried out and ruled out pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities
ROC analysis identified D-dimer > 2.14 mg/L upon admission as the optimal cutoff level to discriminate survivors from non-survivors (area under the ROC 0.85, standard error 0.037; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77–0.92, P = 0.000; Fig. 5). 32.7% of the included patients had a D-dimer of > 2.14 mg/L. For predicting in-hospital mortality, D-dimer level above 2.14 mg/L had a sensitivity of 88.2% and specificity of 71.3% (Table 4).
Discussion
We demonstrated that in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, D-dimer elevation upon admission was common and was associated with both increased disease severity and in-hospital mortality. D-dimers are one of the fragments produced when plasmin cleaves fibrin to break down clots. The assays are routinely used as part of a diagnostic algorithm to exclude the diagnosis of thrombosis. However, any pathologic or non-pathologic process that increases fibrin production or breakdown also increases plasma D-dimer levels [13]. Examples include deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and conditions such as pregnancy, inflammation, cancer, chronic liver diseases, post trauma and surgery status, and vasculitis. Among adults admitted to the emergency room, infections, instead of VTE/PE, are the most common reason for D-dimer elevation [14]. In the present study, no patient had confirmed PE/DVT, which supports the application of D-dimer in COVID-19 not just as a diagnostic tool for thromboembolism. In addition, only three patients in the elevated D-dimer group (3/185, 1.6%) with D-dimer levels of 42.8 mg/L, 89.0 mg/L, and 71.0 mg/L had ISTH-DIC scores of ≥ 5, which is laboratory evidence compatible with overt DIC. Thus, the majority of the included patients with D-dimer elevation in our study did not have overt DIC. Due to the retrospective nature of the study and small number of patients with ISTH-DIC score consistent with overt DIC, it is difficult to tell from our data if D-dimer elevation is related with DIC.
Several studies have shown that D-dimer levels are associated with severity of community-acquired pneumonia and clinical outcome [7, 15]. However, D-dimer has not been used as a biomarker for viral pneumonia [16, 17]. Though D-dimer elevation has been observed in articles describing the clinical features of COVID-19, whether the level of D-dimer is a marker of severity has not been examined.
In the present study, there is a significant correlation between D-dimer levels and disease severity stratified by the area of affected lungs on chest CT, oxygenation index, as well as clinical staging according to the interim guideline. In addition, a higher percentage of D-dimer elevation was seen in the present study than previously reported [2, 5]. This may be due to the higher percentage of severe/critically ill cases referred to our hospital, which is another demonstration of the correlation between D-dimer level and disease severity. This suggests that the assay may be used early as a marker of severity before chest CT scans or as a complement to CT and clinical staging.
In-hospital mortality was also associated with increased D-dimer levels, suggesting that the assay may be used as a single useful biomarker for clinical outcome in patients with COVID-19. Zhou et al. reported that D-dimer > 1 μg/ml is a risk for mortality [6]. The study objective, design, population, and statistical analysis of Zhou’s study and those of ours are different. Zhou’s study was a retrospective cohort study to describe risk factors for mortality and clinical course, which included patients who had been discharged or had died by January 31, 2020. The mortality rate was higher compared to that in our study (28.3% vs. 6.9%). To explore risk factor for mortality, Zhou et al. chose age, coronary heart disease, SOFA score, lymphocyte, and D-dimer as variables for multivariable logistic regression model. D-dimer was defined as a categorical variable in the analysis, and levels of ≤ 0.5 μg/L, > 0.5 to ≤ 1 μg/L, and > 1 μg/L were chosen. The laboratory method for D-dimer assay was not described. In the present case control study, we focused on the predictive value of D-dimer for in-hospital deaths using receiver operating characteristic analysis. In the analysis, D-dimer is defined as a continuous variable. Testing used immunoturbidimetric assay with reference range of 0–0.50 mg/L (Sysmex, CS5100). Despite the differences in study design and analysis, the findings and conclusions of the two studies are not inconsistent. Zhou et al. concluded that the potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and D-dimer greater than 1 μg/L (instead of levels of ≤ 0.5 μg/L, or > 0.5 to ≤ 1 μg/L) could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis. We found that when using the cutoff value of 2.14, D-dimer levels upon admission for in-hospital mortality has an AUC of 0.846. The sensitivity and specificity are 88.2% and 71.3%, respectively. The findings of this present study suggest that an elevated D-dimer level on admission (> 2.14 mg/L) may identify patients at higher risk for in-hospital mortality and therefore inform physicians about suitable candidates for intensive care and early intervention.
It is worth noting that the findings suggest associations between D-dimer levels and disease severity and mortality only. Evidence is still lacking as to the causal mechanisms and whether the associations are specific effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection or are consequences of systemic inflammatory response. In SARS-COV-2 infection, dysregulation of coagulation/anti-coagulation cascades results in worsening lung pathology [18]. In influenza, the pathogenesis by augmenting viral replication and immune pathogenesis can be attributed to an aberrant coagulation system, including both the cellular and protein components [19]. The pathological features of COVID-19 include diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation, pulmonary edema with hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, dominated by lymphocytes, which greatly resemble those seen in SARS and MERS coronavirus infection [20, 21]. Presumably, the observed D-dimer elevation signify a hyperfibrinolysis state and increased inflammatory burden induced in SARS-COV-2 infection. In our logistic regression model to estimate risk factors associated with mortality, systematic anticoagulation therapy was not significantly associated with reduced risk of mortality. However, in a recent observational study including 2773 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, Paranjpe et al. found that treatment dose anticoagulant was associated with a reduced risk of mortality, especially among patients who required mechanical ventilation [22]. And longer duration of treatment was associated with a reduced risk of mortality (adjusted HR of 0.86 per day, 95% CI 0.82–0.89, p < 0.001). Whether anticoagulation therapy confers a survival benefit in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 needs further research with prospective randomized trials. Currently, the potential benefits need to be weighed against risk of bleeding.
This study has some limitations. First, the current study was done in a single center. The overall mortality (6.9%) was lower compared with that reported in other studies done in Wuhan [2, 6] and considerably higher than those reported by other provinces [5, 23]. Further researches may be needed when extrapolated to wider patient population. Second, the study is retrospective in nature. The patients included were not systematically assessed for the presence of PE/DVT but only when clinically suspected. Third, we did not look into the value of serial D-dimer monitoring in assessing COVID-19 patients.
Conclusions
In conclusion, D-dimer levels are commonly elevated in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Significantly higher levels are found in those with critical illness and may be used as a prognostic marker for in-hospital mortality.

This page is designed to help you create an e-dealing process document for your firm. It aims to help you identify the process decisions your firm will need to make before, during and after you complete an e-dealing transaction.
On this page:
Before e-dealing transactions commence
- Preparation and Certify & Sign roles. You will need to decide who will be designated to prepare the instruments and who will be authorised to certify and sign e-dealing transactions within your firm. You may initially decide that only partners can certify and sign. You may also want to delegate the Certify & Sign process to non-partners including staff solicitors, senior associates and senior solicitors. See Managing Sign-off Risk for more information.
- Storage of Digital Certificates, passwords and passphrases. Your firm will need to decide how you will store your Digital Certificates for disaster recovery purposes. You may also like to consider how you will manage transferring Digital Certificates of staff who leave to work at another firm. Other considerations include how you will store passwords and passphrases. You may need to set up a security policy.
During e-dealing
Following an approach from the client, there are five main steps in the e-dealing transaction process (as outlined in the diagram below).
Within these five steps, there are a number of process decisions your firm will need to take into consideration.
- Completion of Authority and Instruction (A&I) forms. Your firm can customise the three A&I forms as long as you adhere to Guideline M of the PLS Guidelines November 2019. You should decide on the process you will adopt for the witnessing of A&I forms (taking into account the requirements of the Authority and Identity Requirements for E-Dealing Guideline 2018 – LINZG20775).
You can also file the client's proof of identity for future transactions as long as their proof of identity is still valid.
See A&I forms for more information.
- Completing the e-dealing transaction. To ensure you have everything you need to complete the e-dealing transaction, your firm may like to use the checklists prepared by LINZ and the Property Law Section (PLS) available from the PLS website. These will help you make sure the right forms, documents and attachments are prepared and annexed to the e-dealing for certification purposes.
To download the checklists, visit Property Law Section New Zealand Law Society
- Certifying and Signing the e-dealing. For more information, see Managing Sign-off Risk.
- Arranging Settlement of the transaction. Your firm should consider what it will do if Landonline is down on settlement day. There are a number of things you can do to mitigate the risks of Landonline being unavailable when you need to settle. For more information, see How to settle when Landonline is unavailable.
- Releasing and Submitting the e-dealing. Your firm may wish to have a policy around evidence of registration.
For more information, refer to the PLS Guidelines.
Once the e-dealing transaction is completed
- Storage of A&I forms. The statutory requirement is that A&I forms be retained for 10 years. It is best to store A&I forms in a way that is consistent with your other filing systems and is easily accessible for compliance review. If you are already set up to scan your files and store them electronically then that option could be also used for A&I forms. For more information, see A&I forms and Guideline P of the PLS Guidelines November 2019.
- Other compliance matters. Your firm will need to consider how you will manage your documentation so that you are prepared for compliance reviews. For more information, see Compliance review and evidentiary requirements.
Last Updated: 1 September 2020Hungary, Russia to cooperate more closely in heavy industry
Hungary and Russia will form closer cooperation in heavy industry developments in technology-intensive sectors, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó said on Thursday in Budapest after meeting with Russian Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov, Hungarian news agency MTI reported today.
Hungarian and Russian companies are encouraged to participate jointly in tenders in third countries, Szijjártó said. The minister noted a partnership between Hungarian and Russian companies to bid for a carriage contract from Egyptʼs state railways. A decision has not yet been taken on the order, thus an offer by Magyar Eximbank to finance the purchase has been extended, he added.
Earlier, Szijjártó said the carriage order was worth EUR 600-700 million.
Szijjártó said on Thursday that the sides had agreed on continuing Hungaryʼs and Russiaʼs cooperation in the area of space research. He also noted the success of Hungarian farm technology investments in Russia and spoke about incentives for the construction of Hungarian water management systems in the country.
The minister mentioned a EUR 20 mln investment last year in Hungarian steelmaker Dunaferr and said capital expenditures this year would top that amount.
Fielding a question, Szijjártó said sanctions against Russia had failed, politically and economically, and had hurt not just Russia but Europe.
"The best thing to do would be to lift the sanctions," he said.
Because of the sanctions, Hungary has written off USD 6.7 bln in exports to Russia over the past three years, Szijjártó said, an amount he said the government wants to make up in the long.San Miguel forward Arwind Santos is confident that even at 37, he can still keep up with some of the world's finest basketball players today.
Santos, who was part of the Gilas pool revealed on Tursday, said he is accepting the challenge in trying to earn a spot in the final 12 of the national team.
"Of course, I'm happy to be selected to the pool by coach Yeng (Guiao), who is my godfather. This is a great opportunity to play for the national team again," Santos told ESPN5.
Santos' last stint with the national stint came in 2009 during the FIBA Asia men's championships, which was incidentally handled by Yeng Guiao as well.
The national squad, then known as the Powerade Team Pilipinas, placed eighth in Tianjin, China.
Santos, a 12-year PBA veteran, continues to be a consistent contributor for the Beermen's title hunt in the 2018 Governors' Cup with averages of 13.18 points and 3.91 rebounds in over 26 minutes of play.
While there are a lot of younger players in the pool, Santos insists he's ready to fight for his slot in the final 12 and believes he can live up to the "puso" battle cry of Gilas.
"We know that Filipinos are known for their big, fighting heart. It's still 'puso', that's the no. 1 battle cry, and for me, I'll fight for my spot because this is a rare chance for me to represent the country again so I will give my very best," he said.
Aside from Santos, four other SMB players were named to the pool, such as four-time PBA MVP June Mar Fajardo, Alex Cabagnot, Marcio Lassiter and Christian Standhardinger, who is one of two naturalized players.
Completing the 20-man pool are Paul Lee, Stanley Pringle, Scottie Thompson, Gabe Norwood, Japeth Aguilar, Beau Belga, JP Erram, Ian Sangalang, Jayson Castro, Matthew Wright, Greg Slaughter and Troy Rosario.
Gilas cadets Ricci Rivero and Kai Sotto were also named to the pool.
Gilas Pilipinas will play two home games in the fifth window of the FIBA World Cup Asian Qualifiers -- playing Kazakhstan on November 30 before facing Iran on December 3. Both games will be played at the Mall of Asia Arena.Benefits of Our Products

Let customers speak for us
Product works well. I've noticed a reductuon in stemming and a greater focus. It took about a 2 weeks before I noticed a huge difference so don't get discouraged if you don't see an immediate difference.
Our child is a picky eater (borderline troubled eater) and this supplement helps give them the vitamins they’re not getting from foods they’re not ready to eat yet. We hide it in their drink and they don’t even notice. We highly recommend it.
When our autistic child is having a hard time calming down or focusing, this product works within minutes to help. We put this in our child’s drink every day before school and it helps so much! We highly recommend it.
Ever since we started giving this probiotic to our child on the autism spectrum we’ve noticed a great decline in sick days. So thankful we found this company.
I have been using the product for the past three weeks with my son and found that his tantrums have lessened. He is also less agitated and calmer. Overall, he is a more pleasant child, smiling and playful. I will definitely order again. Thank you!
Love the product, have two grandsons that are both autistic. The little one was having meltdowns everyday. Since using product he is more at peace, so is grandma. Thankful for your products.
A must in our daily supplement routine. My daughter has less meltdowns and is super happy most of the time. Love your products!!!! I’ve been a loyal customer for 4 years.
Great products, his speech has greatly improved within days of taking this products. About to order more and I wish they can provide freeshipping for over $250 worth of items.
I was skeptical about ordering this product even after reading the reviews. After receiving the product and using it with hopes it would help my grandson, I am now a believer in the product. My grandson is much more calmer and is doing much better in school with staying focused. His teacher even commented on the change. I will be ordering another bottle real soon.
Have been using the product for about 2 weeks in his orange juice and I havent really noticed a difference.
I am a huge fan of this probiotic. My child is sick less frequently. I have noticed less stimming and that he is just happier overall. I recently switched to another brand and immediately noticed an increase in stimming and irritability, so I switched back and my child is happy again. This product does not dissolve well. I mix it in with lemonade and stir it using a handheld milk frother that I bought on Amazon for $12.
My son jake has been taking the multivitamin for over a month his behavior has improved a lot he is more focused and his behavior is much improved I'll be buying more
Our son was diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago and has always struggled in school. We decided to not medicate and take a more natural approach such as his nutrition. I found this a month ago and have noticed a big difference. My son finally gets great sleep and is able to take on the day in the morning! We are so thankful that we have found My Spectrum Hero’s!
After reading some negative comments about prolonged use of laxatives in children with tics, we began a search for a safe alternative for my 6-yr old nephew who struggles with constipation. He has made a smooth transition between the two products. The Fiber Balance Plus is palatable and dissolves well in a small juice and water mixture when shaken. We couldn't be more pleased with this product that is keeping our boy comfortable. Thank you.
It works. my kid used to put everything in mouth, lick everything she get. But after two weeks this is improved and almost stopped. May be it takes couple of months to improve the cognitive health. I keep on the finger crossed 🤞🏽.
Only problem with this is it’s so easily oxidized. Very hard to keep it dry. I need some helpful tips to save from moisture.Free shipping over 200USD

The organization, Goba Care, was created by Melinda Laboucan. She told Cabin Radio she wants to give “culturally safe healthcare navigation and support” to northern patients and their families.
Laboucan is from Fort Good Hope and a member of the K’ahsho Got’ine First Nation. She said the idea for Goba Care came from personal experience.
She lost her mother to cancer in 2011 and her sister to pneumonia less than two years later. She had served as the primary caregiver for both, accompanying them on medical travel across the territory and Alberta, then providing palliative care at home.
“I’ve seen, I’ve felt, and I went through all the gaps that we all fall through,” Laboucan said.
Helping her mother and sister while they travelled for treatment was a difficult experience, she said, describing little support for family members and escorts in Edmonton. So much of her time at home was spent caring for them that she felt unable to properly grieve her loss.
“It was just so devastating,” she said.
“I was always very passionate about what support we needed back then, and how I can help other people. If anybody has gone through what we’ve gone through as a family, I want to be able to help.”
Laboucan said she began working in Fort Good Hope to support residents diagnosed with cancer, hosting sharing circles for patients and survivors, fundraising to cover medical expenses, and taking people on the land to heal mentally and spiritually.
Now having moved with her family to Edmonton in 2018, Laboucan’s new venture will continue that work. Services will be free of charge, she said, with Goba Care funded through donations and support from NWT research support group Hotıì ts’eeda.
The word “goba” means light on the horizon in the K’ahsho Got’ine language. Laboucan said she sees her non-profit as “a light that helps guide through new places, services, and cultural differences.”
She will attend appointments with patients, serve as a point of contact for people travelling to the city, connect people to health services, and offer in-person and virtual support for families dealing with illness and end-of-life care.
“Once Covid restrictions lift, I’ll be able to be right beside them,” Laboucan said of her clients. “If anybody comes down here for cancer treatment, cancer diagnosis or results, or any other medical care that they need, I will be here.
“It’s not only for the patient, but for the medical escort, too. And this is not focused just on cancer, it’s for any other patient that’s coming down here, from diagnostics to surgery.”
‘Extremely stressful’
Florence Burnaby is an Elder from Fort Good Hope. She has experiences of lymphoma – cancer of the lymph nodes – and received support from Laboucan, who would visit her and keep her company.
Burnaby said the sharing circles were the most helpful thing.
“You don’t feel alone,” she said. “There are other people out there that are going through what I’m going through. I couldn’t wait for them.”
Laboucan eventually hopes to host online sharing circles through Goba Care. She plans to develop resources in Indigenous languages and has been assembling free care kits with traditional Dene medicines.
“Research has shown that medical travel is an extremely stressful process,” Laboucan said. “Despite ongoing efforts to improve the experience, people still feel unprepared and overwhelmed.
“But you come down here, you see a familiar face – which is me – and right away, you feel … OK being in the big city. You have somebody who is from the North, who gets it, and who knows a lot of supports down here in Edmonton, so a lot of that stress is lifted off. It leads to good health outcomes.”
The NWT Health and Social Services Authority’s annual report states 15,141 patients travelled for medical purposes in the 2019-20 financial year, both within the NWT and down to Alberta.
Dr Sarah Cook has been a practising physician in the NWT for 13 years. Formerly the territory’s medical director, she also acts as the clinical lead for Choosing Wisely NWT, the local chapter of a national organization that aims to reduce unnecessary medical tests and treatments.
Over the years, Dr Cook has observed the challenges medical travel can present.
“Sometimes, it may be that someone needs an interpreter that may not be available,” she said.
“Sometimes, it’s just the challenge of going to an entirely new place without necessarily having a lot of comfort navigating that place and figuring out how to get to your appointment.”
Health authority ‘welcomes innovation’
David Maguire, a spokesperson for the territory’s authority, told Cabin Radio in an email the authority recognizes “there is room for innovation in the health and social services sector from private businesses and the not-for-profit sector.”
However, Maguire said that doesn’t necessarily point to a gap in the NWT’s healthcare system.
“We work very hard to layer our supports for patients throughout their care journey,” Maguire wrote, “but we also recognize that people may wish for a more individualized support experience than our programs are able to provide.
“There are external services that add value to the health and social services landscape … we welcome innovation and opportunities to understand and recognize successes of organizations that create services that may take a differing approach than our broad, system-level care and service offerings.”
For Cook, bringing care closer to home in the NWT communities is the best solution. It cuts costs and allows more holistic treatment.
However, when at-home care isn’t possible and medical travel is necessary, she said better supports are needed for travelling patients.
“It’s challenging for anyone living in rural Canada,” Cook said. “Having to travel to bigger centres, out of your comfort zone, away from the people who are supporting you is not just daunting, but can actually have an impact on your health, because it’s going to impact the decisions that you make.
“I have seen, in my practice, examples of this. People will have an experience where they feel very, very uncomfortable, and they will decide not to go back for necessary follow-up care because they either didn’t feel comfortable or it wasn’t culturally safe.
“Melinda has identified, through her own personal experience and her very close connection with communities in Northwest Territories, an opportunity to really improve the experience people have when they’re traveling to Edmonton for care. I think anything we can do to improve that experience is going to be positive.”To obtain documents, log on:

Dust of Snow: Analysis
In “Dust of Snow” as well, the landscape of New England is beautifully portrayed by the poet, and it is an important element of the poem as a whole. Winters in New England are harsh. Because there are adequate heating facilities indoors, one prefers to stay at home rather than outside in the excruciatingly cold weather. However, sometimes unavoidable circumstances arise in which one must go out no matter how unwilling one is. Perhaps the poet was having such a day when he had composed this poem.
As he tells us in the poem, he had not been looking forward to that day, and the day was not turning out any better than he had expected either. He had thought to himself that the day would, in fact, be going to waste. Perhaps the region was very heavily snowed in that day, and the poet could not do the work he had set out to do. In any case, his mood was pretty bad as he was walking by a wooded area. In that area, hemlock trees were going. As any student of English literature will know. As the poet himself must have had in his mind as well, hemlock is the name of the poison used to kill the eminent scholar known as Socrates, whose name we find mentioned in the works of his most illustrious student Plato. Hence, the hemlock tree is generally considered to be an ill omen as it is a symbol of death. The sight of the hemlock trees could not have cheered the poet up on its own. Perhaps he didn’t even want to walk by the hemlock trees.
However, this all changed with the actions of a crow. This crow had been flying around, and suddenly it decided to alight on a branch of one of the hemlock trees. Because of this sudden motion, the snowflakes that had been amassed on the branches of the hemlock tree rained down on the poet. The snowflakes were light and also a pleasant sight for sore eyes. Hence, their fall did not hurt the poet. In fact, the poet felt as if he was walking through the light precipitation of snowfall. As those who have experienced snowfall will say, this is a delightful experience.
It was so for the poet as well. Immediately his bad mood was uplifted. He was filled with joy and a sense of thankfulness that he was alive to see such beautiful things in this world. Frost’s greatness lies in the fact that he can effectively convey to us readers how such a simple thing as the falling of snowflakes from atop a tree can have a rejuvenating effect on man’s mind. His depiction of this experience is compelling, and it also fills readers with a sense of tranquillity.
Dust of Snow: Poetic Devices
Rhyme scheme:
Each of the two stanzas in “Dust of Snow” follows the same simple rhyme scheme: ABAB. Only one imperfect rhyme occurs in this poem between the “crow” of the 1st line and the “snow” of the 3rd line, both in the 1st stanza.
Rhetorical devices:
Metaphor: This rhetorical device is used when a covert comparison is made between two different things or ideas. In this poem, the poet uses metaphor in the 3rd line of the 1st stanza when he compares the mass of snowflakes atop the hemlock tree with dust.
Synecdoche: This rhetorical device is used in many ways to represent one thing with the help of an entirely different one. In this poem, the poet uses the device of synecdoche by way of using a part to represent the whole in the 1st line of the 2nd stanza. He says that his “heart” has changed mood because the crow has made the snowflakes from the hemlock tree rain down on him. However, it is not only his heart but his entire person that is now experiencing a better mood as a result of the actions of the crow.
Dust of Snow: Central Idea
On a winter’s day, the poet had been forced to step out of his house and walk around to accomplish some task or the other. He had been unable to complete his work, so he believed that that particular day would waste. His mood had become sullen and despairing. Suddenly, as he was walking by a wooded area full of hemlock trees, a cow alighted on a branch of one of those trees, causing the mass of snowflakes atop it to rain down on the poet. The snowflakes were so light and minuscule that the poet thought they resembled dust particles more than anything else. However, this raining down of snowflakes upon him did not upset the poet further. In fact, quite the opposite happened. His mood immediately improved, and he was cheered up. He felt joy and thankfulness to be alive on such a beautiful day.
Dust of Snow: Theme
The landscape of New England: The poetry of Robert Frost often features the landscape of his home, that is, New England. A part of this landscape is quite hilly and covered by coniferous trees such as the hemlock. During the winter, the weather conditions there are very harsh. It is an unpleasant experience to have to step out of the house and into the cold outside. However, the snow is also beautiful to watch. Hence, life in New England has both positive and negative aspects. This is echoed in the two moods of the poet that we see in this poem. When he is unable to finish his work on a heavily snowed-in day, it upsets him. However, his mood immediately improves when the light, tiny and immaculate snowflakes shower down on him from the hemlock tree branches. Similarly, life in New England is both harsh and beautiful.
Symbolism: The symbolism in this poem is very subtle and hard to catch. However, if we read between the lines, we will understand just how apt the symbols used by the poet here are. The poet is having a bad day. He is clear about that. However, to make us understand the severity of his sullen mood, he introduces us to the symbol of the hemlock tree. As we know, hemlock is the name of the poison that was used to kill Socrates. Hence, from which the poison is said to be made, the hemlock tree is a symbol of death. Walking by the hemlock tree could, in fact, have seemed like an ill omen to the poet and could have upset him further on this unpleasant day. The next symbol that the poet introduces to us is that of the crow. The crow is an ambiguous symbol and could stand for many things. Generally, the crow is considered to be the ugliest among all birds. Hence, it could be another sight to degrade the poet’s mood once again. However, in some indigenous literature, such as Native American literature, the crow symbolizes a trickster. Crows are pretty mischievous birds, and the crow in this poem is no exception. It’s sudden alighting on the branch of a hemlock tree is what causes the poet to be surprised by the shower of snowflakes on himself. And this shower of snow certainly improves his mood. Perhaps the poet is saying that even something that one usually associates with negativity can positively impact. Hence, Frost’s use of symbols is very profound and meaningful.
The best things in life are free: As a popular song tells us, the best things in life are free. Frost is one poet who has advocated this very concept throughout his entire poetic career. In “Dust of Snow” as well, this is what he is trying to tell us. On a cold winter’s day, staying home could have been comfortable. But due to unavoidable circumstances, the poet has been forced to go out. At such a time, the only thing that cheers him up is the world of nature, of crows and snowflakes. This natural world is available for us to see and touch-free of cost. However, we generally take it for granted. Worse still, we can curse nature for giving us bad weather, such as the inhabitants of New England do in winter. However, if we look beyond our own inconvenience, we will see that nature is beautiful even at its harshest. If only we pay attention to all that life gives us, we will learn to appreciate it. The crow brings the beauty of the snowflakes to the poet’s attention, and he is grateful for that. He is grateful to be alive to see such wonderful sights in this world at no cost whatsoever to himself.
Dust of Snow: Tone
The tone of “Dust of Snow” is light and cheerful. It reflects the change that has already taken place in the poet’s heart from sullen to joyful after the shower of snowflakes upon himself. It is thus clear that this poem has been written post that experience. The poet has almost forgotten what a bad day he had been having and has fully embraced the brightening of his mood. He now feels lucky to be alive and watch such beautiful sights as that of the snowfall.
“Dust of Snow” is one of the shortest poems ever written by Robert Frost. Yet, it is also one of his most loved poems. What is great about the poem is that the poet can express, with such brevity, how thankful he is to be living among the hills and snows of New England. This love for one’s home is something that resonates with all his readers.

Many on the left say this isn’t enough and are calling on Franken to resign from office. This New York Times op-ed contends that if Franken doesn’t resign, other women who’ve faced sexual harassment might hesitate to come forward and that democrats must keep riding the current movement for accountability.
Others are defending Franken for his track record on women’s issues, saying calling for his resignation wouldn’t be politically pragmatic and would set a bad precedent for future democratic politicians whose misconduct comes to light. In this Washington Post op-ed, the author argues that it’s better to create a pathway to reform and keep a liberal in office than to oust them and leave a gap for a Republican who would vote against women’s interests.
Meanwhile Republican Roy Moore is denying mounting allegations of sexual harassment and assault of minors against a background of mixed GOP reactions, ranging from calls for him to drop out of the U.S. senate race by GOP leaders such as Mitch McConnell and continued support from the Alabama Republican Party.
While these are different situations with different facts, both Moore and Franken present a pragmatic challenge to their respective parties – to remove them from their political positions or to keep them in power so they can continue representing their respective party values; personal values versus political ones.
So what is to the greater benefit to each party? What will this mean for the national conversation about accountability for sexual harassers? And which is the more pragmatic route?

Join millions of professionals switching to Smartsheet
Smartsheet is an online, collaborative work execution platform that is better than Trello in scalability, reporting, support, security, and price. Start a free 30-day trial and see why 96% of customers recommend Smartsheet to colleagues.
Better scalability
Multiple views to track important work
Smartsheet not only includes a Kanban view, but also has Gantt and grid views, reports, dashboards, forms, process automation, and activity logs to help you execute all types of work.
Trello is a lightweight Kanban tool that works for managing simple tasks but has limitations when solving for a broad range of work.
Smartsheet met our needs for a platform that would serve the whole company, including support of BYOD and mobility for employees. We've also proven that you don't always need a large-scale project management system. A spreadsheet-based system becomes powerful because it is easy for employees to use.
Better reporting
Edit Smartsheet dashboards with drag and drop widgets
You can collect data using simple online forms and then roll it up across Smartsheet items using reports and dashboards.
You can only track pre-set categories in Trello and it lacks the capability to provide reporting across boards.
It's been a tremendous help for me when I'm reporting to the executive team. I can easily show the task lists that demonstrate that the team has thought through every detail for each event. Plus anyone on the management team can drill down, and view documents at any time if they want to find out what we're doing.
More support
Smartsheet offers world-class support
Our world-class services team can help you create customized solutions to complex business problems.
Trello does not provide any services or consulting, and lacks customer success support. The only support available is a one-day response offering for Enterprise and Business plans.
The customer service we receive is outstanding.
Rock-solid security
Smartsheet has tools for enterprise provisioning, managing, and scaling, all while being HIPAA, SOC2, and GDPR compliant.
Trello has limited Enterprise admin features and lacks critical HIPAA or SOC2 compliance.
Affordable pricing
Smartsheet can do what Trello does and much more at a comparable price. Get unlimited sheets, reports, dashboards, and free viewers included with all plans.
A paid Trello plan is required to manage users and be used at the enterprise level.Efficient Online Transfer Learning for 3D Object Classification in Autonomous Driving

Yassine Ruichekis this you? claim profileEVANSTON, Ill. (WLS) -- Some results were in early Wednesday after voters across Illinois cast ballots in local races for Tuesday's consolidated primary election.
Daniel Biss appears to be the next mayor of Evanston. With nearly all the precincts counted, he has more than 73% of the vote, defeating Lori Keenan. Evanston incumbent Steve Hagerty did not run for reelection.
In Dolton, it looks like Tiffany Henyard appears to have won the primary against incumbent Mayor Riley Rogers. Community activist Andrew Holmes came in third. Robert Shaw also ran for the position.
Henyard said she's optimistic about the results and ready to get to work, if elected. She would become Dolton's first female African American mayor.
Not all communities have a consolidated primary, as it's held in jurisdictions where there's a number of filed candidates for the consolidated general election on April 6, and the primary is used to narrow the field.
Also, not all towns have seats up for this election. Residents in Cook, Lake, Kane and McHenry counties had elections Tuesday. DuPage and Will counties don't have primaries and just have the April general election. Chicago voters don't have an election until March 2022.
Some other notable races included Berwyn mayor and Calumet City mayor.

This is a major hint with regards to an upcoming price swing for Ethereum
So far, the month of October has belonged to the market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum. With the top two digital assets making inroads to new ATH’s, other coins waited in the wings to register price hikes off their own. Ethereum’s advance was in the forward direction.
A daily close above $4,000 would allow ETH to march on to newer levels after negotiating past the previous ATH at $4,380. Interestingly, RSI’s next peak along with MACD’s crossover could drop some hints as to ETH’s price trajectory. At the time of writing, ETH traded at $3,942, up by 3.5% over the last 24 hours.
ETH Daily Chart
Ethereum’s bullish-bias has been discussed at length in earlier articles. Now that its head and shoulders pattern was complete, ETH awaited an upwards breakout to unlock its potential. The 123.6% and 138.2% Fibonacci levels could be potential destinations over the coming week, with the 161.8% Fibonacci level serving as more of a long-term target.
However, there were chances of some downside which stemmed from the RSI and MACD. Firstly, overbought readings on the RSI could trigger a slight retracement before ETH embarks on a more ‘organic’ run to a new ATH. Such a development would also see the RSI snap three lower peaks within the upper zone, ranging from mid-August to late-October.
This bearish divergence would not be a promising sight right before ETH challenges a crucial price barrier at $4K. Secondly, MACD was inching close to a bearish crossover while the histogram recorded two lower peaks. While these factors were certainly not enough to overturn ETH’s bullish-outlook, they could delay ETH’s ascent over the near-term.
A rejection at $4,000 would see ETH shift back to $3,680 or even $3,500. From there, the confluence of these support lines and the 20-SMA (red) would present an ideal buy entry before the next breakout attempt. On the other hand, an instant move above $4,000 was certainly a possibility as long as the RSI bests its previous peak around 75.
Such a development would see the RSI scale to new heights within overbought territory without any fears of a reversal. Moreover, two higher peaks on the Awesome Oscillator suggested that bulls were increasing their position in the market- lending weight to an immediate breakout.
Conclusion
Since the MACD and Awesome Oscillator presented a slightly different outlook, it was uncertain whether ETH would close above $4K over the coming days. The RSI could settle the ongoing debate by managing a higher peak above 75. Expect ETH to be in overdrive once bulls are able to clear this final hurdle on the RSI.

Jaishankar on Sunday responded to tweets by several Indians abroad seeking help, signalling a continuation of his predecessor Sushma Swaraj’s social media outreach for people in distress.
Ms. Swaraj leaves a legacy of an easily-accessible External Affairs Minister who helped the diaspora through Twitter.
In a series of tweets, Mr. Jaishankar responded to calls for help by several Indians abroad, assuring them that Indians missions in respective countries were trying to address their issues.
When one Mahalakshmi tweeted seeking help to her family members whose passports were lost in Italy during a trip, Mr. Jaishankar said, “Our Embassy in Rome/ Consul General in Munich will extend all assistance. Please be in touch with them @IndiainItaly @cgmunich.”
The Minister also responded to a Twitter user’s request for help in finding her husband in Kuwait and bringing him back to India. The complainant said her husband was not responding to court summons.
To this, Mr. Jaishankar tweeted: “Our Embassy in Kuwait is already working on it. Please be in touch with them @indembkwt.”
In his first official Twitter post, Mr. Jaishankar on Saturday said he was “proud to follow on the footsteps” of Ms. Swaraj. “My first tweet. Thank you all for the best wishes! Honoured to be given this responsibility. Proud to follow on the footsteps of @SushmaSwaraj ji.”Thanks for helping support Vickie's Kitchen and Garden!

God has always had a people. The Old Testament is the story of His covenant with twelve tribes called Israel. The New Testament introduces a new covenant, inaugurated by the birth of Christ and the subsequent birth of Christ's Church. Now God has thousands of tribes in every Continent, country and zip code.
God started with twelve tribes. They were His people. He chose them and challenged them to be a holy nation. Now, with as much care and involvement as ever, He is building His Church. We are His people. He chooses us and challenges us to be a holy nation. We are the tribes of Christ (1 Peter 2.9).
What is the nature of The Church? Why are there so many local churches? What is the purpose of starting even more? Why should churches grow? How do churches grow? Where do I fit in The Church?
My goal is to shed some Bible light on these questions.
So many people that I meet are longing for something great to give their lives to. I believe The Church is the mission they're designed to advance. I hope that this series will help explain what God is doing in the world and how one local tribe in Metro Detroit fits into His plan.
Bill Hybels says the local church is the hope of the world. I tend to agree.

The first is Richard Sackler (Michael Stuhlbarg), the former President of Purdue Pharma (which created, sold, and lied about the drug OxyContin) saying in 1986 that “the time has come to redefine the nature of pain.” The next, in 2005, is at a grand jury hearing where a rural doctor, Samuel Finnix (Michael Keaton), is asked “did more than 1% of your patients become addicted to OxyContin?” He hesitates, looking up at the ceiling, unsure where to even begin. We’ve just learned, in these opening minutes, that one of the primary ways Purdue was able to convince doctors that OxyContin was safe was because it was allegedly nonaddictive. Finnix is prompted again, and he speaks: “I can’t believe how many of them are dead Finnix—a good man who deeply cares about his patients—be taken in by the lies about the drug’s safety is agonizing. But while Dopesick’s message and education is vital and often compelling, it feels like it never quite hits the right pace. The limited series format, unfortunately, does little to mitigate the feeling of watching your TV vegetables. The dense story could have used a peppy Big Short-esque treatment in movie form, or with more time and with its personal narratives built out it could have been Wire-like in its investigation of the institutions that made this horror proliferate so easily—and with such terrible consequences. Instead, Dopesick often feels a little stilted, its scripts too haphazard. There is so much to uncover, so many evils to unveil and heartbreaks to chronicle, but the distance between cause and effect among the myriad stories craves focus. Still, there are notable standouts from each wing of the show’s sprawling narrative. Keaton is incredible as Finnix, a man haunted by the drugs he dispensed that destroyed a community. An increasingly beleaguered Kaitlyn Dever shines as Betsy Mallum, a young miner battling addiction and a lack of acceptance by her family. Peter Sarsgaard and John Hoogenakker play an immensely likable pair of Virginia District Attorneys with sparkling wit, although they don’t get enough screen time; their toiling to catch Purdue and members of the Sackler family out are some of the show’s most satisfying scenes. (They also may be the only characters on TV with a twang that strong who are also portrayed as incredibly intelligent, and that’s appreciated.) Others are left cold by the scripting. Will Poulter’s pharma sales rep waffles for too long without taking a stand, and is in a draining and completely uninteresting romantic entanglement with a greedy coworker. On the flip side, Rosario Dawson as a DEA agent on the rise gets stuck with a lot of grandstanding and tropey moments for her crusading heroine (of the “my work is my life” variety). Stuhlbarg is also one-note as Richard Sackler, though it’s hardly his fault; all of the family members, along with their Purdue cronies, would be constantly twirling their mustaches if they had them—even the board rooms are accented with dark red leather and carpets, suggesting a vampiric cabal. And yet, somehow, it’s not overwrought. Evil is in full-tilt. As cartoonish as some of the portrayals are (alongside some very bad wigs), I didn’t mind the very obvious delineation between the white hats and black hats, because what Dopesick is telling us is enraging. Dopesick is heavy, but that doesn’t necessarily scare off a viewers on its own; Chernobyl, after all, became a surprise hit in that regard. But Chernobyl was also shorter and more focused. There’s a scene about midway through Dopesick where the DAs wait for a van of court-ordered copies of paperwork from Purdue to be delivered. “That’s a big truck for just a few boxes,” one quips. The door opens to reveal that not only is it full, but the driver then points to four more trucks following it. “They’re burying us in paperwork,” Sarsgaard’s character says with a tired smile. Dopesick can feel the same way. And then, just as quickly, you get a full emotional gut punch. Behind all of this paperwork and boardroom scheming and wooing of agencies, we also see the booming pill mill industry, the way OxyContin is discovered to actually alter one’s brain chemistry, how something regular people were told was safe has completely wrecked their lives. The industry of pain, one that is still thriving in this country, is the simmering constant throughout Dopesick, and it’s not one that has an end—except for those who have been demolished by it. After an overdose, a devastated parent tells a doctor that now “our girl is finally out of her pain.” It’s why, for all its faults and lulls, I wanted to keep watching. Every reveal is damning and essential. I wanted to quote all of it: the lies, the greed, the manipulations, the horror. No one who supported the Purdue side comes out looking good—particularly the FDA. Even those with good intentions were bamboozled, but there is no room for absolution here. When it comes to OxyContin, Dopesickis clear: there is only pain and reckoning. The first three episodes of Dopesick premiere Wednesday, October 13th on Hulu, with new episodes streaming weekly.

The first regular thematic radio show about people and climate in Croatia, entitled “Cuvarkuca” (meaning: the one who cares about home)
Croatia | 15 April 2021 – 31 December 2021
We have started, in collaboration with radio yammat.fm team of journalists, a thematic bi-weekly show with stories about people and climate. The immediate occasion and context of the show is the conference of parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP26 in Glasgow, on the 6th anniversary of the Climate Agreement in Paris; and the EU’s strategic determination towards climate neutrality, which is clearly stated in the European Green Plan.
A total of 18 thirty-minute shows will be aired in the period May-December 2021. The shows cover current topics and news relevant to climate action, with guest appearances and comments from experts and partners such as the Scientists for Climate Croatia as well as various expert organizations, civil society organizations and public authorities.
The concept of the show is to present in the first part a chosen climate-related specific theme as a challenge, use facts on why it’s a problem, present a range and scale of the impacts; and then to present already existing solutions or developing solutions and innovative actions, especially those driven by the citizens and personal actions. We want to activate people to take action based on good cases and examples around us (Croatia, but not only) and we want people to understand why climate change is a challenge and how everything we do is connected with the changing climate and ecosystems, affecting our everyday lives. Each show reflects or refers to current news in the area of global climate and nature policies or important events (eg. G7 summit, World Environment Day, International Day of Biodiversity, Oceans Day, Single-Use Plastics EU Directive etc.)
Cuvarkuca radio show is a joint collaboration lead by NGO Terra Hub and yammat.fm radio, NGO Tatavaka, Scientists for Climate Croatia and with several embassies in Croatia (Sweden, Netherlands, Swiss, UK, France). We work together to present relevant good practices, experiences, views and trends from their countries. The program is supported by Terra Hub partners – EIT Climate-KIC and the European Climate Foundation.
More info & Social Media
Editor’s Note: All information published as submitted by the author(s). Minor edits may have been made to increase readability and understanding.Using social media is amongst the most common online activities of the modern day young person. The likes of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and many more all contribute to the billions of hours collectively spent via computers and mobile devices, with online gaming quickly following on the heels of the more popular social media portals.\r\n\r\nAny site or portal where some form of social interaction occurs can be classed as social media, so even if you don\u2019t allow your children access to Facebook et al, there\u2019s still a chance they\u2019re in contact via gaming or an app of some description: YouTube, blogs and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReports from the American Academy of Paediatrics has found that using social media does provide benefits for young people. According to findings, regular use of social media platforms enhances communication, social connections and technical skills. Not only that, it allows young people to connect with extended family members and friends they won\u2019t see for perhaps years at a time, as they live in places they\u2019re not likely to visit. Depending on the content, social media can help a young person develop better perspectives on various issues in the media and when talked about with an adult, they can begin to form their own opinions, an impressive stage in a young person\u2019s life.\r\n\r\nIn some ways social media can help a young person express their inner feelings and encourages freedom of thought and engagement with similar age people. There\u2019s potential for a young person to learn new things, whether that\u2019s simple life hacks or discovering someone\u2019s job role. All in all, it adds up, on paper at least, to a positive experience that can greatly help a young person grow and help them form a more mature understanding of the world around them; something we didn\u2019t have before the Internet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSadly, with every positive aspect there are several negatives. Whilst the effects of social media on a child can be for good, they are mostly overshadowed by the popular negative aspects that ultimately rise to the surface. The sheer vastness of social media is one of the main causes for such negativity. Due to its freedom and limitless potential, there\u2019s no definable control on the scope of information. Yes, the social media platform can apply rules, filters and restrictions but these seem to be far too easily bypassed, and to some degree worthless in the end.\r\n\r\nCyber bullying is rife on social media. From threats made to young people, to digs at their appearance and body shaming, it\u2019s a platform that has quickly devolved into a pit of despair and depression for some unfortunate youngsters. This can lead, in extreme cases, to fatal consequences but generally the collective term for the negativity plied upon the youth of today is \u2018Facebook Depression\u2019.\r\n\r\nIn recent months, the Royal Society for Public Health together with the Young Health Movement released a survey that revealed Instagram to have the negative impact on a young person\u2019s mental wellbeing, accusing the media platform of deepening young people\u2019s feelings of inadequacy and anxiety. It\u2019s a disturbing fact that on top of the pressures of school or college life, young people are having to put themselves through the mill whilst simply sitting in front of a screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMental health is a major concern amongst young people but social media also presents its darker side through online grooming, potential radicalisation and the spread of malware. Each of these will greatly affect a young person and can lead to higher levels of anxiety, depression and withdrawal. For example, the spread of malware may not sound too negative on the wellbeing of a young person but put yourself in the place of the child who has unwittingly executed some form of malware on the family computer or the school network. The negative emotional effects from this happening can be huge to someone whose immaturity can\u2019t deal with the aftereffects.\r\n\r\nThe safety side of social media and children comes in many forms then. Mental health concerns, access to inappropriate content, Internet borne digital threats, bullying, grooming, loneliness and body image. Where it\u2019s easy to point out the risks of Internet stranger danger, it\u2019s not always easy to cover what happens should someone post edited and manipulated images of a young person to social media.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the pressure on parents and guardians is just as immense, when helping our young people navigate the digital wild west frontier that is social media.\r\n\r\nFind more guides like this in...\r\nBy: John M Jerva
I wonder what this newer generation thinks of when they watch an action movie from the 80’s. I’m sure there are those politically correct morons out there that totally miss what the film is going for and then proceed to try to cancel it because, you know, they know what’s good for us. I feel sorry for youngsters nowadays as they truly missed out on one of the greatest decades of action cinema.
Most people know actor Martin Kove as the deliciously unstable karate Sensei from The Karate Kid films as well as the new hit show Cobra Kai. Kove’s character of John Kreese just oozed slime and unbalanced rage and it’s that role that sort of pigeon holed him into playing villains throughout his career. Let’s not forget that he left John J. Rambo hanging out to dry in Rambo: First Blood Part II and even got to turn in a unscrupulous turn in the Cirio H. Santiago helmed Firehawk.
But there was a time boys and girls when Kove was almost an action star and to this day I view it as one huge missed opportunity for fans like myself. Sure he’s gone on to play some decent roles in later flicks but in 1987, he was the pinnacle of 80’s action hero bravado.
I give you defense exhibit A in the form of the over the top actioner Steele Justice. In the movie, Kove checks all the boxes that one needs to excel in action hero bad assery as he stars as John Steele. Yep once again we have an action hero named John. Love that name. Steele is one bad ass Tunnel Rat fighting the war in Vietnam during the end of the conflict and along with his South Vietnamese ally Lee, Steele runs one last mission before our forces pull out.
Unfortunately, the last mission is with supposed ally General Bon Soong Kwan (the late, great Soon-Tek Oh) who is the biggest weasel in the South Vietnamese army. Kwan makes it his sole purpose to betray Steele and Lee and run off with a cache of stolen CIA gold thus leaving our two heroes for dead in the process.
You can’t keep a good man down however and Steele recovers from being shot multiple times to pick himself and Lee up to make it back to the rally point and puts a knife in Kwan’s chest from his cooler than cool shotgun for good measure. Steele’s superior Harry played by the late, great Joseph Campanella of No Retreat No Surrender 3: Blood Brothers fame was instructed to bring Kwan back but Steele puts a cork on that idea.
Fast forward to present day L.A. in 1987 and Lee is a member of the police department’s Asian Task Force who are after the dreaded Vietnamese Black Tiger gang. This group of criminals not only deal in drugs but they also terrorize the local Vietnamese community. Yeah, they’re bad guys alright. Little do the cops know that the Black Tiger gang is run by Kwan and his equally ruthless son Pham (Peter Kwong). Kwan may be a philanthropist by day but he’s really a snake in the grass like he was back in the war.
Steele is having a hard time readjusting to civilian life and unfortunately has proceeded to spend his days losing jobs and drinking himself into oblivion while pinning for his ex-wife played by Sela Ward. Steele was a cop at one time but that didn’t work outdo he’s an action movie cliche as our story starts out.
Just as Steele is reunited with Lee and his family, Lee is brutally murdered along with his wife and grandmother leaving only his daughter Cami (Jan Gan Boyd) alive. Steele breaks out into hero mode of course and manages to take a few of the gang members out but it is unfortunately too late. Now Steele must clean up his act, protect Cami and bring down Kwan, Pham and the Black Tiger gang once and for all. “Steele’s back!”
I remember when I first saw Steele Justice when it hit VHS back in the day and was immediately hooked as it was an action movie right in my wheelhouse with a better than great tagline that reads “You don’t recruit John Steele, You unleash him.” Watching it today and it might seem a little dated but for fans like me, there’s nothing better than a politically incorrect action flick with Sensei Kreese as the one man army hero. I’m one of the few that feel Kove should have gotten a better break when it came to headlining action films. Steele Justice was his take on Rambo and I loved his look when he’s all tact up in gear which consisted of shotgun shells draped across his chest and arms as well as double mini Katanas strapped to his back. That’s right boys and girls, Steele just doesn’t use firepower. He also brandishes a pair of rad looking swords and he knows how to use them.
Steele Justice might take a while to get our hero back on track but once it does, it is non-stop 80’s excess with enough action and beat downs to satisfy thirsty genre peeps like myself. Kove delivers the goods and in gloriously cheesy, over the top 80’s fashion to boot.
Let’s go over the 80’s action check list with Steele Justice shall we. First of all, we have our opening action sequence where Kove’s Steele is introduced riding an awesome air boat…check. His name is John Steele and that’s simply kick ass…check. We have Soon Teck-Oh playing yet another Asian villain…check. Steele’s partner in crime is ruthlessly murdered by the baddies…check. Our hero is down and out for the first half of the movie only to right himself just in time to get his justice…check. There’s an unapologetic disregard for innocent bystander safety…check. Steele and the Black Tigers rudely interrupt a music video shoot where background dancers are mercilessly slaughtered…check. Steele trains hard to reignite his particular skill set with a glorious training montage ending with him suiting up for action in true Commando style…check. Oh did I forget that Steele has a pet snake called 3 Step that is poisonous and when bitten, the victim dies after taking three steps…check. The soundtrack is totally action 80’s greatness with synthesizers, percussion and electric guitars…oh yeah, check, check and check!
One of the best elements of Steele Justice is that veteran genre actor Ronnie Cox (Robocop) is in it and he plays Steele’s former police chief Bennett. You know all the police chiefs in other 80’s action movies that constantly yell at the hero because he has a total lack of respect for authority and constantly goes around destroying the city? Yeah not Bennett. He wants Steele to do his thing and even condones his actions for the greater good of nailing Kwan and his criminal empire. Now that’s refreshing if you ask me.
We also get the great Bernie Casey who you might remember from Street Knight with Jeff Speakman. He’s the ex-Roger Murtaugh to Steele’s Martin Riggs and he’s almost ready to retire. Uh oh, that’s not a good sign. I’d wear a bullet proof vest if I was him.
Of course, the best part of Steele Justice is the rousing finale where Steele goes all one man killing machine. This includes our hero riding an all terrain attack vehicle while spraying bad guys with countless rounds of ammunition from a mini-gun. I always wondered to this day how Steele drove the vehicle while shooting the mini-gun as he’s all by himself but that’s a plot hole I can look past because the scene is just friggin’ cool.
The climax also includes Pham being introduced to 3 Step and is ceremoniously bitten and dies an agonizing death after taking…you guessed it…3 steps. There’s also the betrayal from one of Steele’s supposed confidants that you see coming a mile away.
This all culminates in the eventual showdown between Steele and Kwan where we see both men duke it out with hands, feet and swords. One pet peeve of mine is that Steele didn’t use those sweet mini Katanas more but he at least takes them out at the end to take on Kwan and gets to spin them around a bit. Or was that his stuntman? Hmmmm.
One thing missing from today’s action pics is the awesome villain kills. To this day I think Chuck Norris taking out Richard Lynch in a rocket launcher duel in Invasion U.S.A. is one of my all time faves but here we get to see Kwan blow up via grenade which is always a cool way to see the bad guy get what’s coming to him or her. There’s nothing like the 80’s when it comes to bad guy kills. Change my mind I dare you.
Of course, after all is said and done and Steele has decimated an entire criminal empire blowing up half of L.A. in the process, there are absolutely no consequences for his actions and he’s free to ride off in the sunset. In fact Bennett tries to offer him his old job back so I guess if you kill dozens of people and commit massive property damage, then the only thing left to do is hire the guy that did it.
All in all, Steele Justice is the perfect exercise in complete 80’s over the top cheesy action awesomeness. There’s bad acting, questionable actions taken by the characters, insane and authentic practical stunts and set pieces and a hero that should have died countless times before the end credits rolled. Martin Kove is a genre legend but he should have been given more opportunity to excel as a leading man of action. They don’t make them like this anymore and I don’t think I would want them too as there is a special magic to these older action flicks that could not be duplicated today.
Steele Justice is pure 80’s action bad assery and one of the best examples that this decade ruled when it came to putting these types of films out. Sure everyone remembers Rambo and Commando but for me Steele Justice was the pinnacle of B movie excellence. There’s no denying that this movie isn’t as good as the others mentioned but for fans like me, it was films like this that fed our enormous appetite for things that went boom. Most people won’t understand our love for movies like this one and I love that as I feel we are members of an elite club.

The standard of living in this city is very high in comparison to other places in the world which is an attractive draw for many. Indeed, it is thought that 43% of the island’s population were born abroad, which gives an idea of its appeal for expats.
It also has a very business friendly approach that helps attract both workers and entrepreneurs to its shores. The chance to conduct business in English, the most commonly used language on the island, makes it easier for many to move and settle in Singapore. If you are thinking of moving to this wonderful place, here’s a few things to consider.
Your children’s education
If you have a family, then the education of your children will be one of the most important things for you. Make sure you fully check all the available educational options when moving to Singapore well in advance. This will give you time not only to make an informed choice but also ensure you have time to apply.
Many ex-pats moving there look at the benefits international schools in Singapore can offer. It is very tempting for many parents because of the chance it offers a child to study for an internationally recognized qualification in a diverse, multicultural environment. Not only will it help them academically for their adult life, but it also helps them settle into their new surroundings in Singapore.
Think about what you will do for work
It may be that you are needing to find a job after you have moved or you are moving for work purposes. Either way, planning for your particular work situation before you leave is vital. The main priority is to have all the relevant VISAs and work permits in order so there are no issues when you arrive. In addition, once you have started work you will need to submit your passport and immigration card to your employer’s HR department for them to officially endorse you.
As befits such a luxurious place to live, housing costs in Singapore are high. That will probably be one of your main outgoings when you live there, so be prepared. To give you an idea, both Paris and London are cheaper to rent or buy in, so make sure you have accounted for this when considering your finances.
Cultural differences
One of the most obvious differences you will come across when making the move to this lovely city is the cultural exchange it brings. It will obviously depend on where you are coming from but be prepared for the way of life and culture to be quite different from what you are used to. Once you have arrived, it is worth taking the time to learn about the local traditions and social niceties to make the most of your experience there.
Above all – enjoy it!
Moving to a beautiful city like Singapore should be a wondrous experience so make sure you enjoy it! By doing some careful planning before you go, particularly around your children’s education, you will be able to have the most fun you can there without any unexpected problems arising.Pre-sale training

Money at 30: Money at 33
This past week I took another step toward aging out of my “Money at 30” moniker. That’s right, I’m now 33 years old. I’d call this a “milestone,” except I don’t really know of anyone who finds 33 to be a particularly notable or interesting age. Nevertheless, as I’ve done in year’s past, I figured it was only right to kick off my 34th year by discussing some of the money topics that have been on my mind lately and what some of my goals are for the months ahead.
Money at 33: My Financial Goals for This Year
Mapping our money
One of the side effects of writing a weekly finance column is that I end up encountering a lot of products and services I’d like to review. Moreover, since I want my reviews to be as in-depth, honest, and helpful as possible, I make sure to spend a fair amount of time using whatever product I’m talking about. This is easy enough when I’m just covering a new app but, in the cases where I want to review a bank account, well… you can imagine that I have quite a few to my name.
That’s why, this year, I’m making an effort to ensure that all of these accounts serve a particular purpose. Furthermore I intend to create a flow chart of sorts, dictating where our money should go to get the most out of it. Incidentally, at nearly the same time my wife and I were discussing this “money map” idea, Jim from Wallet Hacks put out an article addressing pretty much the same topic! This let me know I was definitely on the right track.
Over the weekend, my wife and I started figuring out this flow chart, starting with our main checking account and then extending to a couple of online bank accounts which have with far more attractive APYs. The next step is figuring out just how much we want to have in each account in order to maximize our earnings, while still maintaining accessibility. As luck (or clever design, I’d like to think) would have it, each of the accounts in question offers a different mix of these two aspects, thus there are reasons to use each of them.
On a somewhat related note, after spending the past year watching my credit card rewards balance grow, I realized that my strategy of waiting to earmark those funds for something fun wasn’t exactly working out. While it was a nice theory, nothing had come along that I said, “that’s what they’ll use them for!” So, with my Uber Visa cash back tally totaling $650, I decided to transfer $500 to my Discover savings account. Now, instead of letting Barclays hold that money for free, I’ll be earning 2.10% APY on it. To me, this seems like what I should be doing going forward.
Upping our investments
When I turned 31, I noted that it was time I started investing. Well, I did — but to a very small degree. To my credit, while I have used Robinhood to purchase a small portfolio of stocks, we’ve also been good about contributing to our Roth IRA, which is invested in a mutual fund. In fact I’m proud to report that we just maxed out contributions to that account for 2018 (although I still have a traditional IRA we could max out as well).
Anyway, after reading Tanja Hester’s upcoming book Work Optional (watch for my full review next Tuesday), I’ve decided to get serious about our investing efforts. Now, this isn’t to say that I’m going to become a day trader and apply my very limited technical analysis skills to time the market. Instead, we’re looking at opening a brokerage account and contributing monthly to an index fund.
I will say that I have yet to actually choose what brokerage to go with or weigh the pros and cons of different options but I do plan on getting all of that set up by, say, Q2 or so. In turn, I look forward to making investing a larger part of this column and my Money@30 site.
Reconsidering spending we take for granted
Finally, while my wife and I have always been good about looking at our spending and realizing when cuts can occur, this year I’m reconsidering a couple of things that we’d previously ignored. Topping the list: our cell phone bill. Personally I’ve been with AT&T since whenever the iPhone 3G was a thing, while previously having my decades-old phone number with the other three major carriers at one point or another as well. Having had no real issues with the company, I just continued to stick with them. However I did recently realize that this monthly bill was one of our largest. As a result it seemed that, if we really wanted to make an impact on our spending, we should start at the top.
This line of thinking brought me to investigate T-Mobile. I’ve heard for some time that they actually allowed you to use data overseas for free, which definitely appeals to me as an aspiring world traveler. Looking at their plans, it also seems that we would save on our monthly bill compared to AT&T — although not by as wide of a margin as I initially thought considering that their upgraded “One Plus” plans have some other enticing perks.
Honestly, even though the math is in favor of T-Mobile at the moment, we’re still having trouble deciding what to do. It seems that our hang up (pardon the pun) is in regards to quality. That said, is AT&T actually better or do we just believe it is because they’re more expensive? At this point, I don’t really know — but it’s been an interesting discussion to have.
By the way, next on my list after figuring out our phone bill is reassessing our car insurance. In this case it’s the perceived benefit of being loyal that’s keeping us with Geico and it’s been years since I last requested a quote from elsewhere. Frankly our car insurance bill is far from our largest monthly or annual expense but, if we can end up saving more money, shouldn’t we? That is the question…
So there you have it: my financial goals and thoughts going into this new year. Overall I feel motivated, excited, and intrigued by these topics and I hope all of this comes across in my future writings. With that, thanks as always for reading Money at 30 and Money@30 (yes, there’s a difference) — here’s to another great year.- New Boating Equipment and Supplies

I contacted Assiniboine to renovate a section of my 3-tier backyard by removing a small tree, trimming 2 shrubs, removing grass to create a walkway, a large patio and vegetable gardens. The estimator came a week later and I gave him a fixed budget to work with. He came back promptly to suggest a 25' stone walkway, a 15' x 14' patio and 2 vegetable garden areas of 10' x 4' each. He even suggested using the existing paver stones in my yard to use with new bricks for the vegetable garden border to save cost, which I thought was a great idea.
Within a week, the project manager Anka contacted me and discussed about my likes and dislikes, etc. He was able to arrange for his crew to start 3 days before the original scheduled date. On Friday, the day of construction, the crew worked tirelessly ripping up the grass by hand (because my backyard is inaccessible to machineries). Within a day, they were able to prep the area to start laying the bricks the following day. These men worked long hours through the weekend, and during that time we made some minor changes to the design and those guys were very accommodating. In the end, some of the changes resulted in less bricks used and a pallet of bricks was returned to their supplier.
The only unfortunate thing was that this wasn't communicated properly back to their HQ and when the project was completed, I was charged extra for bricks that were not used. However, the company was able to verify this situation quickly with the project manager and the revised charges were then waived without any issue. By Monday, the work was done to my satisfaction.
To be clear, they are not the cheapest landscaper if you shop around. But if you want quality work and a landscaper who sticks to the budget, then Assiniboine is worthy of consideration. Plus, they provide 2 year limited hardscape warranty pertaining to workmanship defects, which I hope I won't have to use!War on Christmas?
In 2016, then President-Elect Trump claimed that he had unearthed a sinister cabal of intellectuals and the elite to assassinate Christmas. The cunning Fox jumped on the novel idea and Bill O’Reilly, who since then left the Fox disgracefully, found merit in Trump’s crusade of holy folly and provided a platform to propagate the unhinged claims. “War on Christmas” they cried, and what started it all? The fact that some people in the US and Europe opted to greet each other with the blessing “Happy Holidays” rather than “Merry Christmas.” It is the first time in history that a so called war was declared on a…blessing?
Anyways, fast forward 4 years, and now President-Unelected Trump, once again, in one of his rants declared that the Stay-at-Home orders constitute as another assault on Christmas. Since Christ-mass is supposed to be the birthday of Christ, what would you think Jesus of Nazareth would have feel about his followers using his pseudo-birthday as a battlefield? I know, the first thing he would say, being Jewish would be something like: “Hey, what Christmas? I celebrate Hanukah.” The second thing he would probably say, might be something in the line of: “Wait, I’m not a Capricorn. So what’s the fuss about?”
In my book Cosmic Navigator, which combines Astrology and Kabbalah, I placed Jesus under the sign Aries (you can read the astro-logic argument in the book) but I was very happy to get my hands on a book called “The Star of Bethlehem,” written by Michael R. Molnar, an astronomer and former manager of the Physics Instructional Labs at Rutgers University. By combining astrology, astronomy, archeology, and history he analyzed the gospel of Matthew and other sources to suggest that Jesus was most likely born on an eclipse of Jupiter on April 17, 6BCE, which makes him a proud Aries. In my class on The Grand Conjunction (Star of Bethlehem) Dec 21, I will be explaining the conclusion in more details.
So there you have it, with my humble Aries contribution to the war effort, now we have 3 battles waging on Christmas:
1. The “Happy Holidays” bombs.
2. “Stay-at-Home Order” air strike.
3. “Jesus wasn’t even born in Christmas” commando attack.
Now, don’t get me wrong. I love Christmas and I proudly greet my neighbors with Merry Christmas and Feliz Navidad, and will continue doing so regardless of the terrible war being waged every December. Bombs and fire arms are, after all, also in the business of lighting things up, right? Since my sister in law is Colombian and lives with my brother in Israel, we have been celebrating Christmas in our family for the last decade, with the evergreen tree of gifts, and formal greetings of “Merry Christmas.”
First thing first, just to put things in order. It was Christmas who started the war to begin with. The Church attached the Nativity to the Winter Solstice about 350 years after Christ was born. Imagine you, with the help of internet, halls of records etc trying to determine the date of birth of your ancestor that lived 10 generations ago. Would be hard, no? Now think of people 2000 years ago trying to do the same impossible task.
Some might say, well, it is written in the gospel! Well, it is not. It is never mentioned when Jesus was born. In fact the nativity is shrouded in mystery. While the synoptic gospel of Luke and Matthew claim it was a Virgin Birth, Mark, the oldest gospel (written “only” 40 years after Christ died) does not mention anything about Maria being a virgin. The gospel of Matthew was written about 50-60 years after the crucifixion and only mention the fact that a star led the 3 Magi to Judea. The gospel of Luke (2:8) written a bit after Matthew states that (Luke 2:8) shepherds were tending flocs at night when Jesus was born. This would not happen in winter but possible in spring. In fact the Church Father Origen of Alexandria (c. 165–264) mocks Roman celebrations of birth anniversaries, dismissing them as “pagan.” So as you can see, a short trip down history-lane would have proven to Foxes and Trumps that the War on Christmas started before Christmas was born and by the very people who fathered Christianity.
But, that is not what I wanted to say. Sorry, I actually wished to convey another issue and that is the case for antiquity. The Winter Solstice, the longest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere and has always been a myth generating event. Astrologers call the Winter Solstice, the Gateway of the Gods and indeed many of the gods and goddesses of light were said to have been “born” on the Winter Solstice. That includes Attis, Mithra, Apollo, Artemis, and Horus just to name a few.
The ancient Persian celebration of Yalda Night, traces its roots to Zoroastrian celebration of Winter Solstice when it was believed the evil forces of darkens rule. Yalda means “birth,” and also in Hebrew Yalda means both “to give birth” as well as “a girl.” It is believed that the goddess, representing night, gives birth on the Winter Solstice to her child of light and that is why from Dec 21 the days begin to grow while the night diminishes.
Yule (Juul) is a Germanic 12 days festivity connected to the long bearded All-Father Odin, who rode his chariot in the sky tied to his eight-footed steed Sleipnir (Rudolf?) visiting people and bestowing gifts. In ancient Rome, the feast of Saturnalia took place around the Winter Solstice. The celebration included gift exchanging. Once Constantine converted to Christianity in the 4th century CE, along with him did the majority of the empire as its holidays. In addition, in the beginning of the first millennia the Roman empire was experiencing a religious tug of war between the emerging worship of Christ favored by women and the poor versus the cult of the Unconquered Sun (Sol Invictus), which was the preferred religion of the military and ruling class. In 274 C.E., the Roman emperor Aurelian established a feast of the birth of Sol Invictus, you guessed it, smack on December 25, which was at the time the Winter Solstice.
Hanukah, which would have been Jesus’ preferred celebration of light, commemorates the inauguration of the temple in Jerusalem and the miracle of a small quantity of oil that managed to light the Temple’s menorah for eight days. Hanukah is also celebrated around the Winter Solstice and its ritual of lighting another candle every night for 8 days (8 is the symbol of infinity), is viewed as sympathetic magic – a way to help bring light to a tipping point that would banish darkness.
All these myths, rituals, feasts, and holidays of light are trying their best to address the panhuman fear of the dark and what psychologists dub SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder), a malady better know as “Winter Blues.” These celebrations of light have one purpose: to brighten up the short days and exchange gifts and blessings designed to cheer up our winter sadness. These holidays of light came before Christmas, and the Church, as we saw, incorporated these holidays into the canon since they couldn’t stop people from celebrating these beloved festivities. That is why I suggested that Christmas was the one who shot the first bullet in the infamous War on Christmas.
That being said, I would like to end this time travel in the speed of light with a few blessings: Merry Christmas! Happy Yalda! Happy Hanukah, Happy Yule, Happy Dia de las Velitas, Happy Dong Zhi, Happy Soyal, Happy Shalako, blessed Toji and in conclusion: Happy Holidays!
Before we bid farewell, here is a reminder of what is so great about diversity and the American Dream. Tony and Grammy award-winner Daveed Diggs, (he played Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson, in the Broadway musical “Hamilton”) released a new Hanukkah song that combines Klezmer melodies with hip hop. Daveed and his music is a product of the well mixed pool of genes and cultures which he absorbed from his African American dad and Jewish mom:

Best Steps To Start Using Google My Business
Adding your organization to Google — regardless of whether it's a restaurant open to the general population or a beauty parlor run out of your home — is a significant stage to reach consumers, make connections, and ultimately grow an effective business.
It additionally gives your business an air of legitimacy and makes it accessible utilizing Google Maps.
Here's the ideal guide to Google My Business and help you customize your business page.
Set Up Another Google Account
Assuming you need to utilize any Google service—be it Gmail, Google Photos, Google Docs, or Google My Business—you need to have a Google account… that’s a fact of life. Luckily, getting one is free and organizations simply need to go to Gmail and choose the "To manage a business" button.
Assuming you need to make another Gmail address, then your username can just contain letters, numbers, and periods, or you can decide to sign in with a current personal or business email address. Utilize an email that you'll have quick access to, as you'll be asked to log in and get a security code.
After being asked to give a telephone number, date of birth, and gender (and to consent to the ever-present terms and conditions), you can now begin to work on your business profile on Google and get noticed by your customers!
Go to Google's My Business site and sign in to your business account. Ensure you sign in with your business email.
Enter your business name
On the off chance that you have a similar name as one more business in your locale, you'll see the autocomplete function propose those organizations for you. This is to permit you to check whether your business listings already exist (to stay away from unintentional duplication) and to easily add another Google My Business (GMB) profile to a current business on the off chance that you've recently opened another location.
What Should You Do If Your Business is Already Claimed?
Select the "Request access" button and submit the form with details that are as specific as possible. You'll get a confirmation email of the request, and Google will contact the email that is currently used by the business.
Unfortunately, you will need to wait and see for 7 days before you can talk with Google Business Support.
If during this time you get confirmation that account ownership has been granted to you, then that’s fantastic news!
Assuming you receive an email stating that you're not granted ownership, the ideal thing to do is to bring up the issue with the GMB Help Community and receive guidance from one of their volunteers.
Enter Your Location
Next, you'll have to pick whether you need your business' location to show up on Google Search and Maps. In case you're adding a restaurant or other business that is available to the general public, being on Google Maps is extremely helpful. But in case you're just adding an independent venture that is run out of your home, keeping that area private may be a smart idea. Pick between “Yes” or “No” and choose “Next”.
If you decided to add your business location to Google Maps, the following screen will request that you enter your work address. On the off chance that you decided to keep your exact location hidden, the following screen will request that you enter your service area. Answer the important data and select “Next.”
Fill In Your Contact Data
Enter the telephone number and site related to your business that connects with customers and select "Next”. If you utilize a Facebook page as opposed to a website, you can add that instead.
Complete and Manage Your Listing
On the following page, pick whether you need Google Business to send you updates and proposals for your business, and hit “Next”. You'll then be asked to confirm your business information.

Complete your Google My Business Verification
Google should have the capability to confirm that your business is located where you say it is, and for totally new GMB profiles, you have three options to finalize your Google My Business verification:
- Postcard check. This is the most utilized verification process and is accessible to all organizations. With this procedure, a verification postcard will be shipped to the location you entered earlier (you should receive the postcard within five days). Once you got the postcard, you can enter the code in your GMB account to verify the business address. If the code does not appear, you can choose the ‘Request another code' banner at the upper section of the screen in GMB.
- Telephone check. A few organizations have the choice to confirm their listing via telephone. You'll know you're qualified on the off chance that you see the ‘Verify by phone' option at the start of the verification procedure. Utilizing this process, you'll get a computerized message with a verification code, that you'll then need to input in the GMB.
- Email confirmation. Like phone number verification, this is only accessible to certain organizations, and you'll know that you fit the bill for it if you see the ‘Verify by email' option. This effortless process allows you to receive a verification code in the inbox of the Google Account related to your GMB listing and putting the said code at the verification stage. Be certain you have access to this inbox before continuing with this option.
The two other options are instant verification, which is just available if you've already confirmed your business' site with Google Search Console, and bulk verification, for organizations overseeing at least ten locations.
Concluding Ideas:
Regardless of whether you're searching for foot traffic or web traffic, Google is a definitive search engine referrer. A Google My Business account guarantees that when somebody looks for your business on Google Search and Google Maps, they can find your business. When they do, your listing tells the searchers where and the best way to visit your shop, regardless of whether you have a web or physical location.

3 ways to Tell If alltrademarkets is a Scam or a Legit Broker
If you are reading this review, the main question you are probably asking is whether alltrademarkets is a fraudulent broker or a legitimate broker. Unfortunately, many online brokers are absolute frauds. Others are well-regulated and dependable. Many, however, fall into a grey area. They may be regulated, but not from a top-tier regulator. They may offer a state-of-the-art trading platform, but they charge hefty fees or have lots of bad reviews.
Is alltrademarkets a Scam or a Legitimate Broker? Find Out
At , we make it our business to investigate online brokers and help guide consumers towards choosing investment services that are beneficial for them. Our team of experts are familiar with every aspect of the financial industry and have extensive experience collecting information and helping clients create claims against problematic brokers.
We have looked into alltrademarkets and want to ensure you enter into the trading process well-informed. You should know what differentiates a fraudulent broker from a real broker long before you sign a contract or part with any money.
1. Is alltrademarkets Regulated?
The first thing you should look for is the broker’s license. If the broker does not have any license, do not work with the broker. Not having any kind of license is an admission that the broker does not want any oversight from financial regulators. There is no reason an honest broker should be worried about filing papers to a regulator or undergoing periodic inspections.
Not all licenses are the same. After all, the license is only as good as the regulator that issues it. If you look at ’s license, you may see that it is from the UK, Cyprus, Australia or another country. What sets apart these licenses and determines their grade are the following:
A top tier broker will investigate applicants thoroughly, and in some cases, will give them a test. They will inspect the broker regularly and expect a high market capitalization to protect clients. They will have a proven record of taking disciplinary measures against recalcitrant brokers and suspending or revoking licenses if necessary.
Licenses are important because they protect customers and mean that the client will have recourse to a regulatory agency if they have a complaint with their broker. It is worth looking into ’s license carefully before trading with them.
2. Is alltrademarkets Direct About Accounts and Fees?
One of the most obvious signs of an untrustworthy broker is one that is not transparent about account requirements and fees but seems to change these at will according to the circumstances. An honest broker will always outline fees and commissions clearly on the website and not leave it for the fine print at the end of the contract.
Some brokers don’t even let this important information linger at the bottom of a wordy contract, but won’t have certain fees printed at all. A fraudulent broker will claim there is some obscure fee, for example, every time a client wants to withdraw money. Many legitimate brokers do not charge fees for withdrawal, and if so, they are quite low.
It should arouse suspicion if you ask to withdraw funds and suddenly the broker asks for a large withdrawal fee or a special tax no one has heard of. He or she might claim they are owed higher management fees than those originally agreed and will say that the management fees increase due to certain circumstances that are not outlined on the site or the contract.
In most cases, it is hard to know from the outset or initial research if a broker engages in these activities or not. If you trade with alltrademarkets and if they have charged you unauthorized fees, contact right away.
3. How Well does alltrademarkets Communicate?
Poor communication and poor service usually go together. It also signals a lack of professionalism. Poor spelling and grammar on website copy and communications are usually signs of second-rate services. Even if the broker is not writing in his or her native language, a broker with a professional attitude would ensure communications are translated properly.
However, poor communication is not always a language issue, but can signal evasiveness or that the broker has something to hide. If you ask a broker a question about their investing philosophy or why they prefer certain assets and they clam up and stop communication, that could be a red flag.
A broker should love what they do and be enthusiastic about sharing their approach to trading. If they instead seem interested only in the bottom line and talk to you only to get you to put more money in the account, they could be shady or at the very least, irresponsible.
A reliable broker should have contact information on the website and should answer your queries. When brokers give clients the silent treatment, that is usually a bad sign. In some cases, a broker could just be busy, but if the communication delay is extended, they may be reluctant to release your funds.
Communication is another aspect that it is hard to judge a broker on unless someone is actively trading with them. Brokers may start very friendly and eager to communicate. Their website may highlight several ways to get a hold of them. However, this can change abruptly once clients send funds to the broker and sign a contract.
If alltrademarkets has suddenly ceased communicating with you or if you are concerned about the nature of the communications, contact right away.
What Legit Brokers Do
So Is Legitimate? See how many of these items you can check off:
If alltrademarkets does all or most of these things, you are probably in a good situation. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean it is 100% above board. Some brokers have professional-looking websites, advanced tools and other features and end up taking client’s money. However, the more of these items you cross off, the better.
What Do Scam Brokers Do?
Is alltrademarkets a scam? On the list of what makes a broker legitimate, it was a question of how many you could check off. However, for the scam checklist, even one of these is a major red flag and is a reason to consider withdrawing your money (if they will let you) and talking to today. If does any of these, it is a bad sign:
Even one of these items would be a reason to have serious issues with and consider not trading with them or to withdraw your money if you have an account. However, many scam brokers make withdrawals impossible. This is where can assist you.
So, Is alltrademarkets a Scam or Legit?
We have looked into alltrademarkets and have found a few issues that require further investigation. It is worth doing due diligence and check if alltrademarkets meets the criteria above. Sometimes it can be hard to know where the broker stands regarding all of the criteria until you have signed up and started an account. That is why it is best to use caution.
One of the best ways to avoid problems with a broker is to only choose those with a Tier 1 license. That way, if there are problems, the regulator is likely to take action, although this process can be slow without an agency like to help you create a case and provide advocacy.
Have You lost Money with alltrademarkets ? Talk to Today!
If you have lost money with alltrademarkets , don’t despair, but consult with right away. Our experts have an in-depth understanding of the intricacies of the financial industry and can help you create a claim and investigate the broker.
The authorities and regulators do care about investment scams, but given the multiplicity of these problems, it can be a slow path to seeking restitution without to help speed up the fund recovery process. We have the resources and can provide the support and guidance you need to recover your funds.

Sangamon Watches: The Springfield Startup Gives New Meaning To The ‘Timeless’ Classic
To wear a wristwatch is to participate in a fashion trend that has existed for well over a century. Despite being updated and digitalized throughout the decades, the analog watch has remained a luxury item, a symbol of style and status that has resisted total modernization.
This sense of tradition is at the heart of Sangamon Watches, a wristwatch brand recently launched in Springfield, Illinois by businessmen Brian Su and Tyler McKay. United by a wish to incorporate a sense of history into classic design, they created a business dedicated to preserving tradition while utilizing the latest technology.
Brian moved to America in the late 1980s and brought with him the experience of international business and a love of American history. Tyler is a sixth-generation Illinois farmer who switched his focus to business and entrepreneurship. He came up with the idea for Sangamon Watches while studying an MBA at Gies College of Business at the University of Illinois.
Both wanted to create a luxury product with a meaning behind it and Sangamon Watches tell more than just the time: each timepiece is inspired by an American story, a nod to the creators’ shared love of the past. In fact, almost every element of the company is inspired by local history.
Basing their headquarters in Springfield pays homage to the once-renowned Illinois Watch Company that was based in the city throughout the late nineteenth century. The name is a tribute to the Sangamon River which is associated with Abraham Lincoln’s early life and career. During the pandemic year of 2020, Sangamon Watches successfully launched three collections.
In Spring 2021, the company released the Clara Harlowe Barton Collection, its first line of female watches. The collection commemorates its namesake, a Civil War nurse and the founder of the Red Cross, a tribute to the nursing profession that is particularly meaningful in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.
A further two new collections are currently in production, both of which pay tribute to incredible moments in American history.
Scheduled for release in the Fall, the 761st Tank Battalion Collection is designed for college-age customers and is inspired by the first African American armored unit in World War Two, since described as one of the most effective tank battalions in the entire conflict.
The end of the year will also see the company release its Grand Expedition Collection, featuring a diver watch inspired by the Lewis and Clarke expedition. American history is quite literally etched into the piece, with the back of the watch carrying an engraving of the explorers’ adventure.
With a brand philosophy firmly committed to producing quality over quantity, Brian and Tyler have set their sights on a global market, without compromising on what makes their watches unique. A limited number of each design is produced, ensuring that the highest standards of craftsmanship and design are maintained. This ethos has proven to be popular on a global scale, with the pandemic necessitating a shift to online business that has allowed more customers than ever to access the company’s distinctive products.
Sangamon Watches met the challenges of the pandemic head-on, with history lovers and watch enthusiasts the world over now enjoying the designs and the stories behind them, with positive YouTube and blog reviews from the US, UK, Mexico, and Canada.
Despite their shift to a wider market, their connection with the local community remains strong. Since its inception, Sangamon Watches has donated to over fifteen local charities, keeping its commitment to using its success to help others.
The success of Sangamon Watches proves that even in a modern market increasingly inundated with fast-fashion and cheap goods, a worldwide appreciation for craftsmanship and quality products with a sense of story remains.

A few of our old favorites got a new look! A few new recipes we're excited for you to cook in your kitchen this fall. Enjoy!I really do regret though not finishing this post about the rest of the steps to throwing a great yard sale before my hiatus began. Again...sorry. Hopefully it can help someone or lots of someones NEXT year when yard sale season comes around again. But I can't just not complete the list, right? So let's finish it up here and now.
In case you need a refresher, you can go here to possibly be convinced that going through the work of having a yard sale is worth it.
And, just in case you want an easy link, the first 5 steps of throwing a great yard sale can be found here.
Now, where were we?
6. Create Price Signs and Labels for Groups of Items or Larger Pieces
Simple, easy to read signs and large labels are a great way to lead people around your yard sale and give them lots of helpful information. They can be hand-printed or typed out on the computer; either is fine. The larger the print and more clear the printing, though, the easier the sign is to read and follow. Something like this, for example, works really well.
The other thing that helps get rid of things easier, especially clothing items, is if you take time the night before the yard sale and put like items and sizes together. So if someone comes along and is looking for young girls' clothes, for example, they could stumble across this table above and go to town! This might seem really obvious to the point of stupidity that I even mention it but you would be shocked at how many yard sales I have been to where there are just boxes of random sized clothing placed about all over the driveway or yard. As in I can pull out of the exact same box a men's size XL shirt, then a girls size 8 pair of pants, then a baby size 9-12 months sleeper. I'm sorry people...that is too frustrating. So instead of shopping at a yard sale like that, I turn around and walk away. My advice: In preparing for your yard sale take the time to organize the clothes and other items for that matter into like categories, sizes and sexes.
Another thing you can do when labeling items and pricing is instead of labeling each item individually put them all together in one bunch and sell them as a set. This makes pricing easier and helps shoppers understand what exactly is being sold and how it can be used to it's fullest potential. Like you can see here for example...
and hereAnd can you see how something as simple as masking tape can be used to label groups of items and give them a general price? Pricing at yard sales does not have to be an overwhelming job.
And even though I had the clothing prices hung up around the sale that doesn't mean I can't hang up specific, easy to read signs in other places to help my shoppers really understand what they are buying and what the prices are. I think it's safe to say, in fact, that the more signs you have and the more information you give the better.
$4 for hanging items might seem high to some? What I found is that the nicer clothes being mixed in with the tee shirts and sweat pants did not seem fair to me. Nicer quality clothing that you usually hang up in your closet as opposed to stuffing it in your drawers IS worth more. What I have done is hang and label them this way and then especially on the second day of the sale, I am willing to negotiate and take less. Most of the clothing here was at least in the $15-20 range when it was purchased so a price of $4 or basically 25% is more than fair.
One of the best ways to have a successful yard sale is to make sure you get lots of customers there. Not every customer will buy something at your yard sale so you need a lot in order to get rid of all that stuff! The methods for advertising for a yard sale have changed a lot over the years so if you haven't had a yard sale before or if it's been a while, you might want to ask a few friends you know that either shop at yard sales or have put on their own recently what they think is most effective. In my area of the world, the best way to let others know you are having a yard sale are temporary signs out on the roads or sidewalks with simple arrows that lead them to your yard sale as they drive down the main roads.
Several years ago I discovered that the sturdy apple boxes I used to hold my junk until it was time for a yard sale performs great double-duty work as a yard sale sign too. Now I just keep those boxes with signs on them from year to year but they are easy to re-make too if somehow they get destroyed. I like to print out large font signs with my home computer and printer like this
or you can use pre-made yard sale signs you buy at Wal-Mart or hardware stores by simply filling in the information in the space provided and then taping them to the boxes. Once you get the boxes in place on the street or sidewalk, I have found it is a good idea to put a few large rocks in them to hold everything in place, especially against the wind. That way your arrows aren't pointing the wrong way and leading your customers down other streets.
Another way to advertise these days is on the internet.
You can always mention your yard sale on your Facebook or Instagram account so friends and friends of friends can come by and shop. There are also specific Facebook groups in most areas that allow you to advertise specific items on their page and this is usually a great place to mention your sale.
Another option ishas is a specific yard sale category that helps shoppers find yard sales with specific items they might be looking for. This is especially helpful for both the buyer and seller if you list large items like specific pieces of furniture or more unusual or specific items that people might be searching or. Some examples from my own years of advertising yard sales are:
1) I had acquired several large street signs (through completely legal means I assure you) that I was hoping to use in decorating my sons' bedroom. It didn't work out so I put "large street signs" in the Craigslist ad for my yard sale and had several people there as I opened the garage door on the first day anxious to see the street signs. They were gone within an hour.
2) I was selling two white wicker chairs that had been on my front porch for a few years and I was planning on replacing with something else. I didn't know wicker chairs were in that high of demand but I advertised my yard sale and specifically mentioned them and again I had several people at the yard sale at 7:00 am to look at and possibly buy the chairs. Just as a side note--there was so much interest in the wicker chairs that I actually had someone offer me DOUBLE what I was asking for them. Yeah, that was a good day.
3) I have been looking for the older-style Bosch Mixers over the last few years so each of my children can have one as they get married. Several times as I have gone to Craigslist to search under Bosch Mixer, they will pop up under the Yard Sale category where someone is wanting to sell a Bosch mixer and just includes a higher priced item like that at their yard sale rather than selling it individually.
So when you advertise your yard sale on Craigslist or any other form of advertising online, try to mention as many specific items (especially the larger or more expensive ones) as best you can. It will draw specific buyers to your sale.
8. Gather small bills for change
9. Consider hosting a bake sale at the same time
Introducing you to my niece Riley and my daughter Carly. Riley was in town visiting us on the weekend our yard sale was scheduled and since she is awesome and a good sport she jumped right in and helped. Both Riley and Carly LOVE to bake so one of their jobs was making cookies, cupcakes and lemonade for the sale...and it was a hit.
Wrapping cookies individually helps customers grab, pay and go and feel better about buying something while they head off to the next yard sale. And making labels with specific information about each flavor or type of treat is another way to make customers want to buy.
When you include a bake sale in your yard sale, it is a really easy way to make an extra $50-$75 and it gives a homey, yummy vibe to your sale. I can't prove it scientifically but it seems to me that people stay a little longer at yard sales that feed them. Subconsciously they just don't want to leave! But we mostly we include a bake sale with our yard sale so the kids have a job on the morning of and help make some of the money.
By the way, after our sale was over this year, Riley, Carly and I went out to lunch and a movie with the proceeds from our bake sale and still had money left over. They were totally happy with that!
10. Be up early and ready for the shoppers to arrive
Every city has a different vibe and culture. Recently I was visiting family in the Portland Oregon area and they were not going out to shop at yard sales until at least 8:30-9:00 am. Where I live in southeastern Washington, that is way too late! If you want to find the really good stuff as a yard sale shopper you have to be out at 7:15 am at the latest! Some people think that's way too early but it's just the way it is. I have run across a few yard sales in my day where the people throwing the sale won't open their garage doors or let anyone on their property until a specific time, like 8:30 or 9:00 am. Those people will never know it but most people that are there earlier will see that they aren't opening and just leave and not come back. It might not be what they are intending to say but to a lot of people it propels a very arrogant attitude of "My junk is SO wonderful and valuable that people will just have to wait to buy it until I am good and ready to sell it to them." Nobody's junk is worth enough or awesome enough to sit around and wait for the opportunity to buy it. So as a general rule, if you are throwing a yard sale, plan on getting up early and being available to sell as soon as the sun comes up or at least by 7:00 am. (the times might be different depending on your area of the country so, again, ask around a bit if you are new at this.)
There you go. Now you have all the tools you need to throw a truly successful yard sale. As people arrive to buy your stuff, greet them with a smile and be willing to take a lower price. The whole goal is to get rid of it so don't be stingy now! After all, in a few hours it will be hauled off to charity without getting you any cash at all. Use the yard sale power to catapult your desires to get rid of things in your home that you aren't needing but someone else could really appreciate and use.
Update:
In my post last year about the reasons I like having yard sales I shared some of the items I had been able to purchase with my yard sale money. This year my yard sale was a huge success and I was able to buy all of the items on my want list no problem. Here they are:
new rocking chairs for my front porch....
new bedding and decor for the master bedroom
and a new Shark Vacuum (cannot tell you how much I love this thing!)
So, in the end, it's worth it to me to put the time and effort in to putting together and holding a yard sale once a year. When you accumulate a lot of stuff, it's important to get rid of a lot of stuff (after all, that is basically what this blog is about.) A yard sale is a great way to do it AND make money for fun new stuff you can really use and enjoy. So go for it!OPPORTUNITY IS KNOCKING!

Asparagus, Burrata and Gremolata
Serves 2
1 bunch of asparagus
1 small handful of flat leaf parsley, finely chopped
zest of one lemon
half a clove of garlic, peeled and finely grated
1 ball of burrata
1tbsp toasted pine nuts
1tsp black sesame seeds
extra virgin olive oil
Remove the woody stalks from the asparagus (the spears will snap at the right point when pressure is applied).
Season the asparagus spears with salt and pepper. Heat a griddle until really hot, add the asparagus in batches, and char for three to four minutes depending on the size of the spears. Turn halfway through.
While the asparagus is cooking, make the gremolata. Mix together the parsley, lemon zest and garlic, along with some Maldon salt.
To assemble, lay the charred asparagus onto a plate and top with the burrata. Slice into it so it begins to ooze out. Sprinkle the gremolata generously over the top of both, followed by the pine nuts and sesame seeds, finishing with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.
Use the asparagus to dip into the soft burrata for a delicious spring lunch.Trump Russia probe reveals advisorʼs visit to Budapest
sputniknews
The ongoing U.S. investigations regarding alleged Russian interference in last year’s American presidential election have suddenly revealed a link to Hungary, albeit a very tenuous one. Carter Page, a former campaign adviser on Russia to Donald Trump, has admitted he traveled to Budapest, but apart from that, not much else.
Carter Page
Carter Page is the founder and managing partner of Global Energy Capital, a New York investment fund and consulting firm specializing in the Russian and Central Asian oil and gas business. He was named by Donald Trump as one of his foreign policy advisors during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Page testified last week behind closed doors before the House Intelligence Committee. The transcript, totaling 243 pages, has been made public and has been described by The Atlantic as "a farrago of legal claims, bluster, contradictions, and concessions."
Page came into the spotlight last year in connection to his travel to Russia, during which he allegedly met high-ranking Russian officials. According to his recent testimony, last year he traveled not only to Russia, but also to Hungary, after meeting the countryʼs ambassador to the U.S. at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Page said he went to Budapest in August 2016 to discuss a renewable energy project, but could not remember the names of the government officials whom he met.
Page denied that the ambassador, whom he repeatedly referred to as Réka (Réka Szemerkényi served as Hungaryʼs ambassador to the United States from 21 January 2015 to July 2017), had invited him to Hungary because of his role on the Trump campaign. The Atlantic noted that the fact Page could not recall whether he’d set up meetings on the renewable energy project before he traveled to Budapest implied "a different motive for the trip."
Asked in the hearing whether or not he had kept in touch with anyone from the Budapest trip, Page said that apart from the ambassador, there was one other foreign policy person with whom he stayed in touch, but claimed that he could not remember his name, nor his portfolio or role.
Online news portal index.hu contacted Ernő Megyesy, adviser to Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on the United States, who confirmed meeting Page last year. He said the meeting took the form of a discussion on general issues lasting 30-40 minutes, but energy projects were not among the issues discussed.
"I was surprised by how general the discussion was," Megyesy told index.hu, which concludes that the goal of Pageʼs visit to Hungary remains.Opened 6 years ago

#36327 closed defect (bug) (fixed)
Custom logo: the image size argument is not taking in account
Description
In this post on Make.WP.org
you explain we can set/get the image size of the custom logo this way :
add_image_size( 'theme-prefix-logo', 400, 175 ); add_theme_support( 'custom-logo', array( 'size' => 'theme-prefix-logo', ) );
Unfortunately it's not working anymore, the size argument is not kept in the
add_theme_support() function. As a result, the full size is always output. It looks like adding the size arguments to the defaults one is fixing the issue.

[EDIT]: As of [37077], Custom Logo does not support the size argument anymore. Specifying the logo size in individual arguments has the advantage of only creating a special image file for the specific logo used (and not every image uploaded), and providing more parity with how Custom Header works.

Fine, but then why using
get_theme_support( 'custom-logo', 'size' ); in the function
get_custom_logo() as it's not possible to specify this size with add_theme_support() anymore ??
see
It seems weird to me to use a function that can't return anything set by the theme....
So to be consistent i think you should allow the size argument or remove this
get_theme_support( 'custom-logo', 'size' ); part...

Read on….
Even though we’re suffering through a recession and financial difficulties, there’s no reason to not have a holiday this year. The Post Office have very handily just published their price comparisons for cities and holiday resorts –
So what does all this mean for the traveller? Does it mean that Riga and Prague are going to overloaded with British tourists looking for a cheap city break – well, they already are magnets for stag parties looking for cheap beer over the weekends. A bottle of lager in Prague will cost you around £1.78 but Riga (shown as the cheapest city overall) will charge you £2.78 for a bottle. Better bet is to go to Lisbon where the beer is cheap at £1.42 for a bottle plus you get more sunshine!
In fact, Portugal is coming out as a very good bet for summer sunshine on the cheap this year. Cheaper than Turkey and Egypt which are countries often promoted as cheap destinations.
So what else has Portugal got that the rest of Europe hasn’t – apart from cheap beer?!
It’s an easy-going destination, packed with historic interest, breathtaking scenery and world class sports and leisure facilities.
Most UK tourists flock to the Algarve but there’s lots more to Portugal than these fantastic beaches and golf courses! Let’s start at the top – the north of the country is green with beautiful countryside. Try a river cruise along the Douro – fly into Oporto (Portugal’s second largest city) and join a 7 day cruise, exploring the region of Port Wine and taste wine in the traditional cellars.
Moving south, the Central Region also has stunning countryside, great to explore by car. Also has the country’s highest mountain range, Roman remains and a Geopark (find out more here –)
Lisbon is a fascinating city, known as the white city thanks to its unique light. Julius Caesar established a municipium there a couple of thousand years ago, making it one of the oldest cities in Europe. The 16th century marks the golden age for Lisbon. The city became the European hub of commerce with Africa, India, the Far East and, later, Brazil, exploring riches like spices, slaves, sugar, textiles, and other goods. It was the starting point for so many explorers over the centuries. Combine a city break in Lisbon with a beach holiday just along the coast on the Estoril Coast.
The Alentejo region is full of history and again perfect for exploring by car. For example, Beja – is the capital of Baixo Alentejo (lower Alentejo), and is a major centre for the production of wheat, olives and cork. Beja’s old town is an area of narrow, cobbled streets stretching southeast from the castle keep to the 13th century convent of São Francisco – now a superb pousada.
So the final destination on mainland Portugal is the Algarve, beloved by British tourists for years. A wide variety of beaches – some good for water sports, some good for family fun, some hidden and some hugely popular. Don’t forget to explore Faro – its more than just the airport!
Whatever your reasons for exploring Portugal, Diamond Travel can help with the planning and preparation – making sure you have the best holiday ever. Contact us now to book your next escape..

A third robbery near the University of Minnesota campus in less than three weeks has campus security officials concerned.
The latest incident occurred shortly after midnight Friday, Minneapolis police say, when a 19-year-old student was assaulted and robbed at gunpoint by three men.
The student was walking home near 14th Avenue and 7th Street SE when the men approached him and demanded his possessions. One of the three pointed a gun at the victim's head while they searched him and took his wallet, cell phone and backpack, police officials say.
The suspects fled the area immediately. They are described as black males in their early 20s, with thin builds and scruffy facial hair. They were wearing dark colored hoodies and pants. One of the suspects had on a letter jacket.
Police are investigating whether the latest incident might be related to two other robberies near campus that occurred in late November, according to the Star Tribune. All three victims were U of M students.
Nov. 25: A student was walking northbound across the 10th Avenue bridge near University Avenue around 1 a.m. when a group of four men approached him. They demanded his possessions and assaulted him, according to University of Minnesota police. The suspects took his wallet and cell phone before running from the scene. The victim was not seriously injured. There aren't any descriptions of the suspects available.
Nov. 21: A student was robbed at gunpoint at the east entrance to the Carlson School of Management building shortly before noon.
The victim was leaving the school building and the suspect was waiting in the entryway, U of M police say. He approached the victim and asked her for the time, then showed her a handgun inside his jacket and demanded her valuables. The suspect took her cellphone and the suspect fled on foot. The victim was not injured.
The suspect, who was seen on security camera footage (images at top), is described as a black male in his early 20s, about 5 feet 9 inches, with curly, medium length hair.
The suspect was wearing a gray baseball cap, a black leather jacket with a white hooded sweatshirt underneath, and blue jeans. He was carrying a black backpack and the weapon he had was a small, black, semi-automatic handgun, according to police.
Anyone with information about the two off-campus robberies is asked to call CrimeStoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477) or send an anonymous tip to CRIMES (274637) and begin the text message with TIP674.

Because 4ever’s too short
Gonna be famous 3gether
Cuz that’s one more than 2gether
So what are you waiting 5?
So goes the siren song of Girls5Eva’s women, who find themselves in the Peacock comedy trying to revive the success of their fleeting ’90s girl group heyday. One of the four members clawing at that second chance, the incorrigible diva Wickie (Renée Elise Goldsberry), might actually need it the most of all: Her Y2K femme-pire left her bankrupt, accused of human-rights abuses by the Hair and Makeup Guild, and forced to shoot geese for money at an airport, but she’s still convinced of the lifestyle she’s owed because of the voice God put in her mouth. And can you blame her? Here’s a woman who’s unsure why she was ever labelled a diva, “just because I wouldn’t let my backup singers wear makeup and refused to play venues that also did sports.”
For Goldsberry, who’s perhaps best known as Hamilton’s fabulous Angelica Schuyler, Girls5Eva represents a part of her life when she, too, tried to pursue girl group stardom in the ’90s. It didn’t go according to plan, but at least she got a good story out of it — oh yeah, and an eventual Tony Award for Hamilton. On a call with Vulture, Goldsberry was happy to recount her own “super young and cute” girl group experience, Wickie’s T-shirt gun full of catchphrases, and, of course, the joys of The Maskical.
Has Jim Carrey personally called you and expressed gratitude for The Maskical?
Oh my God, you know what’s so funny? I lost my mind the other day about it. [Laughs.] I literally thought to myself, Is there any way I can see Jim Carrey again and tell him about this? I met him backstage at Hamilton once. I want to ask him if he thinks it’s funny. I haven’t had that great honor yet. I do have a friend that wrote for his Showtime show, so I thought to myself, I wonder if I can reach out to him and see if he likes it. I imagine that Jim Carrey is used to all kinds of people finding ways to spoof his brilliant comedy. If you know him, will you tell him I hope he likes it?
Wickie is one of those endlessly quotable divas, and I love the physicality and cadence that you brought to the role. I believe she likens it to “performative sexuality” at one point. Did you do any diva training to prepare?
You know, it was just right there waiting to come out from within me. I think, and maybe I’m not alone in this, I’ve spent a lifetime of suppressing all of those urges and tendencies just so that people will like me. I think Wickie gave me an excuse to let it all out. It was not in any way hard to work for attention, sing a little louder, and sing a little more obnoxious to get somebody to look at me. Or to try to wear the biggest and most ostentatious clothes, anything to get noticed. I don’t know if that’s something behind everybody who comes up in this career, but I’ve been swallowing those urges for such a long time. I didn’t know how desperately I needed it.
The greatest calling card for Wickie is how she develops in the first episode. You get to see the façade and the lie, and then you get to see 100 percent transparency and vulnerability. I remember reading the scripts and having a very clear aha moment by the time I finished reading the scene where she’s in the hotel room with Dawn. I think we can all relate to someone who feels like life owes them something and is aware of how impossible it is to correct mistakes that they’ve made. No matter how ridiculous Wickie is, there’s something we can hold onto.
Where do you think she fits within the spectrum of real-life diva worship? Are we talking Mariah level?
I think she’s definitely studied the Diana Rosses of the world. She’s nipped some of the love that flows out of that. But when you look at Mariah Carey and Diana Ross and Whitney Houston, you’re looking at people who spent a lot of time pouring back out that love and giving it to their fans. Wickie lost that part. She only really saw the receipt of it and felt entitled to it, so that’s where she went wrong. But she’s definitely the dynamic, vocal diva that felt all she really had to do is stand, sing, and receive adulation.
I thought the Y2Gay episode was pretty interesting, because it dives into the fact that Wickie, despite the full extent of her glam and hustle, was never the one profiting off of herself. I’m curious if you’ve ever experienced something like that in your own career.
There’s a long history of artists, the ones in front of the camera or the ones with voices on their records, who have this illusion of financial success. But in reality, if they make this percentage of money, there’s a much bigger percentage going to everybody else. There’s also a time-sensitive element of how they’re able to receive anything. Wickie is aware of that now, but wasn’t in the beginning. For me, Renée, it was always odd. When I look at the hits for every singer outside of, like, Ray Charles, who owned his own masters, you were always working for somebody else, even though they let you stand in a fur coat and ride around in a limousine. But for a long time, the real money wasn’t coming to you. That was always obvious to me, but Wickie missed it and probably spent every night over the past two decades scratching her head and thinking, I can’t believe I thought I owned my mansion. I can’t believe I thought I could pay back those credit cards. She’s increasingly aware of it, and when she goes off at Y2Gay, that’s been her pent-up frustration and pain that finally found an outlet.
At least she was able to keep that spectacular clear piano.
That was truly spectacular. It shows the brilliance of our production team. They had to make a choice about what they were going to spend money on, and they picked this absurdly expensive piano. [Laughs.] In normal shows, that’s something that a writers room would dream of but be rendered impossible by a budget. But Girls5Eva got it. They moved that piano between two sets, too. They realized it was solid gold.
Was pop or girl-group stardom something that interested you, from a professional standpoint, when you were working in the ’90s?
Absolutely. I tried very hard to get signed. I wanted to be a solo artist. I wanted to be signed in a band. I wanted to be signed in a girl group. Anything that would give my career traction. At that time, I thought the first thing you should try for should be recording and studio success. It seemed like it would be more likely that someone would come see me in a movie as a recording artist than buy my album as an actor. I thought, strategically, the smart move would be to start in the recording space. But what I love about my career is that it proved me wrong. [Laughs.] Hamilton and my success in the theater is what has given me an opportunity to record music and tour all over the country. It didn’t work out the way that I thought, but I’m excited about what happened instead. It was perfect for me.
Did you ever come close to making it big in a girl group?
Yeah. In the ’90s, I had a really good friend named Kenna Ramsey who called me because she had an opportunity to be part of a girl group. It was her and another girl named Dawn, I believe. Very Girls5Eva in real life, right? I was brought in with another friend of mine from Toronto. The producers flew her in and got her paperwork cleared from Canada so she could be a part of this girl group. They put these little strips of clothes on us, we were super young and cute, and we could all really, really sing. They gave us this great song. Well, we thought it was a great song. When I look back on it now, I’m appalled. [Laughs.] I recently found a bunch of photos of us from back then, and they’re all hilarious. We went to an audition in a hotel room for MCA Records. One of the department heads came to hear us sing. We were going to kill it and knock it out of the water. Everyone that we sang for up to that point was blown away by us because we could all really sing.
So, this woman walked into the room, and she was clearly a powerhouse. Before she sat down to hear us sing, one of the other girls said, “When is your baby due?” I think you can guess what happened next. “I’m not pregnant.” And that was the immediate end of our career. We didn’t go farther than that. Everything fell apart from there. The closest I’ve ever gotten to signing a record deal was from that group. And who knows what would’ve happened. When I look back at my life, I think everything was perfect. But that perfectness is a road full of nos, rejections, disregards, and pivots.
Something that was on my mind while watching the show, and it actually came up in one of the episodes, is the idea of what Girls5Eva stands for. They seemed to have such a bleak, Svengali-ed backstory and lost touch with each other, but a sisterhood remained, so it felt natural when they reunited after so many years. When Vanessa Williams’s character asked you all what Girls5Eva is, she was met with silence. So, I figured I’d ask for your thoughts on it: What is Girls5Eva?
I’ve actually thought a lot about that as well. The journey of the show is understanding that there’s no one definition of what a woman is, by herself or in a group. People continue to grow and evolve and change, which also means the answer to that question can change. The girls are just learning that they’re bigger than the approval of anybody else and that they’re bigger than the barometer of our values. They don’t know it yet in that episode, but I think they discover it when Vanessa’s character gives them what they think they want — they think they want a bigger profile, validation, and success. It’s being in the public eye, so to speak. But they learn that’s not what it is. Rather, it’s finding a way to express what our inner voices and talents are in a way that’s authentic to who we are in this particular moment.
When they’re standing on the stage singing “Four Stars” in the finale, knowing that they have to give up their new lifestyles in order to do that one thing, it’s the first time that it ever dawned on them, This is who we are. My point is, they don’t know it yet by the end of the season, but the closest they ever get is when they sacrifice everything just to sing with their authentic selves together. Everything else can go to hell. [Laughs.] We haven’t even cracked the surface of their ability to answer.
What was the most enjoyable throwback performance for you all to film?
My mind changes all the time about it, because I always remember something new that makes me laugh so hard. How bad are the lyrics and the idea of what was appropriate back then? There’s one scene when Dawn and Wickie are shooting a music video about a woman’s fault when it comes to cheating. If our man does cheat / we only get real mad / at the other girl / it’s the other girl’s fault only! I think that’s the whole song. But the more ridiculously wrong our perspective is in the ’90s, the more exciting “Four Stars” becomes. There’s more relief we get when we actually find a way to sing something that’s good.
But also, at the very end of the season, the very last thing we shot was “Famous 5Eva.” I cried when I saw the finished video. I’m not kidding. We only had a day to shoot it. It was a blessing from the gods that we could actually shoot it, amid the pandemic and everything. There was really no need for a full music video, so I’m grateful that we were given the opportunity. It feels so good. We talk a lot about what was bad about girl groups in the ’90s, but there’s something really beautiful about them. It’s just being with girls and that being enough. Being with a group of girls — laughing, singing, making something in harmony with each other. That seems really trite, but it isn’t. It’s not trite and it’s not small. It’s healing and it feels good just to be with girls, with women. When I see that music video, which is by no means is elaborate, it reminds me of how powerful and healing it is to just be with other women.
Okay, it’s been a month, have you gotten any “cease and desist, bitch!” street calls yet?
I have. I was doing a concert in Iowa last weekend, and it was the first time I was back with my band in a year. We were outside at a beautiful park, surrounded by a beautiful symphony, and I told the audience, “Hey all, I’m in a new show called Girls5Eva, check it out if you can.” And somebody immediately from the audience goes, “Cease and desist, bitch!” [Laughs.] I’m sure nobody in the park knew what that meant. He was a true fan. If that follows me for the rest of my life, I’d just say thank you.Table of Content

Obviously, farmed silver foxes cannot be easily integrated into the wild because they are not trained to deal with wildlife. Likewise, wild foxes will not get used to captivity and will be very unhappy. because it used to live in the wild.

It should never be inside an apartment or house unless you want it to destroy everything quickly and easily. He should not be locked in a cage, as he could go mad and possibly die from it.so better to have a big space or big farm so he can have the freedom to go away and go around but he will come back for food or sleep
If you want a domesticated silver fox as a pet and you have raised the possibility of keeping it locked up, even if it is only for a few hours a day, ask yourself this question: would you force a dog to live in a cage?

What Do Silver Foxes Eat?
Although it is under the Order Carnivora, this can be misleading in terms of their dietary habits. In fact, foxes are omnivores, meaning they will eat both meat (including fresh kills and carrion) and plant foods. Their diet mainly consists of rodents, rabbits, insects, birds, berries, and other plants, depending on location.
Silver Fox Smell
Foxes emit a very strong smell. They have a gland under the tail that secretes a very powerful odorous secretion. This, in addition to the pestilential smell of urine and stool, is one of the reasons why the domestic silver fox (or other foxes) has never been considered a valuable pet for humans in the course of history.
Silver Fox behavior with other pets
he is absolutely not friendly with other animals The silver fox is incompatible and aggressive with other animals. Foxes are exterminating predators, they kill for the pleasure of killing. It’s in their nature. It is well known that when they sneak into a chicken coop, they kill all the chickens and take only one to eat it. that is why you cant have silver fox with Dogs or cats or birds or fish, all are in danger if a fox lives on the same spot.
With very large dogs, it may be they who end up with the fox, because the dog will feel an aggressive reaction to the stench of an atavistic enemy.

For those of you that have ever scratched your heads wondering what a deconstructed meal is my deconstructed pesto is a good example. I took a dish, in this case pesto, took all of the ingredients in that pesto, broke them apart, prepared them separately and in a different way, and then put them back together on the same plate to form a new dish. It was created for Charcutepalooza and inspired by my daughter's favorite pasta sauce. This is a really good, really special meal. If you make the pasta ahead of time and freeze it then this is not a very difficult meal to pull together. Although no one will guess that when they sit down at the table.

See what other Food52ers are saying.The dating internet site for married people is – surprise, shock – full of scammers, catfishers and individuals with strange intimate desires.
In the event that you google available for articles about Ashley Madison, the internet dating internet site for married people, you will frequently find yourself reading variants on a single of two pieces. The foremost is a write-up with a male journalist who signs as much as the website “purely for research purposes”, satisfies some ladies included in their research, does not have the decency to really sleep together with them after which utilizes this research to draw shoddy conclusions concerning the type of women that make use of the web site. The second reason is compiled by a female whoever wedding moved stale, eventually ends up utilizing the web web site, perhaps has sex and learns some life that is valuable in so doing. This short article is neither of those things.
Back ground: we’m 40ish, a university teacher into the UK, an upstanding person in the community that is local hitched with young ones. I’m additionally an intercourse addict. Or, we’d acknowledge to being an intercourse addict if we actually accepted that intercourse addiction had been an actual infection, in place of simply a phrase utilized to pathologise individuals who like intercourse plenty, especially the stuff that is weird. Phone me personally extremely subjective, but i suppose that everybody is dependent on intercourse in mind – it is simply that some social folks are too uptight to admit it. If We had been attempting to justify that last declaration, I would say that my spouse is one of the second category, but that might be a lie. She is as hooked on intercourse as anybody, except that for many weird explanation she just desires to have sexual intercourse beside me.
We’d messed around on Tinder in past times with a few success, but while i am obviously a scumbag, i am a scumbag would youn’t need to get caught. I have found that fulfilling some body on Tinder involves twice as much level of lying – lying to my spouse in what We’m as much as, but in addition lying to my matches about my situation. Nearly as good a liar when I have always been, staying in touch this known amount of deceit could be tiring. Ashley Madison appeared like means of handling both issues. Anybody on the webpage who recognised me personally ended up being apt to be since morally compromised when I have always been and so not likely to blow my address. And in case I been able to satisfy somebody, i mightnot have in order to make up some cock-and-bull tale about needing to be discreet because I’d recently divided from my partner, yada yada yada.
Thus I put up a profile on Ashley Madison, posted a discreet picture and purchased some credits within the hope that i would ultimately satisfy some other sex that is married. And also this is exactly what we discovered.
The website Is Filled With Scammers
Exactly exactly exactly What a surprise, eh? A site populated by males who would like intercourse, but do not need to get learned, may be russian mail order bride the place that is perfect tear somebody down. Nevertheless, a lot of these people have the elegance of a Nigerian 419 scammer and therefore are simple enough to identify. One of their biggest flaws is which they utilize photos of porn stars with their profile photos, without realising that many AM users probably save money time viewing porn than they are doing having fun with their young ones. Many of these profiles cut straight to the vow of whatever shit that is sick you on. Other people have fun with the game that is long rotating out a tale over days – months, also. The very first sort are pretty simple to spot, the 2nd, less so – a great deal of work gets into some frauds, and I also’m perhaps maybe maybe not too proud to state that we finished up getting strung across the first few times, stopping prior to getting really burnt.
Whichever approach they just take, it frequently ends up in the exact same destination: They either request you to register with a “ticket site” or ask if you want to webcam. Ticket web web web sites are, supposedly, a spot where they could anonymously verify your identification, to safeguard by themselves – the only real issue being that you confirm your identity giving your bank card details to an Eastern European fraudster who installs malware on your pc. And webcamming? Well, for many strange explanation, they never desire to use Skype, but occur to know of the great web web site where you are able to set a profile up. “Of program it’s not a fraud, infant. Trust in me. ” The initial guideline of Ashley Madison: it almost certainly is if it seems too good to be true.
If She Actually Is Not a Scammer, She Is Probably A sugar Baby
Then she probably is out to get paid if you find a profile of an attractive woman under 25 and she doesn’t turn out to be a scammer. It is pretty reasonable, I suppose – why would she would you like to rest with paunchy married males free of charge, when she could rest by having a muscular, tanned twentysomething who probably shaves their balls (see below)? Why would you be picked by her over him unless there were various other incentive? Some men believe when they provide to choose within the tab and book an Uber instead than make their lady buddy make the bus house, these impressionable young things will fall under their hands. That is not the real method it really works. Glucose infants want an allowance, they would like to shop, and once you book the Uber house, they wish to go alone.
If she actually is Under 25, Attractive and Not just a glucose Baby, Things can get Weird
Even you understand that the attractive under-25s are likely to tap you up for the money, you are most likely nevertheless likely to approach them. I am talking about, they are since near as you’ll get into the porno fantasy that made you register with the website into the place that is first. Once in a while you ignore your better judgment and deliver them a key to gain access to your photos along side a message that attempts to encounter as sexually interested not too strange. Many will ignore you, specially that you’re not interested in being a Sugar Daddy if you tell them. Nevertheless the people whom do respond will turn out to inevitably be strange.
You will be sent by these women communications that are therefore tasteless you will think the manufacturing crew of To Catch a Predator is targeting you. I have had one woman brag about her “young-looking” human anatomy before delivering me personally pictures of by herself with a lover that is previous a former enthusiast whom made her dress yourself in their child’s swimsuit before fucking in said child’s sleep. Another was not thinking about conference for a conventional dinner-and-drink type of date, but she did deliver me personally her target and then leave a window available making sure that i really could climb up in at a prearranged time and play-rape her. Roleplaying incest isn’t actually my concept of enjoyable, nor is trying to explain to the cops that I became satisfying a lady’s play-rape dream, should it arrive at that. We politely declined both overtures.
Even though things are not that extreme, my impression is the fact that intercourse is actually a complete lot more. Experimental into the ten years since I have got hitched. Now, that is definately not being truly a study, also it might be that AM users are more inclined to go after some kink, nonetheless it appears like spanking, hair pulling, bondage and also choking are actually predominant, if you don’t ubiquitous. And anal. Once I had been just starting to have intercourse, straight right right back into the 1990s, anal had been a myth that is urban. Blame internet porn if you want, but ass-fucking is practically always on the table now, whether that is to your style or otherwise not.Eden Hazard has admitted that he was a fan of Arsenal growing up, following and idolising a number of the Gunners’ French players in the late 1990s and early 2000s before going on to play for London rivals Chelsea for seven years.
Hazard is Belgian but he grew up in the French-speaking part of the country close to the border with France and his own career took off when he joined the youth ranks at Lille at the age of 14.
His love of Zinedine Zidane has already been well documented and is thought to have at least contributed to his desire to link up with the 1998 World Cup winner at Real Madrid. But there were other French players at that time he also enjoyed watching, including Thierry Henry.
“When I was little, the team I watched the most was the French national team. For me, the players I looked up to were Zinedine Zidane and Thierry Henry,” Hazard told magazine On the Front Foot.
"It’s difficult for me to admit because of my relationship with Chelsea, but I really liked the Arsenal team at the time,” he added. “They had players like Robert Pires, [Sylvain] Wiltord and [Patrick] Vieira, so it was mainly French players that I followed growing up.”
Hazard was only 16 when he made his senior Lille debut in late 2007 and became a regular the following season while he was still just 17. He was a key part of the side that won a French domestic double in 2010/11, before a stunning individual campaign in 2011/12 saw him score 22 goals.
Hazard chose to join Chelsea in 2012 after attracting interest from top clubs across Europe. He was regularly Chelsea’s best player and scored 110 goals in 352 appearances for the Blues, while winning two Premier League titles, two Europa Leagues, the FA Cup and League Cup.
He moved to Real Madrid in the summer of 2019 for an initial €100m, but his dream transfer to the Bernabeu has been wrecked by injuries and he has been unable to show his best form thus far.

Source : 90minCardinal : Hymns
More often than not, the fate of genius is not to be remembered, but repeated instead. Chuck Berry’s moderate success funneled into huge triumphs by The Beatles and The Beach Boys. While Fugazi may always hold a place in the throbbing hearts of true rock junkies, their influence mostly lives on in the aggressive rhythms of modern alt-rock. Likewise, Cardinal’s 1994 self-titled debut sparked a new vibe and culture with its orchestral pop, only for the band to remain dormant thereafter for nearly two decades. However, after years of refining their own musical vision and execution, Richard Davies and Eric Mathews return with Hymns. And it’s worth the wait.
The duo did not invent chamber-pop (that credit mostly goes to the well-known 60s pop icons mentioned above), but they can definitely be credited with reviving the genre. The sounds of their eponymous effort eventually encouraged the rise of such artists as Belle & Sebastian and The Polyphonic Spree. But the great thing about Hymns is that Cardinal does not attempt to rebirth the same sound from their classic debut. Instead, the multi-instrumentalists continue the tradition of their beloved genre.
Sometimes steady and often soft with a slight edge, Hymns brings with it a variety of moving compositions, but never once lays dull on the ear. Layers upon layer of sound carry each tune. Whether it be the humble ballad “Her,” persistent anthems like “Radio Birdman” and “Northern Soul” or the floating soundscape “Surviving Paris,” each track is laced with psychedelic sounds, but in the most soothing interpretation of the word.
In many ways, the Cardinal aesthetic lies in how the duo connects chamber-pop of the ’60s to its modern equivalent. The arrangements themselves largely pay tribute the former (with a slightly harder edge), but the lyrical themes are more modern and eclectic. Hymns is a masterpiece of sorts, but one I believe could easily be overlooked for a couple of years. Like Cardinal’s debut, it’s only true crime is how subtle its genius is.

Serves 4
Preparation time: 1 hour
Cooking time: 3-5 minutes
Special equipment: A nice pasta machine and cutter is all that is necessary.
INGREDIENTS
pasta dough:
1 cup 00 flour
5 tuorli d’uova (egg yolks)
1 oz. water
1 ¾ Tbsp olive oil
1 tsp. salt
lobster farce:
1 large Maine or Blue lobster
2 ½ tbsp cream
pinch tarragon
pinch salt
1/4 tsp. lemon oil
sauce:
5 Tbsp grapeseed oil
Reserved lobster shells from the blanching of the lobsters
1 leek, sliced
1 celery stalk, sliced
1 bulb fennel, sliced
1 garlic clove
1 bay leaf
1 tbsp tomato paste
¼ cup vin jaune
1 ¾ cup chicken stock
2 cups vegetable stock
fagottini:
pasta dough
lobster farce
Olive oil for frying
A layer of semolina
to serve:
½ cup osetra caviar
8 nasturtium leaves and flowers
METHOD
pasta dough:
Place the flour on a clean work surface and form a well in the center. Add the eggs, water, oil and salt and mix with a fork until amalgamated.
Use a kitchen fork or your fingers and incorporate small amounts of the flour into the well. Continue until all the flour is mixed in and knead the dough for a good five minutes.
Add a little extra water if necessary.
After kneading wrap the dough in clingfilm until ready to use.
lobster farce:
Bring a large pot of water to the boil.
Blanch the whole lobster for 2 minutes and remove the tail and shock in ice water.
Continue cooking the claws for 2 additional minutes. Remove. Shock in ice water.
Neither the tail nor claws will be fully cooked. Remove all the lobster meat and reserve the shells. Chill the lobster meat and reserve ¾ cup for the farce, the remaining lobster will garnish the fagottini.
Place the ¾ cup of lobster in a robot coupé and process with the cream until smooth. Tamis the lobster and then add the tarragon, salt and lemon oil. Cool and place in a pastry bag.
sauce:
Heat the grape seed oil in a large stainless steel rondo.
Toast the lobster shells and brown lightly. Add the leek, celery, fennel, garlic and bay leaf. Cook for an additional five minutes until the vegetables have taken on some color.
Add the tomato paste and cook for roughly 5 minutes. Add the vin jaune and deglaze the pan until completely evaporated.
Add the two stocks and bring to a rolling boil. Simmer gently for 45 minutes and then strain into a fresh pot and reduce to 1 ¾ cup. Keep warm in a bain marie until needed.
to assemble the fagottini:
Roll out the pasta dough to the finest possible setting. Cut pieces of pasta 30 millimeter in length by 8 millimeter in width. Pipe the filling in the center of the dough every 4 millimeter. You should get 7 fagottini.
Atomize the dough with a spritz of water and drape the bottom piece of the dough over the farce. Seal down the dough above the filling starting from left to right. Then pinch in between the filling to form the shape of the fagottini.
Cut the fagottini with a ridged pasta cutter using your right hand as you twist the dough with your left hand. The fagottini will look similar to the famous Piedmontese Agnolotti dal plin.
Hold the fagottini on a layer of semolina in the refrigerator until ready to cook.
to serve:
Heat up a large pot of boiling water and season with salt. Warm 4 plates in the oven or plate warmer and keep warm.
Boil the fagottini in the water and transfer the fagottini with a slotted spoon to a sauté pan. Add a little olive oil and keep warm.
Place 25 grams of caviar in each bowl and place 7 fagottini on top of the caviar.

I woke up nearly French kissing a slender nine-month-old black lab named Pepper who, despite our being only recently acquainted, had taken a true liking to my side of my bed, and as a result, to me. Pepper was large for his age, which meant he was only going to get larger, but for the moment he was still small enough to fit atop the mattress and yet big enough to muscle me around. I have always been lax about dogs sleeping on my bed; it must be some kind of ancient Viking gene in there that still found the use in such behavior.
I had already had one run-in with this lovable beast. He had a funny way of snuggling up to you just minutes after committing some treacherous act. In this case after violating my toiletry kit and chewing on my toothbrush as if it were a finger bone. That was the kind of dog Pepper was, and I had grown to like him; otherwise I never would have let him sleep with me…not on the first date at least.
Does this kind of lascivious behavior go on in the town ofGreenwich? Quite possibly, but I could quite tell you because we weren’t even there. In the end, we did go upstate toWest Simsbury, and we did make it without a hassle, and we did join our dear friends Vicente and Joan and their kids and a friend of the family’s and ate a wonderful turkey and drank lots of wine and cava (Spanish sparkling wine), and shared plenty of memories. We did make merry until our bodies dropped…which was about 12:15 am. Pathetic, isn’t it? Things aren’t just what they used to be, and inAmerica, where most finish their dinner hours before midnight, fighting off sleepiness to ring in the New Year becomes a formidable challenge for anyone over the age of 35. It was a great time, I tell you, and since we were a bunch of cheeky bastards, as the British would say, we even offered to sleep over at the place with the excuse “it would be more fun that way!”
That was where Pepper came in. The peppy pup was the newest addition to the family after a rather tough year of losses in the domestic animal department. The list of casualties included two dogs, a cat, a handful of chickens and maybe a horse, if I could recall. Pepper was at that cute but slightly dopey age, socially awkward and trying to make friends in anyway possible. As you already know, he wasn’t doing a very good job of it. Sucking on someone’s toothbrush is not becoming of a host, and I don’t care if he’s got four legs, hair, floppy ears and likes to hump stranger’s on the leg. You just don’t so that. But I am spineless when it comes to dogs, so I forgave him.
I went on line and took a look at the Greenwich Time website to find out the latest on the death of that girl, with the remote hope the Time would produce anything substantial. After all, it was a death in its hometown, so I guess it had no choice but to come up with an explanation.
Murder. It was murder. I suppose we knew it all along, but still the authorities had to make sure they had the facts straight before they jumped to any conclusions. Made sense. The Greenwich police had a history of being especially clumsy and slow-footed when it came to solving violent crimes, in part, I have no doubt, because there are so few they have to deal with. That can make for some pitiful investigating. Posterior analysis of the Martha Moxley case, for example, left experts dumbfounded as to how in the name of God the members of the local law enforcement could have screwed up in so many ways. According to some, the police could have solved the case in a matter of weeks at the most. Instead, it took twenty-five years and a conviction based on the flimsiest circumstantial evidence the judicial system has ever seen or heard.
So why did the bungle it so badly? I told you, they hadn’t had to solve one in decades years. How the hell were they supposed to know? You don’t just go to homicide school, pick up a few tips and say, “Bring on the psychos, I’m ready.” There is nothing like on-the-job training to get the necessary experience and knowhow. Not that they learned much from the Moxely case. Ten years later on August 31, 1986 young Matthew Margolies of the Pemberwick-Glenville section ofGreenwich(a sweet, low-key part of town) disappeared on his way home. The circumstances were eerily similar. A youth, a neighborhood full of families, a wayward walk home, a frantic search. This is time it took nearly five days for the boy to turn up beneath a pile of leaves with several stab wounds in his belly. The Greenwich Police had checked there several times but didn’t spot him and figured he had to be somewhere else. It took a former investigator with a little sixth sense (or maybe a proper usage of his five senses) that led to the child’s discovery. To this day no official suspect has even come close to being charged; and believe me, a little research shows that the Greenwich Police Department had plenty to work with. How this could be boggles me to no end.
This time, though, they managed to bag the case in a matter of hours, though there wasn’t much to it since the culprit basically led them to the body. Here’s how it went: In the backcountry section where the famed large Greenwich estates get so big they look like prep schools, there was a sizable property owned by a hedge fund mogul named Donald Sussman. Apparently Mr. Sussman was one of the first to make it big with this newfangled style of investing known as the hedge fund, and I applaud him because not only does it take a lot to come up with strategy like that, it strains the brain just to figure out what the hell it is all about. It seems as if all of my friends are into hedge funds, and not one can really tell me how they work. The minute I ask the question, a kind of blank expression overcomes their faces and they stare out into the distance morosely the way veteran primary school teachers do. Mr. Sussman clearly had a good grasp on things and he did it very well.
But let’s not get into that because the poor man had little to do with this tragic event. His only crime was being a very affluent resident in a very affluent town, and couple that with a violent crime and what you get is a Class A news item. And a very large property, so big, it required live-in service, including a gardener. This brings us to the deed itself…and its protagonists.
The live-in landscaper, Adam Dobrzanski (that “brz” combination I find particularly challenging to pronounce), was a Polish man who had come to this country with his wife and two children just a few years ago. My guess was that it was to start a new life and search for happiness through the American dream. Well, things haven’t turned out so well for him, or his family. He literally lost all grip on his sanity and killed his 20-year-old daughter in such a brutal way it breaches the wall of all that is rational, reasonable and conceivable. He slit her throat.
Ironically, the initial concern surrounded the wellbeing of the father, as he had whizzed off frantic text messages to his wife that he was going to do himself in. Her name was Renata. Where was she at the time? Well, in the Caribbean with the Sussmans who were on Christmas vacation. What was she doing there? Well, she was the family housekeeper, and was probably there to do the cooking and help out in any way. But that wasn’t all. She had also filed for divorce two weeks earlier, and it would seem that this troubled personal story involving a troubled husband led to the family’s demise. Adam Dobrzanski, it would seem, lost it.
The police rushed to the scene fearing for Adam’s life, which turned out to be genuine because when they found the man he really had tried to kill himself about a dozen different ways, but hadn’t managed anything better than a bloody mess. It was when the semi-conscious Dobrzanski muttered something about his daughter that the police set off a frantic house-wide search. They found her, but it was too late.
Imagine being on the plane taking the family back and having to spend those hours thinking about the only reason you are making the trip is to go to the town morgue to identify your dead, 20-year-old daughter who has just had her throat slit by your husband…that is…her father? I am sure that woman has lost all sense of time and space and dimension. Her world had become shapeless, never quite defined; never quite together. I sighed and felt like I didn’t want to talk aboutGreenwichanymore for a while. This no longer had to do with a town. Happy fuckin’ New Year.Boxing defense is key to being a successful fighter.When I box I have one thing that is always on my mind. That is to avoid getting hit. Any fighter can stand in the ring and get punched in the head, but a good fighter will avoid it.
Far too often as fighters do we forget the importance of boxing defense and the role it plays in boxing. To many times when we are first starting off all that matters is trying to go toe to toe. That is not what the sport is about at all. The object is to land punches against your opponent without letting him land punches on you.
Now that I have given you a little taste of what boxing defense is all about let us dive in.
Parry Your first line of defense beside keeping your hands up and elbows tight. Is the parry, the parry is a very easy way to avoid a punch. When your opponent starts to strike you simply move your hand quickly almost slapping down the punch to misdirect it.
Slip The slip is done by rotating the body so that an incoming strike passes next to the head with out contact. This is done because, as the opponent's strike arrives, You will sharply rotates your hips and shoulders. Turning the chin allowing the punch to slip by.
Block The block is simply accepting a strike with out avoiding it. When accepting the strike you absorb the strike with your gloves.
The bob Is where you go underneath and opponets strike. As the strike arrives the you bend your legs quickly and shift your body either to the left or right.
Weave You now return to the up right position. Evading the incoming strike while it still sits extended. Usually coming on the out side of punch offering a striking chance for you to take.
Rolling Simply with your arms up gloves nearly pressed agaist your forehead. Focusing on keeping you elbows in and protecting your jaw. As the strikes come toward you, you simply rotate your hips from side to side rolling. Absorbing the strikes in against your gloves and arms.
Down side to rolling it is poor protection against body strikes.

Yeah...that looks like a bug.
In theory, I believe that "Right Top" should be the top right corner of the max text "box" (as in, the top right corner of a capital M) but this definitely looks as if it is starting with the top right of the characters as typed, then holding that point to shift the next piece of text.

Trinity Rep has come a long way when it comes to having a musical presence in its lineup, a long way indeed from the days when impressive voices were few and far between. Because for the next month the theater is staging a “Little Shop of Horrors” that’s a joy to behold.
It’s a production that looks great, with Audrey Two plant puppets that could star on Broadway. It also covers all the vocal bases, while still having that quirky stamp of a well-oiled regional theater.
Mr. Mushnik’s struggling Skid Row flower shop pops out from behind a roll-up garage door (at least it did most of the time, save for a momentary technical glitch), while a crack band led by Esther Zabinski is perched on the roof.
And who better than Trinity vet Stephen Berenson to play nerdy Mr. Mushnik, the perfect nervous worry wart. The casting, in fact, was spot on, with Rebecca Gibel as his sexy assistant Audrey, making the most of tight skirts and a campy accent.
Stephen Thorne is fabulous as the sadistic, motorcycle-riding dentist Orin, who lives on laughing gas and inflicting pain. Thorne shows up in a skin-tight leather outfit, swinging his hips like Elvis, then rips off his leathers to reveal a white coat with a glittering DDS on the back.
Director Tyler Dobrowsky has made sure there are no shortage of clever touches, like the Marilyn Monroe reference when Audrey’s skirts flutters over her head while standing over a heating grate. And when Chiffon, Crystal and Ronnette launch into their doo-wop routine, Janice Duclos, playing a drunken bag lady, chimes in from the sidelines.
The star of the show is, of course, Audrey Two, the plant from outer space that feeds on humans and threatens to take over the world. As she grows, feeding on not so nice people, bigger and bigger puppets, stunning creations from Monkey Boys Productions, appear in the shop.
But in Trinity’s version, Audrey Two takes human form as well, as Rachael Warren dressed in green tights, curling up in Mr. Mushnik’s lap.
In other roles, Jude Sandy couldn’t be better as the sweet, unassuming Seymour, the bubbling clerk who discovers the carnivorous Audrey Two, and nurtures her until he discovers he has a monster on his hands.
The production runs through May 12, and finds Trinity at its best when it comes to putting its own spin on a fun, if familiar, musical.Diana Solis

Overview
There is a growing interest today in training deep learning models on the edge. Algorithms such as Federated Averaging [1] (FedAvg) allow training on devices with high network latency by performing many local gradient steps before communicating their weights. However, the very nature of this setting is such that there is no control over the way the data is distributed on the devices.
consider, for instance, a smart checkout scale at a supermarket that has a camera mounted on it and some processing power. You want each scale to collect images of fruits and vegetables being scaled and to collectively train a Neural Network on the scales to recognize these fruits and vegetables. Such an unconstrained environment would almost always mean that not all edge devices (in this case, scales) will have data from all the classes (in this case, fruits and vegetables). This is commonly referred to as a Non-IID data distribution.
Training with FedAvg on Non-IID data, would lead the locally trained models to “forget” the classes for which they have little or no data.
In a recent paper [2], which will appear at NuerIPS’s Federated Learning for Data Privacy and Confidentiality workshop, we present Federated Curvature (FedCurv), an algorithm for training with Federated Learning on non-IID data. In this paper, we build on ideas from Lifelong Learning to prevent knowledge forgetting in Federated Learning.
Lifelong and Federated Learning
In Lifelong Learning, the challenge is to learn task A, and continue on to learn task Busing the same model, but without “forgetting” task A, i.e. without severely hurting the performance on that task. Or in general, to learn tasks A1, A2 … in sequence without forgetting previously-learnt tasks for which samples are not presented anymore.
In the paper — Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) [3] the authors propose an algorithm for sequentially training a model on new tasks without forgetting old ones.
The idea behind EWC is to prevent forgetting by identifying the coordinates in the network parameters that are the most informative for a learnt task A, and then, while task B is being learned, penalize the learner for changing these parameters. The basic assumption is that deep neural networks are over-parameterized enough, so that there are good chances of finding an optimal solution *B to task B in the neighborhood of previously learned *A. They depict the idea with the following diagram:
In order to “select” the parameters that are important for the previous task, the authors use the diagonal of the Fisher information matrix. This is a matrix whose size is the same as the model parameter tensor, and each entry’s value correlates with the matching model parameter’s “importance”.
The authors enforce the penalty by adding a term to the optimization objective, forcing model parameters that have high Fisher information for task A, to preserve their value while learning task B. This is depicted by the following objective:
his loss adjustment can be extended to multiple tasks by having the penalty term be a sum on all previous tasks.
Federated Curvature
For Federated Learning, we adapt the EWC algorithm from a sequential algorithm to a parallel one. In this scenario, we keep communicating and averaging the local models, just like in FedAvg, but we also add the EWC penalty for forcing each local model to preserve the knowledge of all other devices. During communication, each device sends its model and the model’s Fisher information matrix diagonal. Mathematically, we get:
This way, we enable training on local data, without forgetting the knowledge gained from data of other devices (such as other classes).
Keeping Low Bandwidth and Preserving Privacy
At first glance, the number of new terms added to the loss would seem to grow linearly with the number of edge devices. However, as we show in [2], by simple arithmetic manipulations we can keep to a constant number of terms which depend on the sum of Fisher information matrices, making the loss function scalable since the number of terms is not dependent on the number of edge devices. This also means that while each edge needs to send the model and its Fisher information matrix diagonal to the central point, the central points only need to send the aggregation of the individual models and their Fisher information matrix diagonals to each edge. Note that FedCurv only sends local gradient-related aggregated information (aggregated on local data) to the central point. In terms of privacy, it is not significantly different from the classical FedAvg algorithm.
Experiments
We tested FedCurv on a set of 96 edge devices. We used MNIST for the experiment, and divided the data so that every device has images from exactly 2 class (which no other device sees). We compared FedCurv to FedAvg and FedProx [4] (the central existing solution, whose description is beyond the scope of this blog).
Since the main benefit of our algorithm is that it allows less frequent communications, we expect that as the number of local epochs E between consecutive communication rounds increases the advantages of using FedCurv will become more apparent, i.e. FedCurv will need less iterations to reach a desired accuracy.
The results, presented in table 1, show that for 50 local epochs FedCurv achieved 90% accuracy three times faster than FedAvg. Figures 1 and 2 show that both FedProx and FedCurv are doing well at the beginning of the training process. However, while FedCurv provides enough flexibility that allows for reaching high accuracy at the end of the process, the stiffness of the parameters in FedProx comes at the expense of accuracy.
Conclusion
We presented the problem of non-i.i.d data in Federated Learning.

♡ Worldista! I saw it on opening day in Shizuoka and then twice in Miyagi. It's not as good as Epcotia or Neverland in my opinion, but it's still quite good! My seats were fine in Shizuoka, but I was in the arena both days in Miyagi, so from my subjective standpoint I've certainly been enjoying it a lot XD; I'm seeing it again twice in Saitama and twice in Nagano (I hit for both the shows in Nagano, thank god, so I'm done buying tickets for this show), so hopefully I'll have good seats for those, too!
♡ I saw SixTONES in Yokohama, and it was a good show! I'm happy for them that they've been doing so well recently. Kouchi's Magical Song was really cute, and I also enjoyed Hokuto's artistic solo (though I'm honestly crushed that I missed him performing Ayame last year). I hope that they have more success from now on!
♡ I had a good Spring Break and am currently enjoying Golden Week! I ended up going out a lot during Spring Break and was pretty tired, so I'm enjoying mostly relaxing during Golden Week XD; I did hanami in Meguro during Spring Break, though, and saw all the paper lanterns for JUMP members! It's really fun that the trend of buying lanterns for your tan is spreading; I spotted 4 for Inochan!
♡ The season of Kaseifu no Mitazono with Inochan started! Inochan has been super cute. It's funny and easy to watch, so I'd definitely recommend checking it out!
♡ I saw the Shounentachi movie, and, despite that it was terrible, I really enjoyed it, lol. They adapted it a lot from the regular SixTONES and Snow Man version of the play (can't speak to older versions or Osaka versions since I haven't seen them), which made it a lot better, especially for the movie format, but the script, the filmography, and a lot of the acting was really just horrible. XD; Still, it was also really gay, so I mean, what else could you want. It had similar elements in terms of the gay aspects to Bakaleya, which was very cute and nostalgic, and Reia's role was extremely brief but also amazing, which I enjoyed a lot. XD All in all, if you want to see a good movie definitely don't go, but if you want to see a movie about Johnny's Juniors forming ~bonds of companionship and what have you, I recommend it XD;The open kitchen and dining invites for delicate cooking, and share stories at the large wooden table.

Man convicted for role in son-in-law's slaying
SPOKANE - A man who says he took part in a family plot to kill his son-in-law because he believed the victim had molested his granddaughter was convicted Wednesday of aggravated first-degree murder.
Jurors convicted Morris "Mel" Goldberg after agreeing that prosecutors had proved an aggravating factor was present in the 1991 slaying: Peter Zeihen was killed to prevent him from testifying in a child custody court hearing.
Prosecutors argued that was the real reason for the killing, not because of the suspected molestation.
After hearing six days of testimony, the jury decided Tuesday that Goldberg was guilty of a lesser count, first-degree murder. But the jury was split on the alleged aggravating component of the crime.
No sentencing date has been set for the 69-year-old Goldberg, who faces a life prison term without parole. Prosecutors declined to seek the death penalty, the only other sentencing option in Washington for persons convicted of aggravated first-degree murder.

Sure, it has its uses, but the rise of Web 2.0 has proven that being yourself on the intertubes isn’t bad, although it can be dangerous. But that’s a different post for a different time.
When you’re anonymous, it’s much easier to be a jerk because the repercussions don’t fall on you. You can troll around being snarky and mean with no consequences.
When people know who you are, you don’t have the same liberty. This is a good thing.
However, the lack of anonymity creates a sanitized experience where people tiptoe around, characterized most obviously on Facebook.
I’m not the only one who has noticed. Last week’s South Park lampooned people’s behaviors on Facebook, and The Oatmeal’s “How to Suck at Facebook” has been floating around for a while.
This is a tough post to write because my goal is not to criticize, but rather to point out how behaviors have changed with the loss of anonymity.
Facebook isn’t the only place this happens. It’s been happening in blog comments and forums forever.
I’ve tried to reengage with my Facebook network, but increasingly, I feel like an outsider because I have nothing to say. When I do comment, I get sucked into polite games of “you hang up first”. I need a rule of thumb for when it’s acceptable to stop commenting on a Facebook post.
This has a lot to do with how frictionless Facebook is. It’s so easy to post and comment that I feel rude when I don’t. This is why LOL is the most commonly used word on Facebook. I made that up, but it sure seems to be.
Contrast this to Twitter, which retains some anonymity, and whose 140 character limit enforces brevity.
I’m much more interactive with my Twitter network, and I find it enormously more interesting, especially since I started following more.
Why?
First, I don’t feel obligated to read Twitter. I can browse, read or ignore, and search and hashtags allow me to keep up with topics I find interesting.
Second, because I don’t know everyone I follow on Twitter IRL, I don’t feel like a jerk when I don’t reply or don’t read their tweet streams in minute detail.
Finally, because of the above and the 140 character limit, I’m fine with short replies and fine when people don’t reply to me.
The differences between Facebook and Twitter networks have everything to with the differences between the friend and follow models.
The friend model requires acceptance, which makes it more socially loaded, i.e. it’s not trivial to de-friend someone on Facebook. Because of the social weight, Facebook networks are full of strong ties, and even though you could branch out into friends of friends territory, your existing network might not approve.
The follow model is frictionless, allowing you to build a network quickly and test follow accounts with very little commitment. Twitter also exposes followers/following for each account, which provides a nice way to Discover your weak ties.
The composition of your network is directly responsible for how much new information you can discover.
I suppose my preference could be due to effort as well. I simply don’t have time to be the kind of Facebook friend who meticulously comments on everyone’s posts. Twitter allows me to have single-serving friends and control the amount of time I spend.
So maybe it’s me.
Interestingly, this is the second time I’ve found a use case for anonymity.
What about you? Facebook or Twitter and why? Or do you use both the same way?
Find the comments. I’m interested to hear what you’ve noticed.
Granted that a lot of this IS personal, but it sounds like you've identified at least two factors: the friend vs follow model, and the IRL vs online-only method of acquaintance. Of the two, I suspect that the IRL factor is the more important of the two.
It's important to note that there are gradations of IRL. You and I have met a few times, but obviously this is different from how you would relate to your Aunt Margaret that you saw every Christmas as a child. If you ignore me, no great harm done, but if you ignore Aunt Margaret, then perhaps Mom gives you a call and asks why you didn't respond to Aunt Margaret's LOLcats video.
For me, I'm not sure the question is about anonymity, per se. For my Twitter stream, I actually identify who I am, and a link to my profile to learn more about me should someone wish. I do totally agree that Twitter is a much looser model than Facebook. Depending upon how well you might know someone there, though, it can come with social repercussions if someone unfollows. In fact, some have written tools to track and notify those who request it that they have been unfollowed.
I actually operate two streams. One public, one private. In the private one, where I do know every single person there, people do seem to be more aware of who comments on who's tweets and how often. Others have used unfollowing or even blocking as tools for retribution. I prefer to keep my online experience as low drama as possible, and am happy to be disentangled from such shenanigans.
By comparison, my public stream is much more fluid. I follow and unfollow more freely and really don't care at all who follows or unfollows me. As you point out, it's all a matter of controlling the information flow. About the only reason I pay any attention at all to my public follower list is to weed out obvious spammers.
Facebook, to me, seems a combination of these two. The friend list itself operates much like my private twitter stream. But although I did dip my toe briefly into the FB gaming scene, I quickly withdrew… blocking the game, and insisting that my friends list only include people I actually know or at least have met and conversed with (again, like my private twitter stream). But the liberating part of facebook, the part that enables a form of unfollowing (without unfriending) is hiding.
Since the Facebook news feed is the primary stream to see what people are up to, I find that I can easily control the amount of information flowing through by hiding. As with spammers in twitter, I hide mostly to get rid of the fluffy application updates, which I find not at all interesting. Occasionally, I do hide people from my news feed if I find that they choose to discuss topics I find uninteresting or just become too chatty (I loathe small talk). Doing so doesn't limit their ability to see what I've posted, unless they choose to do so.
I have only had the question of whether I've read or replied to someone's post come up a few times, and I basically tell them that I treat my facebook feed like I do twitter… I try and keep up with it, but often I post without reading. I make an effort to keep up with replies, but anything else is subject to skipping over without warning or apology. As with all things, if something resonates with me, then I pursue it. If not, I move along… so in that sense I guess I try to stay as honest to myself online as I would behave in the real world. It doesn't always happen that way, but it's what I strive for. 😉
As for anonymity… I find little value in it. From my perspective, the only reason to be anonymous is to allow yourself the flexibility to say or do things you would be embarrassed by if anyone you know learned about it. That isn't to say that I share all parts of my life with everyone I know. In fact, this is true even in Facebook; I make liberal use of friend lists in order to filter visibility to content (mostly pictures) to handle privacy of some information and/or to cause discomfort to some portions of my friend population ( it can be one thing to know about something in a person's life, and quite another to see it in living color). But, again, this kind of filtering happens in real life as well as online. I personally try to minimize it — friends (IRL and online) are known to utter “TMI” around me a fair amount… heh — but it really is necessary in some cases. 😉
For me, I see these online experiences as being an extension of myself… allowing me to share with more people I know what's going on in my life than I could ever hope to manage if I had to find time to be with them all IRL. Anything else would be the projection of a falsehood that really wouldn't be worth anyone's time.
There's definitely a difference. I just don't get the online manifestation of pleasantries. Why would Mom call me to ask why I didn't comment on Aunt Margaret's LOLcats video? If we were at Aunt Margaret's house watching the video, you'd get the same drivel out of me that you will on FB.
What I don't get is why the IRL social niceties are required on FB, when it's so obviously just a game?
I guess it's my personality 🙂
I use Hide liberally on FB to avoid social gaming spam. Your loathing of small talk is exactly the problem I have w FB. It doesn't exist on Twitter, at least for me, b/c I don't find it terribly interesting and doubt anyone would, but FB's friend model exposes friends of friends to small talk too, on purpose. So, in that regard, FB is more annoying.
I don't personally find any value in anonymity and never use it. My point is that it seems to make for more interesting content. Twitter is varying degrees of anonymous, placing the focus more on content vs. relationship, whereas FB has always been about authenticity.
They are very different animals. My filter for FB stuff is way finer-grained that it is for Twitter, which leads me to believe I'm more interesting on Twitter.
It's all relative 🙂
Given your admirable tendency to respond to even the most banal commenters (*cough*) on this blog, I can see where FB could present this sort of “you hang up first” problem. My filters are a little different for FB; if it's been more than 12 hours, I'm unlikely to respond on a comment thread or status update, unless the conversation is unusually compelling. I definitely don't feel a need to respond to most of my friends' status updates, and we're all probably grateful for that.
Oddly enough, I have the reverse problem with Twitter. I find myself going back way farther in the timeline than I really should, just in case I've missed something interesting. Probably means I need to follow more people, to break the habit with sheer weight of impracticality.
I agree with the Friend vs Follow point. But it is hard to ignore that Facebook would win in a fight over Twitter.-…
Thought about ignoring this comment for my own amusement 🙂 That tendency did occur to me, but I didn't expect anyone to mention it. Comments here are way more deliberate, so I feel that I owe them more attention. That said, I do feel the pull of that tendency on FB and Twitter at times.
You know I recommend following more people on Twitter. It has spiced up my stream substantially, and with Chirp this week, I'm sure I'll add a lot more.
By size alone, you'd have to put FB as a prohibitive favorite. Strange things happen in fights though . . .
My boss told me to post anonymously after I called BS on someone online and they emailed bosses boss. I've also been kicked off of modded places for simply being direct.
But I agree strongly with your view of repercussions, which is why I've strongly advocated for posting under real names since usenet was the big thing.
But now I have a 14 year old, newbie to facebook. I think of teenage silliness, and have to wonder, do you really want that on Your Permanent Record? Of course, I miss stuff on facebook because it scrolls off so fast, but that is mere current tech. I think of the dumb things we did as teenagers, and am glad I can dribble that out as I see fit.
My best friend of 40 years just majorly stroked out, and I couldn't figure out if I should say anything on his barely-used facebook page. He won't be on there again – the person we knew is basically gone – I did contact one person who hadn't heard (and was wondering why his calls weren't being answered, they were supposed to have dinner the next weekend), through facebook private message.
I have to rebuild my kids laptop again, the collaboration site his class was working a project on infected half the class at least. Web 2.0…
I guess Twitter is somewhere between full disclosure and total anonymity. You can be fully anonymous, but there's a record of what you say and to whom.
Your point about permanent records is a bit sad for kids today, but then again, since everyone was young once, everyone should empathize what that entails.
Talk about permanent record…
Yeah, saw that. Future generations will marvel at our tweets 🙂

Madonna’s daughter Lourdes wore these chunky boots to the ‘Material Lady’ assortment launch. The conditions that the families work in meant that, without applicable sneakers, they had been constantly affected by severe injuries on their feet. These tried and true shoes have stayed fashionable for decades, and celebrities like Selena Gomez like to throw them on when heading to the airport.
For some time, Jessica Alba couldn’t be seen in an airport without these platform sneakers by Vince She’s styled them with skirts, attire, and joggers, and although her pair is white, in addition they are available tons of different colors and patterns for fall.
We have seen fairly a spread of comfy footwear coming and going from airports all over the world on the toes of these stars.

This feature will definitely not be available in the next months. We are approaching Frankfurt Musikmesse and are working hard on many things, and if something comes in DC then it is the playback monitoring feature first.
schnelle Antwort!
Danke
Not to beat a semi-conscious horse-- but is there any prediction when the Mac DC will have the same functionality as windows?
Rich
Yes, any info on this? Would be a great feature..
Sorry to say this but we had to cancel our plans of adding Global Record to Mac OS X.
We still want to add the playback monitoring, but first tests revealed that it will require much more development effort than expected, and will never be available in the same way as under Windows. Core Audio requires us to add additional features in soft- and hardware to be able to do this, and these will only be worked on when there is time left.
Sorry again, we all hoped it would be much easier (and therefore quicker) to be added.
I'm devastated to learn that global record is not available on the Mac. It is one of my main tools during composition, when I just want a one-touch record setup. Please, PLEASE have even a rudimentary version (no need fast forward/rewind). Just a stereo capture would do, nothing fancy at all.
Sorry, did you notice that this thread is from 2011 ? This is 7 years ago, so it looks like this feature won't come.
May I suggest to either stick to Windows or to invest into a RME recording device with Durec.
This gives you even a better functionality as you do not need to start the computer for recording.
I use DURec very often to concentrate on playing and not having to fiddle around with a PC.
It's also a very uncomfortably seating position to operate PC/Cubase while holding my guitar.
Possible devices: UFX II, UFX+.
Hi sambasevam,
you can use wave tracks live (which is for free) or Boom Recorder. They start very quickly, just one click which Audiointerface to choose and one click on global record...
tracks live is very robust and hardly doesn't take any resources. For a test I recorded 100 tracks in 192 kHz--> no issue (just a full hard drive after a couple of minutes :-))

I don’t really remember why I selected Shopify in the first place.
So I opted for the herd. People can have excellent success in offering Add A Foother To Clickfunnels
They were very easy to develop (as a non-techie with few style skills). I had the ability to establish my pages without losing any energy on design, optimization or coding. Most notably, I was finally able to present what I needed: a sales funnel. As a result, my conversions increased and average order value increased from $11 to $19.
I chose a variation of the 2-Step TripWire. The secret to this funnel is to use an alluring upsell. The concept of a 2-Step TripWire is quite simple. It involves a low priced preliminary product being bought, and after that instantly using them an expensive 1-click upsell. If the upsell is turned down then your contingency deal is a lower priced 1-click downsell.
What do I suggest by 1-click? The upsell and downsell are provided instantly after the customer purchases the single eBook. For that reason, I have currently collected used at $9 individually – How To Add A Foother To Clickfunnels.XSign in by: Email Mobile

A CHARITY watchdog has blocked plans to take a vintage car to the top of Ben Nevis.
VINTAGE: He wanted to take a car like this one- Pic posed by models
Enthusiasts want to airlift a Model T to the summit for the centenary of Henry Alexander’s ascent of Britain’s highest mountain in the first Ford vehicle.
The Edinburgh motorist’s 1911 attempt in the 20hp car took several days and involved ropes, planks along a 4,406 ftpony track.
Organisers of a centenary rally in Fort William hoped to use a helicopter to transport a Model T up the 4,406 feet mountain, as it would not be able to recreate Alexander’s route at the event, in May 2011.
But the John Muir Trust, which is responsible for the mountain, has refused their request saying it could damage the wilderness.
Enthuisast Iain Blyth said: “We all have the utmost respect for the Ben’s fragile landscape which the John Muir Trust does a magnificent job in maintaining. However this is not some Jeremy Clarkson-style stunt.”
In a letter to Lochaber Provost Allan Henderson, Andrew Campbell the trust’s head of land management said it had to “protect and restore the wild character and landscape” of the Ben.
He added: “Part of our vision is for all those who visit the summit to be touched by the sense of wilderness that this high altitude mountain environment can convey.”
Provost Henderson said: “This is a one-off and would certainly not set a precedent and, other than a brief fly over by a helicopter, would not detract from the wilderness of Ben Nevis.
“I really hope the Trust will look again at this proposal and reconsider its decision.”Glenegedale Cottage Self Catering Accommodation

Soil density is determined by how great a concentration of mineral components a soil sample holds and how compacted the components of the sample are. A high concentration of hard minerals, such a quartz, which is very compacted, will have a higher density than soil without rocks that are loosely compacted. Soil density is also affected by the presence of liquid in the soil sample.AMP Football is pleased to announce that Elias Goritsas has been identified by Gary Lewis for trials in the UK.

This pair is immensely popular—for a fleeting hour, the bookstore was the most exclusive club in town, with Powell's letting people into the packed upstairs only on a one in-one out policy.
I was excited to get a space (even a crunched one at the far back of the room) because I am in love with Joe Sacco and also because I agree with Mercury reviewer Joe Streckert that this new book about American poverty packs a powerful punch.
But listening to Hedges talk about his powerful book was intolerable. I agree politically with pretty much everything Hedges says (example line from last night: "We have undergone a corporate coup d'etat and it's over. They have won."), but for some reason, the way he said these smart things made me want to roll my eyes and make a hasty exit. At the lectern last night, Hedges came off as a person who has never smiled in his life, who expresses his points by beating the audience over the head with a pompous liberal stick. I respect Hedges' work and am glad he's fighting hard for important causes, but last night's lecture was a perfect example of the kind of political discussion that turns people off to politics because it's humorless, guilt-inducing, and offers no solutions.
It got me thinking: We need a word for when you totally agree with someone, but are totally irritated when they talk.
I put the call out on Twitter and got a few good responses: being in agreeyance, finding yourself aggritated, someone is irritruthful, having an adversionality, getting Olbermanned. As in: Hedges, you're great, but you need to figure out how not to Olbermann your audience.
I moderated a panel with another old-school radical, Bill Ayers, at Stumptown Comics Fest this spring and found Ayers to be refreshingly non-irritruthful. He just put together a book with a Portland cartoonist about teaching and comics and he made a point that stuck with me: People listen to humor. When politics is expressed in a way that feels pedantic, we tune it out, even if we agree with it. Jokes are not frivolous—humor is essential to political discourse. Express politics in a way that can laugh about and people will actually listen up and be more likely to take your point to heart. This is why places like Syria continue to break the fingers of cartoonists.公司旗下品牌

Lender Processing Services reported significantly higher numbers in judicial foreclosure states, at 6.5 percent of all loans, compared to non-judicial states, where the foreclosure inventory settled at 2.5 percent.
Also, according to LPS, more than half of loans in foreclosure in the judicial states have been delinquent for at least two years, compared to just over 30 percent in non-judicial states.

***This post may contain affiliate links.***
Even after 2 years China still amazes and surprises me on a weekly basis. Some days I can’t believe how fast our time in China has gone by, and others it feels like an eternity and I wonder when the insanity will stop, but one thing’s for sure China has had a profound impact on my life in ways I never could have imagined.
1. I stopped caring about what people think.
Or, as the brilliant Mark Manson would say “I stopped giving a fuck”. As a foreigner living in China, there’s literally nothing I can do to stop being seen as strange. Blonde hair and blue eyes “Is it natural?” A question I’ve been asked by complete strangers about both my hair and eye color. The answer, by the way, is yes.
I dress like an American…weird. I dress like the Chinese…also weird (it’s a foreigner in Chinese clothing!). No matter what, they stare, so why even bother caring? Fucks = 0.
2. I am more conscious about the quality of food I consume.
Health in China is directly linked to food, both type, and temperature. Some things are eaten cold, some hot, and every individual type of produce or meat has a direct effect on some bodily function. For that reason, I’ve learned to never settle when it comes to the quality of food I buy.
The egg yolks are too yellow, where are the nutrients? Those shrimp aren’t jumping around in their tank, definitely not buying those, they’re already half dead!
3. I always have to eat something green with my meal.
Seriously people, where are the greens? No joke, it’s a huge deal if I go to the market and the happy vegetable lady I buy from weighs my vegetables and doesn’t see anything green (peppers don’t count by the way). She’ll literally ask me, “No greens?”.
And I totally get it now, because it’s just weird if my meal doesn’t have something green in it. I still don’t really go too much for the leafy ones, because, let’s face it, they’re just not that good, but there’s absolutely always a touch of green somewhere in just about every meal I make (minus breakfast because I just can’t get in to the whole eating vegetables with breakfast deal).
4. I have become more financially savvy.
The bargaining culture here, while it has been on the decline in the past few years, is still pretty strong. If you’re at any type of shopping market or buying something off the street, the given price means absolutely nothing. They will overcharge you like you’ve never been overcharged before, and because it’s so cheap to begin with and you’re an ignorant foreigner you will pay for it.
Well, my ignorant foreigner days are long gone. Nowadays I study prices much more scrupulously and always try and get the best deal before I let the cash leave my hands. Oh, and I’m definitely not afraid to walk away when the going gets rough.
5. I put myself first.
Because if you’re not first, you’re last. In a country with around 1.5 billion people, there is no time to be polite. If you yield to others, you’ll never go anywhere or get anything done, because the list of “others” never stops. In China, no one is going to look out for you, except you.
I learned how to make myself noticed. If I need something, I get it, and if I can’t get it or don’t know where to, I ask. I don’t ever wait for someone to come up and help me, because I could be waiting forever.
But don’t worry, I haven’t lost all of my American politeness, I still can’t help holding doors for people and use “thank you” way too much, some things never change!
6. Lines are for losers.
I think we can all agree that waiting in line is a giant waste of time. But we’re taught that everyone has to wait their turn to get what they want, so we stand single file in a polite little row and gradually move up to the front of the line.
Ha! Once again China laughs in the face of our politeness. Ain’t nobody got time for that!
At first, you might think that there’s a fire somewhere, but no that’s just the Chinese bulldozing their way through whatever door, or to whatever destination their trying to get at in an attempt to get their needs met before everyone else. Again, the place has 1.5 billion people, would you want to wait all day with thousands of other people to buy a train ticket? I didn’t think so.
While the custom can get really irritating for those of us stuck in our polite ways, there are parts of it that are actually super cool. Like, line cutting is totally acceptable, as is bribing people to let you sneak ahead of them in line. I can’t even count the number of times that I just casually stepped in line beside someone, and nobody batted an eyelash.
7. Fake it until you make it.
Confidence is key in Chinese culture. It’s looked down upon if you’re a super shy, reserved person because if you can’t stick up for yourself and really go after what you want, you’re not going to “make it” in China’s overpopulated society.
Now, once I make a decision, even about simple things, I stick to it, and I own it, and if it doesn’t turn out how I thought it would, I move on and try again later. Never let them see you sweat.
8. You catch more bees with honey than with vinegar.
The Chinese have this concept called “face”, which I find insanely annoying, but that’s beside the point, it’s there, and their entire culture literally revolves around it. In a nut shell, “face” is basically your reputation and other people’s perception of you.
It’s pretty much the entire life’s goal of the Chinese to “save face” and garner a positive reputation. Kind of like in western culture how we’re obsessed with leaving some kind of legacy and making something of ourselves.
That said, with everyone trying to save face, they all want to be right, and feel important all the time, to a fault, in my opinion. So, while I might be able to point out someone’s mistake and have them acknowledge and correct it in western culture, in China they will deny to the high heavens that their godly existence could have even made a mistake, and then become even less likely to help you out.
While I’m still not so great at, I’ve learned that if I can stay positive and use persuasion rather than getting frustrated, you can often get someone to help you out, or bend the rules for you even after their original answer was “no”.
9. Nothing is what it seems.
I have pretty much learned to just stop making any assumptions because no matter what I think in China, it’s almost always wrong.
Looks like eggs? Probably tofu. Thought that was chocolate? Nope, sweet bean paste.
At this point, I’ve just stopped trying.
10. I’m less materialistic.
From my travels and experiences around China, it seems to me that happiness lies in the “have enough, but not too much” zone. Once you can provide all of the basic needs of you and your family, no amount of things or wealth will make you happy. So, I have concluded that the happiest people are those that have just enough.
For example, the food vendors and hole-in-the-wall shop owners, always happy and smiling, the rich people in the fancy cars and expensive apartments, super rude and angry. You do the math.
Now, I don’t buy hardly anything except food, and just replace things I need when they wear out or run out. I don’t feel like there are so many things that I “have to have”.
11. Rules are meant to be broken.
The Chinese love to implement new rules that are never enforced. It’s so comical you’d think it was a past time of theirs. No smoking? Lights up a cigarette in the elevator. Do not enter? They don’t really mean that, lets enter anyway.
For real. I have to admit there’s something a little thrilling about taking a photo in a place that says “no photography”.
12. I take pictures of everything.
There’s no such thing as no cameras allowed. Regular or video, everything in China gets documented. The Chinese love love love taking pictures, and selfie sticks are a national craze. Don’t want to be on tape? Might as well just stay holed up in your apartment because, as a foreigner, the Chinarazzi will be out in spades.
But hey, this applies to me too, so I feel no qualms about snapping photos of anyone or anything I want, anytime, anywhere. Well, I guess a little qualm, but they’re definitely receding thanks to China. The selfie craze though, there ain’t no shame in that!
13. There is no need for personal space and privacy outside of your home.
There is literally no such thing as personal space or privacy in China. In fact, I don’t even think the concept exists here. Anywhere outside of the walls of your home, your life is on display to the world, which is welcome to document, record, and interfere in any way they like, and they will. Mostly out of curiosity, but they will.
There are little in the way of privacy laws here, so I am free to video, photograph, probe, and snoop around as much as I want. Now, that’s not really my thing, but I’ve learned to accept this as part of the culture.
People will walk in on you getting an exam at the doctor’s office. There are no private rooms in the hospitals, and doctor-patient confidentiality doesn’t exist. It’s just a fact of life; I will be getting super cozy with the stranger standing next to me, and I just don’t care.
How has living abroad or traveling have a lot of catching up to do with your blog, but just wanted to say this post was awesome! China is definitely an interesting place, but I’m glad you’re learning to roll with the punches!
Thanks so much! China is definitely a unique and interesting place. We are never bored living here that’s for sure!

Abstract
In spite of the policies to allow student participation in school governance in Zanzibar in an attempt to provide avenue for students to learn democratic values and principles, hardly anything was known about the practice on the ground. This study explored the practice and dynamics of, and the beliefs and attitudes about, student participation in school governance in public secondary schools in one district. The study employed a sequential mixed-method research design whereby quantitative data were collected through a survey questionnaire distributed to a sample of 560 participants from 21 schools. Quantitative data were analysed both descriptively and inferentially to determine frequencies, percentages, and correlations. On the basis of the findings from phase one two schools were selected for in-depth qualitative exploration through semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and document reviews. Qualitative data were later coded and categorized into themes.
The findings revealed that students participated in school governance through two key governance structures – student government and school committee. Besides, overwhelmingly, respondents held positive attitudes and beliefs about the practice of student participation in school governance and there were positive correlations between beliefs and attitudes and the student participation practices in school governance. The study also found that student participation is influenced by unbalanced power relations and socio-cultural beliefs and practices which favour adults at the expense of students. Other influencing factors were gender issues which disadvantaged girls, inadequate skills among students and limitations in, and the flouting of the policy guidelines in the process of student participation in school governance. Overall, the issues surrounding the practice of student participation in school governance appeared to impede the achievement of the main purpose of student participation in school governance of learning democratic principles and values.
On the basis of these findings, there is need to review the policies and to eliminate the policy-practice gap to provide equitable opportunities for student participation in school governance. In addition, concerted efforts through education are needed to equip students with essential skills for effective participation, and to reduce unfavourable gender and socio-cultural beliefs and practices. Further studies are recommended to explore in-depth the dynamics of gender relations, and the norms, assumptions, values, and traditions related to socio-cultural practices in the wider community in general and in schools in particular and come up with possible strategies to reduce imbalance and negative impact of gender relations and socio-cultural beliefs and practices in the practice of student participation in school governance. This study has created long overdue contextually knowledge and contributed to the world-wide debate in the field of student participation in school governance.

See, 100% called it. For all that it can be a fault, Tiffany’s predictability is also the single driving force that saves the day.
Also, gotta love that dress, the pose from the third panel is no different than ones we’ve seen half a dozen times so far, but this time it looks all girly because of the curves ^^
Ha-ha! Tiff in love! I love that vulnerable look on her face she has on panel 4.
Let’s just hope this brings enough fire to get her her real attitude – and incidentally, physique.
Yeah, Tiff, that fight wasn’t all your fault. Just 70-90% at most, I mean no one would really be expected to lash out after being called a paedophile and then poked in the chest…
That church though, now that is assholery on a whole new level. The punishment for not doing what the priesthood says is being rendered mute!? Wow, talk about disproportionate retribution. In the Church of England they just give you a hard glare and make you have a chocolate digestive instead of Jammy Dodgers.
Loving the saga of Denver and Tiff though. Mostly…awwwww
I foresee two confessors who REALLY wish they had another job in the very near future.
Go Tiff! 😀
Take away her voice might not be rendered mute it might be worse might be getting her magic power removed. They use a lot of song references in church about magic. But if you noticed the brother hood is all men. They might be as bad as Tiffany people when it comes to magic.
Told y’all the church was evil.
Well think about it, if you could use awesome butt-kick magic with just your voice, how would you govern that? Gag them and feed them through a tube for the rest of their life? Have to handcuff them and imprison them to prevent them from removing said gag?
I think, if that was the case, the only safe way to deal with those who would, apparently, betray the church would be to mute them, to seal away their voice.
As for the church being evil… see previous, but with a new phrase thrown in for good measure: Love the faith, hate the fanclub XD It’s why I chose a small, unrecognised religion to follow, because it’s all faith and no fanclub, so to speak.
You said it, boy !
What Thaylien said. Church not evil, just… strict.
Also, I question that Tiff is in love – the statement just confused and worried her. Denver, OTOH, behind his shy, bookish exterior, is crushing hard. Still too sensible to admit it to Tiff, tho – even with all of the ‘girlifying’, I doubt she would take such a confession well.
Thirdly, I wonder how Tiff is going to get Theresa out of this. More of her usual ‘Tiff smash’ might not work so well – she’s girlier than usual, in a palace full of (demonstrably badass) armed guards, and going up against two ‘confessors’ who are also powerful magic-users. Plus, she’s in a tight, confining dress, might get in the way – unless it comes off – oh please oh please…
I know I’ve talked too much already, but I’m reminded of something Theresa said a few strips ago. “I was just being myself”, she said. The confessor’s response: “And that’s why you need to be punished”. Like the RCC, this church seems to be about repression of the self in service to the greater good. They view personal foibles (like gender and sexual expression) as ‘challenges’ which the good person must overcome to win God’s favor. Theresa’s about to be punished, it seems, for not trying hard enough to be good.
Tiff’s not responsible for Theresa’s punishment – this has been a long time coming, I think. It’s become clear that Thomas was guilty of several… indiscretions (Honey Nectar) during his time in the church, and has always been known as somewhat of an oddball. His transformation, and subsequent fight with Tiff, is simply the straw that broke the camel’s back.
I wonder if she’ll be able to help with her new, less muscled body? because with her lack of knowledge about most things around there, I doubt that her smarts will be enough.

Make some extra cash by selling things in your community..Get PriceA medical orderly (also known as a ward assistant or nurse assistant) is a hospital attendant whose job consists of assisting medical and nursing staff with various nursing and medical interventions. These duties are classified as routine tasks involving no risk for the patient.
Orderlies are often utilized.
In the US, orderlies have been phased out of health care facilities in recent years and their functions are now replaced by the patient care assistant and Certified Nursing Assistant. They remain common in Canada and other countries.
Orderlies in UK hospitals were known as "attendants" (primarily in lunatic asylums), but that role has been phased out. The nearest role left to a male hospital assistant is that of Porter, but that is more a logistical role, moving patients and equipment around the hospital. This is not to be confused with healthcare assistants (HCAs) who are essentially carers for patients (not qualified or licensed health care professionals), and may be of both sexes.
A common set up among hospitals in Australia is seen at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in Adelaide, South Australia. At the RAH the orderly service is contracted to Spotless, a national corporation. There are around 80 orderlies employed by Spotless at the Royal Adelaide alone. Here, they are tasked with the movement of patients and equipment between wards and departments, the movement of patients from ambulances in triage, the movement of patients from MedStar retrieval helicopters that land at the hospital, the movement of deceased patients to the mortuary and various other tasks. They respond to every MET (medical emergency team) call that originates within the hospital to provide extra oxygen and so that the patient is able to be moved to another area (such as the intensive care unit) as soon as is required. The orderlies are dispatched using pager-radio combos. Some orderlies are stationed at particular departments such as radiology and theatre/recovery but most are in the 'pool' and are dispatched throughout the hospital. In The Royal Brisbane and Womans Hospital in Queensland, orderlies are called patient support officers or PSOs. Controversially, PSOs are required to do all cleaning within the hospital, leading to an outcry from staff that the practice is unsafe because PSOs have to not only clean, but also take care of the patient handling, leading to a possible increase in the spread of infection.
In Canada, orderlies are called Nursing assistants, PCA (personal care attendants), PSW (personal support workers) and health care aids (HCA).
An operations assistant (OA) is a type of orderly trained to assist in the running of an operating suite. An OA requires no prior formal training and learns.Also it is programmed on java which may make things easier.

This is a piston design recirculation valve that is a direct replacement for the original fitment. This valve gives greater longevity than the diaphragm (OEM) valves as it benefits from being fitted with the up rated Yellow spring; built to withstand increased boost pressure from a remapped / modified RS. This modification works great with the DS Ultima 2+ and DS Ultima 3 set ups available on the Stratagem iMap.

Checkout the color coordination ... Lucky and Carolyn are obviously members of the
Textile Color Card Association of the United States (TCCA)
Did You Know? - Prior to the creation of the TCCA in 1915, later to become The Color Association, hat makers took on the responsibility of color forecasting in the textile industry. Following World War I the information and supplies the milners were using from Europe, especially France, was cut off. Textile manufacturers who had grown dependent of these color decisions decided to form their own committee, the TCCA, which immediately published a Standard Color Card.
As industry exploded after the Industrial Revolution certain industries especially in the textiles trade found the need to be able to better predict and set upcoming color and style trends. The Color Association of the United States (CAUS), then the Textile Color Card Association of the United States (TCCA), was formed to accomplish this goal. By implementing a standard, business could then plan upcoming product releases and marketing with better hope of success.
Their Mission:
- Issue color forecasts in the form of cards twice a year
- Give directions in color trends to the market
- Enable different segments of the market to coordinate their products by offering the formulas for the production of each forecast color
- Buy products worldwide knowing they would coordinate at the point of sale
- Serve as an information center for all kinds of color information.
The central purpose of setting trends and maintaining color standards is accomplished to this day in part through publication of the "Standard Color Reference of America", and other swatch books.

whys it say 1.5mill on top, and 15mill on the bottom?Attendance across this picture in a feed of the year’s funniest photos. That was so very long ago that I cannot even remember the year, but I do recall the story that went with the image. A photographer snapped a picture of these characters as they traveled from their hotel to a Comic Con type event. What a funny sight it would have been to see five superheroes in full regalia riding on a subway train! I have always thought that a good caption for this photograph would be: Even superheroes have to go to work.
I laughed at this image, as most people do when they see it for the first time, and the thought that immediately popped into my mind is that these particular superheroes rode the train with everyday folks on their morning commute. They definitely stood out among all the commuters on the way to work, and they were recognizable at a glance because they were in their unique superhero attire. Wearing colorful, out-of-the-ordinary comic book character clothing on a subway will get you noticed.
My next thought was, “What about all the superheroes that walk among us everyday who are not wearing their spandex, masks, or weird hair? Do we notice them, or are they invisible to us sort of like Clark Kent is to the staff of the Daily Planet?” I have always thought that the staff at the Daily Planet must be terribly naïve or have their heads high in the clouds not to recognize the fact that Superman was right there behind those thick horn-rimmed glasses.
I pray that as educators we are not as unobservant as the staff at the Daily Planet. I hope we can see the superheroes that walk our halls even though they are not wearing a big “S” or some other logo emblazoned across their chests. I hope that as educators we can recognize their incredible acts of heroism for which they usually want little to no attention. I also hope we praise their kind spirit and acknowledge them for who they really are and what they do. These superheroes in disguise do so much in service to students that the general public will likely never know.
Here are just a few of the superheroes I have known over the course of my career.
- I know a team of teachers that kept a food pantry (paid for out of their own personal funds) in their classrooms for two siblings who were too proud to apply for free and reduced lunch as high school students, but too poor to purchase their lunch at the school each day.
- I know a teacher who helped a high school student whose family moved while she was at school and left no forwarding address. The student went home to find an eviction notice on the door and the apartment cleaned out. She turned to a person she knew would quiet her tears and help her to a safe place- one of her teachers, who assisted her in getting to a homeless shelter so that she could finish out her senior year.
- I know a school that collected money from the faculty to buy a suit for a young man who had a full-scholarship interview, but did not even own a winter coat much less a suit. They bought him a suit. He got the scholarship, and he is the first in his family to go to college. He went with room, board and tuition fully paid.
I could go on and on. I have hundreds of stories that are examples of selfless acts on the part of teachers, principals, and school staff to help those students who need us most. Educators like these are the real superheroes in the world, and they walk the halls of the schools in this country every day.
I LOVE this!Luft Garden
This private residential park, with its two gazebos and several ponds, dates back to the beginning of the 20th century. The city of Pilsen was later able to restore, reconstruct and then open it to the public in 2010. There are a number of newly planted types of rare woody plants and aged, adult trees that give this garden its one-of-a-kind atmosphere.
Open every first Wednesday of the month
April – October 9:00–18:00

While enjoying a walk through the garden, you are bound to come across column-like oaks near the banks of the lower pond, stunning beech trees, cypresses and rhododendrons. Originally, the garden’s ponds were used for raising and breeding fish. Fish are still caught here today, for instance, in the decorative pond at Mill Race, located in Pilsen’s historic city centre. The Luft Garden also provides a very specific moist environment, meaning you’re sure to see plenty of wildlife. You can expect to find anything from frogs and grass snakes to kingfishers and herons.
Garden renovations
The garden was founded by the Burgers toward the end of the 19th century. Then several generations of the Luft family took care of the garden, until they were forced to sell the space to the government in 1959. From then on, the garden has been used for various breeding purposes. However, no one ever kept up with the garden’s original, pre-war design. At the beginning of the 90s, the garden was left in disarray, having been nearly lost to history.
It wasn’t until 1996 that the Luft Garden underwent renovations. Even though the garden didn’t receive the care it needed, the city of Pilsen was successful in its reconstruction efforts and was able to preserve the space as an isolated example of the region’s pre-war garden architecture. It was first opened to the public in 2010. People tend to gather here during the summer months for various tours, smaller festivals as well as other events. Weddings are also held here. During autumn one of the gazebos serves as a cider mill, open to the public.
 United Nations' nuclear watchdog said Monday that Iran had still not handed over key information to his staff, and that his body's investigation into Tehran's atomic program could not continue indefinitely.
"Iran has yet to provide explanations that enable the agency to clarify two outstanding practical measures," chief Yukiya Amano told the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) Board of Governors in Vienna, echoing a report seen by Reuters last month.
The two measures relating to alleged explosives tests and other measures that might have been used for bomb research should have been addressed by Iran last August.
"The Agency is not in a position to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran, and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities," Amano said.
The West has related concerns that Iran wants to develop nuclear warheads. Tehran has vehemently denied those allegations, saying its nuclear program is entirely peaceful.
Amano added that the IAEA remains ready to accelerate the resolution of all outstanding issues, but "this process cannot continue indefinitely."
The United States and five other powers are seeking to negotiate an agreement with Iran to curb its nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. They have set a March deadline for a framework deal and a June deadline for a final one.
The IAEA is likely to monitor any possible deal between Iran and the six powers in addition to its own investigation into Iran's nuclear program. Amano said he proposed a 1.8-percent increase to the body's $386 million budget given increased demand for its services.
He added that he remained seriously concerned about the nuclear activities of North Korea, which quit the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1993. The IAEA has not had inspectors on the ground there since they were expelled by North Korea in 2009.

Session during election years are usually free of any serious debates but this session was filled with a combination of complicated policy fights over issues like Medicaid and job protections for teachers. Yet lawmakers also spent time entrenched in divisive partisan battles over federal health care reform and whether Congress should be forced to balanced the federal budget.
So who was the most effective legislator this year?
Florida Tribune takes a closer look at a potential list and offers up 10 nominees. This list is by no means exhaustive. But readers can vote for one of the 10 nominees or they can put in another legislator that they believe is most deserving of the title.Paul Loska, PLS

All she had to do was kill the monster. But Shahrzad never expected to find that underneath the leader’s cruel mask was a lonely young man, burdened with an inescapable curse.

Division Director – Kristy BlanchetteMany Fulanis across the Sahel are eager to hear God's Word.
Apr. 15, 2021 | West Africa
Fulani Believers Receive Bibles
[185] prayers in [17] nations have been posted for Fulani Believers.
This year, many Fulani believers have received audio Bibles as part of an ongoing effort to deliver God’s Word among the Fulani tribes in central and northern Sahel. Distributions of Bibles among the Fulani have resulted in many salvations and the spread of the gospel across the Sahel over the past few years as many are eager to hear God’s Word. Pray that these Fulani Christians will grow in their faith as they learn the Scriptures. Pray that many more Muslims in the Sahel will be eager to hear Scripture and will come to know Christ.Xero has taken another stab at MYOB with the launch of free conversions from MYOB to Xero for accountants and bookkeepers in Australia who have signed up to the cloud accounting company’s partner program.
Xero announced at its recent roadshow that it was building an MYOB conversion tool into its “green Xero” partner portal. The service was available to all Xero partners, from Bronze up.
Queensland company Jet Convert was carrying out the conversions with a program that automatically exported the data from MYOB and imported it into Xero.
“We’re at a stage now where the complete conversion process is automated and doesn’t need any human input. We still have a team of people checking what we do to make absolutely sure we’ve got the highest quality conversions,” said Alexander Kohl, managing director at Jet Convert, in a video on Xero’s blog.
Jet Convert said the free automated service would only be available for a limited time. The conversion process took three days and moved across bank transactions, invoices, quotes, orders and credit notes. It also transferred payments, manual journals, payroll entries, contacts and payroll setup with complete employee information.
“Two years ago, we started to develop a tool that … creates the perfect mirrored image of the data in MYOB (so you can) use it in Xero,” Kohl said. “You can do a conversion and the client can continue with their work in Xero without stopping their business.”They Share, You Save.

This month's empties, what I used up, loved, hated
& all my humble opinions in between:
bath: Trader Jacques "French Liquid Soap"- I love the way this hand soap smells, so luxe! | Trader Joe's Strawberry Lemon Sugar Scrub- on the other hand I did not enjoy this product, the strawberry seeds were almost like sticky to the skin and became hard to wash off | Trader Joe's "Cedar Balsam"- I like this scent a lot! & this one seems to travel more than the others | Revlon "Deep Burgundy"- I used this hair color right before my sister-in-laws wedding, this is my tried and true! | Garnier "Raspberry Jam"- just used this one before my gangsta wrapper sweater ootd, loving it! | Neutrogena "Makeup Removed Cleansing Towelettes"- still think the Walmart brand ones are better but these are fine | "Cleanse Well" + "Bathe Well" + "Suds Well" + "Rinse Well" + Aqua Organics Body Bar- all hotel products and I enjoyed them! Did remind me of that scene in Schitts Creek though | Dr. Bronner's "Pure-Castile Bar Soap"- this is a fave, especially in the winter! | Summer's Eve "Island Splash Cleansing Cloths"- a must!
beauty: Bobbi Brown "Remedies"- not sure these do anything for my skin but I am using them up! | Trader Joe's "Coconut Body Butter"- these are a favorite and need them in this cold weather | Urban Decay "All Nighter" - good thing I got a new one but I am going to reuse the sprayer on this one | Suave "sweetpea & violet" - a good standard deodorant | CEO Vitamin C Brightening Serum Sunday Riley- enjoyed this sample and it had a decent amount | Juliette Has a Gun "Musc Invisible"- I really enjoyed this perfume, I would definitely purchase this one! | Sierra Nevada Brewing Co- I have had this for too long but it was a nice chap stick! | Nicka K New York "NY139"- This was my favorite red for a long time but it is past its prime | Morphe "C1.55" concealer- I wanted to like this but I did not, not enough product got on the brush to be able to use it the way I wanted to, a little too dry for my liking."Best New Online Casinos in Australia
It’s understandable that people who have just started their journey into the thrilling world of online casinos often feel puzzled about where to start. The market is so overwhelmed. It seems like every month, several new online casinos appear. That is why it is crucial to learn how to pick up the right one.
However, newbies are not the only ones who may have problems. When you are an experienced player, it seems like nothing can surprise you anymore. You have seen all slot games, all bonuses, and all live dealer rooms. Hold on; the gambling casino industry has lots in store for you.
We are here to lend a helping hand to new and experienced gamblers alike. Read on to find out some secrets online casinos have to help you to choose the right place, to win, and to see that there is no limit to the emotions you can feel!
Golden Pokies 735 is one of the few online casinos that doesn’t just provide Aussie players with their own gambling possibilities. It also monitors other old and new online casinos to create a full list of the most thrilling and profitable online gambling platforms.
Since 2020, the experts of Golden Pokies analyze and try what’s new on the market of online gambling in Australia. They check licenses, have a look at soft providers’ reputations, read players’ reviews, and find out whether the banking system can be trusted.
Top AU Online Casinos
According to the Australian government, it is not against the law to visit online casino sites that have a license. Here is a table, thanks to which you can make an informative decision of whether to give a certain casino a shot or not. All platforms here operate under the law.
Pick a Trusted New Online Casino for Real Money
In order to make a list of places people can trust, it is not enough just to look through websites like Trustpilot (though our experts do that as well). What seems to be more important is to have a look at a state database where you can find when a certain casino site was registered, who owns it, and where the domain belongs.
The process isn’t fast, but the outcome is definitely worth it. Here are things we check before we can take responsibility to recommend certain Australian online casinos.
1. Our Experts Register at Every Casino They Examine
At this point, it is clear how complicated the process is, whether it is straightforward and quick, and how convenient it is. We pay special attention to the fact that some online casinos ask potential clients to send them scans of the ID or passport. This request is fair.
However, the casino must adopt advanced security technologies like data encryption, optical character recognition, or blockchain. If you would like to read about those in detail, go to the Techstory. Most people are not fascinated by technical details, so we spare their time.
2. We Analyze Bonus Systems
Unfortunately, not many players have a habit of reading bonus terms and conditions. We are ready to do it instead. What concerns us the most are hidden terms, as well as unfair and ridiculous wagering requirements.
For example, you think that you are about to get 1,000 AUD as a gift, but your deposit must be 5,000 AUD. Unpleasant surprises may not end here – you may also have some limits, such as only being allowed to spend bonus money on a few dull slots and bet more than 5 AUD per spin.
3. Our Analysts Test Available Payment Options
All payment methods mentioned on the official website must be valid. If there are some fees, they must be stated clearly in a readable font. Using a credit card seems to be a bad idea for some people. That is why additional payment options must be presented. They can be crypto and e-wallets.
4. We Check the Withdrawal Process
According to the responsible gaming policy, a wish to play for real money mustn’t be motivated by a desire to find extra income recourse. Still, withdrawals are just as pleasant and exciting as the gaming experience itself. We made cashouts to check whether or not the time is within the 48-h limit mentioned on the website.
New Aussie Online Casinos
According to the publications of the Australian Gambling Research Center, the Internet’s interactive gambling in Australia has increased over the last 15 years. Mobile gambling is a part of this industry that grows most rapidly.
Right now, Australian law states that the operation of online gaming platforms is legal only in case when online casinos are licensed. According to The Guardian article, players from Australia are now protected from illegal gambling sites more efficiently compared to the 2010s.
Ten years ago, the Australian government became aware of the rapidly increased amount of adults who were engaged in interactive gambling venues on the Internet. For example, the total amount of money people spent on games increased by 5% in 2018. Overall, folks spent $24.887 billion.
Nowadays, the sphere is decently regulated, which resulted in a decreased number of new online casinos in Australia. For new players, however, it’s a positive change as they are dealing with the best Australian online casinos and have nothing to be worried about.
Go Mobile With New Online Casinos in Australia
As the Australian Gambling Research Centre officially states, the bigger part of middle-aged players prefers computers to play online. Still, the majority of young adults stick to their smartphones to enjoy their favourite casino sites.
Both existing and new online casinos can’t just ignore the fact. There are two ways out. Casinos either develop an application or create a special mobile casino mode that adjusts to smaller screens of tablets and phones. Building mobile casinos, however, comes with regulations:
According to Google’s real money online casino policy, online casino gambling applications are enabled in each country according to its laws. For example, in Belgium, only sports betting, lotteries built by governmental developers, and casino games are allowed.
App Store allows only native iOS gambling applications. HTML5 games won’t be distributed through App Store, or at least there won’t be access to lotteries and real money games.
Not to limit gamblers with these restrictions, most online casinos decided against creating an app but for elaborating a mobile browser version.
Interestingly, even among players, there isn’t a clear answer to what is better. Due to Trump’s ban in 2018, App Store had to remove the wrong apps from their marketplace. Accidently some applications, which are not connected with gambling, were also removed. The story was widespread due to BBC News article.
Taking everything into consideration, it seems like a mobile view is the best option now for those who don’t fancy sitting in front of their computers. Mobile device programs have performance just as great as the desktop versions. There is no censorship that we can see in applications.
These are the minimum requirements for a device to be able to perform at Golden Pokies Casino:
Which Phone to Choose for Convenient Gaming
Basically, any smartphone is capable of playing at least some games as long as it has a stable internet connection. The utilization of HTML5 technology enables almost all users to enjoy their favourite games. Still, the UK Tech recommends the following models for the best performance:
- Samsung Galaxy Note 8
- iPhone 11 Pro
- Asus Rog Phone 2
If your phone is not on the list, but it is relatively modern, don’t worry. You are likely to play online casino platforms without any trouble.
Gambling Online With Tablets
Tablets may seem to be more attractive when it comes to mobile gaming because their screens are usually larger.
The best tablets to use are:
- Apple iPad Air 2
- Google Nexus 9
- Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5
- Surface Pro 3
- Sony Xperia Z4
These devices have a large screen (9-12 inches), good resolution (2048 x 1536), and a long-lasting battery (more than 10 hours of active use).
Bonuses for Aussie Real Money Casino Players
If you still have second thoughts about playing at an online casino in Australia for real money, here is something to make you feel better. Here are some typical bonus offers you are entitled to in different online casinos.
1. No Deposit Bonus
This is a kind of casino bonus you get without being obliged to give away your cash. It is granted to your account after registration, for example. Please, note that a live casino will rarely present you with this bonus. Usually, no deposit bonuses are no more than $10-$20 or 20-30 free spins.
2. Welcome bonus
Only newly registered players have a right to get this bonus. A person needs to make a deposit to claim it. Welcome bonuses can contain a large number of free spins (200-300) and some money to play with, reaching even 200% of your first deposit.
At Golden Pokies 735, the welcome offer is fascinating – up to $2,500 and 100 free spins. To get this generous bonus, you need to deposit only $20. Moreover, you can add $30 as the second and the third deposit and get an additional $2500 each time. No wonder people consider it to be one of the top Australian online casinos.
3. Cashback
Cashback is one of the most pleasant casino bonuses. Unfortunately, a seldom casino offers it. When you have lost a certain amount of money in a week, on some weekday (usually Friday or Sunday), you can get 5%-10% or even more back to your account. Generally, you can’t withdraw that money, but you can use them to try your luck again.
4. Tournaments With Prize Pools
You have to get as many points as possible to be able to share a prize pool with 10 or more other players. Some huge prize pools that grow to hundreds of thousands of dollars are shared between 100 people, but the bigger part of the money goes to the top 5 or top 10.
5. Birthday Gifts
Usually, birthday presents from a casino are not very significant but pleasant to get anyway. Just specify your birth date upon registration and get a bonus.
6. Game of the Week or Month Bonus
Some online casinos choose a game (usually, it is a slot), playing which you can get free spins or other bonuses. Please, study the terms carefully to know where and how to reap the benefits.
7. Loyalty Points
Loyalty points are points that you get for special kinds of bets at some games. The more points you get, the higher your rank in a loyalty program is. Each new level brings free spins and extra bonuses, sometimes even money.
8. VIP Club Membership Advantages
The loyalty points program is often combined with the VIP system and VIP clubs. If a casino doesn’t have it, it doesn’t mean it provides you with a poor casino experience.
However, we guess you can imagine how inspiring it feels to be a part of a VIP club. It not only boosts your energy to go on but also grants casino bonuses. Golden Pokies has three levels of the VIP system – Bronze, Silver, and Gold.
Being a part of a club implies lower free bonus wagering requirements (40x, 30x, 20x accordingly), an exclusive invitation to VIP-only tournaments, support from a dedicated VIP account manager, customized promotions, and, when you join in the Silver, automatic entry to VIP raffle that takes place every month. The Gold VIP status reduces withdrawal time. Moreover, every day a small gift will be delivered to your account.
9. Special Offers for Each Day of the Week
The reward allows a player to access daily bonuses that vary depending on the weekday. The best Australian online casinos may surprise their users with a Friday offer to make their weekends more captivating.
Monday gifts are not rare as well – we all know how devastating it may be to go back to a busy workday, especially after noisy weekends.
At Golden Pokies, if you deposit $30 or more, you have a right to obtain 150 free spins per day. This bonus offer can be claimed five times per day from Monday to Friday.
10. Support for High Rollers
Only the very best online casinos show their care for gamblers who are ready to play big. From Monday to Friday for $200 deposits, you will receive a 55% bonus, up to $1000. The more, the merrier! For $500, there will be 65% or up to $1500; and for $800, you will be entitled to get 85%, which can be up to $2000.
Online Casino Payment Options in Australia
Payment options differ from casino to casino. There are some globally accepted methods like Visa, MasterCard (sometimes Maestro), popular e-wallets (Neosurf, Sofort, NetEnt, Skrill). More and more online casinos nowadays accept cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Other digital currencies are less common.
Some of the most popular ways of making a deposit in Australia include PayPal, Skrill, and Neteller. You can still choose other, more convenient for you, deposit methods.
Get Ready for Winning Strategies for Golden Pokies Casino Games in Australia
You will considerably enlarge your odds of winning at any online casino in Australia playing for real money if you read some information about the game beforehand. Naturally, no strategy guarantees you’ll grab a million, but with some knowledge of tricks and rule peculiarities, you have a better chance.
Gamblers who like table games often implement 4 popular newbie-friendly strategies:
- Martingale
- Flat Betting
- Negative betting progression
- Positive betting progression
Roulette
The aim here is to predict correctly where the ball lands. It looks like a game is a piece of pure luck, and that is true. Still, there are some things that will help you to reduce the amount of money you lose.
First of all, place bets not on numbers but on red or black, odd or even, and so on.
Blackjack
There are plenty of blackjack rules. Each one can have its own winning strategy. Make sure you understand the rules when entering an online casino in Australia for real money. The most popular strategy to win is to split your ace and eights. Besides, playing at the table where the dealer stands on soft 17 proves to be useful.
Baccarat
This game is based on comparing a player’s hand and a banker’s hand. There are three variants of baccarat. Keep that in mind when you are about to start playing, and always make sure you know what variant you are currently in.
The most famous strategy to win is to always bet with the banker, as it has a favourable house edge of 1.06%. It would be nice if you steer clear of tie bets, as your chances rise up to 14.36%, which is quite high.
Craps
This is a simple game with two dice. If you throw between 7 and 11, you win. All you need to do to increase your chances is to place low bets and bet on the pass line. Your goal must be to make the house edge as low as possible. That is going to give you the landing result.
Avoid using complicated strategies at the beginning. Make sure you feel comfortable, and every single detail of how the game works is clear for you. After that, it’s high time to try something more sophisticated like the Three-Point Molly strategy. The main idea is to multiply your odds to your come bet by three.
Video Poker
This classic five-card poker is played in the style of a slot machine. To grab huge winnings here, keep in mind to play with good payables only (9/6). Bet five coins per hand to have Flash Royal. As always, manage your bankroll and play responsibly.
Video poker varies greatly from the usual online pokie the majority of players are used to. According to Poker Central, the odds of winning are 1 to 500, which doesn’t look promising. Nevertheless, there is no need to give up. Learning how to combine several winning strategies can improve your situation dramatically.
Customer Support at Golden Pokies Casino
Golden Pokies Casino has a vast section dedicated to FAQ. You are likely to find your answer there. In FAQs, there is detailed information about banking methods, bonuses and promotions, creating a casino account, customer policy, deposits and withdrawals, and many more.
If your issue is more complicated and you need a personal conversation with a specialist, use a live chat. Live chats are usually open for you 24/7, so ask your questions no matter how late or early it is. You can also write about your problem via email. All online casinos have it. Sometimes a phone call is also a possibility.4 Days Uganda Gorilla Safari from Kigali

Anyone in Vegas want to make the over bet for me in Wash wins?
Don't think we'll be seeing Wizards/Mavs in the finals.
I say Washington makes the playoffs.
Finals I got Bucks and Clippers.
I definitely see Was w a better record than Phx, Cha, Mem and the Knicks.
I don't see the Hawks, Chi, OKC or MeM as having better records though. OKC is gutted. How the hell are they going to win any games? Same w the Cavs.
And now you have me rethinking considering Beal signed an extension and doesn't need to prove anything...
Screw it, I still say they make it!

A while ago we reproduced a lightbulb joke, relevant to public health research. We now come back with another one! (source)
– How many public health people does it take to change a lightbulb?
– None; they never do it themselves but ask clinicians to do it and then tell them what a lousy job they did.
Regardless of whether you find the joke funny or not, it reveals some criticism on the lack of connection between public health research and clinical practice, something that is part of knowledge translation and exchange. In an Editorial introducing a new section at the International Journal of Public Health , Louise Potvin and Thomas Abel describe define “knowledge translation and exchange practices as activities or functions that bring together researchers or research results and practitioners in order to build bridges that will increase the science base of practice and the relevance of research“. In this vain, we recently published a study on the development of an online knowledge translation methods registry (available to download for free here) which aims to support evidence-based decision making in public health.
– Do you think the criticisms for the gap between public health research and practice are valid?
– How can they be overcome?
– Do you know any other public health related (lightbulb) jokes?Environmental Topics: Informational Videos 2021

MERCEDESThe lady who really got me into bondage with me was my first wife Mercedes. How we got into it was similar to the things with Betty. However we were at the beach, alone, for a month. Mercedes and I lived in Spain, in a town named Cartagena. Near by, her father had a beach house on the Mediterranean Sea. The first summer we were married we spent our honeymoon at the house.One afternoon, Merce caught me looking at some bondage porn and like Betty;”Does that give you pleasure? Burn it, you have me, I AM your wife and I am to give you pleasure. Who knows, maybe I’ll like it too. We can’t find out unless we try.””Have you seen what some of these girls are doing? Do you mean that I could do this to you and you would..””John, I will do anything to give pleasure, anything” At this stage of the game I was always horny, and my dick never went soft.”Strip and then find me some rope”Merce went into the bedroom, stripped, and went into the courtyard to get some rope. She found a piece about 20 feet long, which I cut up into four lengths. I tied her wrists together, then tied her elbows. Next I tied one end of a section to a overhead beam. I had her stand on a chair while I tied the loose end to the rope between her elbows. I got down and removed the chair, her weight was then supported by her elbows and arms. Her body arch forward, tits hanging down. Then I took a bamboo pole and tied one end to her ankle, spread her legs as far as they would go, and tied the other ankle to the pole. I then took my time and stripped. I approached her and began to caress her body. Bending over to suck her nipples. Lower and lower, I went until I reached her cunt. I put hands between her legs and on her ass to steady her while my lips and tongue went to work on her. My tongue probed deep inside of her, my finger entered and plunged into her ass-hole.”Oh, God, John… yes. no. It hurts so… oh God, harder, give me more…” Her body stiffened, and my mouth tasted her cum. I hadn’t realized it, but I too had cum, I had shot my load all over the tile floor. Slowly I got up, untied her feet. Then I cut her down. Her wrists and elbows were still tied. I pushed her face into my cum on the floor.”Lick it, bitch, every drop. From now on every drop of my cum goes in your mouth if not your cunt or ass-hole. One way or another.” I put my foot on the back of her neck, as she licked the floor clean. “Now bitch, declare me your Master, and yourself as my slave. Declare my right to do as I wish with you.””My Lord John, I declare you my sole Master and affirm your right to do what ever you wish with me at any time.” With that I untied her and rubbed her arms back to life. I took her in the bedroom and laid beside her;”Merce, You have set my brain as well as my cock and balls on fire. There are some things that I have to get in town, is there anything you want?””Yes, my father said that you should stop by his office today. He has a surprise for us.””Any idea on what it is? He already has given us so much.””Sorry Master, I have no idea”I caught the bus into town, and went to my father-in-laws office first thing. My father-in-law was a high ranking officer in the Spanish Navy, and was one of the kindest men I have ever had the pleasure to meet.”Good Morning, John. I guess Merce told you I have something for you. Just to save you time and wonder, it’s a week-end in Morocco for you”. I was stunned, Merce and I had always wanted to go, and had talked about it many times. Morocco is straight across the sea about 150 miles. I thanked Don Jose, and came back to the cabin without getting the things I wanted to get. As I came into the door, I was very excited, and as soon as I told her, Mercedes was too.The next day we boarded the ship in the harbor of Cartagena. All of the in- laws were there to see us off. What a day, twelve hours later we disembarked in Melilla, Morocco. Our hotel was nothing special, and after getting settled in our room, we went into the market place to see what there was to see. After several hours of wandering, we noticed that the people were looking at us strangely as if we were not to be there. As soon as we turned the corner we knew why. There was a slave market.We watched as a couple men were sold, and then they brought out a young girl of maybe 18 or 19. She was not very pretty, but then not ugly. It was the way she was dressed that caught my eye. She was totally naked except for some leather straps. A wide, maybe 2-3 inches, strap was around her neck. It had many steel rings fastened to it, as well as buckles. Around the base of her breasts were other leather straps, pulled very tight. This emphasized her tits. Then there were more straps between the neck collar and the breast straps. Around her waist was another wide strap/belt, again with rings and buckles. From this belt there was a two inch strap that ran between her legs and separated her cunt lips. Off to the side were two additional straps that crossed at a point between her legs. All three of these fastened to the waist strap in the back. Her wrists were handcuffed behind her , and there was small strap that fastened the handcuffs to the back of her neck collar.In my mind I knew that I had to get a set of these straps for Merce. After a few more girls were sold, including one I knew was an American, the auction was then over. I went to the man who was in charge and after some argument, bought a set of the wonderfully useful straps. Mercedes knew that I had obtained the straps for her, but she did not say a word about them. We spent the rest of the day sight-seeing and we made some purchases. I bought seven sets of plain gold earrings and two sets of long dangly ones for Mercedes. I told her that she would understand when we got back home. The next day we continued with our tourist trip and purchase of tourist items including a cat- o-nine tails. At 4 P.M. we boarded our boat back to Cartagena. Early the next morning we arrived at the pier. It was only 5 A.M. and the town was just waking up. I decided that we should not go straight home but have breakfast at the Gran Hotel, then head home.We arrived at the house in time to have coffee with Don Jose before he went off to work. Mercedes passed out the presents to all who were there. I asked permission of Mercedes father to move into the beach house on a full time basis. This would give them back their home and give Mercedes and I privacy. Mercedes and I packed all the belongings that we could move at one time and Don Jose promised to send a truck to move us. Since we didn’t have furniture, there was just clothes,and books, (many books). With the help of the Spanish Navy we got moved in half a day. We then spent the rest of the afternoon on the beach. The sun started to set and Merce went in to make supper. I went into the bedroom and began to unpack the goodies from our trip. I had only six days left on my leave before I had to report back to the base for duty.After supper Merce and I were laying in bed talking about nothing much of importance. I was wearing only a pair of briefs. These briefs had no opening like normal ones, they had a small hole about the size of a dime with elastic around it. Merce had on panties like a string bikini, barely covered her cunt, and no bra. I started to tell Merce of all the things I could do with her new set of straps;”Don’t tell me Master. Show me. It has been several days.”I guess that was the cue I had been waiting for, I was out of bed like a flash and got the straps from their place. Merce had removed her panties and stood waiting for what was to come. First I fastened the wide strap about her throat, then I had her bend over from the waist so that I could fasten straps Around the base of her breasts. I pulled them as tight as they would go. This emphasized her tits. Then there were more straps between the neck collar and the breast straps. Around her waist went another wide strap, with rings and buckles. From this belt there was a two inch strap that ran between the her legs and separated the pussy lips. Off to the side were two additional straps that crossed at a point between her legs. All three of these fastened to the waist strap in the back. Her wrists were tied behind her, and there was small strap that fastened the tied wrists to the back of her neck collar.”Lord John; this is painful. Please lets stop, I can’t take this. Please stop…” I sealed her mouth with her panties and some wide tape.”You are going to take it, and more, and even enjoy it, sweet slave.”I put her high heels on her and walked her to the dining room. Tied a rope to the beam overhead, then tied the bitter end to her wrists and neck band. Then I went back to the bedroom and got the earrings, a large needle, alcohol, and my lighter. Merce’ eyes told the story, there was both terror and wonder in them when she saw what I had. I opened the buffet and took out some thread and a candle. I ran the thread around the candle to wax it, then light the candle. Next I threaded the needle and then got it hot in the flame. I approached Merce, and pierced her left nipple. Quickly I cut some of the thread off and left it in the new hole, re-threaded the needle and pierced the right nipple in the same way. Then I removed the waxed thread from her nipples, and replaced it with the dangling earrings. Her breasts looked exquisite with their new additions. I freed Merce from the overhead rope, and told the her to walk around the room. As she walked about, I noticed the bounce of her tits, and the swing of the new ‘tit rings”.”O.K. slave, sit on the table, and lay back after I free your hands.”Merce sat on the edge of the dinning table, tears streaming down her face, as I untied her wrists from the collar, and each other. Then she lay back and I retied her wrists to the legs of the table. Next I tied her legs open to the table legs. I approached her and sank my dick into her cunt. With my cock buried deep in her, I told her how I was going to pierce the lips of her cunt, five times each, and install the gold rings. These were to be known as ‘cunt rings”. I also told her that I had more straps to add to her misery, and my enjoyment. I withdrew from her box, and got my needle and thread. I began to sew her cunt with a whip stitch. Each time the needle pierced her, Merces eyes showed the pain, but she refused to cry out, my cock got hardier. Once the ten holes were made, I began to get hardier and I began to replace the thread with the cunt-rings. For the last set I used the second pair of dangling ‘cunt-rings’.”Before I free you, I want you to understand that you are to wear these rings at all times, unless I remove them. Even when you go shopping or visit your mom, talk to your friends or go to Mass.” With that I freed her from the table. I went and got the next set of straps. Upon returning, I had my slave kneel on the table top. With a set of four inch wide straps, I fastened her ankles to her thighs. The next set of straps fastened her elbows together, another her wrists, and the last was placed between the elbows and shoulders. Her panties went back into her mouth with the tape covering istanbul escort it. Then the bitter end of the rope from the overhead beam was looped through her wrist ropes, and pulled up taut. Mercedes was now standing on her knees. With my enlarged cock before me, I walked up to her, and removed her gag. Without a moment to argue, I plunged my cock into her mouth.”Suck me good, or your cunt will get twenty-five lashes with the cat-o-nine tales you wanted so much”Mercedes began to suck, and use her lips in a way that made me feel like I was in heaven. It took only a few minutes for my balls to explode into her mouth. I froze, trying to prolong this wonderful feeling. I removed my limp dick from her mouth.”You damned bitch, you made me cum too fast. I’m going to leave you there for another half hour, then your pussy gets the cat. Think about that while you wait.”I placed the gag back in her mouth, and left the room. I lay in bed to read a bondage magazine. Before I realized it, it had been nearly an hour before I got back to Mercedes. Quickly I released her, rubbed life back into her arms and legs. Merce could hardly talk. When she had begun to recover from her ordeal, I reminded her of the gift that her cunt was promised. She sat on the edge of the table, and I tied her ankles to its’ legs. Then I laid her down and tied her wrists to the legs at the other end. Going quickly to the bedroom, I got the cat, and returned to the awaiting slave. No gag this time, I wanted to hear her screams and moans. Besides there was no one to hear her beside myself. I raised the cat into the air, and brought it down squarely between her legs.”A H H H H H H, GOD, JOHN, STOP, PLEASE OH GOD PLEASE STOP”Again, and again the cat fell, until it had counted to twenty-five. Her pussy was cut, and welts were raised on it. Her inner-thighs were also welted and cut. I couldn’t resist, I got down and began to kiss, lick and suck on her injured cunt. My prick was hard and needed a place to be. And the place for a cock that is hard was in Mercedes’ cunt. Standing up, I slipped it into her. The heat from her pussy was good, as well as tight. It did not take long before Mercedes’ body began to try to join in, coming up to meet my downward stroke, moans of pleasure replaced the cries for mercy. No mercy was being asked for now, only no mercy. That is what she got. In and out, up and down. Sweat coming out, the cunt-rings pressing into my crouch.”AH H H H H H H H.H…….” We both came. I lay on top of her… LATER….”I Love you Mercedes, only you have done so very much for me””John, when I met you, I knew nothing about sex. Now you have taught me well, and I feel all of it. Even the pain feels good and I want more and more all the time. Because when I feel the pain, I know that I shall feel hot and satisfied soon. Don’t ever stop loving me, please don’t.”As soon as I freed Mercedes, we took a shower, and went to bed to get some well needed sleep. In the morning, I woke up first. After a hot shower, and went into the kitchen and made coco and churos. Then I took a tray into Mercedes. She was still not wake. I looked at her wonderful face, at her cut pussy, the welts on her thighs. The thoughts were beginning to make my cock hard. I put down the tray and got back into bed. I started to snuggle with her, and my hand went to her cunt by instinct. A finger parted those hot, wet lips and began to dive into the cave of love. Merce moaned, and her hand reached for my cock. Slowly she began to stroke it, and held it tight. As Merce stroked my cock, my finger was joined by a second, and they went deeper into her realm of good feeling.”Oh lord John, yes, oh yes, oh it’s so-o good, yes — slow yes slow. Slow and hard, oh Good… I can taste it, s.o.o.o good yes oh yes. Give it to me, let me taste you, in my mouth, God John, give it to me….”I moved up, and she released my prick. Her tits looked so very inviting. I took hold of her tits, and held them together as if trying to make one large tit. My cock slid between them and re-appeared just under her chin. Her hands moved quickly, and replaced my own. My hands moved to her head. I held her head up so that I could slid my cock further, and into her mouth. Merce held her lips in a tight circle, that welcomed my cock into her mouth. She made her tongue work on my cock, while she created a soft suction. Faster and faster I moved in and out of her home-made cunt. My balls began to tighten, they were ready to explode. Then with no further warning, they did explode. It seemed like I poured gallons of my love juice down her throat. She swallowed hard and often. And we both relaxed.”Merce, that was something else. Oh lord Mercedes, you are good…, Hey, I made some other good stuff for us”Later that night I thought that we should go out to eat, so I called ‘Recon de Pepe’ in Murcia for reservations. One of the best things at Pepe’s is Strawberries and ANY time of the year. Fresh strawberries. At quarter of ten, we arrived at Pepe’s. After a cocktail in the lounge, our table was ready, and we sat down to some just plain good food. Mercedes was such a turn on in her dress with a very tight bodice, full skirt. After a wonderful meal, we ordered the famous ‘strawberries and cream’ for desert. The cream was rich goats cream. The huge bowl of berries came lightly sugared, and contained more strawberries then we could possibly eat. At that moment I had an idea to make these huge berries taste even better. I whispered for Merce to raise her skirt to the edge of the table cloth, and spread her legs wide apart while sitting on the edge of her seat. Taking a huge berry by its’ stem, I took it below the table, and found her cunt. Merce spread the lips of her pussy, and I put the strawberry into her. Removing it, I sucked on it until the stem came loose. It was better than ever, Pepe would never know how sweet his berries were. With each berry, Merce became hotter and hotter, and I was not far behind. By the time we got to the 16th one;”John, in and out, in and out… s l o w l y. A H H H —– H …”Mercedes came. She just slumped there, and I was left high and dry.”My dear, when we get home, you are due for a surprise.Arriving back home, I was indeed very hard for I knew what I had planned. I had Merce strip down to her garters, stockings, and high-heels. Moving into the living room, I got my riding crop, and put it on the table beside my chair. Then getting some rope, I tied Mercedes arms behind her.”Now you will kneel before my chair and suck me off. You have ten minutes to get me off. And I will help you with the riding crop.””After ten minutes I’ll time you and for each minute you will have to provide a young girl for my enjoyment, and you will receive 10 blows with the cat. The young girl you get for me will have to be between 18 and 21, a virgin with no experience of any sexual kind. Are you ready?””Yes Master”I knew that she was thinking of how hot I was because of the strawberries. Going into the bedroom I stripped down and put on the black bikini briefs that had only a small dime sized hole for my cock. I was at full erection when I put my cock through the opening, and returned to the slave. Sitting down, I spread my legs, and pulled her head forward. As her lips touched my dick, I picked up the riding-crop. The first blow fell on her tender ass, as her mouth took more and more of my cock into her mouth. The slaves tongue worked against the skin of the love-rod she was trying to consume. The crop fell again. Her lips were working. The crop fell again, and again. As her head bobbed to and fro. Again the crop fell on that lovely ass. THE ALARM SOUNDED…………….I pressed my stop watch, I must have, although I really don’t remember doing so. I do remember my dick getting tighter and tighter, and my raining blows with the riding-crop on her ass.”A H H H H H H”My milk pumped into her hungry mouth. I felt completely drained as I looked down at my watch.”Three minutes and 12 seconds. Three young virgins for my pleasure.”I explained what and how she was to provide me as I untied her.”They must be girls you know now, not something you pick up off the street. You must tell them that they will be fucked, sucked, and do sucking of their own. They will give and get face to each other as well as you. They must be able to spend the entire week-end. They will also assist me in tormenting you. They must know everything when I walk into the room. They must also be naked when I come in. Do you understand?””Master I understand, but I don’t think that I can get any virgins for you.” I slapped her face.”Bitch. You will get them, or you will pay by being branded on your ass. Is THAT clear?””Yes, very clear”The next morning, when I awoke, Merce had hold of my cock, like a c***d with its favorite toy. It was hard, and I rolled over on her wonderful body, and slid it into her pussy. Her eyes fluttered,”Oh y e s s s, Oh y e s s s, faster, harder”It really didn’t take much, I had not recovered from last night. I came. As we lay there, we talked about what she was to do today. By the time she left, Merce was ready to do her duty. She was to be back by 8PM.At the appointed hour, I heard voices approaching the gate of the courtyard. I went up the stairs so that I could watch without being seen. Merce would know where I was, but the young ladies would not. Merce had done very well. All three young ladies were very good looking. She led them into the living room. Merce was talking…”Girls, I’ve explained what I want you to do for me, and I do really owe you a lot. Now you are to strip and wait for our master. But if any of you want to back out, do it now. I will understand, really.”I could see and hear well from my vantage.”Junita, do you wish to go?” “No. I have wondered about sex for so long, and I will now find out, and not be alone when I do. No Sra., I will stay.””Inez?” “I feel the same.””Nina?” “Me too. I’m staying.”The girls began to remove their clothes. All of their hair was dark, dark brown or black. Their tits were well formed, and not too much, yet quite enough to play with. All had hair covering their pussies to a greater or lessor degree. Inez’s pussy was almost bald except for a very few curly wisps. Merce then told them to finger one girls pussy, and to gently pinch the other girls nipples. They giggled slightly, then their hands moved to their tasks. Slowly the fingers touched pussies and nipples. Then fingers entered pussies. Within moments glazed looks shown on the girls faces. It was time for me to make my entrance. When I walked into the room, the girls did not see me. They were lost in their feelings of new found sex. I whispered to Merce to strip and make sure that her tit-rings, and pussy-rings were in place. I walked up behind Nina, and gently moved the hbd in her pussy away, replacing it with my own. I gently kissed her neck, and played with the unoccupied nipple. A moan escaped her young lips. She started to turn toward me, but as she did, I moved behind avcılar escort Inez. In doing so, I put Inez’s hand back to Juanita’s pussy , and repeated what I had done for Nina. Then on to Jaunita. Merce returned to the room completely nude, except for her rings. I then quietly told the girls to continue, but to do it to themselves, and for Nina to come over in front of me.”Unbutton my shirt, Juanita, then kiss my nipples”Slowly her fingers left her pussy and tit, as she unbuttoned my shirt and removed it. Then she bent forward and her lips kissed and sucked gently on each of my nipples.”Now Nina, I want you to kneel in front of Merce, spread the lips of her pussy, and lick and suck until Inez replaces you. While you lick Merce, let your hand play with your own pussy. Inez come here.”Slowly Nina sank to her knees before Merce. I know she was having second thoughts, but was caught up in the feelings, these new feelings that were so very good. Her hand went to Merce’ pussy and spread the lips. Then her face, with tongue extended, met Merce hot slit. At the same time Inez came up to me.”Inez, remove my shoes, socks, and pants. Then kiss and lick my balls.”Inez knelt on the floor and removed my shoes and socks. Then she straightened up, while still kneeling, and unfastened my belt and buttons. With her thumbs, she hooked my under shorts and pulled them down with my pants. My cock was at full attention, and it hit Inez in the chin as it was released from their prison. She looked up at me in full surprise. Once she had the pants off of my legs, I spread them. Inez, came up and began to kiss, lick and fondle my balls. I didn’t know how much more I could take, so I ordered her to replace Nina, and for Nina to go back to playing with herself. Jaunita was to come before me and suck on my prick. Jaunita placed herself in the right place. Her tongue touched the head of my cock, then her lips took hold of the cocks head. Slowly she sucked more and more of it into her mouth, as her tongue worked the sides of it.”Stand up Jaunita.”With seemingly great reluctance she stood. She was only five foot tall. I picked her up until the head of my cock slid into the groove of the pussy. I carried her over to the table. Laying her on the library table, I shoved my cock into her hot and tight pussy. Her pussy was very tight. A moan of pain and of pleasure came from her lips. I could see from her face that she was happy to be fucked, and that pain was a pleasure for her. Slowly I entered and retreated from her pussy . Her hips rose to me my downward plunge. A heavier moan escaped her lips to let me know she had had her first climax, just as I came. Filling her with her first load of cum.Applause. Applause from the others, greeted Jaunita and I, as we came back to reality. Quickly I ordered the girls into the shower. I forbade them from cleaning their own bodies, and only one girl at a time was to be cleaned. All three were to be in the shower at the same time. This in itself would not be hard since the shower was a large place, two meters by three, (6 feet by 9 feet). As the young ones were taking their showers, Merce and I took time to clean up the mess we had made, and while Merce prepared supper, I got the bedroom ready. I had cleared out the largest bedroom, and then laid out matresses wall to wall. Then placed the pillows so that I would have two females on each side of me. No ego problem here. When I returned to the main room, the girls were helping Merce set the table. They had dressed themselves in bikinis I had provided. Soon the meal was over, tables cleared, dishes washed. We sat around the table and talked of many things, all of them dealt with sex. I had Merce bring out the collection of straps, gags, and clamps. Rather than tell them about these toys I thought it better to let them see, or rather wear them, first hand. First I would use the slave bra, and since the slave bra was intended to emphasize small breasts in order to make a female slave more appealing at the slave market, I decided to use the largest titted of the trio and that was Nina. The use of a large breasted female would emphasize the effects of the bra.I had Nina remove her top. And as I fastened the collar around her neck. Merce kneaded, pulled and squeezed her nipples. Next I placed the base straps around the base of each tit, and pulled them tight. The straps between the breast straps and the collar were adjusted to provide lift. The result did indeed show the effects as desired. Nina screamed as I clamped the nipple clamps, with 2 ounces of weight each, on. But a ball gag fitted to her mouth by Merce shut the noise off. Next I tied her wrists above her head, and suspended her, next to the wall, from the rope overhead. Then proceeded to tie her legs at the knee and ankles. My attention then turned to Jaunita. For her I selected a group of straps called ‘The Sleeve’. After stripping her, Merce fastened a wide leather collar about her neck. This collar had several rings set into the outside. To one of the rings in the back, was fastened the middle link of a pair of handcuffs. I twisted Jaunts arms behind her back, and fastened her wrists in them. Next came a second wide belt. This belt buckled and locked in the back. In the middle of the front, a second strap of leather was riveted. This strap was one inch wide, tapered to three inches at the other end. Additionally, in this strap, were set two plastic tubes. The first of these tubes was two and a half inches in diameter, and four inches long. The second was one and three quarters inches in diameter, and six inches long. While passing the strap between her legs, I first inserted the first into her pussy, and the second into her asshole. This was not done without some difficulty. Neither of her holes was really large enough to take anything of that respective size. During her ‘fitting’, she moaned and cried.”Jaunita, I want you to understand, that this device is to allow you to be fucked in either hole, without you having control. As a slave you control nothing. Now I want you to get a pail of hot water, and mop the patio. Come back when you are done. Inez, strip off everything, and come here”She left to do her task, walking like a bow-legged cowboy. I chuckled a little about this as I turned to Inez. For her I had chosen the breast press. The breast press consists of two pieces of quarter inch plywood, the top being three inches wide, and f******n inches long. The bottom was six inches wide, and f******n inches long. One inch from each end, and in the middle, two inches from the rear edge there were bolts four inches long. The breasts were placed between these boards, and the the bolts tightened to the desired tightness. Then a cord was tied about each nipple and pulled taut, and tied to a tiny cleat on the underside of the wider board. Inez cried as her nipples were pulled. Her crying was delightful to my ears as she begged to be released. Instead I turned her around and tied her elbows together. Then I took her across my naked lap, my erection pressed into her stomach. My hand fell on her tender white ass. Her muscles tightened, her asshole puckered, and a cry came from her mouth. Pure music. Again and again my hand fell, leaving red hand prints. Tears flowed from her eyes, and cry’s for mercy from her lips. Nina still squirmed against the wall, as she tried to free her tits of their tormentors. Just then Jaunita returned, an knelt before me.”Sr. i have done my task. Will you please free me of the sleeves?””No. I will do so before bed. I will release all of you then, but not until. Right now, Merce and I are going to fuck, and all are to watch, and be quiet.”I dumped Inez on the floor and walked up to Merce. Gently taking her in my arms, my lips met hers. Our tongues fought. My hands slid slowly down her back to the firm globes of her ass. I stroked her ass as my lips left hers, and traveled down her neck then down her breast and on to her nipple. Taking hold of the titring, and pulling it with my teeth. Slowly she started kissing her way down my body until she knelt on the floor. Her lips parted and her tongue licked the length of my cock until she came to it’s head. Here her mouth opened and engulfed it. slowly she moved back and forth along it’s length, until my entire cock was in her mouth. Without taking my prick from her mouth, I walked around her until I was behind her. Her head was bent back. I reached over her shoulder, and took hold of her tit-rings, and pulled on then as Merce continued to suck. After a few moments I let go of the rings, and withdrew from her mouth. Merce lay on the cold stone floor and bent her knees as she spread her legs. I knelt between her legs and feed my cock into her pussy. She placed her legs over my shoulders to allow me greater penetration into her. Slowly we moved together, then apart. Faster and faster. The sweat began to pour from both of us. Suddenly Merce stiffened, and I followed as I poured my cream into her bowl. We lay there for what seemed a very long time. Then we got up. I went to the bathroom to piss and wash. When I returned, Merce and I began to free the new slaves from their bondage.”Now off to bed after you wash up. NO CLOTHES IN BED. Merce and Inez next to me. Jaunita next to Merce, and Nina next to Inez. Now hurry, in bed in twenty minutes.”During the night I had to get up and take a whiz. When I returned to the bedroom I saw a wonderful sight. Four naked ladies in various positions laying on the floor. Through the shutters moonlight streamed across their bodies. I was particularly struck by Inez. She lay with her arms to her sides, and her legs spread. The moonlight across her bald cunt. I just could not resist the temptation. I quietly knelt between her legs. Bending forward, my lips gently met the lips of her pussy, my tongue parted those lips. I began to lick and suck that wonderful cunt. As I worked, moans came from her lips. Soon her hands were on top of my head, pressing downward. I turned around without leaving her cunt, so that my dick touched her lips. She must have been at least semi-awake, as her lips sucked me in, and her tongue began to work on me. One of her hands left my head and went to my ass, and here applied pressure keeping my cock in her mouth. Her tongue worked like that of an expert. It took all I could muster to disengage from her, but I did manage. I turned around again and slid my cock into that hot and tight box. Inez just smiled, and within minutes her hips were working correctly. I felt like a k** getting his first ass. The feeling was good, and I didn’t notice the tightening in my balls at first. But before long I exploded into her. A great moan escaped from her lips.”You have made me a woman. Thank you Master. I love you.”Without a word, we turned over and went back to sleep. The next morning would be very busy for us all.The sun woke us all about the same time. It was very warming to the skin. Merce rose, slowly. Stretching and yawning.”Do you really want breakfast? After all you did have a mid-night snack.Come on girls, lets get the şirinevler escort Master another breakfast.” As soon as they left the room I got up and put on a pair of leather briefs and went into the dining room. The smell of bacon and eggs mixed with fresh coffee filled the air. I turned and went into the court-yard. Under the east overhang were some toys covered by a large tarpaulin. I removed it and revealed the stocks, spanking block and the horse.The horse was really nothing more than a small roof mounted on a stand. From the ground to the peak was six feet high, each side was four feet long and three feet wide. The two sides fitted together at a forty-five degree angle. This peak was very sharp and was covered with standard roofing material, making it very rough.The spanking block is made of oak, and measures two an a half feet square. On each end were two sets of straps to fastened the arms and legs. A wide strap went side to side to hold the back down, ant there were two holes, five inches in diameter, drilled in the top of the block towards the front end. These holes were four inches deep, and each had a plunger coming from the side, which when released, would hold fast the tit within its hole.The stocks were about 110 cms high. The victim had to stand stooped over, with their feet locked in a wooden vise. With their legs spread about three feet. Then their hands set on a horizontal bar, and locked in place with a second bar. Then the neck is locked in place by placing the neck in a groove in the second board, and then placing a third board on top. All three boards are then locked in place at the sides. This device puts a person between 4’10” and 5’9″ at a rough 90 degree angle. This added to the general discomfort.Breakfast was small, but very good. As soon as it was over, and the dishes washed and put away, I ordered the girls to shower, and to appear in the courtyard, naked. Once there, they positioned these larger toys as instructed. Merce came out of the house with a riding crop and a hat.””Girls”, she said, “inside this hat are three folded pieces of paper. Upon each is written one word. Stock, horse and block. You will draw one of these and then play with the toy you drew. For the stocks you will be placed in them until the Master releases you. The horse entitles you to ride until told not to, and the block will get you strapped down, and at least ten kisses from this whip on each of the tender globes of your ass. Then you will …. er.. You may be fucked by the Master. That may mean that He will fuck your cunt or your ass. Draw…”Jaunita walked up and drew, then Nina, and Inez. Each displayed their toy. Jaunita had drawn the stocks, Nina the block, leaving the horse to Inez.As the others watched, Merce and I took Inez and tied her arms behind her, each wrist to the opposite elbow. Then we slipped a hard rubber ring, eight inches in diameter, on each leg. Then forced her to kneel. Her ankles were then tied to her upper thighs, with the rings positioned at the knees. Lastly, before mounting the horse, a wide belt was fastened about her waist. Then Merce and I lifted Inez onto the horse, with one leg on each side. Merce fastened a rope from the roof to a ring set in the wide belt about her waist, sort of a safety line so she would not fall to the ground. The point of the horse and the small stone of the roofing materials cut into the tender flesh of her cunt. The crack of her ass, and the lips of her pussy were separated. Next we attached concrete blocks with ropes to the rings at her knees. This added weight pulled her down more, and added to her pains. Then came the nipple clamps with four oz. of weight were the final touches, except for the itching powder blown on her cunt.Merce then led Jaunita to the stocks and locked her feet in. Merce continued putting Jaunita into the stocks, as Inez began to moan and cry. Nina was looking very nervous. She knew that she was was going to suffer direct pain, in addition to the indirect pain the others were feeling. When Merce finished with Jaunita, I added a finishing touch by putting a large, 1.5 inch dia., candle up her ass and lit it. In fact the hot wax would not fall on her, and the flame would most likely go out long before it reached her, but she didn’t know that.I marched Nina to the block, knelt her down, and spread her legs. Then the straps were fastened behind her knees, and upper thighs. Next she was laid on the block, plungers withdrawn, tits fitted to their holes. Plungers released after the straps secured her upper arms and above the elbows. A scream issued from her as those plungers were released. The back strap was fastened. Merce handed me the whip. Taking the whip, I drew a line softly across both cheeks of her lovely ass. I knelt down, putting the whip down, and with my hands separated those cheeks. Opening a drawer in the bottom of the block, I took out a strap of leather. It was 2 inches wide at one end and four at the other. The narrow end was fastened to the block, just under her cunt, drawn up between the cheeks of her ass, separating them, and the wide end then fastened to the strap across her back. Stepping back, I picked up the whip and again drew a line. Swiftly I applied five stripes across left cheek. Screams cut through the air, joining the cries and moans of Jaunita and Inez. Merce took the whip from me as I handed it to her, she applied five more to the right cheeks. While she was doing this, the stripes on her left cheek raised into welts. Merce then handed the whip back to me, and I applied the last five for the left cheek.As Merce gave Nina her last five, I walked over to Inez. She had broken out into a sweat, and her tear stained face was twisted with the agony she was feeling. Her cunt was red from the friction. She was almost ready to have a kiss or two from my riding crop. Then I would screw her using a french tickler. That ought to give her a thrill.Crossing back to Jaunita.”Please Sir, remove the candle. I can feel the heat, please.”Without complying, I pulled roughly on both nipples, commenting to myself that they would be good for nipple caps.Back I went to Nina.”Nina, I haven’t decided to use your ass or cunt, but don’t worry. In five minutes one of them will be entertaining me.”I walked behind her, and unfastened the cheek spreader. Merce came up to me an knelt down before me, and took down the leather briefs. My cock was already fairly hard, but she took it in her mouth to bring it to full size. With a few licks along its full length, I removed it from her mouth, knelt behind Nina, and plunged it fully into her cunt. A cry came from her throat. The cause being her tender ass, and the fact her cunt was compressed by being strapped down. She would have been a tight fight in any case, being a virgin until that moment. As I slid the love meat in and out of her love tunnel, her cries turned to moans of pleasure. I could tell she was trying to move her body with mine. Before I could fill her with cream, her body stiffened, she had had her first climax. I kept pumping. Soon my balls exploded into her, and as I withdrew, I left a trail of cum.Merce knelt to lick my cock clean. Then I returned to Jaunita. Pulling the unlit candle from her ass, I began to unlock her prison. Once her wrists were free, I re-handcuffed them in front of her. Then I completed the task of freeing her.”Jaunita, first free Nina, then you assist Merce for now, and you will administer punishment to Inez, once I get her off the horse. But for now follow Merce and do as she directs or suffer for it.”I took my time cutting the ropes that held the cement blocks, and untying the safety rope. I lifted Inez from the horse and set her on the ground. She collapsed crying her head off. Just then Merce and Jaunita reappeared. Jaunita was carrying two block of wood and a bamboo cane. Merce had a basin of warm water, and a bar of soap. I turned Inez over on her back, and Merce began to gently to wash the itching powder remaining from her cunt. Meanwhile Jaunita set the two blocks on the ground, about three feet apart. She lay the bamboo cane between the blocks, and then returned to the inside of the house. In an instant she reappeared with a large pillow, which she placed to form a triangle with the blocks. Merce and Jaunita lifted Inez up, and placed her knees on the blocks, and her head on the pillow. She was ready for further pain.”Inez, you are going to receive some strokes with the bamboo cane, to your inner thighs, and pussy. Jaunita is going to do the honors. If you fall, you will receive five more. If you manage to keep from falling you will get fewer strokes. Jaunita proceed in the manner Mercedes told you.”Jaunita picked up the cane, leaving the free end on the ground. She brought it up sharply, directly into the crease between the pussy lips. A cry came from Inez…”GOD, no.. P L E A S E…. OH MASTER…. STOP..”A second, third and forth blow followed swiftly. Still Inez didn’t fall. Jaunita shifted her attention to the inner thighs. Here her aim was to add five strips to each. When it was done, Inez fell over, full of pain and emotionally exhausted. This would be a very good time to fuck her, but I had other ideas. Merce untied her ankles and arms to rub life back into them. Next she covered her with a wet sheet. It was time to move on to other things.I went into the spare bedroom and got a double ended dildo from a drawer, and returned to the courtyard. Walking up to Jaunita I ordered her to spread her legs and to squat slightly. As soon as she had done so, I slipped the shorter end of the dildo into her box. Moans came from her as I was not slow or gentle in doing so. Next I tied the dildo to her with the straps provided.”All right Jaunita, you are to fuck Nina. Get to it.”With a very puzzled look on her face, she walked over to where Nina lay. Slowly she knelt between Nina’s legs, and fitted the head of the dildo to her cunt. Nina was equally surprised at what was going on. Slowly Jaunita shoved the dildo home then withdrew. Then in and out. Slowly at first, increasing faster and faster. Soon both were uttering the rough sounds of enjoyment. Jaunita was the first to cum, but she was quickly followed.Time now for my own enjoyment. I pulled Merce to me and stuck my forefinger up her cunt.”Yea. The right temperature, fuck me bitch.”I lay on the ground and Merce knelt over me, impaling herself on my shaft.”Jaunita, get over here. Get down between us and lick us both as we screw. Do it now.”She got down between our legs, and in an instant I felt her tounge work on both of us. I knew that this would bring us both off very quickly. Merce was pumping at an accelerated pace. The faster she worked the faster Jaunita’s tongue worked. I could feel the pressure building. Oh GOD how I wanted to hold off, but to no avail. My cum flowed into Merce’s cunt and onto Jaunita’s tongue. I pushed Merce off and took Jaunita by the hair.”Clean me off, cunt. Nina get over here and go 69 with Merce.”Jaunita fell to her job quickly, and Nina knelt above Merce. Merce couldn’t wait, she grabbed Ninas hips and brought her cunt to her lips. Nina’s tongue parted Merce’s cunt and began its work. The moaning and groaning from all of us became very loud, until one by one we came.The rest of the week-end was spent in much the same manner. I remained in Spain another four years, and the girls and Merce continued to serve me. From time to time they would bring me others to taste the honey of slavery.THE END.Geri

What Is Paper Hangers Insurance?General liability insurance covers third parties like clients and any other people who are not associated with your project in case of a claim. However, general liability insurance can’t account for every potential accident that comes from every type of profession, contracting work especially. Paper hangers’ insurance fills in those gaps by covering claims that are specific to the profession, keeping you safe at nearly every turn. There are five common categories of claims paper hangers’ insurance can cover, should they ever occur. We want to provide you with examples connected to each category, that way you have a good idea what this unique form of coverage can protect you against.
- Injuries to the Body: If there is any physical harm inflicted upon a client or any other third party, paper hanger’ insurance can cover it
- Example: The client’s child picks up an unsecured X-Acto knife and accidentally cuts themselves with it.
- Damages to the Property: Any damage that is lasting and unwanted, especially aesthetic in the case of a painting company
- Example: A can of epoxy spills onto the living room carpet, forcing the client to replace it.
- Personal Injury: A personal injury is non-physical and negatively affects the reputation or emotional state of a third party
- Example: The custom wallpaper you installed in a daycare is poorly sealed, creating a bubbling effect that leads to tearing and other unwanted damage.
- Advertising Injury: Any false claim or direct attack made against a third party, such as libel or copyright infringement
- Example: You use a photo of your own insufficient work in an advertisement against a local competitor to gain new clients unethically.
- Medical Payments: This covers the medical bills of a third party who suffers an unwarranted injury
- Example: Fumes from liquid adhesive leads to a third party suffering an asthma attack. Your insurance can cover the ER visit.
How Insurance Companies Determine Paper Hangers Insurance CostsThe list below discusses some of the variables that insurance companies consider when putting together a quote for your insurance plan.
- Your company’s accident history. An accident or two on your record is not going to put you in a situation where your rates will be too much for you to afford. Insurance wouldn’t work for anyone if providers were that unforgiving. Even so, the history influences rates to an extent. Talk to a licensed insurance agent today about ways you can keep your rates down if you have a high number of accidents in your record.
- The age of your company. A young company still has something to prove in the eyes of clients. Trust in your work, as well as trust in your ability to hold yourself accountable, is still in a state of flux. Insurance companies share this view, but if you’re just starting out, don’t despair if rates are on the higher end. If you prove yourself to be reliable and responsible, you will be able to reap the benefits of that later on.
- The type of contractor you are. It’s likely that your services will be asked for by an interior designer who oversees a particular project as a kind of aesthetic foreman. If the interior designer you work for is a paper contractor, your name will be mentioned first on whatever claim is made against the general contractor and the subcontractor. If you do this type of work regularly, higher rates may be applied due to the shared risk.
Why Should Paper Hangers Choose Contractors Liability?Paper hanging is becoming more and more of a DIY kind of job, but that doesn’t mean the professionals should be left twisting in the wind because of it.

March 20, 2003. As several large explosions rocked the capital,.
Three hours after the attack, Hussein, wearing a military uniform, black beret and glasses, appeared on state television and hurled defiance at Bush. His broadcast began with the country's national anthem and a picture of Hussein with the Iraqi flag. Seconds into his speech, the broadcast went off the air but came back. "The criminal little Bush," Hussein said, "has committed a crime against humanity."
Hussein began his comments by reading a Koranic verse. Then he switched back and forth between two sets of papers. His remarks, which appeared to be handwritten, were laced with religious terms and military hyperbole. Bush had given Hussein 48 hours to relinquish power and flee. The explosions began about 90 minutes after the deadline expired. A military official at the U.S. Central Command in Doha, Qatar, suggested the airstrike was limited â€” and not a part of what would become a wider assault.
"These are opening stages of what will be a broad and concerted campaign," Bush said in his televised address to the nation from the Oval Office. "We have no ambitions in Iraq except to remove a threat and restore control of that country to its own people. Our forces will be coming home as soon as their work is done." Bush decided to launch the preliminary attack during a marathon meeting Wednesday afternoon with Vice President Dick Cheney and his top military and intelligence advisors. After dinner with his wife, he received a call from White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card, informing him that there was no indication Hussein was complying with Bush's ultimatum to step down.
The attack, by about three dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles and bombs dropped from F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighters, was likely to be followed by other limited attacks over 24 hours, even before a main air assault begins, a senior defense official said. By its own account, the United States planned to overwhelm the Iraqis with shocking firepower, using cruise missiles, precision-guided bombs and electronic jamming devices. The outgunned Hussein hoped to draw U.S. and allied British troops into deadly and difficult urban warfare as he makes a last stand in Baghdad or possibly his home region of Tikrit, to the north. Even before war began, much of the Middle East â€” and the world â€” was tight with tension and dread. Aid workers in neighboring Jordan and Kuwait braced for thousands of war refugees.
Seventeen Iraqi soldiers surrendered to U.S. forces along the Kuwaiti border Wednesday, reported the U.S. Central Command, headquartered in Doha, Qatar. Fifteen of the Iraqis entered Kuwait from the west, and two others crossed along Highway 80, which runs north-south from Iraq into Kuwait, military spokesmen said. U.S. officials were eager to spread the news of the surrender, citing it as evidence that a persistent propaganda program was working. Tons of leaflets â€” 2 million on Wednesday alone â€” have been dropped over parts of Iraq by American aircraft to persuade Iraqi forces to give up, return to their barracks or at least hold fire. U.S. Marine and Army mechanized and infantry battalions rolled through a fierce sandstorm Wednesday afternoon and moved into positions along Kuwait's northern border with Iraq, while Hussein's forces were reported to be concealing weaponry and aircraft and mounting defenses around Baghdad.
At the same time, the United States sent warplanes to attack Iraqi missile systems and artillery near the southern port city of Basra, about 40 miles from the Kuwaiti border. Rear Adm. John M. Kelly, commander of a three-carrier battle group in the Persian Gulf, said the strike responded to Iraqi attempts to shoot down U.S. and British aircraft. A senior military official said the artillery posed a danger to the thousands of American and British soldiers as they moved ever closer to the Iraqi border. "They were aimed at our troops," the official said. "Obviously, as the potential for hostilities gets closer and closer, you have to get to a point where you can jump off." During the afternoon and evening Wednesday, armed security guards fanned out throughout Baghdad and took up defensive positions along its southern edge. Some residents headed for bomb shelters or into the countryside in a desperate attempt to escape. Others assumed defensive posts along sandbag-lined intersections and atop government buildings.
Then a pall seemed to settle on the city, accentuated by hazy skies turned yellow by the desert sandstorm. A city of 6 million people became a place of empty streets and worried silence. Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz appeared before journalists to belie rumors that he had defected or been killed. He predicted a long, bloody battle if the United States invaded. "I am carrying my pistol," he said, "to confirm to you that we are ready to fight the aggressors." Information Minister Mohammed Said Sahaf warned that American soldiers faced "certain death." In Israel, the government ordered all citizens to have their government-issued gas masks with them at all times. Many Israelis fear Hussein will launch missiles at their country filled with biological or chemical poisons. He fired Scud missiles at Israel during the 1991 Persian Gulf War, but they were armed with conventional warheads.
In Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Germany would allow American military planes to use its airspace on their way to the Persian Gulf, despite widespread opposition among the German people to war with Iraq. But Schroeder reaffirmed that no German soldiers would take part in any fighting. Similarly, in Saudi Arabia, King Fahd vowed that his kingdom, intent on giving diplomacy every opportunity to disarm Iraq, would not participate in war. In an address to his people, Fahd said none of his armed forces would "by any means trespass by one inch into Iraqi territory." He said Iraq should not be subjected to "military occupation."
Bush had finalized war plans Wednesday afternoon amid an air of expectancy. During those preparations, Fleischer, the White House press secretary, made a point of reminding Americans that war against Iraq would be costly. "Americans ought to be prepared for a loss of life," he said. But he said the president was at peace with using military force. "We have not received, unfortunately, any indication from Saddam Hussein that he intends to leave the country," Fleischer said. "The president would like very much to see the Iraqi people save their lives, the Iraqi military save their lives, by laying down their arms and by not following their orders." As hundreds of front-line troops, likely to be the first into Baghdad, moved into their final forward positions on the northwestern Kuwaiti desert, the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division formed long convoys, obscured by one of Kuwait's infamous sandstorms, and edged closer to the Iraqi border.
When the dust settled and dusk fell, a vast array of men and equipment was poised within five miles of the border. "There is a series of berms leading up to the border," said Maj. Gen. Buford Blount, the division commander. "We are moving closer to that." Abrams battle tanks powered by jet-fueled turbine engines, Bradley fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers were joined by fuel tankers, dump trucks, backhoes and front-end loaders. Blount counted 10,000 vehicles in all. "We've got trucks here that are brand-new," he said, "and trucks that are older than the drivers in them." Six tanks in the 4th Battalion of the 64th Regiment broke down in a four-hour trek that covered barely 20 miles. Mechanics pulled out their engines and transmissions and repaired or replaced them on the desert floor. Three of 14 tanks in C Company broke down. "Probably the problem is age," said Lt. David Chen, company executive officer. "The Abrams was new for the Gulf War, but that's 12 years ago. Most people don't even keep their cars that long.
"And it's not just the model. Some of the actual tanks are 12 years old." In response to the allied troop movements, Iraqi forces scrambled to hide or relocate targeted weapons, said Adm. Kelly, the battle-group commander, at his headquarters aboard the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln. "Up in Iraq," Kelly said, "they are continuing to move surface-to-air missile systems and some surface-to-surface missiles in an attempt to make our targeting more challenging and to increase their survivability." Most of the Iraqi troop movements have been concentrated around Baghdad, Kelly said, and some fortifications around the Iraqi capital, built in recent months, are now occupied. Kelly said Hussein's troop movements expose his weaponry to detection. "He has nothing else he can do," Kelly said. "There's a chance he will get lucky and protect something ... and it's something for his people to do other than sit and wait." Kelly described a furious spree of protective movements by Iraqi troops, clearly aware they were outnumbered. "In some areas, it's desperation," he said.
In Washington, cots, bottled water and military rations were delivered to the White House Communications Agency, responsible for every aspect of Bush's ability to communicate with the world, including secure telephones. Security perimeters were expanded around the White House. Other key agencies went on war footing. Round-the-clock staffing went into effect at the Pentagon, the State Department and for analysts and counter-terrorism specialists at the CIA. At the busy Pentagon Metro station, subway riders were greeted by the sight of machine-gun-toting guards.
At the Capitol, leaders of both parties tried to present a united front in support of U.S. troops. But some Democrats criticized Bush's decision to abandon diplomacy and go to war. "Today I weep for my country," Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W. Va.) said on the Senate floor. "No more is the image of America one of strong yet benevolent peacekeeper. The image of America has changed. ... Our friends mistrust us, our word is disputed, our intentions questioned." Byrd's speech was greeted with applause from the Senate gallery, a breach of etiquette that was gaveled down by the presiding officer.
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a strong supporter of Bush's move to war, rose immediately to challenge Byrd with deep and anguished emotion. "To allege that somehow the United States of America has demeaned itself or tarnished its reputation by being involved in the liberation of Iraq is neither factual nor fair," McCain said. Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), attacked by Republicans earlier this week for remarks faulting Bush for failing "so miserably at diplomacy," focused his words Wednesday entirely on U.S. military personnel. "We are awed by their sacrifice and their bravery, and we want them and their families to know that they have the profound respect and gratitude of every American," Daschle said. "We will make sure that they have every necessary resource so that nothing stands between our troops and victory."
On the eve of major war in the cradle of the world's major oil supply, the financial markets' reactions seemed paradoxical: Stock prices rose and the price of oil fell below $29 a barrel to a three-month low. Halfway around the world in Iraq, Abid Ahmad Mohammed, who has lived in Baghdad for 12 years, volunteered to help defend Hussein's government as if it were his.Overview

Maksimilijan Vanka (October 11, 1889 – February 2, 1963), also known as Maxo Vanka, was a Croatian-American artist. His most important works are his Millvale Murals in the St. Nicholas Croatian Catholic Church, the first Croatian Catholic parish in the United States, in Millvale, Pennsylvania, a borough of the city of Pittsburgh in Allegheny County. They depict Christ and Mary in images of war and offer social commentary on world events like fascism, war, and poverty.
Murals painted before the war depict Croatian immigrants coming to America to seek a better life, grateful to have escaped the slaughter taking place in their homeland. Their strong sense of pride in their heritage comes through and blends well with their entrance into the Pittsburgh labor-intensive industry of the time. This was Vanka's [s. The mother ends up losing all four of her sons, sacrificed for the good of others.
Murals painted after the war are much more striking and vivid, with very dark and haunting themes. This was Vanka's [sic] "Mothers offer up their sons for war" theme. He was a committed pacifist and the intensity of his beliefs are depicted clearly in these murals.

No.....now don't be shaking your heads and getting a lecture ready....I didn't do this decorating after my hip replacement! Most of it was done with the old hip and a bit of it was completed by my sweet niece BillieJo when she came to stay with me a few days when I first got home.
I kept if fairly simple this year, and not much outside at all....and it's all okay. In fact, I'm rather liking it! Best thing about it right now is actually having the time to sit down, relax and enjoy looking at it all. I usually never been afforded that...or should say I've just never taken the time...and I'm kind of liking that part of it too!
I did take the photos I'll share with you, as well as put them in to the album. There is no semblance of order to them as you will see, nor is there much as far as captions go....but they're all together in one album for you to view and all you have to do is ask if you want to know what something is....in fact I encourage your questions and comments. They'll give me something to do while I am sitting back, relaxing and taking all the holiday cheer in!!

Health Care-Associated Infections – Nosocomial Infections. Necrotizing Smooth Tissue Infections – Difficult Pores and skin Infections. Bacteria are microorganisms that are available numerous shapes. Most bacteria have a single, circular chromosome that’s liable for replication, though a few species do have two or extra. Many viruses, when launched from contaminated cells, might be effectively knocked out by antibodies which were produced in response to infection or previous immunisation. Most bacteria, other than the cocci variety, transfer round with assistance from small lashing tails (flagella) or by whipping their bodies from aspect to aspect. The flagella beat in a propeller-like motion to assist the bacterium transfer toward nutrients; away from toxic chemicals; or, in the case of the photosynthetic cyanobacteria; toward the light. Antibodies produced by the immune system attach to the micro organism and help in their destruction.
Bacteria are additionally important in biotechnology. These hibernating bacteria are referred to as spores. Spirochaetes – as the title suggests, these bacteria are shaped like tiny spirals. Antiviral drugs are currently solely efficient against a few viral diseases, resembling influenza, herpes, hepatitis B and C and HIV – however analysis is ongoing. Micro organism are prokaryotes, lacking nicely-defined nuclei and membrane-bound organelles, and with chromosomes composed of a single closed DNA circle. Throughout the lytic cycle of the viral replication, the phage DNA, together with the bacterial chromosome is damaged down into smaller pieces. During this process, the phage genome normally integrates into the bacterial chromosome as virus replication is repressed during lysogeny. The phage host cell (donor cell) is first infected with the phage, during which, the phage DNA enters the cytoplasm of the micro organism. Nucleoid – The nucleoid is a area of cytoplasm the place the chromosomal DNA is situated. Relying on the phage, the DNA integrates into the bacterial genome, replicates in the cytoplasm as a plasmid, or replicates instantly producing phage progeny. For many plasmid sorts, copies within the cytoplasm are handed on to daughter cells throughout binary fission. In some situations, alternate genes equivalent to hsp65, rpoB or recA are sequenced when 16S is just not satisfactory for species stage identification.
Use of this webpage means you comply with all of the Authorized Terms. As far as I know, you do not use any medicine should you bled after your first intercourse. One factor I’ve discovered is to not query somebody’s injuries,” Clark mentioned. “As players navigate this season, each themselves personally and their families, there is a realization that that is removed from the norm. It is typically essential to determine bacterial isolates to species degree with the intention to rule out species which might be drug resistant or more pathogenic, to detect unsuspected pathogens, ascribe pathogenicity to species to this point considered to be nonpathogenic and to determine new bacterial species. Bacterial skin infections are common, although the skin kinds such an efficient barrier that people might continually come into contact with micro organism with out pores and skin problems occurring. Examples embrace Staphylococci (which cause a number of infections together with boils). The range of bacterial skin infections is wide, from easy boils to a widespread and life-threatening bacterial infection that involves deeper layers of skin and has the potential to trigger blood poisoning.
Any break within the skin makes it more seemingly for bacterial disease to establish itself, so it’s important to maintain cuts and scrapes clean and lined. During the nineteenth century, the French scientist Louis Pasteur and the German physician Robert Koch demonstrated the position of micro organism as pathogens (inflicting disease). Pharmacy technicians can generally study their function by on-the-job training, offered they graduated from high school or earned a GED certificate. Issues can come up when an individual’s immune system is compromised in a roundabout way, by illnesses reminiscent of cancer or AIDS. This includes species which might be found in decaying materials in addition to those who make the most of fermentation or respiration. Proteins are the molecules that carry out all the capabilities of cells and living organisms. Our online pharmacy and healthcare part contains an intensive vary of merchandise for treating nearly any situation which doesn’t require prescription treatment, all of which might be delivered straight to your door. Cocci – formed like a sphere with a diameter of round 0.001mm. Depending on the sort, cocci bacteria group themselves in a range of the way, such as in pairs, lengthy strains or tight clusters.2nd May 2014
In 1442, the vaulting of St. Mary's Church over the chancel collapsed. Falling bricks and stones destroyed the interior of the church and its high-altar ceased to exist.
At that time, Cracow was the capital of a powerful country extending between the Baltic and the Black Sea. Local merchants experienced a boom in the trade exchange with German, Italian and French cities. The merchants were affluent and spared no effort to display their high social status., build up their prestige and enhance the high positions of the families. It was decided then that Cracow would have an altar with no which no other in Europe would match.
Veit Stoss ( Wit Stwosz) a Swabian- born sculptor gained fame in Nuremberg.
The work on Cracow altar took him 12 years, and was dedicated to Virgin Mary, the patron of the church. Its main focus both as far as the theme and composition are concerned, is the central scene of the Dormition of the Virgin Mary surrounded by the Apostles.
The figures are almost three metres high . The artists carved them in uniform blocks of lime wood. Only five-hundred year old trees could have such wide trunks, so the wood may now be more than a thousand years old. The figure of the Virgin Mary was carved according to the medieval standards of female beauty , whilst the accompanying Apostles had the features of contemporary Cracovians.
With great passion the sculptor rendered all details ,whether it be brick curly beards, boldish skulls, bulging veins on the feet, hands deformed by arthritis or a wart in the curvature of nose.
The poliptych carved by Veit Stoss and his apprentices in 1477-1489 is 13 metres high and 11 metres wide.
The religious themes of the reliefs on the altar wings did not prevent the master from depicting the material culture of Poland toward the end of the 15th century. Head-dresses , shoes , mantles weapons,vessels and household utensils are exactly such as one could find in Cracow streets and homes at the time.
The artist's fee for the work of his life totalled to 2,808 florins. This amount was equivalent to the city's annual budget, and sufficient to afford of a number of fine townhouses.
Definitely worth visiting. It's a real masterpiece.
Absolutely beautiful.
I often wondered how long it took to do that type of art.
I know so little about Poland and am loving learning about your wonderful country from you.Farmhouse and B&B Serafina, the best located in Amalfi Coast-Furore, with the comfort of an hotel

European Council and Parliament reach provisional agreement.
SW – 02/2021:
- combat youth unemployment. At least 12.5 per cent of ESF+ funding should be spent on this in EU countries, where the quota of young people aged between 15 - 29, who are neither in employment nor in education or training, is above the EU average. This could be, for example, on vocational and advanced training measures, especially apprenticeship training, or support during the transition from school to work. All other EU countries will be called upon to provide an adequate amount of resources for the fund in order to support youth employment measures.
- support groups in the population that are particularly vulnerable to job losses and loss of income. In each case, 25 per cent of ESF+ funding will be used to promote social inclusion.
- provide food and basic material support to the most socially deprived. At least 3 per cent of ESF+ funds should be earmarked for this purpose.
- support young people and children at risk of poverty. For EU countries with a child poverty rate above the EU average, at least 5 per cent of ESF+ funding, and an appropriate amount from elsewhere, should be allocated to targeted measures for tackling child poverty.
- promote social innovation through the new "Employment and social innovation" area with a special fund of 676 million euros.

Next steps.Compassion, cover to cover
We chat to illustrator and author, Stanley Foo
With his twin passions of veganism and illustration, Stanley Foo works hard to portray animals as sentient and valued beings to both adults and children.
Stanley does this by creating impactful collections of art works that seek to make people question the norm, as well as via illustrated books for children that hope to incite curiosity and compassion in them as they grow. We talk to Stanley about how it all got started.
Tell us about your journey to veganism.
My journey is a bit of a long one… I went vegetarian 30 years ago announcing it to my family over Christmas dinner, telling them that this was the last time I would be eating meat! It's hard to imagine now, but for me, that seemed to be the 'vegan' of the day and I was doing all I could for the animals.
I knew Morrisey and River Phoenix were vegan, but when I look back at it, I don't think I really knew what that even meant… It seems so bizarre now! The information just wasn't readily available then.
Over the next 20 years I gradually stopped wearing leather, drinking milk, and eating eggs, which just seemed really weird! I started soaking up internet videos; Gary Yourofsky lectures and interviews, animal rights footage, and this eventually led me to Earthlings.
I watched that and everything clicked. The old cliché came true for me. I made the connection and went vegan in 2012.
When did you decide to combine veganism with art?
Around 2016 I decided I wanted to do something more proactive to help 'the cause'. I'd studied illustration at university, so along with my profession as a graphic designer, I set about using what I considered to be my best skills to try and make some sort of difference.
With online tools making it so easy to build a shop, promote yourself and even get a book printed, I was able to make the vision a reality.
Talk us through your V CUTS series? What do they seek to achieve?
The old butcher shop signs have always really annoyed me. How demeaning the labelling is, and how they turn these beautiful animals into segmented parts to be consumed, is just horrendous.
I wanted to 'reclaim' those images, and by using my own descriptive words, turn them into something beautiful. My main vision for them was to create a conversation piece in people's homes.
A meat-eater would see them on the wall and instantly think of the butcher shop signs of old… until they look a bit closer.
\"I wanted to 'reclaim' those images, and by using my own descriptive words, turn them into something beautiful\"
Tell us about your debut children's book, Just like me! How does it help children to understand compassion towards animals?
My debut book talks about how similar we humans are to animals, and how we all have body parts that are used for the same purpose. To make this point as clear and obvious as I could, I came up with the simple, but effective title: 'Just Like Me!'
'Pigs have ears to hear with… Just Like Me! Lambs legs have legs to jump with… Just Like Me!' It's a simple idea that small children inherently understand. By relating themselves to animals, they can have nothing but compassion towards them.
Why is this important?
Many adults will think of mint sauce if lambs' legs are mentioned. When I was researching the book, I innocently typed 'pigs' ears' into Google… Try it and see what comes up, if you dare.
The Google search algorithm certainly doesn't think that pigs have ears to hear with. I think it's such an important subject to communicate to young children so that they don't fall into the meat-eating mindset.
How useful is art in spreading awareness of animal welfare and vegan issues?
Combined with the internet, art is as important as anything we have to spread the vegan message. Whether that be paintings, music, literature, documentaries or more recently, TikTok videos. It's all about expression, creation and imagination.

Chase has a Balance Liquidation Program which would be a good option for your Chase credit card debt. You will need to contact the bank directly and ask if they could accept you in this Chase's liquidation program and offer an affordable payment plan. But before you do this, you will need to make some preparations.
First of all, you need to look at what you owe and how much you earn and spend each month. Write everything down on a list of paper to make sure you have it handy. Also, you should be able to explain what led you to current situation, you can write it down as well and even practice saying it out loud. Remember, you are not the only person who has dealt with a situation like this, so don't be afraid to be honest about your circumstances..
Now when you are ready for a call, get ready to spend some time on the phone - get comfortable, try to be in a quiet place where you can concentrate, don't chew gum or eat, but keep a big glass of water next to you in case your mouth gets dry. You may need to navigate a few menus to get to a customer service representative, and once you do, you might be transferred a couple of times. Be prepared to tell your story a few times until you get to the right person.
Once you reach the right Chase representative, answer patiently to all his or her questions. In the best-case scenario you will be offered a Chase credit card payment plan. You can be offered a lower APR and a low monthly payment.
The Chase's Balance Liquidation Program does not work like bankruptcy - participating in the program won't hurt your credit (though it's always a good question to ask your customer service representative, as programs do vary). You may even see some improvement to your credit history after a couple of months of on time payments.
Don't be afraid to pick up the phone and just talk to your credit card company as credit card companies usually offer balance liquidation at no fee. The voice on the other end of the phone belongs to a person who may have been in a similar situation, or who is eager to help you. Be polite but firm, patient but persistent, and you might be surprised what you are offered.Today when I was going to play some games I realized that I had no audio through my microphone. I have my headphones connected to the headphone jack on the Blue Yeti for voice monitoring purposes. When I select the Blue Yeti as my audio output like I do every day, the audio then came out of my desktop speakers. I can hear myself when I talk into the mic as well, just no audio from PC. I have tried everything that I know how to do. I've updated all my drivers, made sure it was set as default audio device, restarted my computer, browsed other forums. I seriously have no idea what's going on as I am pretty tech savvy and can usually fix things on my own. I'll take any and all tips/advice you all have. Thanks in advance.My vCenter environment is 5.0, and was initially set up using SQL Server 2008 R2 Express as the database. We have hit the size limit of 10 GB for the Express version, so I want to upgrade the database from 2008 R2 express to 2008 R2 standard.
Before doing the upgrade, I stopped the vCenter Server service, then launched the SQL Server installer. I did an "Edition Upgrade", to take it from express to standard. This completes successfully in about 2 minutes, then I went and restarted the vCenter server service.
However, after restarting the service, vSphere is unable to communicate with the VIM_VCDB. For example, in vSphere if I click on a VM, and click the Performance tab, it tells me it is unable to display the web page. It seems to be unable to communicate with the VIM_VCDB. I haven't changed any database names, or the ODBC settings, so not sure what is causing the issue.
If I go to ODBC Data Source Administrator and Test Data Source, the test completes successfully.
I have read all the documentation I can find, and tried a few different things, but not found anything that resolves the issue. I ended up having to revert to the snapshot backup I took prior to the database edition upgrade.
Anyone have any ideas on what the issue might be, or what I need to do to resolve it?
Shane
The database is probably fine.
Is the vCenter Web Management Service running?
The database is probably fine.
Is the vCenter Web Management Service running?
You were on the money.
When I shutdown the "VMware VirtualCenter Server" service, it shuts down 2 additional services, one of them being the VMware VirtualCenter Management Webservices. Then once the database upgrade was done, starting the server service back up, does NOT start up the 2 additional services that it shut down earlier, so the webservices service was down. So I manually restarted those 2, then everything worked properly in vSphere.
Thank you for help on this.

Being there for Thrissur Puram 2014 was a dream come true, had never seen something like this ever before.The festival is all about elephants,processions, music and fire crackers. It attracts lakhs and is known to be the mother all poorams, the largest temple festival in South India.On Pooram day two teams of elephants stand opposite to each other in the grounds of the Sree Vadukkunnathan Temple (u see one team) changing beautifully designed parasols (umbrellas). We present pics of Pooram as it happened.
Entrance to Sree Vadukkunnathan Temple. Took a flight from Mumbai to Kochi. From airport took a pre-paid taxi to Thrissur. U see Deepasthambham (Traditional Light Mast). 7 kms away from airport is Sankara Birth Place. Went there too. To see pictures Click here
Temple lit up at night. U see fully lit Deepasthambham. Day before Pooram there is a puja in the morning in the SV temple, after that devotees visit two halls to see Elephants Ornaments that are used during Pooram. To see pictures of Elephants OrnamentsClick here
U see lamp-post with tortoise which represents the Kurma avatar of Bhagavan Vishnu in the Dasavatara series. Temple has a wall around it followed by maidan part of which you see. It is called Thekkinkad Maidan. Temple area is huge - allows for massive congregations.
Fully lit up temple area. U see deepasthambham in front and fully lit up gopuram hid behind trees. Pooram was next day. Crowds thronged the ground and temple for darshan. I had darshan too. One needs to wear a Mundu (worn by Kerala men) or Dhoti as I did and remove shirt. Details of captions taken from Click here
There are elephants moving all over the temple grounds. '''.
There are three gopurams, you see one of them. Design is very different from what one sees elsewhere in South India. 10 temples take part in the Pooram. 'The processions and rituals of each of these deities follow a very strict itinerary, scheduled in such a way that the tempo of the Pooram celebrations – 36 hrs non-stop- is maintained without any loss of energy'. To know names of templesClick here
Same gopuram beautifully lit. In centre in blue is image of Krishna as child. The festival is 200 years. Its earlier form Arattupuzha pooram has a history of more than 1000 years. Its current form is credited to the former ruler of Cochin, His Highness Ramavarma Raja, popularly known as Sakthan Thampuran (1751-1805 AD). To know more about history of festival Click here
Evening-prior to Pooram all elephants go through extensive medical check up. It is done to ensure elephants are fit to be part of the 36 hour festival. I found all elephants to be very well behaved.Only once was there a ruckus, some got injured, when a devotee pinched a elephant - their skin is known to be very sensitive.
Decorated elephants start the procession. Hundreds of devotees form part of the procession, there are many more on either side of the road and watching from their homes.
Procession is accompanied by percussion artists as you see. This bit of Pooram is called the Madathilekku Varavu ceremony during which the thidambu (idol) of the Thiruvambadi Bhagavathy is taken on elephant Sivasunder from the Thirduvambadi Temple to Naduvil Madom and later to Vadakkunatha Temple.
On the road where procession moved was this huge offering. It is called Aann Ottu - feeding the elephants. Normally a portion is given to the elephant and the rest is taken back. There are people who give all the displayed items to the elephant. In pic is image of Ganesha and Krishna.
Percussion artists during the procession. Instrument in centre of pic is called MADDHALAM. What two artists in front have in their hand is Ilathalam (pair of round metallic discs joined together with a thread -used for rhythmic beats).
Senior citizens with offerings. It is called Para Vazhipadu (An offering when the residing deity comes visiting you). The 10 temples who take part in Pooram are split into two parts namely “Paramekkavu side” and “Thiruvambady side”. The Paramekkavu side consists of besides “Paramekkavu Bagavathy.
Musicians playing the KOMBU or the horn which is a wind like instrument. Procession is to the accompaniment of Panchavadyam, led by percussion maestro Annamanada Parameswara Marar.
Procession of elephant and musicians walks for about a km before it has to cross the Gopuram ie minutes away from the Sree Vadukkunnathan Temple. I had darshan at this Shiva mandir. The idol is not visible, as it is covered under 3-5 meter high and 5-7meter wide mount of ghee, formed by daily abisheka (ablution) with ghee over centuries'. To know all about temple traditionClick here
3 elephants came from the Thirumvady temple. More elephants came from other temples who are part of that group and stood at the western entrance of the Sree Vadukkunnathan Temple as you see. Percussion is played for a while.
A rear view at the same time as the preceding picture. Every elephant has a parasol (umbrella), umbrella of elephant with deity has a different color.
Side view at the same time. One storeyed building behind the deepastambh is where I spent a lot of time - gave me a good overview although navigating through the crowds was a challenge.
By the time earlier group had finished the second group was on its way to the main entrance of the Sree Vadukkunnathan Temple. Elephants with umbrellas and percussion artists.
A close up of the same group. Note men wear only a Mundu with no shirts. Close up artists playing the KOMBU. This and earlier group of elephants represent the arrival of ''cheru poorams'' from participitating temples across the district in the morning and mark the commencement of the festival.
You see me with a percussion maestro, he is actually the leader of one of the two groups of musicians. He is Padma Shri Peruvanam Kuttan Marar. Music had me spellbound. Years ago I had heard him at a function in Mumbai. Had loved the music so much that decided to visit Thrissurpooram someday. Am not a student of music - any errors are on account ignorance only.
Before we move on to the next event this is another fully lit Gopuram.
The next big event is at the Paramekkavu Bagavathy Temple. It is a dominant partner of Thrissurpooram. End of pic is entrance to exhibition where various products are sold. Did walk through hoping to buy some local handicraft but it has other items including good juice stalls. To know the sequence of each event at Pooram Click here
This is a Devi Mandir. On right is Krishna and Arjuna on chariot. On left of entrance which you cannot see so clearly is Bhagavan Narayana reclining on the bed formed by the mighty serpent of thousand hoods on which the universe is supported. The serpent is also called Ananta, Ananatanaga, Sesa and Sesanaga. It is also shown that the Creator, Brahma, is emerging out of the naval of Narayana. Lakshmana and Balarama, brothers of Rama & Krishna are said to be incarnations of Adisesha. The allegorical significance of this picture is the unity of creation in the infinite time and space and is sustained by them. Caption courtesy T N Sethumadhavan whose commentaries on the Holy Gita and Upanishads are on esamskriti.
After last event at Sree Vadukkunathan Temple a group of elephants move to the Paramekkavu Bagavathy Temple which is one of the dominant partners of Thrissurpooram. They remove their ornaments and stand outside the temple. I must add that did not attend all the events in individual temples as stated on Thrissurpooram site but focussed on the main events around the Sree Vadukkunathan Temple - pic no 25 has link which gives sequence.
Elephants with ornaments waiting for the elephant with Deity to return from the Paramekkavu Bagavathy temple after darshan of Devi.
Elephant with deity making its way through the temple door. There is a roar amongst the crowd when they see the elephant. It also implies that the function of changing of parasols (umbrellas) and percussion is about to begin.
U see decorated elephants with percussion artists in front. Behind them were huge crowds. I stood on the top of entrance porch of a building that adjoins temple. It was the best way to get a good view from a height.
Overview of the crowds. Simply put persons sitting on the elephant are sometimes sitting-standing and keep on changing the umbrellas which is held by the person who sits in the centre of the elephant. Timing of standing on the elephant is related to percussion rhythms. White thing held in hand of those standing is called Venchamaram.
Earlier pic was crowds in front. This pic shows crowds behind them - in between it started raining. Behind is exhibition. In background crackers were being burst. Atmosphere was electrifying to say the least.
The next many pictures we showcase the different designs of umbrellas. It is very creative work. This one is yellow with polka dots.
Elephant with deity has a different colored umbrella. Round green thing which those standing on the elephant are holding is called Aalavattam.
Changing of umbrellas going on. Behind the scenes there are numerous people carrying umbrellas for each of the 15 elephants. Golden color on elephant face is called Nettipatam. The men responsible for giving umbrellas have to move at very fast pace, take back old and give new - get from and return to hall where umbrellas are kept.
Here u can see the green round thing clearly it called Aalavattam. Note the umbrella design - looks like it has brass stitched on cloth.
Purple, blue and white umbrella.
Bright umbrella.
People you see waving hands - when the numerical progression of chenda and elathalam beats reached a crescendo, percussion-lovers wave their hands in the air in a kind of ecstasy.
This pic scanned from a Malayali newspaper is what the finale of Thrissurpooram looks like. It is known as Kudamattom (display of decorative parasols). One team of elephants is in front and the other at the end of pic. In between are huge crowds. A wooden stand was made for photographers that was on left of pic. We stood there all through. Crowds very disciplined. For someone like me who has not seen an event like this, it reminded me of a rock show. Credit and copyright of pic lies with the newspaper.
The elephant which carried the image of the deity is elephant Sree Padmanabhan. Name of elephant that carried image of Thiruvambadi Bahagavathy was elephant Thiruvambady Sivasunder. This is as per newspaper report-I could have got names wrong. Intent is to share names of elephants.
Bright dark pink parasols.
Sree Krishna image. Some photo caption details taken from The New Indian Express paper Kochi edition of May 10, 2014.
Overview of percussion artists with elephant face covered in golden color by what is locally called as Nettipattam.
Design of this parasol reminded me of Maharaja styled dress that we saw in Hindi movies of the 1960''s.
Another lovely parasol.
After the event of changing parasols at temple was completed, the elephants and percussion artists left in a procession to enter the Sree Vadukkunnathan Temple from the Southern entrance. That is what you see.
Elephant enters the temple. Somehow these huge elephants managed to make their way through temple entrance.
Procession of 15 elephants moves towards the western entrance as you will see later. Red thatched roof structure is the Sree Vadukkunathan Temple. Temple designs in Kerala are very different from Tamil Nadu and other parts of India. There were huge crowds, I just about managed to make my way.
15 elephants led by elephant Sree Padmanabhan now stand opposite the Illangi tree, where the ''Ilanjithara Melam'' by about 300 percussion artists led by Peruvanam Kuttan Marar had commenced, leaving percussion lovers spellbound. Right of pic is the tree below which is a covered area where artists were. U can see people standing on right of pic. I was there a few minutes before clicking this pic. It started raining whilst the program was on - did not deter the artists or crowds.
Percussion artists under the Ilanji tree performing Ilanjithara Melam. Right of pic person with blue cloth round his neck is Padmashri Peruvanam Kuttan Marar - pic no 23 you saw me clicked with him. I am honored.
Crowds surrounded from Illanji tree from three sides. I felt was attending a rock concert. In between it started raining adding to the fun. Whilst enjoying this heard some more percussion rhythms so decided to move out of the temple. Police refused to let me out of temple - my media card proved helpful.
Evening before main Pooram event area around the temple was bustling with activity. Right of pic is a illuminated Gopuram whose reflection you see in the glass façade of Hotel Pooram. Hotel rates during Thrissur Pooram skyrocket - one hotel from where you get a great view of the main ceremony Kudamattom quoted Rs 10,000/ odd for 3 nights. Even then hotel was full. When this year''s Pooram gets over people book rooms for the next year.
When I walked out of the western entrance of temple saw another group of elephants with umbrellas and percussion artists. I made way through crowds to reach the temporary stage made for photographers-just about managed to reach there. Corner from where would have got a straight view was packed. It had just stopped raining and the colors looked different n super.
Left of pic u see flag - wanted to stand there. Overview of crowds in centre are percussion artists. Crowd was ballistic. I enjoyed this for a while - something told me that action was starting elsewhere so I naturally walked towards the southern entrance of temple. This group was the Thiruvambady contingent.
Crowds had begun to gather, the VIP stand was full, the photographers stand where I stood required some effort to climb onto it. Having got there I thanked my stars for coming early. U see elephants coming thru temple entrance. First elephant that came was the one with deity.
Gradually all the 15 elephants came thru the gate and moving in a procession to the opposite side of the ground to take part in the renowned ''Kudamattom'' (display of decorative parasols). U will see more on this later. Crowds roared every time elephant came out of temple gate.
Close up of percussion artists moving along with procession of elephants. Their instruments are Timila, Maddalam, Idakka (percussions), Ilathalam (pair of round metallic discs and kombu.
Percussion artists play in front of elephants - this group is called the Paramekkavu contingent.
The Paramekkavu contingent with their umbrellas move towards one end of the Thekkinkad Maidan. Everyone looked happy and excited, about to witness the world famous Kundamattom.
This is the backside view of the elephants. U can see the police trying to control the crowds.
The part of the maidan through which the Paramekkavu contingent walked through was declared open to the crowds. The resultant crowds is what you see. Right of pic is VIP stand. All eyes at the southern entrance waiting for the arrival of the Thiruvambady contingent. There were lakhs of people that evening.
A break before the finale. Pooram is a big festival. We had fortune tellers and some who put this design on devotee''s hands. Pre-made wood designs are used to imprint design on hand.After I clicked her pic the young girl came running to ask me ''which media Sir''. Told her from esamskriti.com
The first elephant to come out from the southern entrance of the Thiruvambady contingent is the one with the deity. Not sure but elephant name is Thiruvambady Sivasunder. Crowds roar on seeing Sivasunder.
At the other end elephants of the Paramekkavu contingent getting ready for the main event of display of parasols.
At the temple entrance end the Thiruvambady contingent is now ready with bright orange umbrellas. Crowds on a high and waving their hands. Actually when numerical progression of beats reach a crescendo, percussion lovers wave their hands in the air in a kind of ecstasy.
Purple umbrellas - look at the crowds.
White and reddish pink umbrellas. Crowd turn both sides depending on which contingent was changing umbrellas. Making so many designs and colors of umbrellas requires lots of creativity and hard work.
Umbrella changing happening - note the deity''s umbrella is always special and has a different look.
Umbrellas are not light - changing quickly must have required some effort.
Green umbrellas - our stand was 10-15 feet above ground so managed to get a good view.
Two types of umbrellas, behind the elephants could see men running with umbrellas taking the old ones and bringing the new.
Lovely ballons - so creative. We are not showing all umbrella design pics because the collection would be too big then.
From one end of the stand took this pic to give you a sense of the crowds and mood. Elephants at end belonged to Paramekkavu Mandir contingent.
Baby Krishna playing flute. During festival time drink lots of liquids, the humidity makes you sweat profusely.
Four levels of umbrellas - it was beginning to get dark. Did not see too many women at this part of Thrissur Pooram. Given the quantum of crowds it is difficult for them to stand in between. If the Govt wants more women to attend they should have a separate enclosure for ladies. The next morning function saw a large number of girls and women. Locals told me that the morning function is when families attend Pooram.
Loved the pink color of Thiruvambadi contingent.
Face of a Kathakali dancer.
Such was the mood during the finale that you see this man standing on the shoulders of two others. For me a non Keralite it was nothing short of a rock concert - the most spectacular that I had ever seen.
Goddess Saraswati.
OM - the illuminated Om looks so good in the dark. Loved it.
Shivji is what you see.
A very different type of parasol (umbrella). By now the Paramekkavu contingent had run out of umbrellas. There is a very nice restaurant that services North Indian food minutes away from the western temple entrance. Forget the name.
This umbrella of diyas looks so nice in the dark. So the winner was the Thiruvambadi contingent. Was on the road from 8 am to nearly 8 pm. Two camera batteries drained out, the second one just after event ended. Fire crackers followed around 2 am - was exhausted and decided to skip fireworks. To see pics of fireworks from another site Click here
At entrance of the Sree Vadukkunathan Temple was a Sewabharati counter which served water with Panamrutham (a herbal mix for preparing drinking water). Members of Sewa Bharati served this water non-stop for nearly two days. Water is served warm. Opposite side another group of devotees served butter-milk. Drank atleast 30 glasses of these two during Pooram. Kept me going. It was raining, humid and hot during Pooram. Would not have survived but for their service.
Next morning reached Thekkinkad Maidan. You see elephants belonging to Paramekkavu contingent and percussion artists led by the respected Peruvanam Kuttan Marar. Left of pic is one of the gopurams. In case of an errors in captions please mail back.
Pancha Vadyam is an orchestra of five musical instruments namely Timila, Maddalam, Idakka (percussions), Ilathalam (pair of round metallic discs joined together with a thread used for rhythmic beats) and finally the Kombu or the horn which is a wind instrument. In the pic we see kombu the semi circular horn, then the kurumkuzhal, chenda and the ilathalam.
Close up of artist playing the kuzhal (like shehnai).
At one end of temple was the Paramekkavu contingent whom you saw in earlier pics. At another end was the Thiruvambadi contingent procession that you see. Both of them move towards the western entrance of the Sree Vadukkunnathan Temple where the closing ceremony of Thrissurpooram festival is held.
From one end of the temple took this pic that shows crowds at western entrance of temple with Thiruvambadi contingent in the background.
Close up of the Paramekkavu contingent inching closer to the western entrance of the temple. Percussion artists in full swing - great mood.
Sensing the mood I navigated through the crowd to click this pic of the Thirvambadi contingent - had not seen this umbrella design before.
Elephant with deities of both the contingents now move so as to stand at the door of western entrance to temple. Left of pic is Paramekkavu and right is Thiruvambadi contingent.
Both elephants stand on either side of the Deepasthamb. To read a good travelogue and pictures of Thrissurpooram Click here
While all this was happening in the maidan grounds fire crackers were being burst. The atmosphere was electrifying. The next day after Pooram visited the Sree Krishna Temple of Guruvayur. Takes 40 minutes by bus. U can stay in hotel or leave your bag at temple counter, do darshan and return. Remember to carry mundu or dhoti since no one can enter temple wearing pants.To know more about Guruvayur temple Click here

A Texas-based gay couple is crying foul after they say they were turned down by a reception venue who refused to host their forthcoming wedding.
As WFAA News 8 reports, Ben Allen and Justin Hudgins hoped to book a reception for 150 guests at the All Occasion Party Place near Fort Worth. But the couple says they were told by phone and email that the venue wouldn't host a same-sex wedding.
“It is because of God that I will not be a part in your reception, and I know he loves you, but not what you are doing,” All Occasion Party Place employee Robin Hearne is quoted by the news channel as having written to Hudgins in an e-mail. “I simply said I can not rent to you which is also my right.”
The couple, who will tie the knot in Mexico on April 6, say they were "floored" by the encounter.
"It almost felt like a sucker-punch to the face," Allen told NBCNFW. "I thought, in today's day and age, for someone to deny you simply because you date someone of the same sex, it doesn't really make sense to me."
As NBCNFW points out, the All Occasion Party Place is located outside the Fort Worth city limits, and therefore doesn't fall under the city's anti-discrimination code. Still, the case has nonetheless sparked the ire of local lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights advocates.
Notes Chuck Smith of Equality Texas, "Refusing to provide services or public accommodations to anyone solely because of their sexual orientation or gender identity is wrong."
Allen and Hudgins' case follows that of an Oregon-based lesbian couple, who were turned away by a local bakery after they sought a wedding cake.
"I apologized for wasting their time and said we don’t do same-sex marriages,” Sweet Cakes by Melissa owner Aaron Klein is quoted by KATU as saying. “I honestly did not mean to hurt anybody, didn’t mean to make anybody upset, [it’s] just something I believe in very strongly.”
In October 2012, a New York-based lesbian couple were similarly turned away by a rural farm where they hoped to tie the knot.
Robert Gifford, who owns Liberty Ridge Farm with his wife Cynthia, confirmed the news, telling WNYT: "I think it's our right to choose who we market to, like any business...we are a family business, and we just feel we ought to stay down the family path."
by Stacy Fernández, The Texas Tribune.
At Peaster Independent School District, 40 miles northwest of Fort Worth, Superintendent Lance Johnson has said masks are optional in his school district buildings and classrooms.
They’re not.
In July, Gov. Greg Abbott issued a statewide order requiring that Texans living in counties with more than 20 active coronavirus cases must wear masks in businesses, buildings open to the public — including schools — and outdoor settings when social distancing isn’t possible. Parker County, where Peaster ISD is located, reported 315 active cases as of Thursday.
At least two Peaster parents filed a formal complaint citing, among other issues, the lack of compliance with safety regulations, but there has been no enforcement of the mask mandate despite Johnson’s open defiance. The Texas Education Agency declined to get involved.
The state education agency stated it would not take action because many of the concerns in the complaint “appear to be local in nature,” according to a statement from TEA. But in TEA’s own public health guidelines for schools, the agency acknowledges schools are required to comply with the governor’s executive order regarding the wearing of masks.
“School districts and local health officials are in the best position to make decisions specific to their respective communities,” according to a statement from the agency. “Other issues raised in the complaint should be handled by the local board of trustees, should the local board deem action necessary.”
TEA has received about 90 mask-related complaints in total this school year, but the agency could not immediately provide a breakdown of the nature of the complaints. There are at least two other open complaints about Peaster ISD that are still under review, according to a TEA spokesperson, though they would not say whether they are related to masks.
TEA declined to answer several questions about enforcement of the mask mandate. A spokesperson for the governor’s office confirmed that schools are included under the executive order, but did not respond to questions about Peaster ISD’s lack of enforcement. Under the order, first-time violators will be issued a warning, though repeat offenders could be fined up to $250.
At a Thursday press conference, Gov. Greg Abbott said one of the reasons why coronavirus cases and hospitalizations are on the rise again is because local officials are not properly enforcing existing rules and regulations..
The Peaster superintendent, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has downplayed in emails and presentations to parents the seriousness of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 20,000 people in Texas. Against medical advice he remains steadfast that masks are unnecessary in his schools, which serve about 1,350 students. There is widespread consensus among medical experts that proper mask use reduces transmission of the virus.
.
Sean Hughes, emergency management coordinator for Parker County, said he’s tried to “encourage” Johnson several times to enforce the mask mandate in his district, but says he has no authority to compel compliance.
“Generally we don’t get involved in school district issues because we’ve always been told that school districts are governed by the school board and TEA,” Hughes said.
Peaster parents Kjersti and Frank Powers filed their complaint after meeting with Johnson in July to decide if they felt comfortable enough with the schools safety precautions to send their 3- and 5-year-old kids to school in person.
“This meeting with him was something that I just honestly would have never ever expected with someone in a position of school leadership,” Kjersti Powers said. “It was mind-boggling to say the least.”
The couple requested Johnson wear a mask for the meeting in his office, but they said he refused to put on a face covering, insisting that he didn’t have the virus and was immune since he contracted it in March. Uncomfortable, the couple moved the meeting outside in the 100-degree summer heat.
After the meeting, the Powers asked that TEA investigate Johnson’s refusal to adhere to the governor’s order, in addition to inappropriate comments they allege he made in the meeting.
Kjersti Powers also filed a complaint with Mike Bowling, president of the district’s board of trustees, but he refused to hear it. Bowling has repeatedly made anti-mask posts on Facebook.
Bowling did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
The conflict raises more questions about what roles local and state leaders play in containing COVID-19 across the state. Since the spring, Abbott has often released conflicting mandates, sometimes chastising local officials for overstepping their bounds and other times chiding them for not acting sooner. This summer, Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton fought with local health officials over their role in mandating schools close classrooms when community spread is too high. Ultimately, state leaders said local health officials could not require classrooms to close unless cases were already spreading.
“I do not believe that children should attend a school in America where they are forced to wear masks, sit in straight rows six feet apart, can’t go to the playground, can’t go to the cafeteria, can’t play sports, and can only have nine other classmates with them all day long,” Johnson said in a May email to parents.
In an email to The Texas Tribune, Johnson refused to answer questions about the mask mandate.
“Our community stands in solidarity, supports our school, lifts up our children, practices personal responsibility, uses common sense, lives by faith, and we will continue to do so,” Johnson said.
Clay Robison, spokesperson for the Texas State Teachers Association, said that as an appointee of the governor, TEA Commissioner Mike Morath should enforce the governor’s mask mandate.
“The commissioner of education is an appointee of the governor. The commissioner of education should enforce the governor’s mask mandate and require the Peaster school district to comply with them. This is a safety issue,” Robison said. “We are having more cases now than we’ve had before.
For months the Texas Classroom Teachers Association has asked that TEA establish policy around how it will enforce health and safety guidelines when parents and school employees flag concerns, said Paige Williams, director of legislation for the Texas Classroom Teachers Association.
“This was the ultimate example of why that enforcement mechanism needs to be in place,” Williams said.

CATO Survey Reveals SASE Security Threats
SASE is no longer the “next thing.” It’s here to stay. With businesses large and small migrating to the cloud, relying on anywhere, anytime connectivity to rise above the competition, security must be a priority.
CATO announced the results of The CATO Networks SASE Threat Research Report Q2, 2021. The SASE evangelist analyzed 263 billion enterprise network flows between April and June 2021, and in its research found some startling results.
"Cybersecurity risk assessment is based on visibility to threats as much as visibility to what is happening in the organization's network," says Etay Maor, senior director of security strategy at Cato Networks.
As organizations, embrace SASE and Zero Trust Architectures, location, user identity and device ID are what grant team members access to critical resources. The report illustrated the mounting threat posed by spoofing device IDs, with Spoofing-as-a-Service offerings growing at an alarming rate. Houdini, a well-known remote access Trojan (RAT), is one of the up-an-coming threats on the scenes, challenging IT to stay alert in the cat and mouse game of security.
CATO research also revealed the “blurred line” between personal and professional networks created by WFH, BYOD and consumer applications, like Amazon Sidewalk. Maor proposed, “How can you possibly assess company risk when there is no visibility to what devices and applications truly reside on the network?”
SASE brings together network and security functions to enable secure and productive operations for organizations large and small. How secure is your network? Just a question.

Computer Science Ph.D. Student Vikram Narayanan Receives IBM Fellowship
Computer science Ph.D. student Vikram Narayanan was recently nominated as an IBM Ph.D. Fellowship recipient and as one of the two finalists in the systems area for a Facebook Ph.D. fellowship. “It’s a great honor to receive this award from IBM and be one of the 46 Facebook finalists,” says Vikram who is a fifth-year Ph.D. student at UC Irvine. Vikram works on developing operating systems that provide new security and performance guarantees in the age of datacenter computing, heterogeneous hardware and targeted security attacks. This year, he became one of the 16 recipients selected by IBM from hundreds of applications from 183 universities in 32 countries. As noted in the IBM Fellowship announcement, the award recipients demonstrated academic excellence and provided innovative, exceptional research proposals.
“In my proposal, I suggested developing a new datacenter operating system aimed at providing first-class support for heterogeneous hardware,” says Vikram. “Today, we still use systems that are centered around general-purpose CPUs, yet we envision that the next generation of both commodity and datacenter machines will be heterogeneous. Instead of a single general CPU, they will rely on a broad spectrum of hardware execution units, ranging from specialized cores to near-memory, near-storage, and near-network accelerators; programmable hardware like FPGAs; and even specialized application-specific integrated circuits like Google’s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) that can accelerate common machine learning tasks.”
In his work, Vikram aims to utilize the RedLeaf operating system that he helped to develop from scratch in Rust with his adviser, Assistant Professor Anton Burtsev, and other members of the Mars Research Group in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS). He plans to give a talk at IBM presenting his initial ideas on the architecture of RedLeaf and how its unique properties can be used in heterogeneous environments.
“RedLeaf explores novel language-based isolation mechanisms that can provide secure execution of third-party applications in near-memory and near-storage environments without traditional hardware isolation mechanisms,” he says. “I am excited to collaborate with IBM as this is a chance to get access to cutting-edge hardware and the most innovative datacenter architectures.”
Support from IBM fits well with Vikram’s long-term goal of pursuing a research career in academia or industry. “I would like to continue working in the area of operating systems,” he says. “Recent hardware and language innovations allow us to change how applications interact with hardware and how they achieve peak performance at datacenter scale as well as to provide reliability and security guarantees that were not previously possible.”

We’ve given the sport some of the world’s top bike riders like the Dunlop dynasty. Rally drivers like the Hall of Famer Paddy Hopkirk are still inspiring generations of drivers to this day. Plus, we’ve produced more than our fair share of F1 drivers like John Watson, Martin Donnelly and Eddie Irvine.
Growing in stature year on year, the Tandragee 100 around the Armagh town’s roads is regarded by many as one of Irish road bike racing’s most prestigious and thrilling national events. The Northwest 200 is also one of the premier bike racing events in the calendar. It is held on a street circuit known as the Triangle between Portstewart, Coleraine and Portrush. The hugely popular Armoy Road Races have been providing high quality road bike racing every summer since 2009.
The Northern Ireland Rally Championship series revs up with the traditional season-opener at County Down’s Kirkistown Circuit in February. This is followed by a series of races throughout spring and summer across Northern Ireland. So you might catch the Derry-Londonderry or Tour of the Sperrins rounds, or the Tyrone Stages around Cookstown.
While the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) hurling and football seasons start in early spring, the Championship in summer is when things ramp up a gear. Each county is awash with colour as inter-county rivalries, county pride and banter come to the fore. You should definitely try to catch a game at any of the major GAA stadiums around - not to be missed for sheer excitement, thrill and raw county pride.
Ulster Rugby are one of the four professional teams on the island of Ireland. The team competes in the Pro 14 and European Champions Cup competitions - and in fact were the inaugural winners of the latter tournament in 1999.
Northern Ireland has produced some of the world’s most illustrious players like Lions legend Willie John McBride, rugby Hall of Famers Jack Kyle and Mike Gibson. Many Ireland rugby captains have hailed from this part of the world too including McBride, Gibson, Kyle as well as Rory Best, Simon Easterby and David Humphreys to name but a few. You can catch them playing at Kingspan Stadium (also known as Ravenhill) in Belfast. Definitely worth a visit especially on ‘European nights’ when the cream of Europe come to their fortress.
For soccer (or football, as it’s known), Northern Ireland has a vibrant club and international scene. In George Best, it produced one of the world greats but also players who graced the game with top England clubs, like Danny Blanchflower, Jackie Carey, Pat Jennings, Norman Whiteside, Neil Lennon, Sammy McIlroy and Gerry Armstrong.
The international team plays its home fixtures at The National Stadium in Belfast and if you’re looking to catch a local game you can pay a visit to one of the many Northern Ireland Football League grounds dotted across the country.
Few trips to Belfast are complete without a visit to watch the Belfast Giants compete in the Elite Ice Hockey League. One of the fastest games in the world is on your doorstep here in the SSE Arena and a noisy, thrilling night out is guaranteed. The SSE Arena is in fact the only competitive ice hockey rink on the island of Ireland making it all the more unmissable!
The Belfast City Marathon in May is for anyone who takes their running seriously and you should book a chance to run this race and build your visit around it. Starting in historic Stormont, it takes in some of the most spectacular views and iconic locations of the city and surrounding areas. Whether you’re competing in the men's, ladies, relay, fun run or wheelchair events – or there to cheer on – put this one on your bucket list. There are a whole range of half marathons, 10Ks and other road races across Northern Ireland to suit every runner out there!
In May 2014, Northern Ireland turned ‘pink’ with enthusiasm when the prestigious Giro d’Italia cycle race started in Belfast.
The second biggest cycling race in the world, saw riders tackle challenging courses of steep slopes and tricky gradients, while navigating Northern Ireland’s beautiful landscape, quaint villages and rugged coastline.
The massively successful visit has left a lasting impact on cyclists in Northern Ireland and further afield as many now come to test their ability along the same spectacular route since.
In terms of local competition, the Giant’s Causeway Coast Sportive offers cyclists a choice of 4 routes through an incredible landscape steeped in myth and legend along the spectacular Causeway Coast and through the Glens of Antrim.
There is also Lap The Lough, an annual cycle event around Lough Neagh, the largest lake in Ireland and the UK. Here cyclists can be captivated by tranquil, unspoilt scenery as they cycle counter counter-clockwise around the lake’s beautiful shoreline.
If competition isn’t quite what you’re looking for and you want to take things at your own pace, there are dozens of beautiful cycling routes to enjoy across Northern Ireland, for every level.
The Foyle Maritime Festival is a 9-day maritime extravaganza featuring a range of live performances, visiting ships and boats, water activities and food trails plus the bi-annual Clipper Round the World Yacht Race.
Sport is in our blood, as you can see, and the passions run strong here too, as you will experience if you build any of these and other countless sporting events into your holiday – or even build your holiday around them..Dr. Quentin Young, a Chicago legend, to retire
Phil Kadner
Southtown Star
April 1, 2008
His patients have included Martin Luther King Jr., Mike Royko, Studs Terkel and members of the Chicago 7 conspiracy trial, but after 61 years in private practice, Dr. Quentin Young is hanging up his stethoscope.
Young, a physician in Chicago’s Hyde Park community who from 1972-81 was chairman of the Department of Medicine at Cook County Hospital, was King’s doctor during the civil rights leader’s ill-fated stay in Chicago.
He was with him when King was hit in the head with a rock while marching through Gage Park and also visited King in his Chicago home when he came down with a respiratory infection.
“I stretched a 15-minute visit for a cold into an all-afternoon affair just so I could talk to the man,” Young recalled. “It was a unique opportunity.”
I have done the same whenever I’ve had the chance to talk to Young, a liberal renegade who has lived by the credo: “If the majority agrees with you, you are probably in the wrong.”
Young, for the first time in his 20-year fight for national health insurance, finds himself in the majority.
A survey to be published today in the Annals of Internal Medicine, a medical journal, indicates that a majority of U.S. physicians (59 percent) support national health insurance, 32 percent oppose it, and 9 percent are neutral.
The findings, according to a news release, reflect a 10-percentage-point increase in physician support for national health insurance since 2002, when a similar survey was conducted.
Surveys were randomly mailed to 5,000 doctors, and 2,103 were returned.
Psychiatrists (83 percent), pediatric subspecialists (71 percent), emergency medicine physicians (69 percent) and general pediatricians (65 percent) seemed to be the most enthusiastic about national health insurance, while those practicing radiology (30 percent) and anesthesiology (38 percent) registered the lowest amount of support for such a program.
Young, 84, is a founding member of the Chicago-based Physicians for a National Health Program and believes the results signify an important shift in the public debate.
“People trust their doctors,” Young said. “If their doctor tells them that national health insurance is not a good thing, they tend to believe that’s probably true. If their doctor now starts saying it is something that would be good for the country, then average people will be more likely to support it.”
The survey, conducted by researchers at Indiana University, is being touted as the largest ever among doctors on the issue of health care financing reform.
An estimated 47 million Americans have no health insurance, and another 50 million are believed to be underinsured.
At the same time, health insurance costs are rising at a rate of about 7 percent a year, twice the rate of inflation.
Employers are struggling to pay health insurance premiums for their employees, often reducing coverage or asking workers to pick up more of the cost.
Local governments, such as Cook County and the state of Illinois, find themselves cutting other costs to meet the public’s health care needs.
The amount of money budgeted for Medicaid in Illinois is now larger than the amount of money budgeted for public education, although about half of that cost is picked up by the federal government.
Young contends that while other industrialized countries control medical costs through single-payer universal health care plans, the profiteers here (primarily health insurance companies) continue to drive up costs. Because their primary motive is to make money, not to provide the best health care for patients, insurers’ decisions often are detrimental to policyholders.
Yet many Americans still believe health care here is better than anyplace else in the world. But they seem to be living in denial, ignoring the fact that health care here is not going to remain as it is.
Costs will continue to rise. Employers, facing a potential recession, are going to have to cut their costs.
Health insurance companies will continue to make a profit through higher premiums and by taking control of patient treatment out of the hands of family doctors.
Young, who is giving up his medical practice, will devote all of his energies to reforming health care.
“I tell people that I will refuse to die until there is national health care,” he laughed.

I have in the Datatables instead of Male and Female an Icon and if they is a member of a listed group a check icon instead of 1.
if I want to export the table via print pdf the columns are empty. Is it possible to render the field to the icons if someone click on the Buttons? The icons are fontawesome and render into the table.

Yes, you can use orthogonal data or a formatting function.

I am not sure that I understand the example. I believe, I have already written that with the render option in the Datatables, see the gender part.
The export button should take the Table that is defined. But in the gender Column, is always empty on the exported pages. The icons fa-male and fa-female are not exported

Thanks for the links in the PM.
Looking at the page I see the issue now. You are indeed using a rendering function for the
gendercolumn, which is always returning an HTML
ielement. Buttons strips HTML by default, which explains why you see nothing in the exported file.
As I mentioned above you need to use the orthogonal export options for Buttons, and then in your rendering function simply do:

AllanTwo-time Academy Award-nominated actor and humanitarian Djimon Hounsou from Benin, West Africa, has formed a collaboration with acclaimed, Brooklyn-based performance and visual artist Láolú Senbanjo from Nigeria to create the digital artist series “TIME TO HEAL”. This series consists of five unique portraits featuring Djimon Hounsou as a canvas onto which LÁOLÚ applied his famous body art known as the “Sacred Art of the Orí”.
The exclusive artwork series “TIME TO HEAL” will be sold in a premium auction on the Binance NFT Marketplace between November 10 and 15, 2021. A percentage of proceeds will be given to the Djimon Hounsou Foundation, a nonprofit that aims to reconnect the African Diaspora with the motherland and fight modern-day slavery & human trafficking. This is the most recent collaboration for Binance Charity’s NFT For Good Campaign, which enables creators to convert their art and creativity into meaningful global action targeting social and humanitarian issues.
Binance NFT has selected “Time To Heal” as a meaningful event in the contemporary art space. The series follows the success of the Binance NFT premium collection, featuring digital artworks by icons such as Andy Warhol & Salvador Dali.
In the collaboration between these two West African artists, LÁOLÚ painted Yoruba patterns and symbols related to alertness, compassion, and the quest for freedom onto Djimon’s head, right hand, and left shoulder. The result is an external reflection of Djimon’s inner essence as an African warrior of light. As the actor – who famously starred in Steven Spielberg’s slave-revolt movie Amistad – describes it: “I feel this compelling need, this inherent obligation to give back to my continent, to my people, and to champion the idea of reconciliation and reconnection.”
Says LÁOLÚ, whose Sacred Art of the Ori body ritual was also featured on Beyoncé’s Grammy award-winning “Lemonade” album: .”
In June 2021, Binance launched the Binance NFT Marketplace, which supports and promotes an open market for artists, creators, crypto enthusiasts, NFT collectors and creative fans around the world. According to Exchange Data, NFTs have an almost US$28 Billion market cap to date and, between January and April 2021, the NFT art market grew by more than more than 800%.
To participate in this charitable auction in support of the Djimon Hounsou Foundation, traders need to open a cryptocurrency account on binance.com and bid for the artwork on between November 10 (12:00pm EST) and end on November 15 (midnight EST). Trades will be accepted in BNB, the cryptocurrency coin that powers the Binance ecosystem..- Identification and Creation

Asset management has undergone a transformation due, in part, to the proliferation of data and technology tools, as well as the rapid rise of passive investing vehicles.
Prior articles in this series have highlighted active/passive market dynamics and the technologies that have empowered both active and passive managers. As these articles emphasized, increasingly complex active/passive market dynamics and the proliferation of technology tools make it harder than ever for IROs to be certain they are on the same page as investors. Investors have become increasingly reliant on technology tools for everything from factor analysis to portfolio construction and even natural language processing (NLP).
For IROs to keep pace with accelerating buy-side tech adoption, a new generation of technology tools must be used to empower IROs and ensure they are on equal footing with their buy-side counterparts.
IROs face challenges
The life of an IRO has, perhaps, never been more difficult than it is today. This stems from the fact that shifting buy-side dynamics and regulations have drained research resources, so most companies have fewer sell-side analysts than ever before. Add in the complexity of deciphering what both quant funds and passive investors are doing, and it is extremely difficult to explain stock price movements to the management team and the board. As a result, IROs now face two broad categories of problems:
- The CEO storms into your office wanting to know why the stock fell out of bed this morning and you, as the IRO, need to provide a thorough and thoughtful answer
- Your investors are increasingly demanding of your time because sell-side research on your stock is thin or non-existent.
Addressing these problems in turn, we find your CEO’s question nearly impossible to answer without the correct data and technology tools. In particular, you will need a deep understanding of the specific factors driving investors to invest in, or divest from, your stock. This means not only understanding the KPIs that drive price action in your market segment, but also understanding the unique factors driving specific types of investors (growth, value, momentum, and so on) to invest in your company.
Buy-side investors use numerous tools for this type of analysis; the very best platforms provide specific factor attribution and peer group analysis so that IROs can see what factors drive investors and thus price action. These platforms also allow you to see what company characteristics your investors value and thus who those investors view as your peers from an investment standpoint, rather than competition.
A savvy IRO might look at all of that data and also want to know how bots are analyzing corporate communications to see if NLP tools have flagged particular language as positive/negative. NLP-driven analysis has been used increasingly as not only a quant trading signal, but also a workflow enhancement tool for fundamental and quantamental investors. Accordingly, thorough IROs should track not only what these bots are saying after a communication is publicly available, but also use these tools to vet language ahead of time to ensure new communications are unlikely to elicit a negative market response.
A data platform may allow you to explore factor drivers and an NLP system may interpret language, but these are not just tools to answer questions – these are workflow enhancement tools as well. A strong data platform that identifies specific factors can streamline communication between IROs and investors by ensuring they are talking about precisely the same investment signal.
Moreover, a good NLP system can help IROs be proactive rather than reactive by empowering them to engage in streamlined analysis of the questions being asked of competitors and peers on their earnings calls. Well-designed NLP systems can also identify specific topics mentioned on those calls that drove price action. This type of preparation, combined with quantitative data on specific factors related to your company, can make it easier for IROs to craft consistent communications that will be well received by investors. Essentially, these tools increase both IRO efficiency and effectiveness.
The expanding role of the IRO
As may be obvious from the observations above, I am not, nor have I ever been, an IRO. I am a technologist who has spent the bulk of my career building technology tools for buy-side clients. Shortly before selling my company last year, I attended a NIRI conference that opened my eyes to the challenges faced by the IR community. The combination of increasing complexity of buy-side strategies and the technology used to develop those strategies would pose a monumental challenge on their own, but the IR community is also facing a rapid decline in the coverage and quality of sell-side research. In essence, IROs have lost their sell-side translators while simultaneously being outflanked by the use of technology on the buy side.
This problem prompted me to begin working with the team at Arbor Advisory Group to better understand and diagnose these challenges so we can prescribe technology solutions that help the IR community and ensure markets operate efficiently. In the work we have done this year, it has become apparent to me that, as is the case with most other domains, technology is nowhere near replacing the role played by people. But technology tools can and should be used by IROs to streamline their workflow, enhance communication, improve understanding of their own company and peers and, perhaps most importantly, to enhance the role of the IRO internally within most corporations. These tools and technologies can empower IROs not only to perform their job more effectively and more efficiently, but also assist in crucial corporate initiatives, such as competitive intelligence.
In short, it is time for IROs to think beyond the strategies of the past and get technical. New technologies have streamlined virtually every aspect of modern life and the IR role should be at the forefront of that tech adoption. Used properly, these tools can ensure IROs and investors are speaking the same language. This fluency will make the IR function more valuable than ever.

All About Casein Protein Powder
Casein is a milk product, and is actually the basic structural component of cheese. It makes up 80% of the total protein content in milk, with the other 20% being in whey. Despite the fact that it’s the more abundant constituent, casein protein tends to be lesser known than whey.
This is partly because of the way the dairy industry uses the two ingredients. When milk is separated into whey and casein, the casein is most often used for making cheese. Whey, on the other hand, is most often dried down into a powder to be sold as a supplement or mixed into other foods.
Despite its lesser popularity, the best casein protein powders are an excellent choice for achieving health and fitness goals.
SUMMARY
Casein protein is a component of milk often used for protein powders.SkyTruth and COVID-19: A message from the President
SkyTruth continuing to protect the environment from remote offices.
Dear friends, partners and supporters: the staff, board and I wish all of you as much kindness, strength, good health, and good cheer as these difficult times allow. In case you were wondering, I can assure you that SkyTruth is well equipped to adapt to these extraordinary circumstances. We’re in a good financial position. Our staff and contractors are comfortable with, and experienced at, working as a distributed team: we have well-tested tools to facilitate remote work and data sharing, and a rigorous schedule for communications to keep everyone in touch and on track. To help slow the spread of coronavirus during this critical window of opportunity to “flatten the curve,” we closed our Shepherdstown office three weeks ago, and all staff are working from home until further notice.
I’m convinced the need for our work is even greater during this crisis: the White House assault on the environment continues at a breakneck pace. Despite the staff shortages and chaos resulting from the rapidly spreading COVID-19 pandemic, the Environmental Protection Agency, Bureau of Land Management, and other Federal agencies are under pressure to continue rolling back regulations that were put in place to protect human health and the environment. And the EPA just announced a “sweeping relaxation” of pollution reporting requirements for power plants, oil refineries, and other industrial sites, leaving the public in the dark about the ongoing leaks, spills and other toxic incidents happening at facilities that are often located right next door.
This tunnel we’re in may be long, but there will be an end to it. That’s why SkyTruth will continue to shine a light on the way our lands and waters are being managed, to support effective public participation in government decision making, and to inspire better protection of the environment that we need — now and in the future — to heal and sustain us.
As always, feel free to contact me if you’d like to give me some feedback or learn more about how we’re weathering this storm. I would love to hear from you. – John

"The patient was made to hold his saline bottle briefly before a nurse could bring the stand," karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) Director R. C. Antartani told reporters.
He said the 1,800 bedded hospital has sufficient saline stands and is generally occupied only 50 to 60 per cent.
"The incident occurred at a time when the casualty ward was very busy and the nurse went to bring the stand. Meanwhile, somebody shot the video and made it viral," Antartani claimed.
He said the incident occurred 4-5 days ago with a non-Covid patient who left the hospital hurriedly without heeding the medical advice.
According to the director, the patient's relatives or somebody within the institution could have captured the video.
"We don't know who has done it exactly but such things are going on. Anyway, we are going to send a memo to the Group D workers and the staff nurse," Antartani said.
In the viral video, the patient, identified as Shankarappa Angadi, was seen holding the saline bottle with his raised right hand as he lay on the bed, surrounded by fellow bed-ridden patients.
Angadi, speaking in Kannada, told the person capturing the video that the nurse had instructed him to hold up the bottle and smiled when asked if KIMS ilacks funds, hinting that it could not even provide a saline stand.
However, the room in which the video was shot had no signs identifying it to be KIMS, except two more bed-ridden patients lying to Angadi's right and a switch board being visible.
Recently, KIMS was in the news for claiming to have used plasma therapy on a Covid patient who showed signs of 'recovery'.
KIMS-Hubli was started in 1957 and is currently affiliated to the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS).
The college offers MBBS, MD and MS degrees in all specialties along with other courses.

On Sunday, the Seattle Seahawks hosted the Philadelphia Eagles, holders of the best record in the NFL coming into the game at 10-1. However, the Seahawks were not the most gracious of hosts, sending their visitors packing after a 24-10 game that saw the Eagles held to their lowest point total of the season. The Seattle defense was shorthanded without Cliff Avril, Kam Chancellor and Richard Sherman, but the Hawks quietly retooled and put together an extremely deep roster, including the recent addition of Byron Maxwell.
In the days leading up to the game, much was made of the showdown as “the Byron Maxwell revenge game.” (Or perhaps more accurately, the other way around). Maxwell signed a massive 6-year, $63M contract with the Eagles as a free agent in 2015, but was not a fit for their system and after just a single season they traded him to the Miami Dolphins. The Dolphins did their best to make use of Maxwell’s skills, but they released him earlier this year, and last month he re-signed with the Seahawks, setting up the alleged revenge game.
However, while Maxwell was shipped out of Philly by the team’s front office, he was at least packaged with Kiko Alonso and traded away in exchange for the right to move up in the draft. That can’t be said for Marcus Smith II.
Smith was drafted by the Eagles with the 26th pick in the 2014 NFL draft after having been the AAC Defensive Player of the Year at Louisville in 2013. Hoping they were getting an impact edge rusher, the Eagles never got the production they were hoping for out of Smith, and by the spring of 2017 the team had declined to pick up his fifth year option. Just months after that, on the day prior to their first practice of training camp, the Eagles waived Smith.
Despite having been a first round pick, Smith went unclaimed on waivers and became a free agent. Always on the lookout for a talented reclamation project, Pete Carroll and John Schneider signed Smith just two days after he had been waived. While he has not been an impact player, he has made solid contributions as a role player collecting 2.5 sacks and 7 tackles so far this season while averaging just under two dozen defensive and special teams snaps a game.
And Sunday gave Smith the chance to play in his own revenge game.
He did not put up a gaudy statline, and in fact he won’t even be noted in box scores that skip quarterback hits. He did not register a single sack or tackle in the game, but he did get credited with a hit on Carson Wentz. It was one of twelve quarterback hits the Seattle defense delivered on the night while making Wentz the most pressured quarterback in the NFL in Week 13.
And it may have been after the game that Smith delivered his biggest hit of the night when he took a moment to send out the following tweet.
Talk that shit!— Marcus Smith II (@MarcusSmithII) December 4, 2017
It does not take a lot of imagination to believe that this win felt very good for Smith, and that he will be taking a moment to bask in the glory of the team that fired him barely four months ago.
Congratulations, Marcus, on the victory over your former team, and Seahawks fans hope that you have several more victories to celebrate this season.Free Shipping from 100€ in Germany, Italy, Luxemburg, Great Britain, Austria, Netherlands, Spain and Portugal!

The worst component ended up being if I were the only one who was this lonely that I felt as. IвЂ™d see every one of these freshmen walk in packs вЂ” only massive sets of friends already formed in the 1st fourteen days of college. I really couldnвЂ™t muster the courage to inquire of individuals to get meal. It abthereforelutely was so aggravating. We immediately fired up myself вЂ” blamed and criticized myself if you are strange and unapproachable.
We invested a lot of the time on social media marketing, constantly checking in on my senior school buddies and seeing the way they were certainly getting along at their universities. TheyвЂ™d post more and text me less. I truly attempted to place myself on the market, nevertheless the more folks I came across, the greater defeated I felt. I ended up beingnвЂ™t thinking about forging fake relationships out of requisite, i needed genuine friendships that We could treasure. Why couldnвЂ™t we locate them in my own month that is first on?
We poured my loneliness in to the film that is four-and-a-half-minute made, called вЂњMy College Transition.вЂќ We posted it on YouTube anticipating only my teacher and a couple of buddies to notice it.
It now has over 275,000 views and a huge selection of reviews. I experienced pupils from around the nation get in touch with me personally and show their experiences, thanking me to make them feel less alone. Administrators from different universities penned for me seeking authorization to demonstrate the video clip for their freshman class. We also landed a few video that is freelance jobs. We talked on panels, offered a great deal of interviews and won an prize at a movie event.
It had been overwhelming when you look at the many stunning method, and had been further evidence that We wasnвЂ™t alone in my opinion. In addition revealed exactly just just how necessary it absolutely was for individuals to likely be operational about isolation on university campuses.
Now a sophomore, I observe how absurd my objectives had been for my very first year. To assume i possibly could immediately satisfy my New close friends while also used up to a place that is new beginning a brand new scholastic job, and learning simple tips to adapt to life far from home вЂ” thatвЂ™s a complete dish currently. A number of the school that is high I became missing have been my buddies for my expereince of living.
Anticipating close relationships just like the people which had taken years to build up had been unjust to myself and also the individuals around me. Going to college is a massive modification вЂ” a lot of pupils are increasingly being uprooted through the familiar conveniences of these homes and thrust into a place that is completely new. It had been beyond unrealistic for me personally to anticipate a transition that is seamless.
I had people of all ages and genders reaching out to me, explaining how they felt the same way when they started a new job, when they moved to a new place, even when they started retirement after I posted the video.
Loneliness is simply too frequently combined with self-blame and self criticism: вЂњI canвЂ™t find my destination among these social individuals, so that it must certanly be my fault.вЂќ My social life became a big game of trial and error, gradually learning by which teams we felt welcome and included. It had been hard! It had been draining! But by placing myself around, i came across therefore communities that are many campus to take a position myself in, and where we knew I would personally be joyfully received.
The movie ended up being absolutely a discussion beginner, also it made individuals more prone to start as much as me personally about their battles as being a freshman. But we donвЂ™t think the video clip had been any kind of motivator for folks to really be my buddy.
Now, a 12 months after making the movie, iвЂ™ve settled in to college a lot better. But we look at brand new batch of freshmen around me personally and imagine quite a few are getting through equivalent change. HereвЂ™s exactly exactly what I’m sure now I could have told my younger self that I wish.
You canвЂ™t clone your twelfth grade friends
The idea that my university buddies must be stand-ins for my relationships that are close house: impossible. One of many things that are great going away to university may be the opportunity to meet folks who are not similar. We discovered to cherish each relationship for the individuality, when it comes to perspective that is different tips it brought into my entire life. To start with I sought out those who reminded me personally of my buddies from your home, who does play a role that is similar my entire life which they do. But we begun to recognize that there is no-one to stay in for or replace them вЂ” that was oddly comforting, and a relief to acknowledge.
Social media marketing just isn’t reality
I experienced to reduce my time on social networking. It became a platform for contrast. We evaluated every photo my buddies posted, christiandatingforfree promo code determining whether their college appeared as if more fun than mine, should they had made more buddies than I experienced, simply meaningless justifications for my unhappiness. It had been reassuring whenever friends that are old away to me personally to express which they associated with the video clip. Many of them were individuals we thought had been having a great time at school. Social networking reinforces the idea that you need to constantly be having a good time, itвЂ™s strange never to be delighted and therefore life is a consistent blast of good experiences and photo-worthy moments. We taught myself that everyoneвЂ™s university experience is significantly diffent, and gradually, We began to embrace the individuality of personal.
Offer your self time for you to adjust
Transitions are often difficult вЂ” regardless of one’s age. However the social objectives around university place overwhelming force on pupils to fit right in seamlessly in their campus, without undoubtedly acknowledging the problem of uprooting your daily life and beginning fresh. The thing that is hardest to share with struggling freshmen is the fact that acclimation takes time вЂ” and вЂњthrivingвЂќ even longer. Acquiring buddies is definitely a process that is active and all sorts of the preconceived ideas university students arrive with could make for the defeating experience. Recognize that your loneliness is certainly not failure, and therefore you may be definately not being alone in this feeling. Open the mind and just take experiences because they come. YouвЂ™re planning to find your individuals.A non-profit, homeschooling organization with 25+ years of proven college-prep success.

July 2021 – The Drew University Theatre and Dance Department’s AdvantageArts program returns to the stage after postponing last summer’s program due to COVID-19.
The AdvantageArts program, which began in 2010 under the guidance of the late Rodney Gilbert, provides artistic training and college preparation to Newark high school students. The program is led by professors Lisa Brenner, Chris Ceraso, Kimani Fowlin, current Drew students, and Drew alums.
This summer’s performance, Game, No Game, is an original play by Newark-based artist and filmmaker Teolinda Azizzi, and was choreographed by Fowlin, assistant professor of dance. It will be streamed on July 28th and 29th at 7 pm.
“In Game, No Game, tempers run high and deep beliefs are tested when three ‘streamers’ play an online video game in which they attempt to build the world in which they want to live,” explained Ceraso, professor of theatre arts.
Working with the high school students has been an eye-opening experience for all involved.
“It’s so inspiring to be able to work with such intelligent and amazingly talented students,” said Alize Martinez C ’18, an alumni mentor.
“My favorite part of this experience has been connecting and bonding with the students and being able to create such great work with them.”
Brenner, chair and professor of theatre, reflected on her work with two specific AdvantageArts students over the last several years, and is proud of the impact the program has had on their academic careers.
“Zachery Halley has participated in the program since high school. Teachers from AdvantageArts helped him with his auditions for college and he is now a rising junior at Kean University, majoring in theatre. Khyri Fortenberry participated in the 2018 summer intensive program and is now here at Drew. It’s an honor to watch students grow, gain confidence, and hone their craft.”

Fulham
Local Area
Around Fulham
of FulhamFulham is an affluent residential area of south west London, that is home to a wealth of boutique shops, restaurants, and a number of beautiful parks.
The Kings Road, which runs between Fulham and Chelsea, is renowned for its chic boutiques, home-goods stores, and upmarket restaurants and cafes. But Fulham’s most famous restaurant remains the Michelin-starred The Harwood Arms, which can be found hidden around the corner from Fulham Broadway station.
The popular Parsons Green area of Fulham has the atmosphere of a country village surrounded by three pubs, the White Horse, known colloquially known by many as the “Sloaney Pony”, the Duke on the Green, and Aragon House.
The centuries-old former bishops’ residence on the riverside, Fulham Palace, is another landmark of the area. Featuring architectural styles from Tudor to Georgian amid landscaped gardens and what was once the longest moat in England, the palace remains a popular destination for tourists and locals alike.
Every Sunday, Fulham residents flock to the Bishop’s Park Farmers and Fine Foods Market for its locally sourced, organic fruit, veg and produce. Or for those that prefer a more hustle-and-bustle seasonable market, the award-winning North End Road Market is open Monday to Saturday.
Fulham is also famous for its football, with Craven Cottage the home of Championship team Fulham FC since 1986. Their biggest rivals, Chelsea FC, are also just a stone’s throw away at Stamford Bridge Stadium, which is located on the Fulham Road.
For those who are looking for a more exclusive sporting clubs, Fulham is also home to the Hurlingham Club, best known for its polo, and Queen’s tennis club, which hosts an annual pre-Wimbledon grass court tournament that attracts stars from around the world.

Full day charter .I’m still working through a few of the January incoming, but I’ve also already had a chance to listen to a few of these titles which were sent our way in February:
1. Digital ARC of The Rift Walker (Vampire Empire, Book Two) by Clay and Susan Griffith, read by James Marsters for Buzzy Multimedia:
“A worthy successor in story, narration and production for the Audie-nominated The Greyfriar. James Marsters as a cast of vampires could not be more perfect.” — The AudioBookaneers. (That’s Sam.)
2. Receiving review copies from Blackstone Audio through its Downpour service could not really be much easier. Here’s what I picked up from the offerings in January and February so far:
The City of Devi By Manil Suri, Read by Vikas Adam and Chris Sorenson; Farside By Ben Bova, Read by Stefan Rudnicki; A Teaspoon of Earth and Sea By Dina Nayeri, Read by Sneha Mathan; Daughters Who Walk This Path By Yejide Kilanko, Read by Claudia Alick; Birthright By Mike Resnick, Read by Tom Weiner; and The Free Lunch by Spider Robinson, read by the author. (And I’m trying to decide whether that’s all I can handle as I may have already exceeded my reach by one, or picking one last between AFTERMATH and THE STOCKHOLM OCTAVO.)
3. And late last week, from Brilliance Audio, a little box of goodies:
The Mad Scientist’s Guide to World Domination edited by John Joseph Adams, read by Stefan Rudnicki, Justine Eyre, and Mary Robinette Kowal — available now; Oz Reimagined edited by John Joseph Adams and Douglas Cohen, read by Tanya Eby and Nick Podehl — available Feb 26; and Six Heirs (The Secret of Ji, Book 1) by Pierre Grimbert, translated by Matthew Ross and Eric Lamb, read by Michael Page — available now.
4. And finally, from Kobo, a two-week evaluation unit of their new Android-based Arc tablet:
On which I’ve (pictured) been enjoying a DRM-free audiobook stack from content to OS, using the Downpour Android app. Plenty more thoughts to come on this one.
WHEW. Some very varied listening here, from fantasy to Steampunk to vampires to Mad Scientists to post-apocalyptic India to space sf, and following an interest with some mainstream fiction titles as well. Check back in the coming months for the reviews!Harare – Zimbabwe’s main opposition the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, has slammed the “painstakingly slow and thoroughly inefficient” voter registration exercise undertaken by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC).
The biometric voter registration (BVR) system was rolled out throughout Zimbabwe’s 63 district centres on Monday and was set to continue until January 15, 2018 for the polls in which President Robert Mugabe would seek to extend his 37-year-long stranglehold on power.
In a statement, MDC spokesperson Obert Gutu called upon the electoral body to “urgently and immediately up its game” in ensuring that the biometric voter registration system was a success.
Gutu said that only one BVR machine was being used in each of the registration centres and as a result, this caused “unnecessary delays in the voter registration exercise”.
“ZEC has got a constitutional obligation to undertake a credible, efficient and transparent voter registration exercise but so far, the situation on the ground leaves a lot to be desired. We demand more seriousness and focus on the part of ZEC,” said Gutu.
This came a week after the opposition party filed court papers alleging that the registration authorities were not ready for the process.
The MDC argued at the High Court in Harare that the electoral commission had not procured enough equipment to register voters and that the registration process itself lacked transparency.Archaeological Evaluation of Prehistoric Resources Within the Montreux Specific Plan Residential Development

Amancio Ortega Gaona has spent more than a decade amassing a high-end real estate portfolio across Europe and the United States, but this would be the first property of his in Canada, and the price comes close to a record valuation.
The founder and majority shareholder of Zara’s parent-company Inditex SA has made a firm offer of $255-million to acquire the building, which features high-end retail tenants Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co., and is expected to close in July, sources familiar with the transaction say.

Ranked by Forbes in 2014 as the world’s fourth-richest man with a net worth of US$65-billion, Mr. Ortega is the owner of Ponte Gadea SL, a real estate holding company with a global reach.
Since 2001, Ponte Gadea has made $5.9-billion in acquisitions, targeting retail and office space in the U.S., Spain and the United Kingdom, according to data from global research firm Real Capital Analytics.
An employee at Ponte Gadea’s head office in Spain declined to speak to a reporter on Thursday.
While Ponte Gadea has acquired a former duke’s residence in London, the Torre Picasso in Madrid, and the Gucci Building in Beverly Hills, among its many holdings, the company had not shown up on the property scene in Canada, until now.

One industry source said this first deal would have one of the highest valuations ever paid by a private group in the country.
“They are just parking their money, that’s all this is,” said a second real estate industry observer.
In recent years, foreign buyers have generally avoided the Canadian real estate landscape — with its record-high transaction prices and robust loonie — in favour of other global markets offering higher returns.
“Canada looks expensive for foreign buyers,” observed Dan Fasulo, a managing director at Real Capital’s offices in New York City.
Indeed, foreign buyers accounted for only 2.5% of all commercial real estate transactions during the first quarter of 2014, according to data from commercial real estate services firm CBRE Ltd. That proportion dipped to as low as 1.4% in 2012, a year when aggressive pricing and real estate investment trusts dominated the Canadian real estate landscape, culminating in record-breaking deals like the $1.27-billion sale of Toronto’s Scotia Plaza to Dundee REIT and H&R REIT.

“When the REITs were on fire, it was hard for the foreign buyer,” said Ross Moore, director of research at CBRE Canada. “At some point, these [transaction] numbers don’t work.”
But as REIT activity has slowed, declining to 11% of volume during the first quarter, down from 22% in 2013, pension funds and private investors are expected to be the most active buyers of 2014. High-net-worth families are said to be among them.
. Moore said.
In another example, sources also told the Financial Post that the family behind the Canadian cheese-making giant Saputo Inc. is now poised to acquire a 50% stake in the historic Sun Life Building in Montreal from provincial pension fund manager, the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec.

Ivanhoe Cambridge, the real estate arm of the Caisse, is also one of the three current owners — including PSP Investments and Kevric Real Estate Corp — of the Yorkville building in Toronto targeted by Mr. Ortega.
A spokesperson for Ivanhoe Cambridge refused to comment on the sale of either property.
Kevric president Richard Hylands also refused to comment on the identity of the buyer of the Toronto building, or the $255-million price.
The building was last purchased without tenants in 2008 for around $85-million. It is now almost completely filled.
Mr. Hylands said the property was specifically marketed to foreign buyers and large institutional investors.
“The REIT market was not our target market,” he said.
Indeed one source said the $255-million price would have been too high for the REITs, on a price per square foot basis. The building is said to be trading at a 4.575% capitalization rate, the rate of return it is priced on. The lower the rate, the higher the building’s valuation.
“It makes sense [that Ortega’s group is buying it] because they are buying everything and willing to pay more than anyone else,” the source said. “This is they type of retail these guys are buying everywhere.”

17.08.2020
Egypt approved a new law on Sunday to protect the identity of women who come forward to report sexual harassment or assault in a move that aimed to encourage women and girls to report cases of sexual violence.
The law, which will give victims the automatic right to anonymity, comes as hundreds of women have started to speak up on social media about sexual assault in a #MeToo movement in Egypt where women have long felt disadvantaged.
Female parliamentarian Ghada Ghareeb said the law was a step "in a long road of issuing regulations that preserve women's rights".
"The government had noticed that there was a sharp decline in women being able to report cases of sexual assault they have been subjected to because they fear of social stigma," Ghareeb told journalists.
Ghareeb expected the approval of the law would increase reporting of sexual assaults in the coming months in the conservative, Muslim-majority nation.
The bill was approved by the cabinet early in July and submitted to parliament after being presented by the Ministry of Justice. It followed a widely-published case in July of a university student from a wealthy background who was arrested and accused of raping and blackmailing multiple women. Investigations are continuing.
The case triggered a #MeToo wave in Egypt with the National Council for Women saying it received 400 complaints mainly about violence against women within five days of the case being made public and hundreds of women started to share stories online.
The debate escalated further after an Instagram page revealed a gang rape case in a Cairo hotel, with the six men involved believed to be from powerful, rich families.
The state-run National Council for Women said it stood beside every woman and girl who was exposed to any form of threat by providing the necessary support. The council urged any women who had face such attacks to come forward to both the council and the public prosecution, and to report the incident quickly through official reporting mechanisms.
A 2017 news agency poll found Cairo to be the most dangerous megacity for women, and 99% of women in Egypt interviewed by the United Nations in 2013 reported sexual harassment.
An outcry over attacks on women near Tahrir Square during President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi's inauguration celebrations in 2014 prompted a new law punishing sexual harassment with at least six months jail, but many activists saw this as too weak. (Thomson Reuters Foundation) Kenya filter Kenya

An Updated Checklist of Globally Threatened Species in Bhutan as Listed in IUCN Red List of Threatened Species
Manita, Tej Kumar Nepal
Abstract: Bhutan lies to the East of Himalaya and it hosts around 11, 248 species in all taxa. Bhutan’s lush and green forest covers 71 percent of land which comes under the five National Parks, four Wildlife Sanctuaries, 1 Strict Nature Reserve, Community Forests and biological corridors connecting different protected areas. More than half (51.44 percent) is protected by law and activities are restricted under certain circumstances. It is home to Takin (Budorcas taxicolor whitei), White-bellied Heron (Ardea insignis), Black-necked Crane (Grus nigricollis), Red Panda (Ailurus fulgens), Great Hornbill (Buceros bicornis) and Chinese Pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) that are globally threatened. Bhutan contributed around 23 new species between 2017 and 2020 which were new to science, and Bhutan’s biodiversity holds immense opportunities for researchers and environmental scientists as its biodiversity is in early stage of discovery. To date, Bhutan records 1 species as Extinct (EX), 1 species as Extinct in the Wild (EW) and 134 species as Vulnerable (VU), Endangered (EN) and Critically Endangered (CR) under International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. This paper aims to report a checklist of globally threatened species listed in IUCN Red List of Threatened Species from Bhutan. The paper also lists down the new species that were discovered in Bhutan since 2017. More researchers are needed to discover new species from Bhutan’s rich and lush forest.

Ransomware Protection allows detection of processes that attempt to encrypt user's files using known algorithm that defines processes as a security threat. Ransomware is one of these processes. When entering a computer such malicious programs block access to user data and then demand ransom for decryption. They are considered among the most common malicious programs and cause great annual losses both to companies and ordinary users. The most common way of getting infected are bulk emails containing malicious files or a link to malware.
According to Doctor Web statistics, probability of restoring files compromised by encryption ransomware is only 10%, that is why the most efficient way of fighting it is to prevent the infection. Recently the number of users that have suffered such infection has decreased. However, the number of Dr.Web technical support requests for decryption reaches 1000 every month.
To enable or disable Ransomware Protection
1.Open Dr.Web menu , then select Security Center.

Opened in 1938, Hillington was the first industrial estate in Scotland. Although a large Rolls-Royce factory was subsequently built there, most of the units were small and set among well-maintained lawns and flowerbeds in a pleasant working environment. The estate continues to thrive in 2004 although retail units and service industries have taken the places of many of the original factories..57 / OG.1955.121.[57]

Apple did announcement via a blog post saying that a small number of devices manufactured between October 2020 and April 2021 may have sound problems due to component failure on the receiver module. The free repair will not apply to the iPhone 12 minis or iPhone 12 Pro Max in particular.
Apple said that users who own devices that cannot omit sound from their receiver when making or receiving calls may be entitled to a free repair. If you think this applies to you, there are several ways to get a free service. Users can use both this link to contact an Apple Authorized Repairer, Apple support to send mail service route, or simply make an scheduling in retail.
The news comes after the big, and somewhat unexpected concession from the company in battle to allow independent technicians to do so device repairs. In that case Apple announced created a new self-service repair program in which Apple would sell parts and tools needed for repairs to independent technicians as well as to the general public, a long-standing claim by advocates of the right to repair. The move marked the departure of a company that had previously held tight control over repairs and imposed severe penalties on technicians who used non-sanctioned Apple products.
Apple said in its announcement that the first phase of the program will focus on “most common service modules” such as screens, batteries, and cameras, with the possibility of additional repairs next year.
“Creating greater access to Apple genuine parts gives our customers even more choice if a repair is needed,” Apple’s chief operating officer Jeff Williams said in a statement. The announcement of the self-service repair arrived a week after Apple announced it would release a software update that would make it easier for independent technicians to repair the iPhone 13s without destroying the FaceID feature.

OBSERVED: My niece was living with us at the time of the sighting. She was a senior in high school. Our house is about 6 miles out of town and in 1987 when the incident occurred, it was very rural, though now it has become quite developed. The school buses didn't go down the side roads so kids would have to walk to the closest main road. We live not too far off the bus route. The neighbor girl drove to school and she would often stop and give my niece a ride as she was walking to the bus stop. On this particular morning she had just gotten in the neighbor's car when about 50 yards ahead, this creature came out of the swamp area on the right side of the road, paused in a crouching position, started crossing, then dashed very quickly across the road and into the woods. She said she turned to the neighbor girl and said, "What the hell was that?" To which the girl answered "I don't know!" She says it was about the size of a bear, brown in color, but was definitely not a bear. It started crossing the road walking like a gorilla (she even wondered if it could have been an orangutan or some kind of ape), then it ran the rest of the way very fast on all fours. The whole incident happened so fast that she was not able to see much of the hands or feet. She described it to me as being like an ape, but also sloth-like. I said unless there had been an escaped primate from a traveling circus, we just don't have them in Washington. She said it had hair covering its entire body and she noticed hair hanging from its arms. She also heard from the swamp a whoop-whoop-whoop sound. Thinking back she realizes that she had heard that sound coming from the swamp before, but thought it was some kind of bird. It ran into an area of hundreds of wooded acres which eventually dip into the valley beyond (we are up on a plateau). There is a ravine in the middle of this area. To the right, past the swamp and as the crow flies there is Woods Creek about a mile or more away. The deer pass by this area headed toward water at Woods Creek. My niece said that she and the neighbor girl didn't say a word all the way to school and when they arrived she said again "What WAS that?" They both were dumbfounded. She said it gave her the creeps and she felt scared. We have talked about it on and off for years trying to think what it could have been. A couple of weeks ago we sat down and I made a sketch while she guided me. Actually she had to modify and finish it because I just could not figure out what she meant about how the head, chest and face looked. When I saw her alterations I thought no wonder she was scared.
ALSO NOTICED: Another curious thing happened, though I don't know if it was related. At the time we had a scrappy little dog. Within about a year of the sighting, in the middle of the night the dog went crazy barking, scratching to get out. We let her out. She ran into the woods in the direction of our neighbor's pond barking all the way. All of a sudden there was a yelp and then nothing. The next day we combed the woods but all we found was a little piece of meat that looked like liver. We always thought it was coyotes. The whole area was abundant with rabbits, so we thought it odd they would take a dog.
OTHER WITNESSES: Yes, the neighbor girl. She moved aboout 6 months after that.
OTHER STORIES: Yes, in about January of this year I was awakened from a sound sleep around 2 A.M. to what I thought was a woman being murdered--a loud screaming. I got up and quickly opened the window. I was ready to call the police. The screams seemed to be coming from down the neighbors drive getting closer and closer. Then, from the back wooded edge of our property (which borders the neighbor's drive), I heard what I thought was a loud owl, but kind of like a peacock. The scream was in the middle of two other sounds (howls?) There were about 3 scream-sequences and 3 owl-peacock calls. Once I opened the window it quit. I listened for about ten minutes with the window open but I didn't hear anything else.
TIME AND CONDITIONS: 6:45 A.M.
ENVIRONMENT: Back then the area was primarily mixed evergreen and deciduous woods with lots of understory of blackberries, salmon berry, wild plum and other NW bushes. There are a number of wetlands in the immediate vacinity. We had a pond which is now dried up, our neighbor had a pond (still do) and the swamp where the creature came from was a haven for wetland birds. Around March all these ponds are full of frogs mating and laying eggs, which ducks and herons would feed on. There was a large amount of undeveloped land all around. We had an orchard and many of the people in the area including us raised chickens, rabbits and goats. The fruit trees tended to draw deer. At night we would sometimes hear something large leaning on the goat gate, grunting and rattling it. We assumed it was a bear.We dive deep into Canada’s most beloved picture book.

Ancestors
Both my father and mother came from Macedonia, which today is Aegean Macedonia, or northern Greece. My father, Argire Vasil Lebamoff, was born in 1892 in Visheni, part of the Kostur district. According to legend, the village name was derived from "Baba Visha," a highly respected midwife for the Christian wives of the ruling Turkish lords.
My father's parents were Maria Stumboff and Vasil George Lebamoff of Visheni. Vasil was one of three children of George Dimitri Lebamoff, for whom I was named. My father told us stories about his childhood, going to school under the yoke of the Sultan of Turkey, because the Turks ruled Macedonia for centuries.
In 1903 tragedy happened to many Macedonians, especially in my father's family. On the August 2 feast day of St. Ilia, Macedonian peasant insurgents in several towns and villages began battling the Turks in what became known as the "Ilinden Insurrection." His grandfather George and mother, Maria, were at the village water fountain, located on their property. Across the street, their neighbor Tipo Tsuleff (whose granddaughter I would marry some fifty years later) was meeting with other revolutionaries in his home, their rifles placed against a window. When Turkish soldiers passing through town stopped to drink at the fountain, they noticed the glare from the rifles in Tipo's house and immediately began firing at both rebels and villagers. Several Macedonians were killed, including Tipo, as well as my great grandfather George and my grandmother, Baba Maria, who died in my father's arms. He was eleven years old at the time. The Turks also set fire to Macedonian houses and destroyed much of the village's livestock. The peasant revolt was a failure.
My father then lived with relatives and various neighbors until 1907. His brother Atanas (Thomas) was not in Visheni at the time of the Ilinden insurrection, but was with other Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) rebels near Istanbul fighting Turkish soldiers. Founded in 1893 for the political autonomy of Macedonia, IMRO was an aggressive underground movement even after Ilinden. Tom was arrested for bombing an Istanbul bank and sentenced to prison.
On his release a few years later, some of the old-timers in the village told my father, "Tomorrow your brother will probably be coming across the Vicho Planina mountain." My father, who was about twelve years old by then, waited at the bottom of the mountain and suddenly saw a figure coming toward him. He ran and ran to Uncle Tom. He was warned of bears and wolves in the mountains. "Don't go!" But my father just kept running to meet his brother.
At age fifteen, my father traveled nearly seven miles to the county seat of Kastoria, where a Jewish merchant loaned him money to buy transit to the United States. He came third class on the French liner Lorraine, with a Turkish passport and name, Sultani Argeris. The ship arrived at Ellis Island on April 28, 1907.
My father always commented that his village of Visheni was in a beautiful, magnificent area. "Do you think we came to America because the water was cleaner or the mountains more beautiful?" he would ask. "We came to America for one reason. We came for freedom."
At Ellis Island newly arrived immigrants were required to run up a flight of stairs, met at the top by a nurse and doctor. Any person showing physical weakness might be sent back to Europe. After passing the test, my father was greeted by his brother Thomas, who had immigrated in 1905 and settled in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
The city was primarily Catholic and German Lutheran, with smaller Polish, Italian, and Macedonian neighborhoods. The immigrants probably came to Fort Wayne because of its industry; they didn't need much education or to know the language well in order to do manual labor.
Some Visheni Macedonians immigrating to the United States at that time settled in Lansing, Michigan, to work at the Buick factory, or in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, hired in the auto and beer industries. Even today there are many Macedonian-Americans in the Lansing and Milwaukee areas, as well as in Fort Wayne. Most of those immigrants became Democrats because they wanted to vote for democracy. Maybe they were instructed that being a Republican meant voting for a kingdom.
My father and Uncle Tom, after meeting at Ellis Island, worked for six months at an ice-cream plant in Steelton, Pennsylvania, to earn their train fare to Fort Wayne. Once there, my father found work at the Bass Foundry, a manufacturer of train wheels. Knowing only a few English words and phrases, he was befriended by his German-speaking boss.
One day the German sent my father to the other end of the plant for dirt to mix with steel for the wheels. By the time he reached that part of the plant, he forgot what he was to say in English to the worker, who angrily kicked my father in the tailbone. When the boss found out what had happened, he told the worker, "If you ever touch this boy again, I'll kill you." The kick caused a permanent welt on my father's tailbone; it never healed properly. Fortunately, a few years later, the United States Congress passed the Cox law prohibiting any employer from inflicting physical harm on an employee.
While working at Bass Foundry, my father lived with an elderly German woman. In exchange for low rent, he did household chores, kept coal in the furnace, shoveled snow, cut the grass, tended the garden, shopped at the nearby grocery and dry goods store, on the corner of Hanna and Hayden.
He and his brother became friends with the Jewish owner of the store, Mendel Frank, and my father began doing chores for him, as well. After a few years, Mr. Frank asked my father and his brother how much money they had saved, and they told him. "That's enough," he said. "I'm going to sell you my business."
He arranged the sale for a certain hour on a certain day. Every thirty days after that, Mendel Frank would come to the store, look at his watch, walk up and down the sidewalk until the minute the payment was due. Then my father and Uncle Tom would give him an envelope with the money.
Many of the store's customers had charge accounts. Mendel Frank talked about having a can of fruit or vegetables on the counter and adding it along with the customer's groceries to the account. If the person later said he was charged for an item he didn't receive, Mr. Frank would correct the bill. "I sold this can of peaches thousands of times over thirty-five years. That's how I made extra money." He did the same thing with a broom standing near the cash register. But both my father and uncle said they wouldn't continue that practice. "If we got caught, we'd end up in jail or sent back to the old country." The brothers operated V. Lebamoff Brothers grocery for thirteen years. They had such love for each other. Even though by then Tom had a wife and three children and my dad was a bachelor, they split the profits equally.
On behalf of their Macedonian homeland, the brothers helped establish a national organization of Macedonian immigrants in the United States and Canada. The Macedonian Patriotic Organization (MPO) was founded in Fort Wayne in 1922. Ten years earlier, during the Balkan Wars, the country had won independence from Turkey but in 1913 was partitioned between Bulgaria, Greece, and Serbia is no longer recognized as a separate country. Through this new organization, members in the United States and Canada supported the goal of an independent, united Macedonia. They held annual MPO conventions and published a weekly newspaper, the Macedonian Tribune. Soon the organization had 7,000 members, including a number of my relatives. Eventually my father and Uncle Tom decided to separate and begin their own businesses. "In fifteen minutes," my father said, "he gave me my money, he took his money." Tom opened a grocery at Weisser Park and Pontiac Street. Even then they talked together every day about their families and often about the MPO and the political situation in Macedonia.
My father bought a piece of property at 3230 Piqua Avenue (now South Clinton) and built his store there, which he named Liberty Grocery. Then he returned to his homeland to meet and marry my mother, Elena (Helen) Kachandonov, who was from the nearby village of Blatsa. She had two sisters, Dina and Vicha, and one brother, Risto.
My mother told us that her village had no church. "What do I know about religion?" she would say. "I know there's a God; I know there's a Jesus Christ, but that's all I know. Every year during Holy Week the priest would come on a donkey to our village to hear confessions, forgive our sins, and give communion. That was the extent of our religion." I don't know how my parents' marriage was arranged, because my mother was only six or seven years old when my father left Macedonia. The Stumboff family of my grandmother Maria lived in Blatsa, so she must have known the Lebamoffs and was probably involved in the match. They were married in Bulgaria because at the age of fifteen he had left Macedonia as a subject of the Sultan. My mother was smuggled out of Blatsa to the Bulgarian border, where my father was waiting. They were married in Plovdiv, then after a short honeymoon in Bulgaria sailed for the United States.
In Fort Wayne, my parents lived upstairs in the Liberty Grocery building. Their four children were born in the apartment, Marie Ann in 1925, George Argire in 1927, Ivan Argire in 1932, and Klement Argire in 1939.
In 1931, six years after opening Liberty Grocery, my father applied at Lincoln Bank for a $1,000 loan toward his nearly $4,000 expense to modernize and enlarge the store. "Mr. Lebamoff," the banker told my father, "I've refused millionaires today who wanted loans. On your integrity and your reputation, I'll loan you the $1,000." Then he turned to the head cashier and told him to arrange the loan. With the remodeling, the grocery line was expanded to fresh fruits and vegetables, baked goods, and a refrigerated display case in the meat section.
Soon after re-opening, however, the business was seriously affected by the Depression. Times were harsh, but my father allowed some customers to do odd jobs to barter for food. Elmer Smith, the Wayne Township trustee, sent needy people to buy groceries from my father instead of the A&P or another of the big stores. That helped in the early years of the Depression, and he always appreciated Elmer's help. But even then, my father considered those individuals as customers, not charity cases. And he stayed confident that the business would become successful again.
Liberty Grocery was closed on Sundays, although he was generally willing
to help customers with special needs. Only on Christmas, New Year's, and
Easter would he refuse to open the store. He had a strong work ethic, but
he had strong religious values, too. Nearly every Sunday, I would sit in
his lap in a loung chair and listen as he taught me songs about Bulgaria.
We sang Zhi fe to zhe fe, O Miko Mila, Shuma Maritza,
and Ez gray z Ra Na Svobodata. None of the Macedonian families in
Fort Wayne accepted welfare, because they were ashamed of it. They would
volunteer to work for food, and if they couldn't afford to eat for three
or four days, they didn't eat. It was a struggle, but the would write home
once or twice a year telling relatives or neighbors to come to America,
"You can stay at our house, you can get a job here." The first Macedonians
here made it easier for those who came later.

Have they failed to compensate you? If this is the case, you may not have a legal action for breach of contract, but there are options.
In Michigan, there is an equitable doctrine called “unjust enrichment”. Aggrieved individuals can pursue these actions in cases where there was no actual contract but, a benefit was conferred on someone and they should not be allowed to retain that benefit at the aggrieved individual’s expense.
To establish a claim for unjust enrichment, you must show that the other party received a benefit from you and that it is inequitable or unfair for that person to retain the benefit. If a court rules in your favor, the other party will be required to make restitution to you, even though no contract may exist between you and the other party! Has something like this happened to you? Contact GLLG to assist you in pursuing an action today!Article Text
Abstract
Shorter durations of slow wave sleep and lower growth hormone responses have been reported in children with short stature caused by psychosocial deprivation. We investigated whether lower total sleep duration was associated with shorter stature in a sample of children taking part in the National Study of Health and Growth. Parental responses to a self administered questionnaire were used to estimate usual times for going to sleep at night and usual times for waking in the morning for 5145 children aged 5 to 11 years of age. After adjusting for the effects of other variables known to be associated with height, it was shown that there was a weak negative association between sleep duration and height. It is concluded that variation in sleep duration between children is unlikely to have an important influence.Savour the Cevennes

James Colosimo, 32, of Hay River was charged with murder in September 2020 after Meg Darby Kruger, 18, was found dead at a home in the community’s McBryan Drive.
The relationship, if any, between the deceased and Colosimo is unknown. He was arrested on the same day her body was discovered.
Appearing briefly by video from the North Slave Correctional Complex, Colosimo listened as his lawyer, Charles Davison, addressed Chief Judge Robert Gorin in NWT Territorial Court on Friday.
“Your honour, having had a chance to review the disclosure … the new information before the court alleging second-degree murder, the defence is not requesting a preliminary inquiry,” said Davison.
Preliminary inquiries are held in Territorial Court to determine if there is sufficient evidence to proceed to trial in Supreme Court. They are available to an accused charged with a serious Criminal Code offence, but they are not always utilized for any number of reasons.
“The matter will simply go to Supreme Court at this point,” said Gorin. “There will be no preliminary inquiry.”
With the pandemic-related backlog of cases, when the trial might be scheduled is not clear. The trial may have to wait until later next year or even 2023.
Colosimo remains in custody.
In February, Davison requested a mental health assessment for his client. Colosimo has no serious convictions on his criminal record.
Meg Kruger graduated from Diamond Jenness Secondary School in 2019. She has five siblings.
After Meg’s passing, messages of sympathy left for her mother Marny Twigge on social media mentioned “that adorable, spunky girl that brought a smile to everyone’s face.”
Meg’s father was retired RCMP Staff Sergeant John (Jack) Kruger, a long-serving and accomplished RCMP member who passed away in 2014.
Correction: October 17, 2021 – 8:47 MT. This article initially reported that Meg Kruger has four siblings. She in fact has five.Every project manager faces project management issues from time to time. The good news is that managing risk and planning successful projects is easy when you use the right tools. The risks and issues project management professionals face can be prevented or decreased with a little advanced planning. Check out these project management problems and solutions you can use to effectively improve any future assignment with project management platforms such as Wrike.
Common problems in project management
The most common project management issues tend to revolve around communication, organization, and tool functionality When there are many moving parts in an initiative, communication can break down, information can become lost or confusing, and project management issues can arise at every level.
In this section, we’ll discuss how project managers can mitigate risk by identifying project management challenges and solutions. We’ll also get into the specific ways in which Wrike can solve or even prevent common project management issues.
1. Poor team communication
Did you know that 63% of people have missed a message or important piece of information that went into a colleague’s inbox while that colleague was away or absent? Poor team communication can create unnecessary confusion and misunderstanding that may impact the success of a project.
Solution: Swap disorganized email threads for Wrike’s work management capabilities, many of which allow users to chat about projects, attach relevant documents all in one place, and monitor changes in the deadline, scope, or anything else.
2. Vague goal setting
Vague goal setting is one of the more common project management issues that can leave employees feeling unmotivated when faced with a mountain of assignments. Giving them something to aim for will help keep work focused and productive.
Solution: When creating tasks, add details such as deadlines and approval requests to each step so each team member knows what to aim for.
3. Inaccurate time management
Neglecting to keep track of each individual’s time spent on tasks can lead to poor planning and performance. Understanding how long a task takes or how much billable work an employee is logging helps with setting project duration in the future and measuring employee productivity.
Solution: Automatically document how your teams spend time for more accurate billing and increased productivity with Wrike’s Timelog feature.
4. Costly scope creep
Almost 50% of projects experience scope creep which leads to overused resources, missed timelines, and overspending.
Solution: Communicate your vision clearly by plotting out phases, timelines, and task dependencies with Wrike’s visual planning tools to discover possible obstacles before they come up.
5. Lack of accountability
Team members sometimes get confused about who is responsible for what at various stages of a project, especially if they’re working on multiple projects at the same time.
Solution: Task assignees, @ mentions, and dashboards all make it simple to assign and monitor team progress. These tools also eliminate awkward “who was working on X” and “why hasn’t Y been completed” questions because all the details are in one place.
6. Uneven workload distribution
Some assignees may be overworked while others might be underutilized, creating an imbalance that can have a negative impact on your team long term.
Solution: Use Wrike’s workload charts to see individual team member availability across all active projects in real-time. Assign or reassign tasks to employees with more wiggle room in their schedule.
7. Overplanning
Project planning can take anywhere from 10% to 50% of your project timeline.
Solution: Use Wrike to duplicate the workflows of past successful projects so that you don’t waste time reinventing the wheel for every new assignment.
8. Poor risk assessment
Unexpected risks slow down projects because they take time to discover, assess, and remedy.
Solution: Map out all of your projects in Wrike to see what risks each may face. Then, determine which risks are worth managing, call out key triggers, and create a plan for each one.
9. Confusing expectations
Employees may know what to do but not when to do it or who they should collaborate with, which can lead to unnecessary back and forths or other time-wasting activities.
Solution: Use Wrike to record all assignments, deadlines, and objectives so that everyone on your team knows what needs to happen when.
10. No backup plans
To properly manage risks for project management issues, you need to make sure you know what to do if something goes wrong — which it inevitably will.
Solution: Create a contingency plan within Wrike that details who is responsible and what needs to happen. Apply this planning for every risk you identify in the process.
11. Ineffective resource management
Running out of time or other vital project resources (such as budget and materials) could create roadblocks for your clients or the project as a whole.
Solution: Use Wrike’s workload charts, task duration settings, and Gantt charts to see what and how many resources are needed.
12. Too little client engagement
Clients who don’t know what’s going on throughout the project can often feel dissatisfied with their experience, regardless of the project outcome.
Solution: Keep your key stakeholders in the loop with Wrike’s client view which allows designated users to review specific projects, folders, or tasks and see what progress has been made at any point.
13. Forgetting the big picture
If you manage more than one project or team at a time, there’s a chance you may overlook key issues that, when they arise, have the potential to derail entire assignments.
Solution: Track all of your active projects in Wrike to get a bird’s eye view of potential conflicts between all open assignments at a glance.
14. Poor team collaboration
Teams that lack the proper space to chat about projects and come up with creative ideas have a harder time accomplishing even the most basic of assignments.
Solution: Use Wrike to loop in team members using @mention for assignees, stakeholders, and followers of any folder or task. Any updates made to task descriptions or progress will be seen by all relevant parties and everyone involved has a place where they can brainstorm ideas together.
Manage these risks and issues with project management software
The most common problems in project management include everything from ineffective planning to poor communication and scope creep. However, using a project management tool can help you overcome or prevent all of these risks and issues.
Use Wrike’s two-week free trial to organize project details, strategically assign tasks, and create a well-oiled process that ensures the success of each assignment./>  (R&G) – premium skin brightening range to harness beauty with quality.

Well, if you like shopping around in your travel destination then you should visit flea market in the Basilica of St. Sernin when you travel to Toulouse. There are various goods you can buy as souvenirs. Make sure to impress the seller so you maybe can get some discount. You can also find some antiques if that’s what you like.
- If you bring your family for travelling to Toulouse, you might as well consider visiting The Cite de I’Escape. It is kind of museum, mixed with sense of entertainment. It is also called as Space Town by the locals. The place is full of Outer Space stuffs. It is not only entertaining but also educative.
- There is also possibility that you only want to relax and chill while you are in Toulouse. Then, you might as well go sightseeing. One of the most recommended spots for sightseeing is Bazacle Complex. The architectural complex has been gaining lots of attention from tourists. Besides, it is located near the Garonne River so the vibe is even more mesmerizing. The view is so picturesque.
- Another interesting thing about Toulouse is that you will find the largest church in the world located in Basilica of St. Sernin. It is not only a church building. Aside from architectural value, there are indeed valuable things in the building such as paintings, jewelry items, and leaf mural found from the 11th century.
- Just like other cities in Europe. There are plenty of museums in Toulouse you can visit. One of the most recommended museums is Augustinian Museum. There are many interesting things to see while visiting this museum. The exhibition displays collections of painting and sculptures in various style. Those are made by various artists. Even if you are not art lovers, there is high possibility that you will fall in love with the museum. The collections are great and the place is nice to visit with your friends or families. Denmark filter Denmark

ADAS and connectivity are not always the first things on the mind of a prospective motorcycle customer but they are making inroads slowly changing consumer expectations.
That’s the opinion of Alan Jones, Ducati UK press and racing manager, who sees the advance of technology through motorcycles being a key part of future product development. Speaking to TU-Automotive at Motorcycle Live 2019 in Birmingham, Jones said: “Bikers are still more interested in performance but look at ABS – when it first came in there was quite a lot of negativity about it. Yet, now, it’s pretty much standard across the range and people expect it to be there. The same could be true with all the electronic rider aids that are now available part and parcel of the bike. For example, a bike like the new Streetfighter has so much power that you really wouldn’t want to ride it without the electronic aids.”
All of those aids are needed in full in the brand’s latest naked urban blaster which boasts more than 200bhp from its 1,100cc Desmodromic valve V4 liquid-cooled motor in a package weighing just 397-lbs dry. Features like a selection of riding modes with three different pre-set riding styles adapted to rider, track/route and weather conditions, changing the character of the engine, the electronic control parameters and, on the S version, also the suspension set-up.
Its ABS system features a cornering function, which keeps the ABS working even with the bike leaned over and that can be set at three different levels to suit rider preferences on racetrack or road and even under low-grip conditions.
Naturally, with all that power being fed through a contact patch little bigger than a human palm print, traction control plays a big role and this system is an offshoot of the Ducati Desmosedici GP18 racer and is already. Yet, sliding is a performance feature of modern motorcycles so the bike boasts Ducati Slide Control (DSC), developed jointly with Ducati Corse racing team.
It’s the effect of the brand’s success in the top-flight racing arena of MotoGP that is currently driving the uptake of ADAS technology. Jones said: “We always make the point that a lot of the systems we use have filtered down from our experience in MotoGP. It’s an important aspect of the modern motorcycle that the customers can see where the technology has come from and is being used to improve their experience of riding the bike.”
Connectivity is a bigger sales point for the long distance tourer/commuter who has come to expect it in their cars and so look for it on their motorcycles such as the go-anywhere Multistrada models. Jones explained: “I think these riders are more into the connectivity systems because, while a sports bike will always be more about the performance, the handling the braking, on something like the Multistrada people will be spending much more time on the bike. They will want the connectivity in terms of looking at text messages on their dashboard and receive and send calls. Also, the electronics to change the suspension settings on the move are features that the modern biker appreciates. At the same time, it is early days in terms of bikes but as with many current features people will become more aware of them in future and they will become the expected features of a modern motorcycle.”

Great article, talking about tools that take away some of the risk elements ‘connected’ to riding a motorbike. However, one remark resonates: “For example, a bike like the new Streetfighter has so much power that you really wouldn’t want to ride it without the electronic aids.” You could argue to choose a less powerful bike. But the following statement, in my opinion, completely disqualifies the article: “They will want the connectivity in terms of looking at text messages on their dashboard and receive and send calls.”. Driving a mega powerful bike, assisted by ADAS systems not to have a accident and then get the possibility to be distracted with text messages and the possibility to receive and send calls…. What is Ducati thinking about?
I do agree that any level of distraction from technology can be an issue. However, MotoGP racers, living life on the edge, also have this technology to receive messages from the pitlane about how they are going in relation to other racers around them.
That said, you may be confusing the two machines in question, because in the second quote Mr Jones was referring to the touring model, Multistrada, which would be used at very much lower speeds for long distance trips rather than the Streetfighter which has a lot more power.
I stand corrected. Of course you can compare professional racing drivers with Joe Average and of course if you are driving a 113 to 158 horsepower motorbike you can be distracted by texts and receiving and sending messages. Both a recipe to go off course…..
I do agree but you have as much distraction from technology in the 200+mph hypercars you will see written about in TU-Automotive. Personally, I think it’s the responsibility of the driver/rider to prioritize their attention depending on conditions.
I’m fairly old-school and barely look at the dashboard at speed, as highlighted by the last traffic enforcement officer who stopped me on my Ducati 999S….Welcome to Peach City Radio

> Cups
By its image, the Two of Cups almost always suggests a relationship between two people. Indeed, this is the primary meaning of the card and the one that appears most often in readings. But the love described by this card is not always love for another person. Before we can truly love another we must learn to love ourselves, to love and accept all of the different (and often conflicting) facets of the gemstone that makes up our personality. Like the Temperance card, this is a card of harmonious union, not just of two people, but of two parts of the same person.
It must be said, however, that this card does have its drawbacks. The energy of the Two of Cups is slightly more diluted than the Lovers card, and not simply because of the Major/Minor Arcana power drop. Whereas the Lovers is the reunion of two complete beings, the Two of Cups is a more immature union that, stable as it may seem, does have the potential to fall apart. This is an ideal union, but as you know, there are few ideal cases in our real world! It is ambiguous whether the relationship shown by the Two of Cups can stand the test of time. Only the two people involved can decide that.
One factor in deciding the stability of a relationship is the stability of the people involved. As mentioned earlier, a high self-love will lead to a greater and more comprehensive love of others. So when this card does not appear to signal a relationship, see it as a sign that you have some that too.₹ 6,800.00

Ratings and Reviews
Just one problem
I love this app. It’s really user friendly and I replaced it with my Apple notes app which I really liked already. If you just want to sketch a drawing this is great. Definitely don’t use this if you’re a digital artist. However I have one problem. I have a Siri shortcut that creates a note for me, but when I exit that note, it doesn’t show me my notebooks, it just shows me a blank screen. So then I have to close the app out and then jump back in and it loads and FINALLY I can see my notebooks again. I think this is a great app for college students for taking notes. If you’re willing to pay for an app, I recommend notability. I love this app if you’re coming from apple notes. Did I mention that it has a dark mode! So everything about this app is great besides the Siri shortcut app problem. I think this is a great app for college students, people coming from apple notes, or people who use digital shopping lists. And one more thing, I think the iPhone version is a little harder to use, but the XS max or any iPad version is easier to use.
Not for everyone
I’ll start off by saying I have been a long time Evernote user. I saw that Zoho had built a tool to migrate all of your Evernote notes into their notebook and I thought wow that’s awesome. I use other Zoho products and love them. So I went ahead and did it. I then tried to use zoho notebook instead of Evernote. Just couldn’t do it. You can’t intelligibly sort the notes very well. You have to go to the settings dialog to globally sort things which is incredibly frustrating. Filtering is non existent. The biggest problem for me was the emphasis on tile view (when looking at a notebook) and making things these giant cards. In Evernote I have several view options for listing my notes and my personal favorite is the title, a couple lines of the body and an icon for an attachment to the right. This small list item card tells me a ton about the note. It might have been the migration from Evernote to Zoho notebooks that messed things up, but the only way I can find my notes in Zoho is to search. The note cards don’t have any description on them, only a blown up icon picture and the name of the attachment. Not useful. The last thing that I use in Evernote extensively is email to note. This is not in Zoho notebook and you have to use Zapier to make it work. Tried that and it is very clunky and doesn’t include any attachments.
In the end, I think the app is okay for simple notes, but heavy users should think twice. And coming from Evernote you will be limited.
This is amazing! But it just needs a few more!
I’ve downloaded a bunch of journaling apps and I absolutely love this one for notes too. I love the interface and the organization of it. I like to write down all my thoughts because I don’t have the friends to share them with. Despite the amazing appeal of it, there isn’t much you can do when it comes to writing. You’re not able to change the font of certain areas or highlight anything. I love being able to add audios and be able to draw but when it comes to the scribbling part, you’re making a separate photo rather than actually drawing on the notes that you wrote. What I think would make this app be one of the best note taking apps if they were able to add the ability to highlight text, change fonts, change the color of text, and be able to draw ON the text. It really upsets me that I’m other apps I’m required to pay them even though I can just do the same thing for free on an art program and also do the same exact thing easily for free with a real notebook and some pens, or on google docs we’re able to highlight and change the colors and all that. This addition would especially be helpful for me and many others during the pandemic since most of us are online learners.

"DnsCyte".
Figure 10. Dns Visibility Web Access
Basic System Configuration
After a successful Login to DNS Visibility, configure it to work with DNSCyte Reputation Service. First, ensure that the appliance has access to reputation.dnscyte.com on port 443. DNS Visibility can get category information of DNS requests, which is in DNS logs by using API Calls. Enabling Reputation service requires an API key for the appliance. The support team creates an API key. Once you get the key go to Admin-->Configuration and enter the key under item number 19. Once the appliance has access to reputation service on 443 Cyber-X-Ray Reputation service turns to be green under Admin-->System Information.
Figure 11. API key
Figure 12. API Services
Integration with DNS Server
Before configuring DNS Visibility virtual appliances, enable DNS DEBUG logging in the local DNS server and create access to DNS log files. In this document, we will show how to integrate with Microsoft DNS Server.
Enable Loging On Microsoft DNS Server
DNS Visibility works on DNS debug log files. By default, DNS debug log feature is disabled on Microsoft DNS servers. To enable DNS to debug logging go to Microsoft DNS Server manager and right-click on DNS server and select properties.

The creation of CBGP had its origin in the perception of a two-fold necessity: to continue doing basic research at a competitive level, and to respond to the demands of new products, processes and services by the economic agents related to plant biology. In the last few years, knowledge on plant biology has progressed to an unprecedented pace. A major cause for this progress is the development of innovative technologies that allow efficient and global analyses of genome structure, information and expression. The new technologies are rooted in advances in the sequencing of DNA and proteins, in the use of microchips, in the automation of many laboratory procedures, and in the possibility of handling large amounts of information through bioinformatic tools. Thus, in a few years, the stage has changed from that of knowing the sequence of a relatively small number of genes, into knowing the complete genome sequence of several plant species, including model plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana or Brachipodium distachyon, and important crops such as rice, maize, soybean, lucerne, squash or poplar, as well as of many micro-organisms involved in positive (mutualistic) or negative (pathogenic) symbioses with plants..Energy Efficient Air Conditioning Maintenance
conditioning units have simple configurations. There is box-like design that props up cold and hot sides in sole. An exhaust hose expels the heat and air conditioner prices water is condensed out on the air. The resulting water is collected in an inside drain bucket or any drain hose. Some portable air conditioners use evaporative technology to be sure little to no water is originated.

When you are preparing to install an air conditioning system in property then ensure it is in proportion to requirements exactly like you install other appliances inside the house. An 8000 BTU ac unit best fits an area of about 300-350 sq legs.
A free-standing air conditioner is rather handy should you like cool-down several spots in a flat or office, dejesus37bernstein.bravejournal.net but want not to experience to find the unit is situated a fixed location.

Surgery appointments are available on weekdays from 09.00 to 17.00 and can be booked at reception or by telephone. We would encourage during the pandemic that your initial contact is by
telephone.
General Clinic Times: 09.00 – 11.30 Telephone Triage by doctor, Face to face appointments that are only bookable by the doctor 14.30 - 17.00.
All consultations are by appointment only.
If you call for a doctor's appointment in the morning you will be offered a telephone 'triage' appointment by the reception staff. They will take your name and telephone number and a brief outline of the reason why you need an appointment. A doctor will then ring you as soon as possible. Please be patient as it may mean that they are unable to call until the end of the morning or early afternoon depending on demand.
Telephone triage and telephone consultations aim to improve access to care. As the number of patient contacts in general practice steadily rises and the nature of healthcare becomes increasingly complex, it is perhaps not surprising that many practices view triage as a way of safely managing the increasing demand while also meeting patients’ understandable desires for a timely response to their requests for urgent healthcare. The purpose of triage is to ensure that the patient is referred to the most suitable clinician for the appropriate level of care within an acceptable period of time.
If, during your telephone triage appointment, the doctor would like to see you , they will ask you to attend the practice at an assigned time in the afternoon..

Switch owners can (finally) watch livestreams of their favorite content creators, esports tournaments or maybe even animals at the zoo. The app works in both docked and undocked modes, too. Meaning you can Twitch on Switch wherever! Unless you’re driving, then it’s eyes on the road, buster.
It’s only a viewing app, though. So anyone hoping for a means to stream Switch gameplay similar to how the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S do it will likely be disappointed. Nintendo did release a few screenshots of how the Twitch app, which you can check out below.
Twitch is now available on #NintendoSwitch #eShop!

Nintendo catches a lot of heat for always being behind on the times and it’s kind of easy to see why. Twitch was huge well before the Switch ever came out, yet it’s only getting an app now. Maybe when the company isn’t busy dealing with supply chain issues, we can expect more dedicated apps like this.
The Twitch app is already up on the Nintendo eShop for free, at least. So go on, then. Give it a try!

The last few months have seen many backend updates and upgrades to our live streaming platforms. I’ll outline a few things that have happened below:
- Complete rewrite/update of the TCP socket engine for backend services. Far more stable and responsive.
- Complete rewrite of the client side API (sApi) server software (provides realtime data such as viewer count, stream goes off air/goes live, etc to the client)
- Complete rewrite of the archive management system.
- Built a much better remote server management system (allows restarting specific services remotely, monitor bandwidth, uptime, etc of each server)
- Accidentally fixed a memory leak in our video ingest software, one that has plagued us for many years and has been the cause of many video crashes.
- As a result of fixing the above memory leak, it has uncovered several “new” issues that were masked by the memory leak for many years. Those are being addressed. All are stability related issues.
- Rewrote the email confirmation system (formerly known as activation.)
- Expanded the metadata logged for each incoming stream. This helps us troubleshoot stream issues more easily.
- Expanded video ingest system to multiple bandwidth providers. We’ve been with Cogent for many years, now we’ve expanded to a more flexible blend of providers that has enabled a better experience over all.
- Expanded our video edge system into Europe for better latency/distribution to those outside North America.
- Over the last six months we’ve also ramped up the number of ingest points available for streamers, now totaling eleven points of presence. Streaming to the PoP (Point of Presence) that is physically closest to you allows for better stream stability for you and your viewers.
There are several other things to list, but it’s mostly tedious little things and day-to-day operation stuff. In a future blog post I’ll touch on what is currently being worked on, cover past issues as well as cover current known issues, and maybe a list of bug fixes.

Dr. Andrew Adesman of the Cohen Children's Center points out that while teens may not drink on a daily basis, they always carry their cell phones. Constant access may make it difficult for teens to ignore text messages and phone calls.
As reported by CBS News, despite education about the dangers, over 50 percent of teens admit texting while driving. Additionally, researchers found that laws against texting while driving have little impact. Fifty-seven percent of the teens surveyed admitted texting and driving, even in states where it is against the law.
The US Department of Transportation and the National Highways Traffic Safety Administration have partnered to present Distraction.gov. The website offers facts and statistics, along with real stories of lives shattered due to driving while texting or distracted.
According to the site, teen drivers are the most likely to drive while texting or otherwise distracted. Eleven percent of teens involved in fatal accidents were reportedly distracted when they crashed.
Drivers who are using cell phones while driving ate four times more likely to get into an accident. The average text takes 4.6 seconds to send or receive. In 4.6 seconds, the average vehicle, traveling 55 mph, can travel the length of a football field.
As of this month, the Governor's Highway Safety Association reports that 10 US states, including D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, have prohibited all hand-held cell phone usage while driving.
Thirty-nine states have banned texting while driving, including D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
As studies have revealed more teen deaths from texting and driving than DUI, it is essential to focus on prevention and enforcement. Unfortunately, the studies reveal little impact from educational campaigns and changing laws. Educators and law enforcement may be able to use the results of the study to develop more effective deterrents.The Musée du Louvre and Christie’s have joined forces for an unprecedented online auction

About this Apple Grilled Cheese: This Apple Grilled Cheese is also all about balance. The sweet caramelized onions and apples balance with the savory blend of white cheddar and brie cheeses.Incidentally, one other rational approach to solving this
problem would be to simply forbid use of the field width and
precision parameters with %b - that is, make it unspecified
what happens if either of those (or the left justification
flag) is given. None of those are needed for %b's purpose.
That would mean changing (deleting) the text that now exists:.
Bytes from the converted string shall be written until the end of the string ignoring any field width or precision specifiers.
Bytes from the converted string shall be written until the end of the string.
The effect of any field width or precision specifier is unspecified.
Another approach would be to handle another missing piece of
the specification. Nothing says what the "alternate output
format" flag does to 'b' conversions. All the others are
specified in XBD 5 (which for some is "undefined"), but 'b'
does not exist there, only in printf(1) and the spec of printf(1)
ignores the # flag completly. (The other flags are handled
by XBD 5 - which specifies the conversion types they apply to,
and implicitly makes then no-ops for the others, '+' for example
only applies to "signed conversions" but there's nothing wrong
with %+u or %+s - the '+' simply does nothing. But '#' is not
like that.
I doubt there is any good reason, but we could make use of that,
and have one of %b and %#b detect and process a \c anywhere it appears
in the arg string to the conversion, and the other ignore a \c in that
arg string if it would be dropped because of a precision specification.
If a precision is specified and the argument contains a '\c' after the point at which the number of bytes indicated by the precision specification have been written, it is unspecified whether the '\c' takes effect.Donkeyote and La Chana at AFI DOCS

From Academic Kids
Tylen, chronic use of acetaminophen increases liver damage from alcohol. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen is not particularly effective against pain from inflammatory disorders.
There are a wide array of different varieties of Tylenol available today including extra-strength, children's doses, longer-lasting, and sleep aiding (as a combination with a sedative antihistamine).
The patent on acetaminophen has expired, and the continued success of Tylenol brand preparations is largely due to marketing, the backing of Johnson & Johnson, and new patented delivery mechanisms such as quick-release and extended-release forms of the medication..
On September 30, had recovered in only a few years.
Tylenol remains a top seller, controlling about 35% of the pain killer market in North America.

Hip hop artist Night Shield grew up on the Rosebud Indian Reservation and has won two Native American Music Awards. He's the founder of the N.S.E. label and has caught the eye of Vibe magazine and the creators of the comic book series Scalped. But perhaps the biggest accomplishment on his recent resume occurred March 27—his six-month anniversary of sobriety.
On the same day, the video for "Pieces of Me" featuring Ashlee Faye, premiered on YouTube. It's the second single from his sixth album, Sex, Drunks & Hip Hop III: The Addiction.
“I wanted to show a balance in the lifestyle," Night Shield says. "While most of my album deals with the fun side of living life in the fast lane, 'Pieces Of Me' shows the repercussions, in my life anyway, to my battles with addiction. It’s definitely a song that hurt to write as I had to deal with things that I don’t always like to admit to myself."
Night Shield's music is available on iTunes and at Amazon.com.

The global variables are as follows:
qore_module_name[] - must give the name of the feature provided by the module.
qore_module_version[] - must give the version of the module
qore_module_description[] - a description of the module
qore_module_author[] - the author of the module
qore_module_url[] - a URL for the module
qore_module_api_major- must be assigned to QORE_MODULE_API_MAJOR
qore_module_api_minor- must be assigned to QORE_MODULE_API_MINOR
qore_module_license- must be assigned to either QL_GPL or QL_LGPL according to the license the module requires; if the module links with GPL code, then QL_GPL must be used; otherwise if it is compatible with the LGPL then QL_LGPL must be used
The functions are as follows:
qore_module_init- the module initialization function
qore_module_ns_init- the module namespace delta functions
qore_module_delete- the module deletion function
Here is an example:
Note that the module name (or the module's feature name) as given by
qore_module_name is used to uniquely identify the feature provided by the module. Therefore if a module is loaded that provides feature "widget" and another module also claims to provided feature "widget", the second module cannot be loaded in the Qore library after the first has been loaded due to the duplicate feature name.
The
qore_module_api_major and
qore_module_api_minor variables are used to determine if the module corresponds to the API (and ABI) of the Qore library trying to load it.
The module initialization function
qore_module_init() will be run when the module is loaded by the Qore library. If any errors occur when initializing the module, a description should be returned as a QoreString pointer (the library will own the pointer and delete it later). If a non-zero pointer is returned by the
qore_module_init() function, the feature will not be added to the Qore library and the module load will fail.
If the module provides any namespaces, classes or constants, they will be added on demand to QoreProgram objects by calling the module's
qore_module_ns_init() function. In this case, the namespace additions should be initialized in the
qore_module_init() function and copies should be provisioned in the
qore_module_ns_init() function. In particular classes must not be created more than once, because a Qore class gets a unique ID assigned when it is created, and this ID must be unique in the entire Qore library.
Here are example functions from the ncurses module:Electronics Expertise

Assume for a second about your favorite retail store. Chances are high you’re not a lot in love with the clothes, but the feel and appear of the store. Whenever you walk into your favorite store, you in all probability feel an urge of excitement and a way of peace multi functional. It smells pleasant, and all the pieces is in it is acceptable place. There is no trash on the ground, nor are there any handprints on the home windows. While you stroll into the restroom of your favorite retail shop, it’s clear, disinfected, stocked with scented soaps, paper towels, and possibly somewhat bit of ornament. Each of those traits combined is exactly what people anticipate when they stroll right into a fashion retailer. Without realizing it, all of these pleasant surroundings are precisely what makes people wish to come back for extra.
However this has not at all times been the case.
Because the identify implies these fashion garments are designed very skinny and transparent, you may look into the beneath put on by way of the outer clothes, translucent garments go away much to the creativeness. But sadly, spring is a little chilly, individuals all the time put on sheer skirts, just translucent tops could not get the anticipated effect and the entire translucent dress probably appears in summer.
Combine doesn’t mean dysfunction. Punchy prints pack more punch when they’re paired with different prominent patterns. You possibly can mix completely different colors up, or adorn the gown with little shivering. Too many colours makes folks vivid coloured, this may be a bit of discursive, so little shivering on your costume will probably be extra standard.
Is it a luxurious version or perhaps a sport watch?
One standard spring pattern is floral patterns. Floral patterns on girls dresses, pants, jackets, blouses, and fitted blouses are positive to be popping up everywhere over the spring and summer. Quite a lot of these floral patterned brief clothes and long clothes appear like one thing out of a late Sixties movie. Assume retro/hippy flower wear and you are talking trends.
Whoever said that tuxedos are only for males must have not seen the arrival of this basic piece within the twentieth century.

I almost didn’t go to Newport a day early despite my opportunity to do so, because I was concerned I’d end up going out to eat, eat dessert, have an extra drink or two, or any combination of the above. Thanks to the support of great friends and my family, I realized that was silly, so I took advantage and even hit up a new-to-me restaurant once I arrived. I was hangry and also hankering for a bourbon cocktail after that drive! No one else in the group really wanted to go out so I visited the bar at Malt by myself, and am so glad I did so. I made friends with both locals and visitors; seriously, sit at the bar alone anywhere and you will never even need a book to keep you occupied.
Bourbon, benedictine, walnut bitters cocktail with fresh Caprese salad and unpictured all the bread.
We had dinner in – BBQ pulled pork! – followed by several magic bars. One of the family members staying at the house was actually a 90+ Cellars fan so that was pretty cool! After going back to Malt for one more drink, I hit the hay.
Friday 7/4
Didn’t sleep very well but a three miler in the rain the next (July 4th) morning, which ended at my fave coffee spot in town The Coffee Grinder, made me feel much better.
Running in the rain may be my new favorite thing.
As did brunch at one of my fave breakfast/lunch spots in Newport, Keenwah Superfood Eatery. My friend Lauren joined me and my BBQ tempeh salad was HEAVEN! I continued to feel better throughout the day thanks to my healthy start.
Not exactly red white and blue pancakes but damn was this good.
And then it was time to drink WINE! I love the Newport Vineyards and the Cunninghams had never been, so we went and enjoyed a tasting and then some. American wine on July 4th – how fitting!
Mr. Cunningham aka GENO and I!
I met up with the fam (FINALLY 😀 I’m obsessed with my family as regular readers know), but our timeshare was not ready. Unfortunately the timeshare facility was very behind on cleaning the rooms because several staff members called out for the 4th. So Hannah, Nana Connie, and I killed time at a bar before dinner. I was so so so happy to see them! We had dinner at Midtown Oyster Bar (no pics but I highly recommend) and I actually ended up heading back there after dinner with Hannah and the Cunningham girls Lauren and Abbey.
Nana C and I – so patriotic, yaaaas?
Hannah, Lauren, Abbey, me. (Sorry Michael, you can’t come with us.)
Saturday 7/5
I had a good time but got tired REAL fast – not fast enough to avoid eating ice cream and many chips when I got home. That left me feeling pretty down on myself when I woke up, even after taking another run. I perked up just in time for lunch though and thankfully Hannah and Nana Connie were up for joining me outside at The Landing for just that. I know that I get a lot of anxiety over going out to eat, but once I get there I ALWAYS feel better because I just love the restaurant experience.
No pants no problem.
Scallops appetizer + sparkling rose, plus unpictured beet salad.
I did some VERY productive shopping after lunch, had some down time by a beach bar listening to music, and then it was time to meet up with my favorite RI blogger Sarah! I suggested we visit Forty 1 North because it was SO KARDASHIAN (judge me if you wish) and I just wanted to be there and feel fabulous.
I always love seeing Sarah and we both marveled at how far we have both come since our last Newport summer heart-to-heart. She ventured outside her comfort zone and ordered a cocktail, and I was already two drinks in prior to meeting up with her and wasn’t having a panic attack over it. Go us!
After catching up the family and I went to dinner at a new spot, Willy’s. I loved the location’s previous restaurant Asterisk, and found out that it was owned by the same people, but the concept had been completely re-done. Now it’s one of those burger bar style places, but Newport actually didn’t have one at all, so it was pretty smart! I knew it was a place the whole family could enjoy.
Dinner was pretty good but the service was a bit off. Willy’s is still a new concept though so I’m sure they’ll find their groove. I just don’t know if it’s at the top of my to-return list, with so many other places in Newport that I just LOVE! We went to our favorite dancing spot, The Deck, to watch the Newport fireworks (a day late thanks to Arthur) and dance it up. The music was slow to start but once it got going my family, the Cunninghams, and I had a blast.
After dancing I hopped into Cold Fusion Gelato and got myself a couple of scoops in a waffle bowl. Because waffle cones or bowls make everything amazing. This wasn’t as good as the prior evening’s Ben & Jerry’s but it hit the spot, along with some more chips.
I once again felt guilty about eating the ice cream and chips, along with the day’s beverages and the french fries I munched on at dinner. But honestly, I gave myself some reality checking and got over it quicker than I had the night before. I made healthy choices at each meal, had been fitting in exercise, and a vacation in Newport without a couple of ice creams is like a crime in itself. I truly enjoyed everything I ate and drank, and that’s okay. I’m allowed to enjoy what I eat on vacation, be it a seafood salad or gelato. Most importantly, what I eat and drink pales in comparison to the importance of spending such great times with family and good friends.
This post took forever to write and my description of the trip isn’t even halfway done so it looks like this will be a two parter blog post. I hope to get the second one up this week! So until next time…

According to Elizabethton Water Services director Jonathan Pleasant, the break took place across 20 feet of the main line feeding into the Milligan area.
Pleasant said the material used in the specific pipes tends to crack with age rather than develop holes, and the pipes can fail at a large scale because of it.
Pleasant said the water line repairs were completed earlier than expected, but Milligan Highway might not be open until later Saturday night.It's not THAT hard to pick out a list of 10. Really, it's not. You just start slotting stories where they oughta go, take a two-hour break, come back, shuffle some stories around, play Freebird on Rock Band 3, get distracted with chores, sob uncontrollably for three days, then come back and try to fit Eastern Michigan in there somewhere.
There's the secret. It still won't stop you from griping about this list, which I'm all in favor of: please, please, tell me where I went wrong with this list of the ten top stories from the Mid-American Conference in 2010. if that sounds like a dare, then you're just an astute person on the Internet, aren't ya?
10: No lead is safe: Rallies by CMU, Kent State in MAC Baseball Tournament semis
You might've missed these games the first time around. In the first semifinal, Central Michigan built a 5-0 lead through five innings, only to have Bowling Green score eight unanswered (including a 5-run eighth) to take an 8-5 lead. CMU would respond in the ninth inning with four runs to win 9-8.
In the other semi, Eastern Michigan was up 8-3 after four innings and 8-5 after eight. But Kent State, never say die, scrapped together three in the ninth to force an extra inning, at which point they walked off with a 9-8 comeback victory of their own. A much less boring championship had Kent State topping CMU 5-2.
Kent State quickly bowed out in the NCAA tournament, losing 15-1 to UCLA and 19-9 to UC Irvine.
9. Where's the upside? Weak NFL Draft for the MAC
Taylor Price, Dan LeFevour, James Starks, Antonio Brown and Jameson Konz were the only five MAC players selected in the 2010 NFL Draft. Ouch. Others, like Frank Zombo and Barry Church, were signed as free agents and got some neato playing time, but usually the MAC's good for a first- or second-round pick.
Unfortunately, there are no projected first-day guys for 2011 either.
8. The favorite son: Trey Zeigler picks CMU over larger schools
Our sadness about MAC basketball at a nadir in competition perked up with coach Ernie Zeigler's blue-chip son Trey chose to play for him in Mount Pleasant. Zeigler could've gone to Michigan, Michigan State, and even UCLA. But he stayed home. Rarely do high-profile players get so much attention, only to go to the MAC. A brutal road schedule and some curious home performances punctured some holes into the helium-filled hype balloon, but even fabulous freshmen need assistance.
7. X's and O's Exodus: Three football coaches hired away by larger schools, a fourth is fired, a fifth resigns
Jerry Kill to Minnesota. Al Golden to Miami. And then Mike "Michael" Haywood to Pittsburgh. This all after Stan Parrish was canned at Ball State and Doug Martin walked away from Kent State. Not to mention three new coaches at CMU, Buffalo, and Akron to start the '10 season. It was enough for us to think that maybe something was wrong with the conference that they couldn't keep any continuity at the head coach position.
In their places: Wisconsin DC Dave Doeren to NIU, Florida OC Steve Addazio to Temple, Ohio State WR coach Darrell Hazell to Kent State, Elon's Pete Lembo to Ball State, and Mr. Vacant to Miami. Time will tell if these were the halcyon days of coaching prodigies, or if a couple dynasties are at the sapling stage of development.
6. What got into that cat? OHIO mascot beats up Brutus Buckeye during the Ohio State game
This is a story about the man who would be Rufus the Bobcat trained all year just so he could get a shot at attacking the Buckeyes mascot. He didn't exactly go to either school, but all he had was a dream. Fueled by rage. Still, you want Charlie Cardinal in your corner.
5. Miami dedicates Frozen Four season to fallen team manager
Right, right, there is no MAC hockey. Try to keep your outrage in a mason jar; this one was worth it.
You could really draw three stories out of this one, but we're going to bundle them together. Brendan Burke, son of Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Brian Burke, was killed in a car accident when their auto collided head-on with another vehicle on a snowy Indiana road.
The story of Burke itself is pretty amazing, as one of the few openly gay men actively working for a sports organization, and how the team was pretty quickly accepting of his lifestyle. Of course, as a top-ranked hockey team, they still likely would've gotten to the Frozen Four with him dead or alive, but to score 10 goals the day after his death? That's gotta elicit some tears. Just some wonderful stories that stemmed from this tragic tale.
4. LeFinale: CMU beats Troy in overtime thriller in the GMAC Bowl
The end of an era in Mount Pleasant was annotated on January 6 when Central Michigan beat the Trojans 44-41 in double-overtime. Yep. And what a finale: it was the last-ever GMAC Bowl, who handed the mighty sponsorship torch to GoDaddy.com. Oh, and Dan LeFevour's final game mumble-mumble four-year starter blah blah MAC records legend dynasty Chuck Ealey fire up Chips.
Look at the FBS records he left behind: the only player to pass for 12,000 and rush for 2,500. He's the only guy to account for 150 career touchdowns. So many MAC records (passing TDs, completions, attempts, starts, hearts broken, fevers induced) were given to us by him.
And then the team basically disbanded. LeFevour was drafted by the Bears, cut, and snagged by the Bengals. Antonio Brown went to Pittsburgh and became their return guy. Butch Jones started coaching at the University of Cincinnati.
3. Proof You Are Stupid, Football Edition: Miami upsets NIU for MAC football crown
A comeback, a turnaround, and a badly batted ball all rolled into one game. Just as soon as they became ranked, No. 23 Northern Illinois was no longer the talk of the conference as Haywood's RedHawks won 26-21 in the MAC Championship Game thanks to a 4th and 20 play which will be replayed in our minds for somewhere between a little while and ferfreakin' ever. Oh, and it didn't hurt that Miami scored early thanks to some crazy mad long rushes and matched the better-on-paper Huskies, yard for yard. It wasn't just one fluke play. It was just a damn good game.
This gave Miami a 9-4 record, one year after finishing a measly 1-11. They still got pulverized by AQ conference teams, but none of that matters; they won the championship, and others didn't.
2. Proof You Are Stupid, Basketball Edition: OHIO basketball beats Georgetown in the first round of the NCAA Tournament
This should not have happened, but it did. OHIO finished 7-9 in the MAC and won the tournament as a No. 9 seed. They went into the big national brackety tournament as a No. 14 seed and just stomped on Georgetown 97-83. I was mostly stunned as Ohio coolly left the bench, shook hands, and went back to the locker room. There was no Cinderella dogpile. No over-jubilant coach fist pump. Just a woodshed beating, like they planned for this.
Postcript: Armon Bassett would declare for the draft early, play in the NBA Summer League, and make a pilgrimage to Israel. And you can still watch D.J. Cooper play in Athens today, although his team has been dropping a few weird games.
1. Zip zip, hooray! Akron beats Louisville 1-0 to win the NCAA soccer championship
Here's where the biggest story is rather inclusive; nobody in the national spectrium really used many gallons of ink or teleprompter lines on this story. But it was huge to us: at long last, a Mid-American Conference team is a national champion at something. That they triumphed over Louisville, led by Akron's former soccer coach, blew a hole in the Bigger School Theory. Caleb Porter built up a better dynasty in Akron, and in return the school signed him through the year 2020.
Received consideration: NIU's football season, Toledo losing the Little Caesars Bowl, rumors of possible addition of UMass to the conference, bar fight involving Boo Jackson and OHIO players, the end of David Kool's career at WMU, Temple beating UConn and not going to a bowl game despite an 8-4 record, Bowling Green reclaiming the women's basketball championship, that Akron-EMU double-overtime game in the MAC basketball quarters, decline of Buffalo football, Kent State's five overall MAC sports titles, formation of Hustle Belt Dot Com, and [your nomination here ______________ ]Newly introduced cold food units and solid top units incorporate a refrigerated base featuring an integrated compressor housing with access panels, along with thermostatic temperature controls.

The last time i attempted a side trip there, i missed the last trip.And so, we agreed to leave very early on sunday from san felipe so we can get back within the same day.
Unfortunately, and the worst level of luck ever, there were no waves. Out of the nearly 2hours that we stayed on the beach, the shores have just been so quiet. We then decided to push mapanuepe for the afternoon.
It was almost 4pm when we arrived in san marcelino market. The last jeep bound for pili has left, and the only jeep available was that bound for macarang - a town that's an hour's walk away from Pili. We thought it will be about 5pm when we get there, so perhaps, we still have time to walk to Pili. We stayed in the terminal and waited for it to leave.
luckily, just 10 mins before it is scheduled to leave, someone standing next to me who overheard that were heading to Pili told me that a jeep that just arrived is bound for Pili. I asked the driver immediately to confirm and he said yes... And we rode it topload.
We were dropped right at the shore of the lake. From there, some native kulot approached us and asked if we'd like to boat around the lake (which we sure are). He was initially asking P500 for a roundabout of the lake, but, as there isn't really anything to see around but just to approach the sunken church, we asked if P100 will do to get us back and forth - agreed.
When we were in the boat, I though we could actually see the remains of the houses down the water. However, the bed is mud and water is dark.. so no scene.
Meantime, when we approached the church, we thought we could actually climb the cross. Little did we know that what we thought be be a staircase was actually stained glass sheets that has broken. The water depth is said to be 85 feet, and with 0 visibility down there, I thought it was risky to do so.
After our assault at the church tower, we went back to the shoreline to scout where we can sleep. We walked towards the brgy hall for courtesy as well but Kap wasn't there then. Our boatman/guide brought us to his house, but neither is he there. A quick moment later, his wife came and had a word. She was OKing sleeping in the brgy but was insisting that we sleep instead in their house. As we each have our hammocks, we asked if there is anywhere in the yard where we can do so - and there was.
it makes me sad that my parents are from zambales and i haven't been to liwliwa and lake mapanuepe. tsss...
tara puntahan natin sila.. lolz
Sana makapunta ako dito minsan. Thanks for the info :-)
Thanks for the visit
Thanks for posting! I miss Pili. :(
i was there then 1984 and its like paradise with all the animeties. The cross that u posted could be there beautiful church.Before and after: lash lift and tint singapore
In Singapore, one effective way to change your look is with a lash lift and tint. After the easy, pain-free, and cheap treatment, your eyes look instantly brighter and more alert. As a result, making you look fresh and awake. Also, your lashes get the sexy curl you’ve always loved! That being so, think of it as curling your eyelashes.
Read on to find out more in our post!
So What is Lash Lift and Tint?
A lash lift and tint treatment consist of two steps; both aimed to give you natural, fluttery eyelashes. The lash lift produces a curler ‘s effect. Thus it makes your lashes curve upward. In this case, it makes your eyes look brighter and alert. Besides that, a lash tint is like a brow tint and makes the eyelashes look longer and thicker.
To further enhance your lash lift and tint, we suggest you to try out Semi-Permanent Mascara (SPM) on top of lash lift and tint. SMP will make your lashes look even darker and fuller. Hence, giving you an incredible, eye-catching look for weeks without the hassle of daily touch-ups.
Over at JPro Beauty, our Keratin lash lift and lash tint products from Australia gives your lashes extra strength and keeps them healthy on top of giving you that dark and sexy curl.
lash lift and tint vs lash extensions
One of the most well-known ways to create fuller lashes is by using eyelash extensions. Using a special non-irritant glue, the lash artist will attach synthetic eyelashes to your natural ones. Normally 80-140 lashes are placed per eye. Depending on how the lashes are placed, your eye shape can alter, and your existing lashes appear longer and thicker. At JPrBeauty, our extensions usually last 3-8 weeks. Although lash extensions may look more dramatic, a lash lift needs much lesser upkeep and lasts several weeks longer, and the treatment itself is faster as well as cheaper. Extensions can also weaken the natural lashes, whereas a lash lift and tint are safe and have no side effects.

before and after lash lift and tint in singapore
Your natural eye shape, length, and thickness will decide how dramatic your eyelashes are after lash lift and tint. If your lashes are almost lying flat or even pointing down, you’ll see a major difference after lash lift and tint. Most women see their eyes becoming more radiant and younger-looking after their lash lift and tint. Besides this, your eyelashes appear much longer, fuller and perfectly shaped.
how does lash lift and tint works?
The keratin lash lift works to raise the lash from base to tip, like a mascara brush, so you can see its entire length. But instead of a brush, a silicone rod covered in a keratin formula will achieve this effect. Just as keratin is the basis to healthy hair, likewise this protein strengthens and also protect your lashes. Your eyes are closed in the entire process, which includes placing the lashes on the silicone rods, curling them upwards, then covering the strands with the keratin formula. Therefore this service takes about 45 minutes to an hour, which is so much faster than eyelash extensions.
Also worth noting, the larger the rod size, the softer the cur makes a difference depending on the desired style and the amount of curl you prefer.

In the first 24 hours, avoid water, visiting the steam room, eye make-up, and make-up remover. In general as with any lash procedure, water and dampness can easily affect the result.
After 24 hours, you should treat your lashes as normal – no need to change your make-up routine or stop washing your face.Bookshelves don’t have to be boring! By just changing up the front trim (called the “face frame”) you can give your storage piece a completely different look!
Yes, this is just a simple bookshelf, with a chunkier face frame! It gives this piece a modern but crisp look – so mountain modern!
Why I Built this Bookshelf
I built this piece for our cabin in the mountains, where I’m craving a simplified life, with less things to pick up, less details to dust and wipe down, but still looking to be inspired and encouraged by the surroundings. I needed the storage for shoes, hats, gloves, sunglasses – entryway dropzone stuff – but wanted a piece that could also look good empty. I do love an empty shelf. It’s an opportunity to put something away.
Can I Build a Custom Size?
For my bookshelf, I built a custom size to fit in the space perfectly. If you are building it, you might as well get the right size, tailored for your space.
I love this plan because it is very easy to customize the size in both height and width! You can build just about any size you can think up!
The tutorial below will show you how to size yours just right for your space without doing any crazy math or worrying about making mistakes.
Video Tutorial of Building this Bookshelf
I put together a quick video showing the steps to build this bookshelf. Please watch before you build.

Mountain Modern Bookshelf Plans
Here are the plans for this bookshelf. I decided to do this one more as a template (so you can customize the sizes) – since getting the perfect fit is so important. It will be easy to come up with a cut list and shopping list once you have your carcass laid out.

I don't think I've made pesto since college, but I was inspired by the presence of so much bittercress in the yard. I collected about 2 cups (packed) and a handful of the field-garlic-chive things and blended them with 1/2 cup toasted pine nuts, some pepper and a little garlic, 1/2 c. olive oil and some parmesan cheese. That made enough for 4 meals; 3 portions are now frozen for times when we need the fresh spring taste of the bittercress again.
It was terrific.
Wow! It's beautiful! I'd like a piece of this cake!

A Massachusetts elder law attorney recently posed an issue on an elder law listserv. He was hired to file a MassHealth application. He was hired by the appointed agent (or attorney-in-fact) in a durable power of attorney drafted by another lawyer, and the other lawyer was telling him that t the agent could not hire a lawyer that the elder had never met. Since the elder is now marginally competent at best, what the drafting lawyer was essentially stating was that he is the only lawyer who can no represent the agent who stands in the shoes of the elder through the durable power of attorney.
My opinion is that the drafting lawyer is simply wrong. The elder signed a durable power of attorney so that the agent could handle future financial affairs for the elder. Under principal-agency law, whenever the agent is hiring anybody to help with the elder’s financial affairs, the person who is hired is not being hired to represent the agent, but rather is being hired to represent the elder. One major reason the elder executed the durable power of attorney was to avoid the need for conservatorship proceedings in Probate Court. Nowhere in the Massachusetts Uniform Probate Code, which established both the new durable power of attorney laws and the new conservatorship laws in 2009, is there any restriction on who can be hired by an agent under a durable power of attorney or by conservator.
Under the drafting lawyer’s claims that the agent cannot hire a new lawyer now that the elder is perhaps incompetent, the elder would effectively be denied the right to hire, through the agent, a lawyer who practices in a more special area of law than that of the drafting lawyer and conservatorship proceedings would then be necessary for many elders, contrary to their intentions.
I have found no case that upholds the drafting lawyer’s statements, and cannot help but conclude that his claims were a shamelessly self-serving attempt to force the agent to hire him exclusively.
I would tend to agree. I think the drafting attorney is mixing up two different concepts. As a matter of agency law, unless limited by the document, an agent or attorney-in-fact can hire people to provide necessary assistance, whether in the legal, accounting or any other field. By contrast, under professional conduct rules, an attorney at law cannot hire a lawyer outside the firm to provide legal services for the client without the client’s knowledge and consent. Here, the first principle would apply, unless the attorney in fact is also an attorney at law, and even then it would be a close call to balance the agent’s two responsibilities.
Brian,
You would seem to be right. Perhaps the drafting attorney was considering issues of whether a principal —who may have had a fiduciary role— could delegate certain duties to others, perhaps by means of Power of Attorney. I do not see the issue at all when the principal is an individual and has given his attorney in fact broad powers.Lightning kills 76 in India, including selfie-takers near famous fort
Members of State Disaster Response Force conduct a search operation near the watchtowers of the Amer Fort on the outskirts of Jaipur on July 12, 2021, after 11 people were killed in lightning strikes at the fort. AFP
NEW DELHI — Several people reportedly taking selfies near a historical fort in northern India were among nearly 80 killed by lightning strikes during the early stages of the annual monsoon season, officials said Monday.
Deadly lightning strikes are common in the vast Asian nation during the June-September deluge, which bring respite from the summer heat across the northern Indian plains.
Of the 76 killed, at least 23 people died in the mostly desert state of Rajasthan, including a dozen who were watching the storm cross Jaipur city from watch towers near the famous 12th-century Amer Fort late Sunday, a state disaster department official told AFP.
“It was already raining when the people were there. They huddled in the towers as the rainfall intensified,” a senior Jaipur police officer, Saurabh Tiwari, added.
He said up to 30 people were on the towers when the lightning struck. Emergency teams were checking if any victims had fallen into a deep moat on one side of the towers.
“Some of the injured were left unconscious by the strikes. Others ran out in panic and extreme pain,” he added.
Officials told local media some of those killed were taking selfies during the storm.
Every year, tens of thousands of tourists visit the Amer Fort, a medieval complex on a hilltop outside Jaipur also known as the Amber Fort.
People had been flocking to the fort, which gives a panoramic view of the tourist city of Jaipur, after several weeks of intense heat in the state.
In the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh, at least 42 people were killed in lightning strikes on Saturday and Sunday, officials said. They did not give further details about where they had been killed.
Another 11 people died in the central state of Madhya Pradesh over the weekend, an official at the state’s disaster control room told AFP.
Two of them, who had taken their camels and sheep for grazing, were sheltering under a tree when they were hit by lightning, the official said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the victims’ families would be offered compensation.
Last month, 27 people were killed and four passengers on a flight were hospitalized after severe turbulence during monsoon storms the eastern state of West Bengal.
Nearly 2,900 people were killed by lightning in India in 2019, according to the National Crime Records Bureau — the most recent figures available.
The monsoon is crucial to replenishing water supplies in South Asia, but also causes widespread death and destruction across the region each year.

Radiation levels normal around Taiwan: AEC
CNA
TAIPEI–Levels of radiation recorded around Taiwan did not show any abnormalities yesterday, the Atomic Energy Council (AEC) reported on its website.
Radiation levels recorded by 30 monitoring stations installed in various parts of the country remained at a normal 0.2 microsieverts per hour, the Cabinet level council said.
The report came amid an ongoing nuclear crisis in Japan. Three active reactors at a Japanese nuclear power plant were severely damaged by a magnitude-9.0 earthquake and tsunami on March 11. The troubled reactors have been emitting large amounts of radiation into the atmosphere, causing global concern about radioactive contamination.
Local meteorologists said on Wednesday radioactive fallout from Japan was not expected to hit Taiwan in the coming days because of prevailing weather patterns.Instagram could soon allow you to choose what you want to see on your feed

Here are all the important tips to buy CBD online for sleep. Whether it is your first or umpteenth time, this guide will give you insights on how to make the most of your online purchase. As a bonus, Cannabis Reports has surveyed the market and picked top CBD for sleep products that you can buy online.
Let’s get started.
As much as you can easily buy CBD online, not all CBD products are created equal. The market is highly unregulated and consequently, you will find some unscrupulous dealers who cut corners just to make a quick buck.
One survey found that several CBD products did not contain the amount of CBD that was claimed on the label. Additionally, some of these products contained contaminants that had not been indicted on the product labels.
So when looking for the most ideal CBD product to help you sleep at night, here are a few questions that should be at the back of your mind.
- Can I trust the seller?
- How much CBD is in this product versus how much CBD do I need to put me to sleep?
- Is this CBD product of high-quality?
- What extra sleep-promoting ingredients are included in the recipe?
- Extra benefits such as being all-natural, organic, vegan free
- Is the price competitive?
With these in mind, here is a five-step process to determine whether the CBD products that you have seen online is the best there is.
Step 1: Credibility of the CBD seller
Before buying the product you must always buy the seller first. Go to the “About Us page” and scrutinize the claims made about the business.
Look at how long they have been in the market, what other customers are saying about them, mission and if they are abiding by it, the expertise of the team, and any other thing that stands out be it good or bad. Be objective about your analysis and even compare different CBD brands. If you are getting positive vibes about this company, proceed to step two.
Step 2: What is the quality of their CBD?
This is the next important step. Since you are going to ingest the CBD as a medicine or supplement you want to be sure that it meets the threshold for pharmaceutical-grade products. Right from where the hemp or cannabis was cultivated, was it cultivated in the US, UK, or any other country?
Consider the cultivation practices, are they organic and chemical-free. If you are in doubt of this, the third-party analysis mentioned below will come in handy. Lastly consider how the CBD was extracted. Supercritical carbon dioxide filtration is always a winner.
Step 3: What is the formula of their CBD for sleep?
If you are comfortable with the quality of the CBD the next thing you should consider is the formula. Cannabidiol, in and of itself, has sleep-promoting properties. But how do you make the most of these properties?
The CBD can be combined with sleep-promoting terpenes in a full-spectrum extract. Myrcene, the terpene with an earthy scent, is a known sedative. Limonene, on the other hand, may help to reduce symptoms of insomnia.
Other than terpenes, melatonin is another sleep-promoting ingredient that will boost the effects of CBD. Our body naturally produces melatonin which is a sleep hormone. When one is suffering from sleeping difficulties they may be lacking sufficient amounts of melatonin.
Step 4: Third-party testing
You may be confident about the quality of the CBD that you are about to purchase, but don’t ignore scrutinizing the third-party certificates of analysis (COA).
First, scan the website to see if you can find the particular COA for the product that you want to purchase. Examine the reliability of the lab that has analyzed the product. Then look at the amount of CBD stated; it should match the product label. Look at the other cannabinoids and terpenes. Lastly, look at the list of contaminants to make sure that there are none.
Step 5: How to consume CBD for sleep
This one is for your ease of use and pleasure. CBD for sleep may come in the form of:
- Tinctures to be taken sublingually. This is easy to use and acts fast. Expect to start feeling the effects in 15-30 minutes.
- CBD capsules and gummies. These are swallowed and may take between 1-2 hours before you start to feel the effects. They are easy to incorporate into a daily routine.
- CBD vapes. This is a bit harder to use and will require a vape kit plus cartridges. However, the effects are felt almost immediately.
- CBD nanospray. This is a novel approach that uses nano-encapsulation techniques to ensure that bioavailability and speed of action are enhanced. A little CBD that has been nano-encapsulated will go a long way.
Choose a CBD product that is easy to fit into your routine.

How Does CBD for Sleep Work?
CBD is one of the numerous phytocannabinoids that are found in cannabis. CBD works through various mechanisms to support and promote the functions of the endocannabinoid system (ECS). Through its interaction with the ECS, it can produce the following effects:
- Reduce anxiety
- Promote relaxation
- Relieve pain and inflammation
- Regulate sleep patterns
How Much CBD should I take For Sleep?
Most high-quality CBD products will indicate the starting dose on the label. Generally, you should start with 1-6 mg of CBD for every 10 lbs of body weight. You can titrate the CBD as you observe how your body is responding to it over time.
Where to Buy CBD for Sleep Products Online

Cannabis Reports does regular insightful reviews on CBD brands, keep checking here for helpful information.
You can also search on top CBD review sites for leads and recommendations. Amazon and YouTube may also guide you on which products to consider. Lastly, consider marijuana dispensaries in your vicinity that may be stocking high-quality CBD for sleep products.

Naturally, he was peppered with a number of questions surrounding the league, but the investigation into the Washington Football Team’s workplace took top billing. That questioning came as former employees hand-delivered a letter to the five owners on the NFL‘s Social Justice Working Group in an attempt to make the findings of the league’s investigation into the team public. The letter was signed by 12 former employees and said, in part, that the NFL should not “sweep the results of the investigation under the rug.”
Of course, over a year ago, 15 former team employees alleged sexual harassment in the organization and led to a full investigation by the league, which resulted in the Washington Football Team being fined $10 million for its “highly unprofessional” environment. Meanwhile, Daniel Snyder stepped down from running the day-to-day operations of the team.
While the league did conduct an investigation, only a summary was released instead of a full-scale report, which was done for various other NFL investigations (ex. Deflategate).
“We are calling on you to demand that the NFL make the findings public,” the letter reads. “We are calling you to do the right thing.”
The reason why the investigation was not unveiled in a more in-depth way other than a summary, according to Goodell, is because some Washington Football Team employees were guaranteed anonymity in cooperating with the Wilkinson investigation, and protecting that anonymity is why the report won’t go public.
When asked if Snyder had been held accountable for the findings of the investigation, Goodell said, “I do think he’s been held accountable. I think the organization has been held accountable. I think we gave an unprecedented fine. Dan Snyder has not been involved with the organization for now almost four months. We are obviously focused more on making sure that policies — some that they put into place prior to this investigation — coming out of it were put into place and that they will be maintained and that we can ensure that that will happen in this organization.”
The NFL has said it looks forward to communicating with the U.S. House of Representatives Oversight Committee after it requested the league to turn over documents and findings related to the investigation.-

- RE: How do I change my name on my vehicle registration in PA?
CHANGE NAME ON VEHICLE/TRAILER REGISTRATION AND TITLE If your name has changed due to marriage, divorce or another reason, you will need to complete form MV-41A. Side A of the form should be completed if you are only requesting an updated vehicle/trailer registration card.
Similarly, do you have to take a new picture when you change your name on your license? Updating your drivers license with a new name must be done in person. Most states consider this change a part of the license renewal process, so you will need to take a new photograph, as well as pay the renewal fee. A certified copy of your marriage license (which, again, you will most likely get back).
Consequently, how do I change my address on my vehicle registration in PA?
To change your address for your vehicles registration, you will need: A completed Change of Address Form. Your vehicle title number.
If Youre Moving Within Pennsylvania
- Fill out a Pennsylvania DMV change of address form online.
- Go to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
- Fill out a form by mail.
How much does it cost to change name on car registration?
There is no fee to change your name on your registration documents and title certificate. Forms: Vehicle Registration/Title Application (MV-82).

An interosseous membrane is a thick dense fibrous sheet of connective tissue that spans the space between two bones forming a type of syndesmosis joint. Interosseous membranes in the human body: Interosseous membrane of forearm.
Also, what muscles attach to the interosseous membrane?.
In respect to this, is the interosseous membrane a ligament?

Not all crimes are created equal. Even within certain classification levels (i.e. Class A, Class B, etc.) there are crimes which burn off the page of a criminal record. While it is wise to fight to keep just about any offense off your record, none are more important than those considered “crimes of moral turpitude.” What is a crime of moral turpitude?
Like many things in the law it is a fancy phrase without a simple definition. Some quick legal research makes this point evident. The Houston Court of Appeals, in a case titled In the Matter of G.M.P., gives us no less than six definitions:
-.
In latin, we would refer to a crime of moral turpitude as malum in se which means “wrong in itself” – a collection of crimes which are traditional and not just created by statute, which are malum prohibitum.
There is not bright line dividing crimes of moral turpitude from the rest. Certainly, under any definition would fall crimes like Theft, Burglary, Assault, Rape, Murder and variations of those crimes. Because the definition of a crime of moral turpitude depends on the subjective opinions of society, the category can broaden based on the type of individual analyzing a criminal record. One good example would be the crime of Driving While Intoxicated. While most people would consider this a serious public safety and traffic related offense, there are a good amount of people who would characterize DWI as a crime of moral turpitude.
The more likely it is for an offense to be considered a crime of moral turpitude, the more important it becomes to protect your criminal record. In Texas there are a variety of ways to avoid the mark of shame which comes with a criminal conviction, but not all are created equal. If your concern is a criminal record, hire an attorney who can explain the implications of each step in the criminal process and, when push comes to shove, leave it all out on the courtroom floor to protect a criminal record.Except I continued to take Hgl readings every hour. At 11, diabetes doc called as planned, and we adjusted the morning dose upward and the evening dose downward. It is great to not have to carry insulin pens anymore, and not have to shoot up before meals, especially meals in public.
Lunch was at Togo's. I looked up the nut rition values, and it was something like 1100 calories for a #9 and clam chowder. Balanced that out with a diet cola.
After work first stop was Petco, bought 50# box of A&H clumping odor-fighting litter. 50# is heavy.
Next, to UPS, picked up the Kindle Fire and refused the Google Nexus. Traffic was horrible on El Camino, 1.5 miles took 15 minutes.
Then back to the Safeway next to Petco, because they are bigger than the one nearer home and I had some stuff on my list which the smaller store may not carry.
Got everything on my list, technically, but they did not have the big bottles of glucose tablets, only the 10-tablet pocket sized tubes. And those were behind the pharmacy window, go figure.
One of the items on my list was munchies for the trip, and since it was close to the entrance I checked out the gluten-free section and picked up a few munchie items which looked like they may be edible. Also got some bananas, wheat thins, cheese-its. They had two kinds of Dramamine, I got one of each. Also got some Tylenol to keep in the car, and upped my sunscreen to SPF 50 waterproof. Final thing was a 6-pack of diet Coke plastic bottles (because they have screw-on caps and are safer in the car than cans, and don't go flat as fast.)
Next stop: Rite Aid for a big bottle of glucose tablets, a neoprene sleeve for my knee, and a couple of dark chocolate PeterPaul mounds, which were half price.
Home by way of World Oil, which has similar prices to Costco without the 20-minute wait. Even though I had not filled up since returning from Atascadero, there was still 1/4 tank left.
One of the week's exercises was looking on Google Maps for ways to take I-5 instead of 101. I-5 is freeway all the way, 101 is not, especially going through and a bit past Salinas. There is one point where construction has moved the road so much my GPS thinks I'm lost. But it turns out that it takes more than an hour to get to and from I-5, so it adds about an hour to the trip, and in return I would be in hotter weather with not a lot of scenery.
So it's 101.
After I file this, I'll get on the map, maybe AAA's map, and look for places to stop along the way, because I have 6 hours to make a 3-hour trip.
Plans for tomorrow:
Drive. Vacate. Arrive at Travelodge Morro Bay after 3 pm.School Challenge

Appleton, WI 54915Ind.While the regulatory authority mandates use of verification, inference, and aggregation, it points out that trading partners need to ensure the quality of medicines exported, protect the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain integrity. The transaction information needs to be secure and interoperable in an electronic manner. Use of security features on shipping units like homogeneous cases or 160 pallets of product will help indicate when products could be tampered, or previously unsealed, or damaged, rendering it suspect. It supports use of anti-counterfeiting technologies like physical-chemical identifiers (PCIDs) in solid oral dosage forms. With US being a major market for India’s generic drugs, Swati Babel, CEO, PrimaDollar India, a leading supply chain financing platform, stated, “Our pharma industry has been using serialization software for a long time. The recent US FDA recommendation suggests that drug supply chain must exchange information about drugs and its handing details to the US which would synchronize the process to enable transparency and create a robust supply chain.”Babel pointed out that exports consignments must have 2D barcodes which is done through serialization software after which goods are bought and sold, encoded with product identifiers to allow precise tracking and reporting. Although the supply chain process becomes a long-drawn one, yet we see that it enhances drug distribution security and helps to identify suspected products, said Babel.According to Debasish M Banerjee, director, Creative Solutions, a one-stop pharma product design solutions provider for international markets, lack of harmonized regulations between the DGFT and importing countries can lead to confusion about export product labeling. Potential issues can be duplicate GTIN on packaging levels leading to risk of incorrect receiving or picking of product from barcode to scan which would lead to stoppage of products in the supply chain due to master data discrepancies. Further, use of SSCC & SGTIN can lead to incorrect receiving or picking of product because of aggregation data risk that exist having 2 serial numbers on the same unit of packaging. Non-conformance with HDA barcode guidelines can decrease the efficiency of the supply chain resulting in increased cost, product delays & potential shortages, he noted.Indian pharma can meet the deadlines that are fast approaching for enhanced drug distribution regulations, to protect data, from falsification, malicious attacks, and breaches. The DGFT should harmonize its implementation with that of the US DSCSA and the European Union’s Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD). A solution should be designed from the bottom up: line level to the cloud, without retrofitting of regulations to a commercialized solution that carries the risk of undetected errors. Those supplying to the US should consolidate their site and production-line reporting, obtain exemption from Pharmexcil for correct DAVA portal reporting, and set up master data sets, including GTIN, said Banerjee.The Witcher Showrunner Vows To Deliver A Very Mature TV Series
He’s conquered the Northern Kingdoms and slaughtered just about every beast and foul creature under the sun, but it seems Geralt of Rivia is now headed for television.
Netflix and showrunner Lauren S. Hissrich have officially committed to a full-fledged TV adaptation of The Witcher, with Henry Cavill, star of Mission: Impossible and Justice League, on board to play the glowering Geralt. There’s been nary a mention of an official launch date for Netflix’s latest original series, though over on Twitter, Hissrich posted a brief status report, revealing that a rough cut of The Witcher now exists, and it’s seemingly very, very faithful to the adult content that the series is known for – both across literature and video games.
Via Twitter:
Just watched a cut of #Witcher with Ben, and the verdict is in: this show is not for 5-year-olds. Like, really not.
That’s reassuring, then, though not at all surprising given the involvement of Andrzej Sapkowski, the Polish mastermind behind the original Witcher novel series. Developer CD Projekt Red later introduced Sapkowski’s work into the world of video games, and have since placed the iconic franchise on ice to focus on the long-gestating sci-fi title, Cyberpunk 2077.
That opens up a window of opportunity for Netflix and Co., and it seems the Powers That Be are ready to strike while the iron is hot, with Cavill training intensively for what is undoubtedly a meaty, nuanced role. Netflix has already peeled back the curtain to reveal our first look at Cavill’s Geralt, though it’s fair to say that many were left unimpressed by his silvery wig and pure, beardless face. And after mustache-gate threatened to engulf Justice League?! Oh, the humanity.
The Witcher TV series is yet to nail down an official release window, but we’ll let you know if and when that situation changes.Medical breast images obtained by different types of exam provide a high degree of relevant information to the specialist performing the analysis (Borchartt, 2013). Technological advances in areas such as computer science, computer graphics and engineering have enabled Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems to be developed. Their function is to process images by using predefined algorithms in order to provide medical specialists with information that will speed up and/ or improve diagnosis (Cotrim, Silva, & Bezerra, 2007).
CAD systems are considered important tools which assist the medical diagnosis of breast cancer. The intention behind using them is to improve the consistency of the interpretation of the images by considering how the CAD responds to them. This answer, which may be useful when diagnosing a disease is partly based on the subjectivity of a visual analysis. Thus, double reading - by an expert physician and a computer - can significantly improve the efficiency of diagnosis (Furuie, Gutierrez, Bertozzo, & Yamagutti, 1999 as cited in Cotrim et al., 2007).
Due to the limitations of the human visual system and of physicians’ experience of interpreting thermographic images, some CAD systems are being developed to improve the detection of breast abnormalities. These systems can also be used to investigate the viability of using the thermography technique as a screening exam. In other words, temperature values can be used both to analyze normal patients (without any breast abnormality) and patients who have a malignant tumor, a benign tumor or a cyst.
Typically, CAD systems are associated with graphical interfaces to facilitate how users interpret the results. One of the main advantages of creating a graphical user interface (GUI) is to make the program developed accessible to medical practitioners who do not understand programming language (Kapoor, Prasad, & Patni, 2012). By incorporating CAD systems, these human-computer interfaces may have great potential for diagnosing breast abnormalities that thermograms have identified.
Motivated by the need for a screening tool that can aid the diagnosis of breast cancer, a graphical interface was developed that lets the researcher or the mastologist evaluate a breast abnormality easily and quickly when thermographic images are used.
The results obtained came from the CAD systems, developed by Araujo (2014) and Dourado Neto (2014), based on thermographic images of the database of the system. The images used for this study were of the frontal type in which the patients were positioned with their hands raised and supported by the wooden bar of the mechanical apparatus. The tests were performed with a computer which uses the Windows 10 operating system, Intel Core i3 - 3217U (1.80 GHz), 4 GB of RAM and 64-bit Operating System.Claudia was Senior Compensation Manager at Johnson & Johnson, and Compensation & HR Projects Manager at Citigroup.Claudia Greninger is currently Executive Vice President, Human Resources at Medifast - View - Medifast org chart

From the post:
“Earlier this month, in a piece for Dezeen, Sam Jacob offered a thoughtful and provocative take on the NSA’s Prism program of internet surveillance. In an argument reminiscent of Evgeny Morozov’s critique of solutionism, though from an architect’s perspective, Jacob portrays Prism as a manifestation of the idea that society is a logical system that can be engineered to function in an optimally efficient manner or to otherwise fulfill a set of explicit specifications. Society is, in other words, a design project…”

I often put aside writings or paintings for at least a month or more after finishing them, before editing them or making the final touches. When I come back to the work, I have enough perspective to edit words severely, add an extra line of paint, or eliminate a too busy portion. Sometimes I just note what I liked and what I didn’t like about the piece, tuck the piece away, and use that information to inform future work. Then, I move on. I figure that good work will emerge about 1 out of 10 times, if I’m lucky that day. This doesn’t bother me. My artwork is done for my own entertainment, catharsis, and meditation. The final product is merely a by-product of the process. But occasionally, when I look back, there is a lovely sensation of satisfaction of having done something well.Tuesday April 1st, 2014 – Gurnee, IL
The first quarter of 2014 is now history, and I have no idea where it went. I put in a lot of work on a lot of things, and it went by a lot faster than I expected. It was productive, but I never think I do enough so there’s still some disappointment. I did pull off the benefit show for Sheri Johnson, so that was satisfying. I also reconnected with my siblings, and I’ve waited for that for decades.
Another positive was getting my monthly newsletter restarted. We’ve sent out three editions so far, and each one continues to improve. That’s a big deal, and I don’t intend to let up. I also had a varied array of fun shows, and that always makes me feel good. It’s been a positive three months. I haven’t slacked off, and every day I try to accomplish at least a little. Progress is being made.
Still, I’m nowhere near satisfied with any of it. Surviving is one thing, but I want to kick things into high gear and live life on all cylinders. I’ve had a few flashes, and it feels great. It’s time for me to get my payoff for all the years of struggle, and I need to buckle down and try even harder.
I am sold beyond sold on the Uranus concept, and that’s going to be my main point of focus for at least the next six months. I still have to survive like I always have, but I’m going to set aside a chunk of time each morning to work on all things Uranus. I’ve started and stopped and started all over, but that’s just not good enough. I’ve achieved a few results, but nowhere near what I want.
It’s now or never, and the clock is ticking for us all. My biggest regret in a lifetime packed full of them would be to go to my grave with this idea still in me. I realize it might well be a flaming failure, but that’s never been the issue. Not giving it my best effort would be the worst scenario.
I don’t care who thinks it’s a stupid idea. I like it, and that’s all that matters. I feel it in my soul, and I know exactly what I want to do with it. The King of Uranus is the ring master of a circus of talented people just like George Clinton is the ring master of Parliament/Funkadelic. He oversees everything, and decides what projects get done and who is involved. I will take on the same role.
I want to fan the flames of talent, and encourage people to stretch their boundaries to achieve a result they never thought they could. I’m a great mentor if nothing else, but I think I also have an eye and ear for knowing who can do what and matching them with people that complement them well. My role is that of maestro, and it’s a lot more than just being an idiot in a goofy costume.
That costume will eventually be a trademark, but for now I want to build the gimmick from the ground up, and get myself established with a chunk of the public. It will be a much bigger chunk than I’d ever be able to attain as plain old me, and if that’s what it takes I’ll play along with it.
I had lunch with comedian Dan Morris today, and he’s a very sharp cookie. He is a published author, and I asked him what I’d need to do to create a proposal like an author would. He said he would help me, but I have to get something on paper first. That’s my next order of business to do much sooner than later, and I’ll go from there.

What is Public Indecency?
Public indecency, Ohio’s term for indecent exposure, includes various types of lewd behavior, public sexual conduct, masturbating in public, or engaging in sexual activity or publicly exposing your private parts in a manner that suggests sexual conduct, sexual arousal, or gratification.
Public indecency can occur three ways in Ohio:
- Exposing private parts or sexual organs
- Engaging in sexual conduct or masturbation (masturbation does not require nudity)
- Engaging in an activity that looks/ appears to be sexual in nature.
Public urination or defecation is considered disorderly conduct (a minor misdemeanor) and not public indecency in the State of Ohio.
If you conduct public indecency in the presence of minors, you may be charged with felony aggravated indecent exposure. If you have prior convictions for sex crimes in Ohio, you may be charged with aggravated public indecency. If convicted, you may be required to register as a sex offender for at least ten years.
Acting Knowingly vs. Acting Recklessly
Ohio’s public indecency law divides sexual acts into two categories of mental states: acts done recklessly and acts done knowingly. Engaging in any of these behaviors can lead to public indecency charges. However, prosecutors will only be successful in bringing charges if they can prove that your actions were reckless, and were witnessed by others, or likely to be witnessed by others.
- ORC 2901.22 defines recklessly as doing something without caring about the consequences. In this scenario, a person understands that certain risks are attached to carrying out a specific act, yet disregards those risks and continues to engage in the conduct.
- ORC 2901.22 defines acting knowingly when someone is aware that their actions will cause a specific result.
Generally, acts done knowingly carry greater consequences than those done recklessly. Prosecutors may have a difficult time arguing you acted knowingly, especially if you bring a strong defense.
Is the City of Columbus or State of Ohio Prosecuting Your Public Indecency Case?
If you’re arrested for Public Indecency in Columbus, you may be charged under Columbus City Code 2307.09 – Public Indecency, or Ohio Revised Code (ORC) Section 2907.09. The statutes are very similar. If you are charged under the Ohio code, the charge will come from the state of Ohio and state prosecutor. If you are charged under the Columbus code, the charge will come from the City of Columbus and the City Prosecutor.
Koenig & Owen, LLC, has a history of handling criminal defense cases in Ohio for more than 25 years. We have a proven record of successful outcomes in public indecency cases involving both city and state prosecutions.
What Makes Public Exposure A Felony In The State Of Ohio?
ORC 2907.09 can be charged as a felony or a misdemeanor, depending on the unique circumstances, and specifically whether a minor was involved and whether you had previous convictions.
Exposure is considered “public” if it is within view of someone who is not an adult member of your household and/or a minor.
Sorting through these circumstances to determine charges and penalties can be complicated.
Exposing Your Private Parts
- First Offense: Fourth Degree Misdemeanor
- Second Offense: Third Degree Misdemeanor
- Third Offense: Second Degree Misdemeanor.
Exposing Your Private Parts to a Minor
- First Offense: Second Degree Misdemeanor
- Second Offense: First Degree Misdemeanor.
Another way to think of this: the class of charge increases if the person who witnessed the conduct was a minor. So, a fourth-degree charge becomes a second-degree, and a third-degree becomes a first-degree.
Engaging In Sexual Conduct, Masturbation, Or What Appears As Such
- First Offense: Third Degree Misdemeanor
- Second Offense: Second Degree Misdemeanor.
Engaging In Sexual Conduct, Masturbation, Or What Appears As Such In Front of A Minor
- First Violation: First Degree Misdemeanor
- Second or Subsequent Violation: Fifth Degree Felony.
If you were a minor (or your child was a minor) and is charged with public indecency, and the victim was a minor, the law makes no allowances for behavior between minors. Contacting a criminal defense attorney in Columbus as soon as possible following an arrest will give you the best possible chance.
Penalties and Fines for Public Indecency in Ohio
Ohio categorizes misdemeanors into five separate classes: First Degree, Second Degree, Third Degree, and Fourth Degree, as well as minor misdemeanors. The most serious misdemeanor charge is a First Degree misdemeanor, while a minor misdemeanor is the least serious. Penalties for public indecency, ranging from least serious to most serious, include:
- Fourth Degree misdemeanor: A fine of up to up $250, and jail time of up to 30 days
- Third Degree misdemeanor: A fine of up to up to$500, and up to 60 days in jail
- Second Degree misdemeanor: A fine of up to up to $750, and up to 90 days in jail
- First Degree misdemeanor: A fine of up to up to $1,000, and up to 180 days in jail
- Fifth Degree felony: A fine of up to $2,500, and between 6-12 months in prison.
Depending on the circumstances, a person convicted of could be required to register as a tier I sex offender/child-victim offender for a minimum of 10 years. This will be up to the discretion of the court. If you are facing any of these charges, call us at Koenig & Owen, LLC as soon as possible.

When we walk into a courtroom to defend you, every argument has been considered, and every issue has been researched. We give every legal matter the attention it deserves. A successful defense will put both you and your case in the best possible light, and may include highlighting:
- Lack of prior criminal history/record
- Records of good grades and achievements
- Polygraph evidence
- Evidence that shows the alleged victim previously made false allegations.

Defenses to Indecent Exposure in Ohio
Public indecency charges are subject to interpretation by a judge and are not black and white. Charges will depend on where the incident occurred, who was there, your prior criminal record. Potential defenses could include:
- You never exposed your private parts
- You thought you were in a private place
- You did not intend for your actions to be interpreted as sexual.
Mistake, intoxication, and misunderstandings are generally not defenses to indecent exposure charges in Ohio. However, prosecutors will likely not bring charges if you clearly lacked the intent, and no one was offended by your actions.
Many avenues exist for a successful public indecency defense, and your case likely will not go to trial. You have a good opportunity to get charges reduced or dropped if you take immediate action and contact a lawyer right away. If we have any argument that the state’s case is weak, we will ask the judge to dismiss the charges.

Recent CommentsOne interesting thing about "Album Shuffle" is that, if you have more than one album by the same title, the iPod sort of thinks that it's all the same album (even if it is clearly able to differentiate separate artists). Luckily, this doesn't happen so much (ever, so far) with albums where it's really important to listen to all the tracks in a row (hence the reason for Album Shuffle in the first place, ostensibly), but more with compilation-style albums that have titles like "Greatest Hits" or "The Definitive Collection" or "Gold [Disc 2]" or whatever. I'm trying to think right now, and the only non-compilations in my collection that I can immediately call to mind are Jesse Irwin's and Nazareth's Hair Of The Dog.
SO in the current playlist, I have the Greatest Hits albums of Del Shannon, Pat Benatar, Ricky Nelson, and The Band--all called, simply, "Greatest Hits"--so whenever I hear the opening strains of "Runaway" I know that I'm in for a sort of collated version of these four compilations. Each album's first track will play in succession, in what I believe is alphabetical order by artist name (The Band being categorized as a "T" rather than a "B," and all solo artists being ordered by first name rather than last), then each album's second track, and so on.
At first only Del and Pat were in the playlist, but then I tossed in Ricky Nelson and later still The Band, not realizing that they'd be thrown into the "Greatest Hits" mix (so when I first heard Ricky Nelson follow Pat Benatar, rather than it going back to Del Shannon, I was a little surprised). I wonder for what other artists in my collection I have an album entitled simply "Greatest Hits."Published: | Updated:

It must be practised constantly in order to be honed to perfection but unlike many other skills, the learning curve never ends. In fact, gardening requires constant learning and re-learning of old techniques now forgotten and new techniques learnt yesterday. The mark of a good gardener is the ability to grow and protect all living things, not just the trees.If you are a city slicker by birth and haven’t rooted around in the dirt a lot, here are some ways you can be a gardener:
Jump In and Join
There’s nothing like actually jumping in and figuring things out from there to teach you all the lessons you need to know. If you don’t want to lose money on your first try out, buy some cheap plants at Melbourne and plant them in your garden or flower beds. For your first try simply dig some holes and place each shrub or tree in it before covering it up again without the initial bag or basket. Your seedlings will survive depending on how hardy they are. If none of them grow, try changing the type of soil or the place where you’ve planted them the first time round.
Read Up on the Matter
You can also go the academic route and read up on all things agricultural (such as the fact that camellia sasanqua was cultivated in Japan for its functional use). This is a great way to gain all the theoretical knowledge you need to be a gardener, especially if you are starting late and have to catch up to the other gardeners. However, studying will only give you theoretical knowledge; it will not teach you practically how to garden and how each thing has a set time, place and a rule. It will not teach you about the problems you run into nor teach you how to solve it on your own. It’s always better to gain practical knowledge but in the event that you don’t yet have the opportunity to practice, you can read a book too.
Assist Your Neighbours
You must have at least one neighbour who loves gardening and won’t mind someone who has genuine interest poking around. Ask politely whether you can help out and learn a few tricks of the trade along the way. A more experienced gardener will have a wealth of wisdom to share if only you can tap into it. So be patient, do the drudgery and remember to keep your eyes and ears open to catch any morsel of info you get. In order to reinforce everything, keep referring back to what you saw and repeat the process at home as well.Welcome to Our Digital Space!

In 2020, Flanders was home to nearly 200,000 equines. That’s 14 equines per square meter or 30 per 1,000 people – one of the highest densities per capita in Europe. In that same year, the sector exported nearly 3,500 registered living horses worth a total value of EUR 65 million.
You are here
Flanders’ equine sector is galloping forward at full speed
Zooming in on the impact of this important socioeconomic factor and the sector’s international allure, Jan De Boitselier, manager at umbrella organization PaardenPunt Vlaanderen, explains the how and why behind Flanders’ position as a prominent equine region.
Long history of well-bred horses
The success of the equine industry in Flanders hasn’t come out of the blue. The region has a centuries-old tradition of breeding horses. “Initially, Flanders focused on breeding draft horses,” Jan De Boitselier explains. “Between the two World Wars, the region’s economy was quite literally pulled forward by draft horses, with more than 40,000 foals per year being bred in that period of time. In the 1950s, the focus started shifting toward riding and sport horses. At the time, many quality animals were imported from countries such as France, Germany and the Netherlands, and various equine bloodlines were combined in Flanders. Because of this tradition, the region has accumulated a huge amount of knowledge about horse breeding.”
The majority of Flanders’ breeding farms are small: about 93% of foals are born to breeders producing only up to three foals per year. This proves that Flanders really focuses on quality and flexibility. “Moreover,” Jan De Boitselier continues, “the region is perfectly located between the breeding areas of France, Germany, and the Netherlands. Besides that, horses are perfectly adapted to our mild and relatively wet climate. Consequently, they can run outside as much as possible here. This is especially a plus in the equestrian world, where each day spent in a stable is one too many and puts a mortgage on a horse’s sporting career.”
Jumpers rising to the top
Flanders’ golden combination of location, climate, and a focus on quality ensures healthy horses that perform brilliantly by all accounts. But the region focuses on one discipline in particular. “We specialize in show jumpers,” Jan De Boitselier clarifies. “Ours are among the world’s best.”
“Take the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, for example,” he continues. “There, King Edward, a Belgian horse, was the only one to complete six rounds without jumping faults or penalty points. That made him the best jumper of the competition. What’s more, he’s also one of just two horses to pull off such a feat in Olympic history since World War II, the other one – fittingly called ‘All In’ – having Belgian origins as well.”
It doesn’t stop there, though. That same All In shone alongside King Edward and other horses with Belgian roots on the 2020 Olympic stage in the equestrian team jumping category. Out of the nine riders that won gold, silver, or bronze medals, five competed with Belgian horses. These included the steeds of the three Swedish equestrians, all riding their team to Olympic gold. Meanwhile, in the individual jumping category, all but one of the top five riders had a Belgian horse. And the success isn’t limited to the Olympics. Both at the 2021 Jumping European Championship and the 2021 CHIO Aachen, Belgian breeds dominated the winners’ stage as well.
It should come as no surprise that many international riders want to join the craze, competing with horses from Belgium and Flanders as a region, and even spending much time there to train. American show jumping champion and Olympic medalist Jessica Springsteen – daughter of musician Bruce Springsteen – is just one example. So is German Olympic medalist Daniel Deusser. Even American business magnate Bill Gates is aware of Flanders’ quality equines and equestrian circuit, gifting his daughter Jennifer with a stud farm in Flanders to support her horseback riding career.
Track records for the win
In addition to show jumping, Flanders also enjoys an excellent reputation when it comes to other breeds and equestrian sports disciplines. “To highlight just a few examples,” Jan De Boitselier points out, “The Arabian stallion QR Marc was bred in Flanders and received the title of world champion in Dubai in 2012. Meanwhile, Bernard Fonck, an equestrian from Flanders, was the first European and second non-American ever to be crowned world champion in individual reining at the 2018 FEI World Equestrian Games.”
The cherry on the cake: Flanders’ long-standing history in successful horse breeding is reflected in its studbooks’ track records. Jan De Boitselier: “We have some of the best studbooks. In 2021, the Belgian Warmblood got the first place in the WBFSH Jumping Ranking, out of 55 studbooks. The breed made it to first place in previous editions of the ranking as well – and so did the Zangersheide studbook.”
Recent prize money statistics only add to these track records. Jan De Boitselier: “In 2021, horses from Belgium ranked second worldwide in terms of collected prize money, totaling over EUR 19.3 million by October. Looking at which mares produce the best-performing pedigree, the global top three includes two Belgian matrons: Derly Chin de Muze in first place and Diva ter Elzen in third. In 2021, their offspring had already collected EUR 759,756 and EUR 539,689 in prize money by October. At the same time, the world’s most lucrative horse was none other than Belgian pride Killer Queen, while nearly half of the top ten was a Belgian breed.”
We have some of best studbooks. In 2021, the Belgian Warmblood got the first place in the WBFSH Jumping Ranking, out of 55 studbooks.
Outstanding standards in sports and wellbeing
Apart from top-notch and innovating breeding, Flanders also excels in producing equestrian champions. “Belgium and Flanders as a region have some excellent riders, some of which coach foreign equestrians and country teams themselves,” Jan De Boitselier clarifies. “Highlighting just two famous examples: in 2010, Philippe Lejeune became world champion with Vigo d’Arsouille, and in 2021, Pieter Devos, Jerome Guery and Gregory Wathelet won bronze at the Summer Olympics in Tokyo. One of the main reasons behind these and other sports successes shouldn’t be surprising… Horses that are well cared for perform better. In Flanders, this is an understatement!”
Flanders has some excellent riders. Some of them coach foreign equestrians and country teams themselves.
Indeed, various institutions in Flanders check all the right boxes in the animal health field. Take, for example, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the university of Ghent (UGent). Every year, hundreds of animals are treated in its 50,000-m² stables and clinics. Almost 2,000 students, more than a quarter of whom come from abroad, follow the top-notch training program to become veterinarians. The animals also come from far away at times. This should come as no surprise, as the faculty has an outstanding reputation. For example, in 2017, UGent’s veterinary research program ranked number one in the Shanghai Ranking of Academic Subjects and continued to do so for five consecutive years.
Also in Flanders, the university of Leuven (KU Leuven) has a strong reputation in this field as well. A specific division of its Faculty of Bio-engineering focuses on pet genetics, including those of horses. Based on various studies, their main goal is to develop ‘breeding value estimates’ of sport horses.
Overall, there are eight highly specialized horse clinics in Flanders, where over 130 employees go all out to provide the best possible care. One example is Equitom in Lummen, near the city of Hasselt. This internationally renowned, cutting-edge equine clinic specializes in surgery and offers a wide range of medical services, from internal and sports medicine to rehabilitation and medical imaging.
“Animal health is a core priority in Flanders,” Jan De Boitselier continues. “Various organizations in the region are currently working on projects that focus on different topics related to horse welfare such as safety and housing for horses. Another important undertaking is the ‘Equilabel’, which gives high-quality riding schools and boarding stables a chance to distinguish themselves. In the assessment, several criteria are applied, including customer service, animal friendliness and compliance.”
Adjacent expertise deserving of a medal
Furthermore, the equine sector in Flanders is supported by a comprehensive and professional ecosystem that developed and internationalized rapidly in tandem with the region’s long history of breeders. These niche players possess highly specific know-how, which is considered the cream of the crop within their respective markets.
Jan De Boitselier: “Think of Flanders’ excellent equine farriers, feed and transport players, as well as top-notch stable, track, arena, fence, and obstacle builders. Their services and expertise are called upon by equestrian players of all sorts and from around the globe. Or how about our local experts in scenography, whose skills make some of the most prestigious equestrian competitions a treat to the eyes and ears alike. Meanwhile, a variety of veterinary services providers support the equine industry with state-of-the-art equipment and knowledge.”
Even more, there is no lack of professional training: “At Landelijke Rijvereniging and Paardensport Vlaanderen, two well-known organizations within the horse business, you can gain an excellent basic education on the care and training of horses,” Jan De Boitselier guarantees. “This is very important for both horse and rider.”
Meanwhile, the level of professionalism in Flanders’ equine industry is also beneficial to society at large. Horses are even represented in human healthcare. Using hippotherapy, for instance, people can improve both their physical and mental health. “This kind of treatment has been gaining popularity in recent years,” Jan De Boitselier explains. “It requires additional training offered by several university colleges in Flanders, including Arteveldehogeschool in Ghent and Vives in Bruges.”
A key economic and ecological factor
Adding to the local equine industry’s international allure, the export of horses from Flanders is on the rise. In 2020, more than 3,500 horses were exported, worth EUR 650 million in total. Countries such as France, Ireland, Germany, and Italy as well as more distant markets such as the US, Japan, and Brazil are among Flanders’ most important equine export destinations. But the socioeconomic relevance of the region’s equine industry goes beyond international trade.
For instance, the use of horses in sports and recreation is extremely popular in Flanders as well, generating around EUR 105 million in turnover in 2020 and resulting in well-attended horse races across the region.
What’s more, in 2020, Flanders’ 108 approved centers for equine reproductive activities, which employ around 100 full-time equivalents, generated a turnover of EUR 21 million. That’s an increase of 50% compared to 2014. Meanwhile, the 23 recognized studbook associations in Flanders realized a turnover of EUR 3.8 million.
Last but not least, horses also play a major role ecologically in Flanders. Jan De Boitselier: “The horse sector contributes to preservation of valuable permanent grassland, which is good for the welfare of people and environment.” On top of that, horse pastures and hay meadows are a real asset for the realization of the European Directives on conservation objectives.
“We can say without a doubt that the equine sector in Flanders brings added value in several socioeconomic areas,” Jan De Boitselier concludes. “The horse is a noble animal that deserves our attention and the best care!”

Harris Patents on classical business methods are apparently “not dead yet,” to borrow a phrase from Monty Python, and in some respects may be “getting better.” But new legal developments in the area of financial technology and service (fintech) patents are expected in the near future. Fintech patents can provide significant competitive advantages. As reported in the Wall Street Journal on February 4, 2013, Vanguard Group supposedly pioneered the idea of offering exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a separate share class of existing mutual funds to create economies of scale and keep costs low. The company obtained a patent on its ETF management process (clearly a “business method” patent), and seems to still have some leverage from obtaining that patent. A quick look at the claims of the Vanguard Group patent illustrates what it takes to get patents these days in the financial technology space. The patent also gives hints on what fintech companies might try to patent themselves – or hope that a competitor does not try to patent. Claim 1 of the Vanguard Group patent reads as follows, with emphasis supplied 1. A method for administering an investment fund comprising an aggregation of a plurality of underlying financial assets, the method comprising the steps of: (a) issuing at least one class of shares for purchase and redemption from the fund at a net asset value, including at least one class of crossing shares having crossing share redemption restrictions; (b) issuing at least one class of non-crossing shares that do not have the crossing share redemption restrictions; (c) tracking, by a computer programmed to perform such tracking, crossing share redemption requests; and (d) processing for cash redemption, by a computer programmed to perform such processing, only as many crossing share redemption requests from one or more redeeming parties as are offset by processing a cumulative dollar amount of share purchase requests from one or more purchasing parties, the share purchase requests processed by: (i) retiring redeemed crossing shares corresponding to the crossing share redemption requests in exchange for providing to the one or more redeeming parties cash equal to the number of redeemed crossing shares multiplied by a net asset value of the redeemed crossing shares, and (ii) issuing shares corresponding to the share purchase requests to the one or more purchasing parties to offset the retired redeemed crossing shares. The language relating to use of a computer programmed to perform such tracking or processing is characteristic of an approach to patent claiming now being forced upon fintech and computer software companies by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The USPTO has for a number of years been strongly encouraging, nay, almost requiring, patent applicants to tie financial and business process patent claims to a particular machine. This “tied to a particular machine” requirement is one facet of what is known as the “machine-or-transformation” test for patentable subject matter of processes. Tying a process to a particular machine, e.g. reciting a computer programmed to carry out a specific process, is one specific way that such processes can be found patentable subject matter. There have been several recent and significant court decisions in the area of process patents. Prominent among these court decisions was the Supreme Court case of Bilski v. Kappos, 130 S. Ct. 3218, 3231 (2010). In that case, the U.S. Supreme Court suggested that claims which satisfy the “machine-or-transformation” test are more likely to be found patentable. But the Court said that this is not the only test for patentability – one cannot attempt to patent an “abstract idea.” The more recent case of Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc., 132 S.Ct. 1289, 1293 (2012) emphasized consideration of the notion that you cannot patent laws of nature, natural phenomena and abstract ideas. This case was in the context of deciding against a patent on a medical diagnostic method. Other process patent cases are working their way through the appeals process. On February 8, 2013, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) hear en banc oral arguments in the case of CLS Bank International v. Alice Corp., Case No. 11-1301. This case will consider the frustrating puzzle of applying the Supreme Court’s prohibition of patenting abstract ideas to another sort of fintech patent claims. The patents in the CLS Bank case relate to various method and system claims to a computerized currency trading platform used by banks as a low-risk way to reconcile pending transactions, particularly across different time zones. A district court found the claims ineligible for patent protection under 35 U.S.C. §101 as directed to abstract ideas. A Federal Circuit panel reversed, and now the case is back for en banc rehearing. The en banc CAFC posed several particular questions for briefing, which further illuminate the difficult philosophical problem for any court (CAFC or Supreme Court) of deciding what kind of things can be patented: (1) What is the test for determining if a computer-implemented invention is a patent-ineligible abstract idea? (2) When, if ever, can a computer in a claim lend patent eligibility to an otherwise ineligible idea? (3) Should it matter to patent eligibility that the computer-implemented invention is claimed as a method, system, or storage device? (4) Should such claims (method, system, storage device) be considered equivalent for determining patent eligibility? A decision from the Federal Circuit is expected within the next several months. If history is any guide, the CAFC will either find the claims patent or unpatentable, it will lay out some kind of decision framework that patent professionals and court judges will find perplexing and only partially workable, and – if the loser of CLS Bank or Alice Corp. still has any fight left – another Supreme Court decision will follow. As a practical matter, this area is too philosophical and policy-dependent to be decided in the courts. The Supreme Court can only work with the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress as to determining patentability. And the current laws are much too vague and uncertain to provide industry with practical guidance on patenting – whether fintech, computer software, medical diagnostics, or otherwise. Further and more carefully considered patent reform is really the only way to go, but don’t hold your breath for another round of patent reform. The 2011 American Invents Act (AIA) is just really getting started, and it is no help whatsoever in this area. * * * * *Frequently Asked Questions

Not only you won’t have to think about the safety of your valuable and expensive piano, but you will have someone who will do it for an affordable price for you.Crucifixion or cruci-fiction?
Few Years back, an American historical researcher and mathematician, Michael Hart, published a book called ‘The 100, the Greatest Hundred in History’ In his book he gives the names of the 100 ‘Most Influential Men in History’ and his reasons for their positions in his list. Amazingly, he (most probably a Christian) puts Muhammad first in his hundred, and with good reasons too. And with equally good reasons he places Jesus Christ, the man accepted as ‘Lord’ and ‘Saviour’ by nearly all his fellow Americans, number three.
Prophet Muhammad is No.1, A Chapter by Michael H. Hart in his book Top 100 ‘Most Influential Men’ I have also placed the chapter on Jesus Christ along side it Real Founder of Christianity. Though there are at the moment 200 million more nominal Christians in the world than the 1000 million Muslims, Mr. Hart divides the credit for founding Christianity between Paul and Jesus, and he gives the greater portion to Paul. Hence the 3rd position for Jesus. Every knowledgeable Christian concedes that the real founder of Christianity is St. Paul and not Jesus Christ.
In any event, if there is any division between a Muslim and a Christian on the grounds of dogma, belief, ethics or morality, then the cause of such conflict could be traced to an utterance of Paul found in his books of Corinthians, Philippians, Galatians, Thessalonians, etc., in the Bible.
As against the teaching of the Master (Jesus) that salvation only comes through keeping of the commandments (Matthew 19:16-17), Paul nails the law and the commandments to the cross Paul nails the law and the commandments to the cross Colossians 2:14 (One of the multifarious letters/correspondence of Paul among the 27 Books of the New Testament) and claims that salvation can only be obtained through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ ‘If Christ be not risen from the dead, then our preaching is vain, and your faith is also vain.’ (1 Corinthians 15:14)! ‘For all your good deeds’, says the Christian dogmatist, ‘are like filthy rags’ - (Isaiah 64:6).
No cruci-fiction - No Christianity
‘The death of Jesus’, says Professor Jurgen Moltmann in his ‘The Crucified God’.
(‘God’: The bulk of Christendom accept Jesus Christ as God incarnate - God in human flesh. According to the Christian dogma, Jesus must die as God, for a million human sacrifices cannot redeem mankind from their sin.)
In a nutshell. No Crucifixion - No Christianity! This is the experience of us Muslims, in this ocean of Christianity, which is South Africa. A thousand sects and denominations of Christianity are vying with one another to redeem the ‘heathen’ (as they say) from hell-fire. However, in this battle no Christian priest, parson or predikant, or hot-gospeller, local or imported, will ever endeavour to teach the Muslim something about hygiene; for we Muslims can claim to be the most hygienic people (I am talking about personal hygiene).
Nor do they endeavour to teach us about hospitality; for we are the most hospitable of people. Nor about ethics or morality; for we are the most moral people - (as a whole) i.e. we don’t drink, we don’t gamble, we don’t date, court or dance; we pray 5 times a day, we fast for one whole month during the Muslim Holy month of Ramadan; and we take pleasure in being a charitable people. Despite any of our shortcomings, we venture to suggest that there is not another group of people that can ‘show a candle’ to us in brotherhood, in piety or in sobriety.
Blood for salvation
‘Yes! Yes!’ says the Christian missionary, ‘but you do not have salvation.’ Because salvation comes ‘only through the blood of the lord Jesus’. ‘All your good works are like filthy rags’, he says. ‘If only you Muslims would accept the redeeming blood of Jesus, and take Jesus as your ‘Personal Saviour’, you Muslims, then would be like angels walking the earth.’
What are we Muslims to say to this Christian claim? Nothing better than Allah’s shattering reply to the Jewish boast!:
‘Full of Doubts! In a state of confusion. Without Knowledge! In ignorance. They only follow Conjecture!” (Quran 4:157)
Allah: is the name of God Almighty in the Semitic languages, i.e. in the language of Moses, Jesus and Muhammad (peace be upon them all).
Could anyone have been more explicit, more emphatic, more dogmatic, more uncompromising in rejecting the dogma of a faith than this? ‘impossible!’ is the answer. The only One Who could, would be the All-Knowing, the Omniscient, the Omnipotent Lord of the Universe - God Almighty Himself!
The Muslim believes this categorical Quranic statement to be from God. Hence he asks no questions and seeks for no proof. Had the Christians accepted the Quran as the Word of God, the problem of the crucifixion would never have arisen. They vehemently oppose the Quranic teaching and attack everything Islamic. In the words of Thomas Carlyle - ‘They (the Christians) have been trained to hate the man Mohamed and his religion.’
In trying to prove their dogmas (Dogma: ‘Principle, tenet, doctrinal system; arrogant declaration of opinion.’ - Oxford Dictionary), they invent shocking statements and posers - one of which has been used as the title of this book - ‘Christ crucified - Hoax or History?’ (Original title of this book) No doubt it sounds provocative; but it is a borrowed title - from the Christian’s own extravagances; from his own vocabulary.
Garner Ted Armstrong, the Executive Vice-President and Co-Publisher of the ‘Plain Truth’ (a Christian Magazine from America, which boasts a current, free, world- wide circulation of 6 million copies a month) (As claimed in their February 1984 issue), attempts to answer his own puzzle under the heading:
"Was the resurrection a Hoax?’ This is the typical American way of selling religion. He elucidates his poser -’Hoax?’ - with the words, ‘The resurrection of Jesus Christ of Nazareth is either the supreme fact of history or a flagrant. Deliberate fabrication foisted off on the followers of Christianity."
Another budding, young ‘Billy Graham’ from America, Josh McDowell effuses in his book ‘The resurrection factor’, saying, ‘I was forced to the conclusion that the resurrection of Jesus Christ is either one of the most wicked, heartless, vicious, hoaxes ever foisted upon the minds of men, or it is the most fantastic fact of history.’ Since it is not possible for an Oriental to match American superlatives and extravagant verbiage, I do not have to apologize for humbly borrowing their words for the title of my book: ‘Christ Crucified -Hoax or History?’. Now changed to - ‘Crucifixion or Cruci-fiction?’
Christian objection
To the Muslim belief that Jesus Christ was ‘neither killed nor crucified’, the Christian objects, ‘how can a man (Prophet Muhammad) a thousand miles away from the scene of a happening, and 600 years after an event, pronounce as to what had transpired?’ The Muslim says that the words Muhammad uttered were not his own, but that the Words were ‘put into his mouth’ by the All-Knowing, All-Seeing God. The Christian retorts that he is not prepared to accept the metaphysical aspect of Muhammad’s revelation; more so, in view of the written records by ‘eye-witnesses’(?) and ‘ear-witnesses’(?) as regards the happenings on that Easter week-end some two thousand years ago.
The Christian plea is valid. Their logic is good. To entertain their plea we will call up their witnesses and cross examine them to discover the truth or falsity of the matter from their own authorities. Admittedly, the key witnesses in the case are Matthew, Mark, Luke and John - the alleged authors of the Canonical Gospels. But they have all died and are in their graves. ‘Yes, that is true, but we have in our possession their sworn affidavits!’ says the Christian.
When confronted by the extravagant and conflicting claims of the Jews and the Christians to their exclusive rights to salvation, Allah commands us to demand for proof. He says: “And they say: None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian. Those are their (vain) desires. Say: Produce your proof if you are truthful.” (Quran 2:111)
And they have produced the only proof they have; in over fifteen hundred different languages! eleven different dialects of the Bible for the Arabs alone! Are we going to swallow their hook, line and sinker? No! It is presupposed that when Allah commands us to demand for proof, that we would be in a position to analyse the proof, once it is produced. Otherwise, it makes no sense to demand for proof; it would be nonsense! Glory be to Him!
Third party evidence - ‘according to’
The amazing thing about the Christians’ sworn affidavits (writings attributed to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) is that not a single one of them is duly attested. Not a single one bears the signature, mark or thumb-print of its author in the so-called originals. They now boast of being in possession of over 5000 ‘originals’ of which no two ‘originals’ are identical. Amazing! Little-wonder the Christians themselves label their Gospels as - ‘The Gospel according to St. Matthew’, ‘The Gospel according to St. Mark’, ‘The Gospel according to St. Luke’ and ‘The Gospel according to St. John’.
When Christian scholars are asked why the words ‘according to’ are repeated at the beginning of every Gospel, the obvious implication is that they are not autographed. It is only assumed that they are authored by the names the Gospels carry today. The translators of the ‘New International Version’ have unceremoniously expunged the ‘According to’s’ from the four Gospels in their latest translation. Of the alleged Gospel writers, viz., Matthew, Mark, Luke and John it can be categorically stated that 50% were not even the elected twelve Disciples of Jesus.
Prima-facie case
I dare humbly claim that such unattested documents would be thrown out of hand, in any Court-of-Law, in any civilised country, in just two minutes. Furthermore, one of the alleged witnesses, St. Mark, tells us that at the most critical juncture in the life of Jesus - ‘All his disciples forsook him and fled’- (Mark 14:50).
Please ask your Christian friend, ‘Does ‘all’ mean all in your language, you Englishman?’ (This applies to the North American as well) And he will no doubt say - ‘Yes!’; ‘Does ‘almal’ mean almal in your language, you Afrikaner?’ And no doubt he will say - ‘ja!’ (pronounced Yaa); ‘And does ‘bonke’ mean bonke in your language, you Zulu?’ And he will say - ‘Ahe!’ This is true of every language. Why not memorise this verse from the Bible in your own dialect? Even in some additional languages?
So the so-called ‘eye-witnesses’ were not really eyewitnesses to the happenings, unless St. Mark is not telling us the whole truth, the ‘gospel truth’. Yet he is supposed to be speaking under oath! you will agree that a case based on such hearsay evidence would be thrown out of court, twice in two minutes, in any court of law, in any civilised country; that is twice in just 120 seconds flat! But a ghost (dogma) of two thousand years standing, upon which hangs the salvation of 1200 million Christians, should not be summarily dismissed. It deserves a little more circumspection. We will therefore entertain the alleged testimonies of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John as if they were duly attested.
Where do we begin?
At the beginning of course! - Exactly as the Bible does (‘In the beginning’ Genesis 1:1) - just 24 hours before the cataclysmic events of ‘a thunderstorm; an eclipse of the sun; an earthquake; rocks being rent; the veil of the temple being torn from the top to bottom; graves being opened and sleeping corpses marching through the streets of Jerusalem...’ as narrated by the Christians’ Witnesses. What a scenario for a billion dollar, record breaking, film production!
We must not forget that the Jews are in the dock, alleged for the murder of Jesus Christ; and we as Muslims are constrained to defend them against the Christian charge, because justice must be done. Whatever their sins of commission and omission, Allah exonerates them from the charge of murder. He says: “That they said (in boast), ‘We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah’; but they killed him not, nor crucified him” (Quran 4:157)
The Christian world has been unjustly persecuting, and hounding and killing our Jewish cousins for nearly two thousand years for a murder they did not commit. Attempted murder? - may be! But murder? - no! By absolving the Jew of a crime he did not commit, we are also taking the wind out of the hot gospellers’ and the Bible thumpers’ sail. In the battle for the hearts and minds of mankind, ‘cruci-Fiction’ is the only card the Christian holds. Free him from his infatuation and you will have freed the Muslim world from missionary aggression and harassment.
On the eve of the Passover Feast, Jesus and his twelve disciples are seated around a huge Table with their host - the ‘beloved disciple’, whose name also happened to be John. Johns’ and Jesus’ (of the three candidates for the 3 crosses at Golgotha on the 1st Easter week-end, there were 2 Jesus’. The one released was Jesus Barabbas.) were names, common among the Jews in the year 30 A.C. as Toms, Dicks, Johns and Jimmys are with us in the twentieth century.
There were at least 14 men at the table (count them if you wish) and not the unlucky thirteen of Western superstition. A country as advance as South Africa, like an adjunct of the USA., has no Row 13 on any of its Aeroplanes!!
March into Jerusalem
Jesus made his triumphant royal entry into Jerusalem at the head of an excited and enthusiastic following, with high hopes of establishing the ‘Kingdom of God’ any minute; riding a donkey to fulfill prophecy, Zechariah 9:9 “Tell ye the daughter of Zion, behold, thy King cometh... sitting upon an ass... And a great multitude spread their garments... and branches in the way... and the multitude cried, saying, ‘Hosanna to the son of David...
Hosanna in the highest” (Matthew 21:5-9)
Let Luke the beloved physician, add his strokes to clarify the picture “because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the Kingdom of God should Immediately appear” (Luke 19:11)
“But those mine enemies, who would not that I should reign over them, bring them hither, and slay them before me” (Luke 19:27)
“Blessed be the King who cometh in the name of the Lord” (Luke 19:38)
And John adds that the excited throng exclaimed “Hosanna! Blessed is the King of Israel, that cometh in the name of the Lord” (John 12:13)
“The Pharisees said... Behold, the world is gone (mad) after him (Jesus)” (John 12:21)
“Now is the judgement of this world; NOW shall the prince of this world be cast out” (John 12:31)
Who would withstand such heady-wine of impending glory? Little wonder that Jesus was tempted physically to oust those that bought and sold within the temple precincts. He overthrew the money-changer’s tables and drove them out with a ‘whip of cords’- (John 2:15)
The overthrow of the Temple Authority was imminent, and a forerunner to the expulsion of the Romans, heralding the ‘Kingdom of God.’ But alas his high hopes did not materialise. The whole performance fizzled out like a damp squib, despite all the ‘Hosannas’ and hoorays to the ‘Son of David’ and the ‘King of Israel.’ All this ballyhoo was only forty years premature. Jesus had failed to heed the warning of the Pharisees to curb the over exuberance of his disciples (Luke 19:39). He had miscalculated. Now he must pay the price of failure. His nation was not ready for any sacrifice, in spite of all their infantile clamour.
Jewish reasoning
The Jewish leaders reasoned that this one man had almost brought the nation to destruction. Therefore, “It is expedient for one man to die for the nation” (John 11:50)
But with all the mass hysteria surrounding him, it was also not expedient to apprehend Jesus in public. They waited for the opportunity of a clandestine arrest. As luck would have it they found in Judas, an elected disciple of Jesus, a traitor who would sell his Lord and Master for thirty miserable pieces of silver.
In the opinion of Christian divines it was the greed of gold which enticed Judas to do his dastardly deed. But he had more money-sense then the Christians gave him credit for. As a purser for the elect group of Jesus he had endless opportunities of pinching pennies permanently. Why jeopardise that for all times for 30 paltry pieces? There is more to that than meets the eye. Judas was disgruntled, after all those mass demonstrations on Jesus’ regal entry into Jerusalem - those hot outpourings of: ‘The Hour is come - and Now is - the prince of this world will be cast out - I should reign over them - bring them hither and slay them before me.’
Jesus had now developed cold-feet. If only Jesus could be provoked, he might react with miracles, and bring down fire and brimstones from Heaven upon his enemies; and, of course, the legions of angels (which he boasted were at his disposal), which would enable him and his disciples to rule the world.
From close contact with the Master, he had learned that Jesus was kind, tender and loving. But, he was not a mealy-mouthed man; he was no milk and water Messiah. But Judas could not understand the ‘hot and cold’ blowing of Jesus. Perhaps if Jesus was accosted, he would yet deliver the goods. To this end Judas schemed.
The traitor known
The furtive looks and the suspicious behaviour of Judas had revealed everything to Jesus. He did not need the Holy Ghost to interpret the misgivings in Judas’s mind. At the Table in the Upper-room where Jesus and his disciples were having that ‘Last Supper’, Jesus dismissed Judas with the words “What thou doest, do quickly” (John 13:27). And Judas took off to put the seal on the deal to the stab in the back.
Jesus will not be a sitting-duck for a clandestine arrest by the Jews. He prepares his disciples for the impending showdown. Discreetly, so as not to frighten his disciples, he introduces the subject of defence. Gently he begins: ‘When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye anything?’ And they said, ‘Nothing’ Then said he unto them, “But now, he that hath no purse, let him take it, and likewise his bag; and he that hath no Sword, let him sell his garment and buy one!” (Luke 22:35-36)
This is a preparation for a Holy War - Jews against Jews! Why! Why this somersault? Did he not advise them to ‘turn the other cheek’; ‘to forgive seventy times seven’ (70 x 7 = 490)? Did he not send his chosen twelve with the advice “Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves; be ye, therefore, as wise as serpents,(?) and as harmless as doves” (Matthew 10:16)
To arms! To arms!
The situation and the circumstance have changed and as with any wise and able general, the strategy must also change. The disciples were already armed. They had some foresight. They had not left Galilee with bare knuckles. They responded “Lord, behold, here are two Swords. And he said unto them, ‘It is enough’” (Luke 22:38)
The missionary, so as to retain the impression of the ‘meek and gentle Jesus’, ‘the Prince of peace’, pleads that the Swords were spiritual! If the Swords were spiritual, then the ‘garments’ must also be spiritual. If the disciples of Jesus were to sell their spiritual garments to buy spiritual Swords, in that case they would all become spiritually naked! Furthermore, one does not lop off people’s physical ears with spiritual Swords “And, behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his Sword, and struck a servant of the high priests, and cut off his ear” (Matthew 26:51)
The only purpose of Swords or guns is to maim and to kill. People did not carry Swords to pare apples and bananas in the time of Christ.
Why couple of swords enough?
If this was a preparation for war, then why should two Swords be ‘enough’? The reason is that Jesus was not contemplating a battle against the legions of Rome. Since his ‘friend’ Judas was in league with the Temple authorities, he was expecting a clandestine, underhand attempt by the Jewish oligarchy to seize him. It would be a question of Jews against Jews. In such a battle against the Jewish temple servants and the riff-raff of the town, he would prevail. Of that he was sure. He had with him Peter (the Rock) and John and James (the sons of Thunder) together with the other eight, each vying with one another to go to prison for him; to die for him. (‘Likewise also said all the disciples.’ Matthew 26:35)
These were all Galilians. They had a reputation of Zealotism, terrorism and repeated insurrections against the Romans. Armed with sticks and stones, and the Swords, and fortified with the spirit of self- sacrifice which they had avowed for their Master, he was sure to knock hells into any Jewish rabble that dare confront him.
He had proved himself a skilful strategist and planner, alert and resourceful. This was not the time to sit and twiddle thumbs; to be a sitting-duck, cooped up with his disciples in the upper-room! No, not for him. He leads his platoon, in the middle of the night, to Gethsemane-Gethsemane - an olive press - a courtyard built of stone walls some 5 miles out of town.
On the way, he unburdens to them the seriousness of the situation. The implications and the explosive nature of the coup that failed. Now he must bear the wrath of the powers that be. The price of failure!
You do not have to be a military genius to appreciate that, Jesus deploys his forces as a master tactician, in a manner that would bring credit to any Officer out of ‘Sandhurst’ (A leading military academy in England). He places eight of the eleven disciples at the entrance to the courtyard, commanding them “Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder” (Matthew 26:36)
The question that would bug any thinker is: ‘Why did they all go to Gethsemane?’ To pray? Could they not have prayed in the upper-room? Could they not have gone to the Temple of Solomon, a stone’s throw from where they were, if prayer is all that they wanted to do? No! They went to the Garden so that they might be in a better position to defend themselves!
Observe, Jesus does not take the eight with him to pray. He positions them strategically at the entrance to the courtyard; armed to the hilt, as the circumstances would allow “And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee... Then saith he unto them... tarry ye here and watch with me” (Matthew 26:37-38)
Where is he taking Peter and John and James now? Further into the Garden! To pray? No! To make an inner line of defence - he had put eight at the Gate, and, now these zealous Zealots (the fighting Irishmen of their day), armed with Swords, to ‘wait and watch ‘ - to keep guard! The picture is very vivid; Jesus leaves nothing to our imagination. And he (alone) prayed!
Jesus prays for rescue
“and began to be sorrowful and very depressed. Then saith he unto them, ‘my soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death”
“And he went a little further, and fell on his face (Exactly as the Muslim does in prayer), and prayed, saying, ‘O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt” (Matthew 26: 37- 39). This is the quality of a good Muslim who submits his will to the will of God.
“And being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood falling down to the ground” (Luke 22:44)
Why all this bewailing and lamentation? Is he crying to save his skin? It would be highly cynical on his part to do that! Did he not advise others :29-30)
We would be doing Jesus a grave injustice if we thought that he was crying like a woman to save his body from physical harm. He was crying for his people - the Jews. They held a queer logic, that if they succeeded in killing any would be Messiah (Christ), it would be a sure proof of his imposture. For God Almighty will never allow His truly ‘anointed one’ (Christ) to be killed - (Deuteronomy 18:20)
Hence the insistence of the Jews as a people, as a whole, in rejecting Jesus, the son of Mary, as their promised Messiah ‘The eternal rejection.’
Imaginative version
This harrowing sob-story, the blood-curdling cries and lamentations would evoke sympathy in the hardest of hearts. And the hot-gospeller and the Bible thumper is not averse to its effective exploitation. We are told that Jesus was destined to die for the sins of mankind. That he was ‘being prepared for this vicarious sacrifice before the foundation of the world’. That even before the material universe came into being, there was a contract between ‘Father and son,’ and that in the year 4000 A.A. (After Adam), God himself in the form of Jesus, as the second person from the enigmatic Trinity, was to get himself hanged to redeem mankind from the Original Sin and their actual sins.
- According to Christian calculations the world and everything in it is 6000 years old.
- ‘Trinity’ The closest approximation to the Christian dogma of the trinity as found in the Bible - ‘For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one’ - (1st Epistle of John 5:7) - has now been unceremoniously thrown out as fabrication in the R.S.V., the most up-to- date translation of the Bible.
From the ‘call to arms’ in the upper-room, and the masterful deployment of forces at Gethsemane, and the blood-sweating prayer to the God of Mercy for help, it appears that Jesus knew nothing about the contract for his crucifixion. It reminds one of the Biblical Abraham, leading his son to the slaughter with the bluff that the Lord will provide a ‘scape-goat.’
If this was God’s plan for a vicarious atonement to redeem mankind, then obviously He had chosen a wrong substitute. This candidate was most reluctant to die. Arming! Wailingi Sweating! Crying! Complaining! Contrast these responses with those of Lord Nelson, a war-hero, who gave up the ghost with these undying words ‘Thank god, I have done my duty!’. There are millions today, who would happily immolate themselves for King and country, with smiles on their faces, with shouts of ‘Amandhia!’ or ‘Allahu-akbar!’ or ‘God save the Queen!’ Jesus was an unwilling victim. If this was God’s scheme of salvation, then it was a heartless plot. It was murder in the first degree, and not redeeming self-sacrifice.
Major Yeats-Brown, in his ‘Life of a Bengal Lancer’, summarises the Christian Doctrine of the Atonement in just a single sentence: ‘Noise this mysterious curse.’
‘No heathen tribe!’ proclaims this Britisher. But the mighty nations of the West, live and die by this ‘Fiction’. If it is no longer fit for home consumption, then it is still good for export! More than 62,000 full-time missionaries (Modern-day Crusaders) are raising the dust throughout the world. Harassing the ‘heathen’ as they call them. Over 40% of these cultists are ‘born-again’ Americans!
Strange as it may sound, after every outpouring of prayer, Jesus Christ found his disciples lulled to sleep at their post. Again and again he bewailed “What could ye not watch with me for one hour?” (Matthew 26:40)
“And again he (Jesus) went away, and prayed, and spoke the same words. And when he returned, he found them sleep again” (Mark 14:39-40)
Poor St. Mark bemoans that the disciples could give no excuse for their lassitude, their somnambulism. He records “neither knew they what to answer him” (Mark 14:40)
However, the most lucid, the most coherent and systematic of all Gospel writers, St. Luke, hazards a guess for this anomaly. He says “And when he (Jesus) rose from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow” (Luke 22:45)
‘Born-Again:’ The latest cult among the Christians. Billy Graham claims that there are 70 million such cultists in America. Immaculate people, veritable angels! Yet in that nation over a quarter million ‘gays’ gathered in San Fransisco last June on a pilgrimage, led by 50 lesbians on motorbikes. In New York, there are only one million more women than men and of the ‘men’ it is said that one third are sodomites!
Overall there are 10 million ‘problem drinkers’ (meaning drunkards), in the USA. If all this is true with 70 million veritable angels (‘Born-Again’) in their midst, then it gives a lie to Paul’s “a little leaven leaveneth the whole” (1 Cor. 5:6). Here in the Christian West not even one third can ferment the loaf. Strange!
Unusual reasoning
St. Luke, though he was never one of the elected twelve disciples of Christ, holds numerous distinctions according to Christians. Among them, the ‘most historical’, the beloved ‘physician’, etc. As a Physician, his theory of men ‘Sleeping for Sorrow’ is unique. Cries and waitings, sobs and sorrows were in abundance from Jerusalem to Gethsemane on the lips of Jesus which would shock and alert to wakefulness any un-ebriated person. Why were the ‘lullabies’ of woe, lulling the disciples to slumber? Was their psychological make-up any different from that of twentieth century man? Professors of physiology opine that under shock, stress and fear the adrenal gland secretes a hormone into the bloodstream - nature’s own injection - which chases away all sleep. Is it not possible that the disciples of Jesus had eaten too much and drunk too much: remembering that food and drink was all ‘on the house,’ i.e. free!
Jesus had doubly miscalculated regarding the enthusiasm demonstrated by the disciples in that upper-room. Believing that he would only have to contend with the Jews in a clandestine arrest.
The Jews were more wily then he had thought. They brought with them Roman soldiers. The Christian scholars are no less wily in their translations and manipulations of the Bible. They have changed the words ‘Roman soldiers’ to simply ‘soldiers’ and from the word soldiers to now ‘band of men’ and ‘the guard’.
“Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh there with lanterns and torches and weapons” (John 18:3)
- ‘Band of men’ here and in verse 12 following, the words in the so-called original manuscripts are speira and chiliarchos respectively. Both Roman military terms, meaning ‘cohort’ and ‘tribune’. ‘That John is the first Evangelist to mention Roman soldiers among the party which went out to arrest our Lord...’ See Knox’s - ‘A New Testament Commentary’, page 260.
The disciples were caught as the Englishman would say with their ‘pants down’. Literally they were caught napping. The enemy trod over them roughshod. Only one of the soldiers of Christ had the presence of mind to ask “Master, shall we smite them with the sword?” (Luke 22:49)
But before Jesus could attempt a reply, the impetuous Peter struck out with his sword and cut off the right ear of one of the enemy. Jesus had not anticipated Roman soldiers. Realising that the tables were turned against his misconceived strategy, he advises his disciples “Put up again thy sword into its place; for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword” (Matthew 26:52)
- ‘Pants down’: A figure of speech, meaning caught in an unguarded moment; unawares.
Change of strategy
Did Jesus not know the truth of this statement when he ordered his disciples to sell their garments and buy Swords? He surely did! Then why the contradiction now? There is really no contradiction! The situation changes, so the strategy must also change. He had sense enough to realise that against trained and well-equipped Roman soldiers it would be suicidal for his sleepy warriors to offer even a pretence of resistance.
Why do not the Christian controversialists give their ‘Lord and Master’ credit for this simple common-sense? Because they have been programmed for a period of two thousand years that Jesus, the ‘lamb’, the ‘prince of peace’, couldn’t harm a fly. They overlook the other side of his nature which demanded blood and fire! They forget his instructions to his soldiers regarding those of his enemies who would not like him to rule over them, to bring them forth “and Slay them before me” (Luke 19:27)
“Think not that I am come to send peace on earth; I came not to send peace, but a sword” (Matthew 10:34)
“I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled? Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, NAY; but rather division” (Luke 12:49 & 51)
In view of these solemn pronouncements and his repeated vitriolic outbursts against the learned men of his time, if the sword of Peter had prevailed, we would have witnessed a massacre without compunction, equal to that of his ancestor Joshua (meaning Jehova - Saviour) who utterly destroyed all that was in Jericho “both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the Sword” (Joshua 6:21)
And the Gospel writers would not have been slow in putting words into the mouth of Jesus, word for word, as fulfilment of prophecies vaticinium ex eventu (prophecies after the event) as recorded3 of his ‘father’ David.
- His ‘father’s’ record: ‘The conquered Ammonites he treated with even greater ferocity, tearing and hewing some of them in pieces with harrows, axes, and saws; and roasting others in brick-kilns’. Maitlands comment on 2 Samuels Chs. 8 to 12 in ‘Jewish Literature and Modern Education’.
- Joshua: a type of Christ, says C.I. Scofield, D.D. in his Bible commentary.
Failure, and trial
The march on Jerusalem had fizzled out. The sabre-rattling in the Garden had proved abortive. As there is a reward for success, likewise there is a price for failure. The odds are heavy! Hence the trial, the tribulation, the turmoil and the sweat and blood.
With heavy hands, the Roman soldiers dragged Jesus from Gethsemane to Annas, and from Annas to Caiphas the High Priest, and on to the Sanhedrin as directed by the Jews, for trial and execution. Whilst Jesus was being manhandled and buffeted towards his doom, where were his heroes who were beating their breasts with the war-cry: ‘Master, we are prepared to die for you. Master, we are prepared to go to prison for you!’ St. Mark, the first of the Gospel writers, unashamedly and without any apology reveals “And they all forsook him, and fled” (Mark 14:50)
The authors of the 27 books of the New Testament could not find a similar dastardly desertion in the Jewish Bible (The Old Testament) to fulfill prophecy. If there was, they would have been quick to exploit it.
In a debate between Islam and Christianity, on SABC TV one of the participants, claiming to be ‘reborn’, gloated over the word desertion. He articulated the word with such relish DESERTION which must have left a taste of triumph in the mouth of the cultists, instead of the bitterness of shame and defeat. The Bible thumpers have developed a new sickness of glamorising despicably and ignominy. Everyone, male or female, of these cultists, will not fail to relate their peccadillos, their adulteries and bestialities, their drinking and drugging. It appears that one must have been part of the dregs of humanity to become a candidate for this ‘born again’ cult.
Trials of Jesus
In the history of the world, there is no parallel of such a contemptible betrayal. From the beginning to the end, Jesus received the most shabby response from his chosen ones. Professor Momerie succinctly sums up the ‘Disciples’ and their response to the Master: ‘His immediate disciples were always misunderstanding him and his works. Wanting him to declare himself king of the Jews, wanting him to call down fire from heaven,.’
a. If Muhammad was the ‘Most Influential Man in History’ (Michael M. Hart);
b. If Muhammad was the ‘Most Successful of all Religious Personalties’ (Encyclopaedia Britannica 11th Ed);
c. If Muhammad was the ‘Greatest Leader of all Times’ (Jules Masserman in the ‘TIME’ Magazine);
d. If Muhammad was the ‘Greatest Man that ever Lived’ (Lamartine in his ‘History of the Turks’);
Then it can be claimed with justification that Jesus Christ was the ‘most unfortunate of all of God’s Messengers’.
The disciples of Jesus always misunderstood him. His nation, the Jews, always misrepresented his utterances, and his so-called followers are always misinterpreting his teachings, even to this day. If Jesus were a Japanese instead of being a Jew, he would most assuredly have committed honourable ‘hara-kiri’ (suicide) rather than endure the fickleness and infidelity of his followers.
Predetermined judgement
The fate of Jesus was already sealed. Caiphas the High Priest, at the head of the Sanhedrin (a Religious Board of Jewish Deputies), was a man who would have recused himself in any civilised Court-of-Law, because of his prejudice against the defendant. He had already condemned Jesus to death without any hearing. He had recommended to his Council, even before the case that “it is expedient for us that one man die for the people, and the whole nation perish not” (John 11:50).
Jesus had to be liquidated! There was no question of right or wrong; Justice or injustice; it was ‘expedient’! The trial was a farce. By hook or by crook they would have Jesus convicted and done away with. In the middle of the night, what we might call at 2 o’clock in the morning, the Jews had mustered up false witnesses to testify against Jesus. A trial, past midnight was against Jewish practice; but who cares? Despite sympathetic and encouraging prosecutors and jurors, the false witnesses could not tally in their evidences.
It was too much for Jesus. He could not hold his peace. He had to remonstrate. He made a telling plea in his own defence, saying “I speak openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews always gather; and in secret have I said nothing” (John 18:20)
In essence, he said that he expounded no secret or esoteric doctrines. He did not teach anything in private which he would not be prepared to proclaim in public. In which case, the Jews would have been able to line up an army of witnesses to testify against him. But what a farce! The Jews could not get even two to agree in their allegations! “But neither did their witness agree together” (Mark 14:59)
His argument was so potent that an officer standing by was provoked to strike him in silence. Did that intimidate Jesus? No! Instead, he protested further “if I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil. But if well, why smitest thou me?” (John 18:23)
The victim was slipping out from between their fingers. It was now or never. Legally they could not incriminate him. Direct intervention was necessary. The High Priest interjects with a side thrust. Tell us then “Art thou the Christ, the son of the Blessed? And Jesus said, I am” (Mark 14:61-62)
- It reminds one of the 5000 (so-called original) Greek Manuscripts of the New Testament of which ‘No two are perfect duplicates’, say the Jehovah’s Witnesses. The ‘cultists’ are now claiming the discovery of a staggering 24 thousand Manuscripts; to which of course the same stricture will apply. read ‘Is the Bible God’s Word?’ for further information.
‘Son of god’ - No blasphemy
There was nothing blasphemous or treasonable in the simple avowal of Jesus. ‘Christ’ is the Greek translation of the Hebrew word ‘Messiah,’ which meant the Anointed one or the Apointed one. Nowhere was the word Christ equated with God. We must divorce this notion from the paganised Christian doctrine of the incarnation, wherein God becomes man. The Jewish expectation of a Messiah, did not identify the Messiah with God.
Indeed, the nature of Jewish monotheism wholely excludes such pagan connotations. ‘Son of God’ is also another harmless expression in Jewish theology. God seems to have sons by the tons in the Jewish Bible. But if you are looking for trouble, you do not have to go far. you will find it round the corner. The High Priest was exultant. He felt that his rapier thrust had ripped open the defence of Jesus. To dramatise his contrived victory, he began renting his clothes.
“What need have we for any further witnesses? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death” (Mark 14:63-64)
- ‘Christ’: For further references, see ‘Christ in Islam’ in which you will get Biblical quotations of ‘priests’ and ‘pots’ and ‘pans’ and ‘pagans’ who are called Christs!
Guilty or not guilty - ‘Jesus must die!’
The Jews falsely charged that Jesus had blasphemed, which is like treason in the spiritual realm. The Christians are ‘One’ with the Jews regarding this ‘blasphemy’ of Jesus, but contend that he was not guilty, because as God, he was entitled to ‘blaspheme’ - it was no blasphemy. Between the two (Jews and Christians) they want poor Jesus to die. One for ‘Good riddance’ and the other for ‘good redemption’.
The verdict was quick and unanimous. It was cut and dried! But without the Roman consent, they could not hang him. In the morning they took their victim to Pontius Pilate, because, as they said “It is not lawful for us (Jews) to put any man to death” (John 18:31)
On discovering that Jesus was a Galilaean, the most troublesome of his subjects, Pilate felt it advisable to ‘pass the buck’ to Herod (Luke 23:7)
You remember, the oldest game in the world. It started in the Garden of Eden according to the Christian Scriptures. But it did not work. After a fruitless attempt to elicit co-operation from Jesus, Herod sends him back to Pilate.
The Jews had condemned Jesus for blasphemy. A man claiming to be God, they alleged. This would not hold water before Pilate. He had his man-Gods beyond counting. His Jupiter and Pluto, his Vulcan and Eros, his Mars and Neptune, his Appollo and Zeus, to name just a few out of his Pantheon. One more, or one less, would not make any difference to him. This the Jews very well knew. So they changed their charge from blasphemy to treason. They began accusing “we found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ, a King” (Luke 23:2)
Second false charge
The charge was absolutely false. Contrary to what they are alleging, he had said, on the subject of taxation “Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God, the things that are God’s” (Matthew 22:21)
What is subversive about this? Like the Christians (The Christians equate the word ‘Christ’ to ‘A God!’), the Jews too, before them had invented a new meaning for the word ‘Christy,’ viz. ‘A King!’ So that he could be more easily presented as a challenge to their Roman overlords. Pilate got the message. But this poor man, meek and passive, seemed to be no threat. He did not look like a Zealot, a political agitator, a subversive person, a terrorist!
Incredulously he asks Jesus “art thou the King of the Jews?”... Jesus answered him, “my kingdom is not of this world, if my Kingdom was of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my Kingdom not from hence” (John 18:33-36)
A masterful defence! No Q.C. could have done a better job. As a man of God, he could not disavow his religious status. His was a spiritual Kingdom, a ruler to rescue his nation from sin and formalism. This was all nonsense to the Roman Governor. The man may be deluded, mad; but of no danger to the State. He was on no collision course with Rome. Pilate goes to the waiting Jews and delivers an unequivocal verdict “I find in him no fault at all!” (John 18:38)
Though Matthew, Mark, Luke and John are supposed to be writing independent records on the life of Jesus, it is astonishing that the Synoptists, the first three had never heard the words - ‘My Kingdom is not of this world’ - at all. If God dictated these words exclusively to John, or if he had been informed by some witness, then these words must have escaped the lips of Jesus. A most telling defence against the false allegation of the Jews. How did these words reach any ear, without Jesus opening his mouth?
- Q.C. Means Queen’s Counsellor, previously K.C. (King’s Counsellor) The highest legal representative in English Court-of-Law.
- Synoptists: meaning one-eyed; looking from one angle.
The hot gospellers are getting hoarse in the throat, singing and shouting, that Jesus was led “to the slaughter like a lamb, like a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth” (Isaiah 53:7)
Poor deluded souls, they hymn songs “Hy het sy monde nie oop gemaak nie! Hy het sy monde nie oop gemaak nie!’ (And he opened not his mouth).
Now, an Attorney at Law, claiming to be ‘reborn’ has joined the chorus of Bible- thumpers with the same senseless repetition. Let me quote, word for word from his Book, to enable you to diagnose this new sickness of cultism to which even people having undergone a dicipline of Law are not immune. He says; ‘Isaiah predicts about Jesus Christ:’ He would not defend himself at his trial (Jesus did not): ‘He opened not his mouth’.
When you meet these cultists in the flesh, please ask them, ‘Did Jesus speak with his mouth closed?’ How did the following utterances which are attributed to Jesus, escape his lips without him opening his mouth:
A. Before Pontius Pilate “My Kingdom is not of this world” (John 18:36)
B. Before the Sanhedrin “If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil, but if well, why smitest thou me?” (John 18:23)
C. Before God in the Garden “O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away” (Matthew 26:39)
We Muslims believe in the many, many miracles of Jesus, but we would be reluctant to believe that he dabbled in ventriloquism. Again and again, whenever the need arose, during his trials and tribulations, Jesus opened his mouth with telling effect, ‘according to the Scriptures’. But for those who refuse to see or hear, we can only seek solace in the words of the Master “they seeing, see not; and hearing, they hear not, neither do they understand” (Matthew 13:13)
- Ventriloquism: The art of speaking, or uttering sounds in such a manner that the voice appears to come from some other source than the speaker, like Charlie McCarthy and his doll.
The blackmail
In the case under discussion, Pilate finds Jesus - Not guilty! His implacable enemies, blackmail Pilate, saying “If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar’s friend; whosoever maketh himself a King speaketh agaist Caesar” (John 19:12)
While the trial was under way, Pilate’s wife sends him a message “Have thou nothing to do with that just man (Jesus); for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him” (Matthew 27:19)
As reluctant as Pilate was to condemn an innocent and harmless subject, and despite the pleadings of his dear wife based on supernatural visions, he could not prevail against Jewish pressure. He was forced to give in to the Jewish clamour of “’Crucify him, crucify him!’ ‘Pilate took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man’” (Matthew 27:24)
You are culpable for this unjust crime. And he handed Jesus over to be crucified.
Origins of crucifixion
Crucifixion was the common mode of eliminating political prisoners, murderers and insurgents. Long before the birth of Jesus, the Phoenecians had experimented with various methods to get rid of their anti-social characters. They had tried hanging, impaling, stoning, drowning, etc. But all these were too quick in their effects; the culprits expired too soon for their liking. So they invented the crucifixion, a system which produced a slow Lingering death.
The Romans borrowed and perfected the system. They developed a crucifixion for fast death and disposal, and another for a slow death and disposal.
The Christian Masters (great artists like Michael Angelo, Rembrandt, Leonardo Da Vinci, etc) are confused in their paintings of the gruesome scene. They portray the two robbers (Mark 15:27 - ‘lestes’ in the original. Alternatively translated as ‘thieves’ or ‘brigandas’ is actually a derogatory term for ‘Zealot.’ These ‘crossmates’ of Jesus were not common thieves or crooks. They were the terrorists of their day, heroes of their nation) who were simultaneously crucified with Jesus, his ‘crossmates’, one on his right hand and the other on his left hand, as undergoing the fast method, whereas Jesus himself is painted as undergoing a SLOW process.
The Romans never combined these two different methods. They were never confused, as the Christian artists were, with the fast and the slow methods. The Old Masters have painted hybrid crosses (mixture) of the ‘fast’ and ‘slow’ methods in their drawings of Jesus’ bodily supports on the cross - i.e. with Sadile or without sadile either nails or leather thongs to bind the arms to the crossbar; and, either platforms to support the feet, or spikes.
- Sadile: Obviously a saddle, or ‘horn’ which was fitted in the middle of the upright piece of the cross, so that it projected between victim’s legs at the crotch to support his body-weight, but for aesthetic reasons the Christian fathers have eliminated the ‘horn’ from the cross.
The gospel untruth
Contrary to common belief, Jesus was not nailed to the cross, but bound, if at all, like the other two. In the light of the knowledge available, we must regard the ‘Doubting Thomas’ episode as a flagrant ‘gospel fabrication’, similar to the story of the woman caught in the act of adultery. Note that John chapter 8, begins with verse 12.
Can you imagine any chapter in any religious Book beginning with verse 12 as the first verse? Verses 1 to 11 are expunged as a fabrication by the 32 Christian Scholars of the highest eminence, backed by 50 co-operating denominations in their ‘Most up to date Version of the Bible’- the R.S.V.
- R.S.V. stands for Revised Standard Version, first published in 1952. The translators claimed to have had access to the ‘Most Ancient Manuscripts’ from which they learnt that the story about the adulteress was a fabrication. See ‘Is the Bible God’s Word?’ for further information on the R.S.V.
The Jews were in extreme haste to have Jesus done away with. Remember the midnight trial? Early in the morning, they dragged him to Pilate. From Pilate to Herod. From Herod back to Pilate. According to a boisterous American (another ‘born-again’) there were ‘six’ trials within twelve hours. At the busiest time in Jerusalem, around the Feast of the Passover, it appears from the Gospel narratives that people of worth had nothing else to do but twiddle their thumbs in great expectation of interviewing Jesus. Exactly as things happen on the ‘set’, for the shooting of films. Hurry! hurry! hurry!
According to the Gospel writers, the Jews and the Romans managed to have Jesus on the cross by the 6th hour, that is by 12 noon; and by the 9th hour (Matthew 27:46. 32), that is, by 3 o’clock he had given up the ghost - he had died (?). Strange people, these Jews! As much as they were in a hurry to mount Jesus on the cross, no sooner had they succeeded, they were once more agitated to bring him down. Can you imagine why?
Their religious scruples -the Sabbath! They were warned in the ‘fifth Book of Moses’ “His body (any crucified person) shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shah in any wise bury him that day, (for he that is hanged is accursed of God), that thy land be not defiled, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance” (Deuteronomy 21:23)
To appease the religious scruples of the Jews (or for any other reason) if it became necessary to expedite death on the cross, the executioners resorted to the ‘cruri- fragium’, a club like horror with which the legs were broken. The victim expired by suffocation within the hour. This was the fast method.
This drawing is an attempt at a more accurate representation of the ‘execution’ of Jesus. To check his ideas the artist Charles Pickard, actually manoeuvred himself into this position.
God’s ways are not our ways
Was the prayer of Jesus being answered? He had cried (O the loving father in heaven for help, with strong crying and tears “And being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood falling down to the ground” (Luke 22:44)
What can be expected from such heart-felt prayer and importuning? One of the four brothers. The Christians give brothers and sisters to Jesus, through a union of Mary with Joseph the Carpenter. (Matthew 13:55-56) of Jesus reminds us that “The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much” (James 5:16)
Such heartfelt prayers! Such blood-curdling cries! Such sorrow and sobs! A cynic remarked that it would even bring God down from His Throne. (God Almighty does not go up or down He is Omnipresent. All-Prevading. Present everywhere!)
God accepted Jesus’ prayers
Paul confirms that his supplications did not fall on deaf ears “Who, in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared” (Hebrews 5:7)
What does it mean ‘God heard’ his prayers! It means that God accepted his prayers. God Almighty is not deaf at any time. He is the All-Hearing God. He heard (accepted) the supplication of Jesus in the same way that He had heard (accepted) the prayer of father Abraham. Abraham, in his old-age had prayed for a son, and Ishmael was born. The words of Abraham had become flesh. Ishmael literally means ‘God heard’, in Hebrew. Zakariah also in his old-age prayed for a son, and God heard (accepted) his prayers, and John the Baptist was born. Now Jesus cried for help, and God heard (accepted) his prayers:
“And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him” (Luke 22:43)
Strengthening him in the faith, in the hope that God will save him. This is actually what he was beseeching God to do for him. When and how rests alone in the Hands of God. His ways are not our ways. Count the blessings so far:
a) An assurance from Heaven.
b) Pilate finds him, not guilty!
c) His wife shown a dream in which she is told that no harm should come to Jesus.
d) Legs not broken!
e) In a hurry to bring him down from the cross.
The fourth above: ‘and they brake not his legs’, we are told was in fulfilment of a prophecy “He keepeth all his bones, not one of them is broken” (Psalm 34:20)
If the bones of a victim were to be protected from harm, then they could only be of benefit if the person was alive! For a person, already dead, intact bones mean nothing. Whether they are sawed into pieces, or smashed into smithereens, it will not make any difference to the resurrected body, the spirit or the ghost. But for living persons on the cross (like the ‘crossmates’ of Jesus), the breaking of the legs made all the difference between life and death. The pagan Romans were not hell-bound to fulfil any prophecy. Their reason was that they “saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs” (John 19:33)
‘saw’ is a very simple word. We may yet ask, what did they see? Could it be the fulfilment of the words of Christ “seeing, ye shall see and shall not perceive” (Matthew 13:14)
When John says that the soldiers ‘saw’, he means that they surmised. For no modern-day stethoscope was used to verify death; nor did anyone touch his body or feel his pulse before concluding that ‘he was dead already’. I see in the word ‘saw’ another step in God’s plan of rescue.
Resurrections daily! Stranger than fiction
With all the advancements in the Medical field since Christ; with all the modern, scientific instruments at our disposal; hundreds of people are being certified ‘dead’, every day all over the world. Whilst busy writing this, my attention is being drawn to the near murder of a Mr. Barnabas who was being carried to the mortuary after being ‘declared clinically dead’. Not by inexperienced ancient Roman soldiers, but by highly-qualified Medical men.
The news item is reproduced on the side, as is, as a New Year ‘84 shock! This with another shocker from Ripley’s: ‘believe it or not!’ is also reproduced at the end of this book, with a suggestion that some young journalist keep his eyes open for people who have come back from the ‘dead’, and write an anthology, which might willingly become a best seller. Here is a list for a start - What would you say?Resurrected or resuscitated?
1. Little girl who ‘died’ tells how she came back to life (after 4 days) - ‘Daily News’ 15/11/55
2. Man died for two hours: Still lives - ‘Miracle’ amazes doctors - ‘Sunday Tribune’ 27/3/60
3. He died for 4 minutes - Man’s heart stops but he lives on - ‘Sunday Express’ 23/7/61
4. He does not know that he died for 90 seconds - ‘Cape Argus’ 16/3/61
5. Dr. hitge returned from the dead - ‘cape argus’ 4/5/61
6. The coffin moved - Young man narrowly escaped being buried alive - ‘Sunday Tribune’ 13/5/62
7. Back from the dead - After being thought dead for 2 days - ‘Post’ 25/7/65
8. ‘Corpse’ winks at undertaker - Doctor wrote out a death certificate - ‘Daily News’ 25/3/75
9. ‘Clinically dead’ - Toddler alive after hour-long revival battle -’natal mercury’ 5/12/82
10. Was he dead or alive? - The dilemma facing transplant doctors - ‘Sunday Tribune’ 17/7/83
11. Shaken and stirred - Declared clinically dead ‘from too much Christmas liquor’ - ‘Daily News’ 3/1/84
This sombre list would be incomplete without the picture of an exclusive club, the only qualification of whose membership is - to have died and lived again! If everything happened to Jesus ‘according to the scriptures’, then, he could easily become its doyen (Senior member of a body).
Sympathy for Jesus
God works in a mysterious way. He inspires the soldiers to think that the victim is ‘dead already’ so as not to break his legs, but at the same time inspires another to lance him on the side (the ‘side’ of his body and not the front) with a spear, and... “forthwith came there out blood and watery” (John 19:34)
It is a Blessing of God that when the human body cannot endure further pain or agony, unconsciousness supervenes. But immobility, fatigue and the unnatural stance on the cross must have slowed down the blood-circulation. The lancing came to the rescue. By ‘blood-letting’, the circulation could regain its rhythm. We are assured in the Encyclopedia Biblica, under article ‘cross,’ column 960, that ‘Jesus was alive when the spear was thrust’. This also confirms the statement of John that the flow of ‘water and blood’ was instantaneous. In his own words he says: ‘forthwith’ – straight away, immediately, which was a sure sign that Jesus was alive!
But why the ‘Water and the Blood’? Dr. W.B. Primrose, a Senior Anaesthetist of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, gave his expert opinion: In the ‘Thinkers Digest’, London, Winter 1949 issue, he said that ‘The water was a result of the nervous upset of the blood vessels locally due to the over-stimulating effect of the scourging by staves’. This may be an extreme case, but so was his sweating, like ‘great drops of blood, falling down to the ground’, when Jesus was in agony in the Garden of Gethsemane. Medical authorities also confirm the latter phenomenon.
Evangelists differ
The Gospel-writers are not unanimous regarding the time when Jesus was hoisted onto the cross. But John tells us that Jesus was still before Pilate in the praetorium at 12 noon “and about the sixth hour (Hebrew time), he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your King!” (John 19:14)
And after much wrangling he was handed over for crucifixion. Imagine the disorderly mob, the heavy cross which Jesus himself is supposed to have been loaded with. The long climb to Gol’gotha could never have been accomplished in minutes. And the saddling, the tying and the lifting must have taken some time. On TV shots, they can do it all in 30 seconds! But we know that in real life it does not happen that fast. The author of John’s Gospel failed to record the time when ‘Jesus gave up the ghost’ (John 19:30), but the synoptists seem to be agreed that it was around the ‘ninth hour’, meaning 3 p.m.
- Dean Farrar, in his ‘Life of Christ’, says on page 421, that ‘Jesus was on the cross for only three hours - when taken down’.
We are told in the Gospels, in varying terms, that between the ‘sixth’ and the ‘ninth’ hours, there was thunder, an eclipse and an earthquake! - Without purpose? No, to disperse the sadistic mob after their enjoyment of a Roman holiday. To enable the hands of mercy, his ‘secret’ and faithful disciples, to come to his succor.
Joseph of Arimathe’a together with a sympathetic Roman centurion who had declared “Truly this man was the Son of God” (Mark 15:39), went to Pilate to claim the body of Jesus, and “Pilate marvelled if he were already dead, and to him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead” (Mark 15:44)
What was the reason for Pilate’s amazement? Why did he marvel? He knew from experience that normally no man would die within 3 hours on the cross, unless the ‘crurifragium’ was resorted to, which was not done in the case of Jesus; unlike in that of his ‘crossmates’, who were given the treatment because they were still alive!
Reason for marvelling
It stands to reason, that if a man faces a firing squad, and shots are fired into his body, and he dies, there would be nothing to ‘marvel’ about. If a person is taken to the gallows and is hanged, and he dies, there is nothing to ‘marvel’ ‘that just man’? Was he not blackmailed into surrendering to Jewish clamour? So if Jesus was alive - Good Luck to him. Pilate grants permission for Joseph to have the body.
The so-called disciples of Jesus, whom he called ‘my mother and brethren!’ (Matthew 12:49, Mark 15:47) In preference to his own mother and his uterinal brothers and sisters, were nowhere in sight when he was most in need. His ‘secret’) Mark 15:47.: ‘He is alive! He is alive! They knew that the Jews would then make doubly sure that that life was snuffed out.
Why the inverted commas ‘ ’?
Jews suspicious and uneasy. We must not suppose that Jesus was buried 6 feet underground. The sepulchre was a big, airy chamber and not a grave. Jim Bishop (a Christian authority of note), in his book ‘The Day Christ Died,’ gives the dimensions as 5 feet wide by 7 feet high by 15 feet deep, with a ledge or ledges inside, which any ‘pondokkie’ dweller in our slums would have been happy to own as his residence. The Jews were suspicious. It was all very ‘fishy.’
a) The tomb within easy reach.
b) Helping hands of his ‘secret’ disciples.
c) His ‘crossmates’ still alive.
d) His legs not broken, whereas those of his ‘cross)” (Matthew 27:62-64)
The Jews are talking about ‘first’ and ‘last’,; go your way, make it as sure as ye can” (Matthew 27:65)
He was not going to pander to their whim. He had more than enough reasons to hate them.
- From the word ‘watch’ in the King James Version of the Bible, and ‘guard’ of the Roman Catholic Version; the 32 Christian scholars of the R.SV. have now interpolated the words, ‘of soldiers’ after the word ‘guard’, reading ‘guard of soldiers’. There is no end to Christian theological ingenuity! As was discussed earlier; the revisers have now re-revised the R.S.V. and have re-inserted the spicy verses about the women ‘caught in the act’ once more into their 1971 Version.
What the Jews did or did not do after Pilate’s curt reply is immaterial. They had already lost a day! But the Christian cultists clutching at straws, transform the Jewish temple ‘guard’ to soldiers, and make these ‘soldiers’ into ‘Roman’ ‘error’ that the Jews made in wanting to eliminate Jesus? The first was that they had permitted Jesus to be brought down from the cross without breaking his legs, under the false assumption that he had died. The last would be to allow the ‘secret’ disciples of Jesus to render help to the wounded man, by not sealing off the tomb. But in the meantime, they made another mistake by approaching Pilate the ‘next’ day which was too late! God works in a mysterious way. His Ways are not our ways. He says “And (the unbelievers) plotted and planned, and Allah too planned, and the best of planners is Allah” (Quran 3:54).

Hokuto prime minister declares war, announcing that Touto is hoarding Pandora’s Box for nefarious purposes.
Touto tries to evacuate its people, but the city on fire.
Over at the lab, Sento locks something away before joining Ryuga, Misora and Sawa upstairs. As they are watching the news, Touto forces barge in and take Sento and Ryuga into custody upon orders from the government that Kamen Riders will be used military weapons against the Hokuto army.
They are brought to Gentoku who is at Touto command center. He tells them about Hokuto Smash appearing all over Touto and that Hokuto has a secret, uber-powerful weapon. That’s why they’re after Pandora’s Box.
Gentoku explains that Pandora’s Box had six panels, each with 10 FullBottles. So they will need those 60 FullBottles to open the Box. The 40 Bottles not in Touto were somehow purified with Hokuto and Seito each having the remaining panels and 20 FullBottles. So the three territories, in theory, must cooperate to open the Box. Instead Hokuto has chosen to use force and Gentoku says it’s only a matter of time before Seito makes their move as well.
Gentoku wants Sento and Ryuga to protect the Box. Sento refuses to be used as a weapon of war, but Gentoku reminds him that it was he who started all of this in the first place.
Gentoku offers to grant both Sento and Ryuga a pardon for all their crimes if they can drive Hokuto back to their side of the wall.
Sento refuses. Gentoku tells them they have no choice. He gives them both tracking bracelets they must wear that will also serve as a line of direct communication.
Hokuto’s PM meets with Seito’s PM to talk of an alliance against Touto. He agrees. But after he leaves, she admits to Blood Stark that she only wants to keep Seito in check until she defeats Touto. She anticipates being able to obtain Pandora’s Box for herself so she can have world domination.
She asks Soichi where “Grease” and the others are. Soichi says they should be retrieving the FullBottles now.
Later, Sento is able to remove his bracelet. But Ryuga does not. Just then, three guys appear and ask if they’ve been injected with Nebula Gas.
They introduce themselves as Hokuto’s Three Crows. After Ryuga calls them morons, the tall one morphs into a Smash. Sento and Ryuga are surprised that he retains awareness even as a Smash and the guy explains that they are Hard Smash.
After Ryuga henshins, the other two also morph into Smash. Sento quickly henshins and joins the fight. But the three Hard Smash are too much for both Sento and Ryuga. They are both forced to dehenshin.
The Three Crows demand they hand over the FullBottles, but as they argue about who will actually collect them, Sento and Ryuga manage to slip away.
Back at the lab, Sento and Ryuga realize those three are Hokuto’s secret weapons. Ryuga wonders what they should do, but Sento says it is none of their business.
Ryuga takes out the ultimate system Sento just finished. Sento says it is the Sclash Driver, changing the contents of FullBottles into jelly and able to draw the element’s maximum power. Dragon was the only element that reacted to the driver. But Sento says Ryuga cannot use it.
Sento regrets completing the driver since it will surely become a military weapon in the end. Sento says that’s why Katsuragi, he, didn’t originally finish it.
“War is wrong,” Sento says. But Ryuga thinks it’s only an excuse so Sento can just run away.
Ryuga says he is going to fight, especially if it means his name will be cleared. He promised that to Kasumi.
Sawa comes down to the lab, worried about Misora who has not yet returned after going out a while ago. Sento and Ryuga go out to look for her.
Misora walks through the rubble of a now-war torn city. Bodies all over the streets, children crying over their dead mothers. It’s hell.
Ryuga is at an evacuation center when a Smash suddenly appears. A strange man in a winter coat who had been mumbling strange things since Ryuga got here jumps down and finishes off the Smash with one punch. He has a FullBottle, but Ryuga does not see.
Just then, Gentoku calls Ryuga on his bracelet. Gentoku wants to know where Sento is, wanting to check up on the progress of the new Driver. Ryuga says Sento has it, but will not use it. Gentoku says only the new Driver can defeat the Hard Smash.
Ryuga says he doesn’t take orders from Gentoku and hangs up.
Meanwhile, Sento finds Misora as she looks across the city burning to the ground. She feels guilty for her part in creating this deadly military weapon and thus helping to start this war for the Box. She feels this is all her fault.
Misora tries to rip the bracelet from her wrist, but she cannot. She repeatedly slams her wrist on the ground. Sento stops her and pulls her into an embrace. He tells her this is not her fault, but his.
The Three Crows appear, applauding the emotional moment. They morph into Smash and demand the FullBottles.
Sento says Misora made him realize that he can’t just sit on his high horse. He must fight to protect her and the city and to stop this war. The Rider System isn’t a weapon and he will prove that it is meant for justice.
Sento henshins to Sparkling. The Three Crows knock him around, but Sento is resolved. He says he will rise up as many times as he needs to.
Ryuga arrives and he has the Sclash Driver. Sento says not to use it, but Ryuga activates it. A strong current surges through his body before he henshins to Cross-Z Charge.
Ryuga feels an immense new power. Sento suggests he uses Twin Breaker which unleashes a powerful weapon on his arm. Ryuga is able to deliver different attacks to the Three Crows and that provides an opening for him and Sento kick them out of Smash mode.
The Three Crows drop some of the FullBottles and Sento and Ryuga pick them up.
Just then, the strange man from earlier appears. The Three Crows acknowledge him as their Boss. And he has a Driver!
Episode Thoughts
Wow! Now that was a very dramatic episode. I really enjoyed that. There was a sense of gravity to the situation at hand. Especially when they start the episode off with all those bullets and explosions and dead mothers. It reminded me of the last arc of Gaim and when everything really went to hell. Everyone evacuated, Zawame was in ruins, the country/world was in chaos. And we’re only on episode 17 here on Build!
It was definitely an episode that helped to kind of give a buffer to Sento after the big reveal of his identity. Or at least, his real identity for now. Him and Misora questioning their part in starting the war by way of fully developing the Rider system and the FullBottles was a good way to serve as this in between from the big twist/reveal and this next arc, I assume, as we get these new characters coming in.
Again, as I don’t follow toy catalogs and other kinds of spoilers, I didn’t know that the new Rider was coming up this episode. And I’m not sure if he’s here to stay, but I assume since he is a secondary Rider that he will be around for the rest of the season. Should be interesting to see how that develops. Especially with the Three Musketeers tagging along.
We got an explanation of how Pandora’s Box is supposed to work this episode. They need to fill all the panels with FullBottles so they can actually open the box and unleash the power. That should be good enough material for the next couple of episodes I assume.
But aside from the great chaotic war scenes, I was definitely more interested in the character beats in this episode. I really like the moment between Sento and Misora. That guilt they feel can be a nice foundation for some really great material if they choose to explore it. And seeing Ryuga’s little dilemma as well is also another great way to explore his own feelings. Well within his character as we know him. Also great to see Sawa course.
Interesting to see the prime minister of Hokuto just go full-on crazy. And I wouldn’t be surprised if Soichi Stark is just manipulating her to get to his own endgame. I have no doubts that she is not long for this season. Lol She also definitely took over the crazy quota for this episode away from Gentoku. Lol
Overall I really enjoyed this episode. It was very exciting and action packed. And again I definitely enjoyed seeing some nice character beats from Sento, Ryuga and Misora.A combination of a scientific phenomenon, nutrients and dietary supplements might improve the fertility rates of both men and women.
Recent studies have suggested chronobiology, the science of studying how cycles of time impact many facets of human health, can play a crucial role in determining if and how effective both men and women will be when deciding to try and conceive a child.
How Does Chronobiology Relate to Fertility?
The crux of the argument put forth by proponents of chronobiology-based fertility is that people are more likely to conceive when they attempt to do so during specific periods of time, as well as under the right circumstances. In addition, it is also believed individual fertility can be maximized during such cycles if they ingest vitamin and chemical supplements said to improve fertility.
Women and Chronobiology-Based Fertility
It is well-known women of childbearing ages experience a monthly cycle at which they are most fertile. That said, it is now believed natural bodily cycles such as the circadian rhythm (sleep-wake cycle) and seasonal rhythms can have a profound impact on a woman’s ability to become pregnant. Research has concluded that women who do not receive an adequate amount of sleep, do not operate on a typical daily schedule or do not gain enough exposure to sunlight often experience fertility difficulties.
What Types of Supplementation Should Women Receive?
Chronobiology-Based Fertility and Men
Scientific research illustrates men also have “biological clocks” that can impact their fertility levels. While a number of factors such as sperm count and age play a role in male fertility, sperm motility is arguably the most critical. Sperm motility, the ability of sperm to pass from a male’s reproductive organs into a female’s, must be high to successfully complete the conception process. A recent study found sperm motility varies throughout the calendar year. Research concluded sperm to be much more motile during the summer months of July and August. Therefore, chronobiologists suggest men seeking to conceive a child make their attempts during the summertime.
What Type of Supplementation Should Men Receive?
Some men suffer from a low rate of sperm motility regardless of the season. Medical professionals believe this condition is related to a diminished level of the hormone testosterone in their bodies. In such instances, or for men intent on conceiving during a season other than summer, a therapeutic regimen of testosterone might need to be considered.
Fertility, like many other issues, can be greatly impacted by timing. Scientific research has proven that both men and women stand a better chance to conceive if they attempt to do so at the right times and supplement their bodies with substances and nutrients known for making the process easier.Big Big Train – Empire
Incredible how Big Big Train has matured since its foundation in 1990, within 30 years this UK formation has turned into one of the leading current prog rock bands. In 2004 I wrote “that BBT has taken a giant step into the 'prog rock zone' with their new album Gathering Speed” and “at some moments BBT still sounds a bit poppy, the music is not very original”. In 2019 I wrote about the band its latest studio album Grand Tour “Big Big Train succeeds to generate a lot of excitement and delivers many interesting musical ideas, this is topped with David Longdon his excellent voice”. Well, what a stunning progress during the years! And now anno 2020 this live album entitled Empire, I was very curious, high expectations!
Well, I am blown away, what a variety, dynamics, lush instrumentation and strong, often emotional vocals. And although BBT sounds very melodic, accessible and song oriented, this is not Neo-prog, BBT sounds way more elaborate and varied. I tend to name this progressive blend of folk, rock and classical an eclectic musical approach, very tastefully arranged. My highlights.
Alive is built around a tigh mid-tempo in a cheerful melodic rock atmosphere, wonderfully embellished with majestic Mellotron violins and choirs, and soli on synthesizer and violin.
Hedgerow also delivers a tight beat but now with a folky climate featuring strong, obviously Peter Gabriel inspired vocals, and halfway moving violin work with twanging guitars, simply beautiful.
Theodora In Green and Gold contains a mellow atmosphere with tender piano intro, then warm vocals and piano, in the second part sensitive violin, and finally piano and violin, what a wonderful ballad.
The Florentine starts with acoustic rhythm guitar, warm vocals, and moving violin play, halfway a sparkling synthesizer solo, fiery guitar solo, and finally tender violin. A strong example of BBT its dynamics and variety.
The long Voyager presents all the elements of a captivating and compelling epic composition. From dreamy with warm vocals, violin and brass to a bombastic eruption with violin, intense Mellotron choirs, and piano. From a mid-tempo with a spectacular synthesizer solo, tight beats to a fiery guitar solo with organ runs and synthesizer flights. And from mellow with violin to finally bombastic with emotional vocals, Mellotron choirs and violin runs, another ‘wow moment’!
The most adventurous song on this live album is the instrumental Engines And Men featuring a catchy percussive sound, strong beats and brass, it reminds me of Sledgehammer, funny and the crowd loves it!
The final track is the epic East Coast Racer (close to 20 minutes), here BBT rises to the occasion! It begins with a dreamy piano intro, then a mid-tempo (close to Neo-prog), embellished with a Hammond sound, inspired vocals, moving violin work and vocal harmonies. The second part builds to a compelling climax featuring Mellotron choirs, violin and fiery guitar, and in the end tender piano runs, as a perfect ‘prog cooldown’, the crowd is excited, I wish I was there!
If you are up to melodic and accessible, but also elaborate and varied prog, this live CD is highly recommended, I am impressed!

Brooks plays Bernie Rose, a not-too-successful B-movie producer and a much more successful mobster considering going into business with Driver (Ryan Gosling) and his mechanic mentor (Bryan Cranston). The role has heads turning, including Oscar’s.
“I don’t know producers like Bernie,” he says. “I know very rich producers who screw you without even getting out of bed because they have lawyers and they do nasty things, and I’m not going to name names.”
“Drive” offers Brooks the opportunity to play against type to chilling effect. It’s something that, as an actor, he’s been fighting for. “I always wanted to play a different part than the normal parts, and I always felt I could do an interesting villain,” he explains. “I know that I have the ability, but you have to convince a movie studio to take out the Skarsgard and put you in. It’s hard to do that.”
But apparently “Drive” director Nicolas Winding Refn didn’t need very much convincing. “He’s saying that I was the person he always wanted. I don’t believe him,” Brooks says. “He told me that when he was a youngster he saw ‘Lost In America’ in the theater and he was scared when I yelled at my wife. So I thought that was funny.”
Don’t buy bad spaghetti
Albert Brooks is not a fan of DVD extras — and that’s putting it mildly. “These DVDs become like garbage dumps,” the veteran writer, director and actor says. “Other products don’t do this. When I buy spaghetti, I get the pound of spaghetti. I don’t get the extra half a pound where it curled up and didn’t look good, you know? If it was good enough to show you, I would’ve put it in the movie.”

Seth Heald, top left, and others with Repower REC are petitioning the Virginia State Corporation Commission for more transparency at Rappahannock Electric Cooperative. Photo courtesy of Repower REC
Find an update from Rappahannock Electric Cooperative in Emily Piontek’s December 2020 blog about how Virginians can get involved in their electric cooperatives.
Former Sierra Club Virginia Chair Seth Heald has been a member-owner of Virginia’s Rappahannock Electric Cooperative in the northeastern part of the state for more than nine years. He has become an outspoken critic of the co-op’s board of directors’ lack of transparency. Rappahannock board meetings are closed to the public, meeting minutes are not made available and board compensation is kept secret.
According to Heald, member-owners that mail in signed proxy forms are entered for a chance to win prizes, and there are typically thousands of blank ballots. The board treats each blank ballot as an invitation to vote on that member-owner’s behalf, and then selects a single candidate for all the blank ballots to count towards. Heald contends this practice — which generally determines the election outcome — is “unfair and undemocratic.”
In 2017, Rappahannock attempted a $22.2 million rate increase, which included doubling the residential grid access fee. This type of fee, which is charged regardless of how much electricity is used, disproportionately affects low-income households and discourages homeowner solar and energy efficiency improvements.
After intervention from Sierra Club Virginia and the state attorney general, the State Corporation Commission instead approved a 40 percent increase to the fixed charge, which is now $14. Deciding it was time for reform, Heald banded with other member-owners and solar advocacy organization Solar United Neighbors of Virginia to form the member-owner advocacy group Repower REC.
In April 2018, the group informed Rappahannock of their intent to put three bylaw amendments up for a vote at the co-op’s 2019 annual meeting. The amendments would open board meetings to the public, reform board election procedures and allow the public to see how much board members were paid.
But when Repower REC asked the co-op for the necessary paperwork to begin collecting the required 500 signatures to put the amendments on the ballot, the Rappahannock board of directors refused.
So, in August, three Repower REC members filed a petition with the Virginia State Corporation Commission, alleging that the co-op was breaking state law by withholding the form and by requiring the signatures at all. Rappahannock categorically denied the allegations, and the case will be heard by Virginia’s State Corporation Commission on Dec. 11.
“I’m hopeful that we will, at a minimum, get the petition form,” says Heald. “The trouble is we need to submit our petition signatures by around Feb. 1, and the 500 signatures are required to be spread fairly evenly around [the co-op’s] 22 Virginia counties.” He noted that the board’s reluctance may delay the vote on the amendments until 2020.
Soon after Heald filed the complaint, all of the 12 other electric cooperatives in Virginia intervened in the case to oppose the reforms, including Powell Valley Electric, which also serves part of Tennessee.
“I’m hopeful, I think our case is strong,” Heald says. “But it is concerning to see all of the electric co-ops in the entire state piling on to oppose some reasonable reforms from three co-op members.”
Regardless, Heald is undeterred. “This is a long process,” Heald says. “It’s not something that you can do in three months or six months — but we are growing and we’re planning to keep at it.
“If you’re not involved, then you’re leaving it to other people to control what’s happening at your utilities,” he adds. “The only way to ensure that your voice is heard is to be active and engaged and inform yourself of what’s going on, and our co-op really makes it hard to do that.” — By Kevin Ridder
CORRECTION: Dec. 20, 2018
The print version of this article incorrectly stated that the three Rappahannock Electric member-owners filed a lawsuit against their co-op. They filed a petition with the Virginia State Corporation Commission.
CORRECTION: Dec. 21, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly identified Seth Heald as a current Sierra Club Virginia Chair. Heald stepped down from this position in 2017.

Bruce Poole did a fantastic job plastering and painting my home’s halls and second floor bedrooms. The hallways had stucco walls which I wanted smoothed out and the bedroom walls were badly in need of repair. Bruce meticulously plastered and sanded the stucco walls to build up multiple layers of plaster over the ancient bumpy walls. As you can imagine, the plaster dust was flying, but Bruce had several dust control strategies, including a site clean-up at the end of each day. The result? Smooth, newly plastered and painted walls that bring my old 1929 house into the twenty-first century. Bruce’s careful prep work and painting have resulted in a wonderful fresh new look.
Bruce’s professionalism, plastering and painting talents, and strong work ethic makes him the painter to hire. And on top of that, he is an all-round great guy you feel comfortable having in your home.Scripture: “Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.” Luke 11:43 NIV
Observation: Pomp and ceremony, the adoration of others, all of the best that could be had, those were the things that were important to the religious leaders of whom Jesus spoke.
Application: I don’t know what to write today without becoming offensive. I have many aspects, good and bad, of many congregations of today, flying around in my head. To call any one out could and would be hypocritical of me–me personally. There are churches that are more interested in their appearance in their community than winning souls for Christ; more interested in carpet and stained glass than ministering to their neighborhoods. Who am I to criticize? I am them–I am the church. I too have been given a great commission from the Lord. What have I done with my charge? As I write this I realize that not until I started this daily devotion and sharing had I done much of anything to reach out to others for Christ. I’ve always been pretty content to set back and be a Pharisee, enjoy a little bit of church without having to put myself too far out there. I’d attend, I’d fix s thing or two, here and there, but I wouldn’t really try to do more, to become more involved, to go further out on a limb for the Lord. I know that I’ll never be a Billy Graham, God doesn’t want me to be, He already has one of those. God wants me to be willing. Willing to listen to Him and share a truth now and then. Willing to go out on a limb for Him. The truth is if we aren’t careful we will all neglect our calling, our great commission, and we will become very much like the Pharisees. I pray that I am no longer like a Pharisee.
Prayer: Father, forgive me for being a Pharisee. Put it on my heart to desire to reach out to others with your truth. Amen

Commentary by Tom Brokaw
Hardball, CNBC, 12/21/98
The natty anchor was promoting his book, in praise of the World War II generation. But it didnt take long before Big Dog Tom uncorked a classic howler. First question:
MATTHEWS: It seems to me that one of President Clintons problems coming into office was that he was not of the generation, the World War II generation, which had run the country and the presidency from Ike all the way through George Bush, and therefore never really had the legitimacy of that generation.
When Tom replied, he brought the analysts right out of their seats, reciting the highlighted groaner:
BROKAW: Well I think it was some of that, but an awful lot of that generation was sympathetic to him as well because they came to not believe in Vietnam and many of the positions he had taken...So I think there was a well-defined knot of that generation that could never accept him because, not just of the way he got out of the draft, but because he used that phrase, I loathed the military. He seemed to be emblematic of the slickness of the Baby Boomer generation...
The analysts fell back in their swivel chairs, shaking their heads, as Brokaw moved on with his musings. But well ask you, the reader, to be the judge of who has been slick on this score. Clinton, of course, never used the phrase that Brokaw now attributed to him. But a concerted spin-effort, carried on through the years, had persuaded millions of folks that he had, so that even the natty--not nattering--Brokaw was convinced it was what Bill had said.
In December 1969, Clinton had written Colonel Eugene Holmes of the University of Arkansas ROTC, to thank him not just for saving me from the draft, but for being so kind and decent to me last summer, when I was as low as I ever have been. The polite tone of that opening remark characterized Clintons letter throughout, and when he had finished discussing the anguish hed experienced in trying to decide how to deal with the draft, he wrote this passage (his closing paragraph), summarizing why he had written:
CLINTON: And that is where I am right now, writing to you because you have been good to me and have a right to know what I think and feel....
It isnt exactly Off the pig--and it does not say, I loathe the military. It says, with a persistent tone of regret, that many fine people, in 1968, had come to loathe the military. Making that statement, in 1968, was like saying the sky is blue and the grass is green; only a fool could have disputed the accuracy of what young Clinton was saying. The tone throughout is extremely respectful of the service that Colonel Holmes and others had provided; and Clinton stresses that those to whom he refers still do love their country.
These are hardly the words of the Weather Underground, manning barricades and burning down buildings. Clinton closes with these provocations:
CLINTON: Forgive the length of this letter. There was much to say. There is still a lot to be said, but it can wait. Please say hello to Col. Jones for me. Merry Christmas. Sincerely, Bill Clinton
In Clintons letter, he tells Col. Holmes that he had come to oppose and despise [the Vietnam War] with a depth of feeling I had reserved solely for racism in America before Vietnam. In a more balanced time, we might even appreciate the feelings of a young man who was able to care about such matters so deeply. It could even occur to us that we might be well served, in later years, by a young man who could express his views in such measured ways--not letting his hatred for a particular war obscure his respect for those who had served in the military.
But when Candidate Clinton came on the scene, we were not living in balanced times. And life in this celebrity press corps meant always finding ways to tweak stories. Polemicists found, in Clintons one phrase, words they could spin to create an impression. And Brokaw, misquoting, seven years later, gives us a portrait of our age--shows us how the best and brightest can end up reciting the scripts of the people who spin.
No, Virginia. President Clinton, as a young man, did not write: I loathe the military. He thanked Colonel Holmes for his years of service. We observe now the thanks that he gets.
Exegetically correct: Young Clinton did go on, in the sentence following the first passage quoted, to make the following comment:
CLINTON [continuing from above]: .....
One can read Clintons text so the phrase many of us implies that he is one who loathes the military. But considering how we all hate lawyerly parsing, were sure no one would want to do that.
Our view?: A major official, on a controversial matter, has a right to be quoted exactly. A sympathetic reading would be too much to ask. But Brokaw should repeat the words right.The two most commonly used flooring products specified for educational facilities are cost-effective vinyl (VCT) or expensive terrazzo.

To do this I am peeling the stacked stone off the mesh backing, cutting the stones as needed with a tile scoring/breaking tool and tile nippers, and gluing them in place with a construction glue that some guys at Home Depot clued me into.
Since this is not a full size stacked stone installation, I don’t need to use mortar – glue is fine.
Here’s a picture of the fireplace in progress – at this point the stones along the sides of the wood base are the only ones in place. Next step is to install the front base row of tiles and then install the wood hearth, which will be cantilevered at the front of the fireplace base. If you enlarge the picture, you can see the pencil lines where the wood hearth will be affixed. I thought about using slate, because I can purchase slate tiles, but since no actual fires will be burning in the fireplace I can use wood, which is easier to work with. I don’t have a wet saw so I’d like to avoid major tile cutting situations.
These stones won’t actually show from the front view of the room as they will be covered by the face stones.
The electrical tape runs behind the fireplace so that the electric fire can be installed. The interior of the fireplace will be lined with paper that looks like stone or cement, not sure which yet.
I may cantilever the mantel as well, but may just glue it on to the stones. I’ll decide when I get there!Filter Feedback Bar
Intro
Filter feedback bar is a horizontal scroll area containing interactive chips that provides users quick access to filter controls. The bar appears below the app bar, and above the list of objects. The interactive chips in the filter feedback bar indicate which filters have been applied, and what filters are available. Users can modify the filters directly by tapping on the chips.
Usage
Do’s
- Use filter feedback bar to provide direct access to frequently used filters.
- Use filter feedback bar when filter options are relatively simple and straightforward.
- Use filter feedback bar when users want to modify applied filters often.
Don’ts
- Don’t use filter feedback bar when users usually apply a large number of filters, or the filter options are difficult to represent by chips. For example, when filter options have very complex names and structures.
Structure
The filter feedback bar sits between the app bar and content area. The chips in the filter feedback bar are grouped into two types:
A. Active Filters
Active filters indicate the sort (if it is a non-default sort) and filters currently applied to the list. They are represented by chips in selected state. The active filters are always on the left side of inactive filters, with sort (if applicable) at the very left.
B. Inactive Filters (for Fast Filters)
Inactive filters are available filter options that are not currently applied to the list. Only fast filters will be shown as inactive filters. They are represented by chips in non-selected state.
Types
Fast filters
Fast filters are pre-defined filter options that remain visible in the filter feedback bar even when they are not applied. With fast filters, users can apply filters to the list directly in the page instead of opening the filter dialog. The fast filter options are defined by the app team. To make fast filters most effective, we recommend to only include the most frequently used filters as fast filters.
Filter feedback bar with fast filters
With fast filters, the filter feedback bar is visible by default with all fast filters as inactive filters. Users can apply fast filters directly or through the filter dialog. All applied filters will be shown in the filter feedback bar as active filters.
Filter feedback bar without fast filters
When no fast filters are defined, the filter feedback bar is hidden by default. The default sort does not show up in the filter feedback bar. After the user has applied a filter or changed the sort option through the filter dialog, the filter feedback bar will appear to show the active filters.
Behavior & Interactions
Horizontal Scroll
All filter options in filter feedback bar are displayed in one row. Users can scroll horizontally to view all filters.
Applying fast filters
Users can apply a fast filter simply by tapping the chip. This will change the chip to the selected state and become an active filter. The active filter will move to the left of any inactive filters. Each time a fast filter is applied, the list below will be refreshed to show the filtered result.
Removing fast filters
Users can remove a fast filter simply by tapping the chip. This will change the chip to non-selected state and back to an inactive filter. The inactive filter will move back to its original position as the fast filter. Users can only remove one fast filter at a time, and the list below will be refreshed to show the updated result.
Applying filters from filter dialog
In the filter dialog, users can apply multiple filters at a time. All applied filters will be displayed in the feedback bar as active filters. If fast filters are defined from the options in the dialog, they can be applied through the dialog as well.
In general, the active filters take the selected filter’s name or value directly. If the value or name is not clear enough, we recommend using both the label and value in the active filter. For example, a location value could represent arrival or departure, adding “Arr:” or “To:” and “Dep:” or “From:” to the location value would help user identify what the location stands for. By default, we recommend adding “Sort By:” to the sort value in the filter feedback bar for clear communication.
Removing filters applied from filter dialog
Users can remove a filter applied from filter dialog directly by tapping the chip in the filter feedback bar. If that option is not defined as fast filter, it will disappear from the filter feedback bar. The user can also remove a filter by deselecting it in filter dialog as the standard behavior of filter dialog.
Expand and collapse
To maximize screen space for users to scan through the list content, the filter feedback bar will collapse as users scroll down the page. It will expand and stay on top of the list content when users start to scroll back up to provide easy access.
On 21 July 1969 a quarter of the world’s population watched the grainy black and white images of man’s first steps on the moon. They saw Neil Armstrong, the commander of the Apollo 11 mission, step on to the surface of the moon, after a journey of 500,000 miles, and heard him say, “That’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.” The news of Neil’s death, at the age of 82 following heart bypass surgery, has brought sadness to many around the world. Walking on the moon was a great landmark in the history of human exploration. Since 1972, however, no-one has travelled to the moon.
Tributes have been paid to Neil Armstrong by his colleagues on the Apollo 11 mission. Buzz Aldrin mourned “the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew.” Scott Carpenter said, “He was the best of the best.” His family described him as “a reluctant hero.” Charles Boden, a NASA Administrator, said that Neil Armstrong “will be remembered for taking humankind’s first small step on a world beyond our own.”
Very few people will ever have the experience of walking on the moon. However, all of us will one day leave this earth and enter into eternity. This is the ultimate step into “a world beyond our own.” Our life in this world is just for a time, but each of us has an immortal soul which can never die. Death involves the separation of our body and soul. Just before he died Jesus said, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.” When he died his body was taken down from the cross and was buried, but his spirit had already passed into heaven. On the third day the tomb was empty because his body had been raised from death. His resurrection triumph offers hope to us all.
It is important to think about the end of our lives and to make preparations for it. The wonderful achievement of the Apollo 11 mission was the culmination of a great deal of preparation by many people over many years. Jesus Christ came into this world to bring hope to us all when we put our trust in him. One hymn writer wrote, “While I draw this fleeting breath, when my eyelids close in death, when I soar through tracts unknown, see Thee on Thy judgement throne, Rock of Ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in Thee.”Pancit Palabok (Filipino Noodles With Smoky Pork and Seafood Sauce) Recipe
This classic Filipino noodle dish is packed with pork, chicken, shrimp, and layer upon layer of seafood flavor.
:max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__serious_eats__seriouseats.com__2019__11__20191030-filipino-pancit-palabok-vicky-wasik-32-6e6689568e134ca187290918c8558c09.jpg)
Why It Works
- Marinating the pork, an optional step, makes it more flavorful and enhances surface browning during roasting.
- Using head-on shrimp infuses even more flavor into the sauce.
- Making smart use of all the ingredients means you can whip up a quick stock for the sauce with the same ingredients that end up in the final dish.
This Filipino noodle dish is a seafood- and pork-lover's dream. The rich, thick sauce is layered with flavor, starting with a base of chicken-and-shrimp stock, and followed by crab paste, the juices from shrimp shells and heads, and flaked smoked fish. The whole thing is spooned on top of springy rice noodles and topped with roast pork belly, shrimp, hard-boiled eggs, and a party of garnishes, including fried garlic, crushed fried pork rinds, scallions, and citrus wedges.

- One 8-ounce bottle Filipino crab paste

- Kosher salt
- To Serve:

- 1 cup crushed pork cracklings (chicharron)
Directions
For the Pork Belly: In a zipper-lock bag, combine 1/4 cup (60ml) fish sauce, sugar, 1 tablespoon black pepper, and coconut milk; seal bag and shake well to combine. Add pork belly to bag, carefully press out air, then seal and refrigerate overnight. Remove pork belly from bag, pat dry, then allow to air-dry in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Alternatively, if you don't have time to marinate the pork overnight, simply brush the belly with fish sauce and season with black pepper, then proceed.
Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C). In an overproof skillet or on a baking sheet lined with foil, roast the pork belly until an instant-read thermometer registers 160°F when inserted into the center, about 45 minutes.
Increase oven temperature to 500°F (260°C) and return the pork to the oven until skin is browned and crispy, about 10 minutes. Let cool, then slice pork into 1/2 inch thick slices. Reserve for serving.
Meanwhile, for the Stock and Sauce: Fill a Dutch oven or large pot with 4 quarts (4 liters) water. Add the 4 crushed cloves of garlic, ginger, scallion whites, and reserved onion scraps. Bring to a simmer, then add chicken thighs and cook at a gentle simmer for 45 minutes. Remove chicken, let cool, then shred meat and discard bones.
Set up an ice water bath in a large bowl. Add shrimp to simmering stock and cook until just cooked through and pink all over, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to ice bath and let cool. Remove from ice bath.
Shell shrimp and remove heads. Working in a large mortar and pestle, crush shrimp shells and heads until juices are extracted. Strain, reserving shrimp juices. Return shells and heads to the stock and simmer for 5 minutes longer. Keep shrimp chilled until ready to serve.
Strain stock, discarding solids. Reserve 1 quart (1 liter) stock for the sauce below, and freeze the rest for future use.
In a clean Dutch oven, heat 1/4 cup (60ml) oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add minced garlic and diced onion and cook, stirring, until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in annatto powder, followed by the crab paste, 1 quart (1 liter) reserved stock, and reserved shrimp juices. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer.
Stir in the flaked fish, followed by the cornstarch slurry. Return to a simmer, then cook until sauce thickens. Add the remaining fish sauce in 1 tablespoon increments until it tastes well seasoned to you (you may not need all of it). Season with salt and pepper, if desired. Set sauce aside, stir in reserved chicken, then allow to cool slightly.
In a large pot of salted boiling water, add remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil. Add noodles and cook, stirring gently to break them up, until softened and beginning to turn slightly clear, about 3 minutes. Drain in a colander set in a sink, then run cold water all over the noodles to rinse and chill; toss noodles as you rinse them to ensure they're not stuck together. Set aside to drain fully.
Pile the noodles on a large serving dish. Spoon sauce all over. Arrange reserved shrimp and pork belly slices on top, and garnish with the hard-boiled eggs and citrus wedges. Sprinkle all over with reserved sliced scallion greens, fried garlic, and crushed pork rinds. Serve.
Special equipment
Dutch oven, mortar and pestle
Notes
You can find the specialty Filipino ingredients at well-stocked Asian and Filipino markets; some are also available online. Fresh calamansi can be very difficult to find, so substitute lemon if you can't track it down.
Make-Ahead and Storage
The sauce, shrimp, and pork can be refrigerated separately for up to 2 days; gently rewarm sauce and pork before serving (the sauce need not be hot, but you don't want it refrigerator-cold either).Contact Information

The Big 12 publicly reprimanded and sidelined Texas Tech’s radio broadcasters for the Red Raiders’ next game after they called out the officiating crew — along with the Big 12 and commissioner Bob Bowlsby — during the team’s 41-38 win against Iowa State on Saturday.
Play-by-play announcer Brian Jensen and color analyst John Harris, per Yahoo Sports and Awful Announcing, criticized what they thought was inconsistent officiating against the Red Raiders, particularly after Texas Tech junior defensive back Dadrion Taylor-Demerson’s fourth-quarter, goal-line interception was overturned upon review.
But they also said “the Big 12 should be embarrassed” while suggesting the conference was rooting for Iowa State to win, and, at one point, they named every member of the officiating crew.
Obviously, the Big 12 was less than thrilled about their comments and suspended them from calling Saturday’s Week 12 game between Texas Tech and No. 9 Oklahoma State. So here’s a breakdown of what the broadcasters said and exactly how the conference responded.
So what did Jensen and Harris actually say that was bad enough to warrant a rebuke from the Big 12?
They blasted the conference for several calls from the officials, and they didn’t seem to hold back, including suggesting that one of the officials had a head injury, contributing to the objectionable calls.

From the radio audio:
“I’ll say it right now: The Big 12 does not want Iowa State to lose this game.”
“Yeah, Bob Bowlsby, you need to answer to this. This is ridiculous.
“I’ve seen some horrific calls today.”
“This is ridiculous. This is ridiculous. Unbelievable. The inconsistency of this referee crew in favor of Iowa State today — unbelievable.”
“That’s remarkable.”
“Unbelievable.”
After the overturned interception call, officials dealt Iowa State a false start penalty, and the broadcasters seemed to be in disbelief: “No way. No way.” And then they speculated maybe the referee had a concussion “’cause he’s acted like it this whole game.”
At that point, fans were also throwing things on the field, which briefly delayed the continuation of the game. And that’s when the broadcasters continued to chastise the officials.
“This is another ridiculous thing about this officiating crew. Take control. Get on the microphone and explain what’s happening… so that the fans understand and that they can be told and that everyone else here can understand and be told.”
“This has been a remarkable day and a remarkably horrible day of officiating by this crew.”
“Yeah, the Big 12 should be embarrassed. The Big 12 should be embarrassed with this crew. We’ve only pointed out two guys. I’m going to read them all to you.”
And then they proceeded to announce the names and positions of each official working the game, calling them “completely out of control here.”
The Red Raiders ultimately won the game with a 62-yard field goal from Jonathan Garibay as the clock expired.

$15,578The commercial sector consumes about 75% of electricity, but industries have nine times more existing applications for combined heat and power (CHP) technologies in use today. CHP plant downtime is a costly inconvenience as it reduces efficiency and leads to lower productivity, translating to losses and delays. CHP plant faults arise from various factors, including misfires and worn parts. You can avoid or minimise plant downtime through regular performance management, replacing faulty parts immediately, and continuously training your operators.
Look For The Most Common Faults
Industrial plant monitoring systems usually collect current and historical data for a wide range of parameters. Integrating your CHP plant into an effective monitoring system allows you to regularly record the most common faults affecting your plant.
A technician can check for CHP plant faults in the following parameters:
• Heat and power output
• Rate of water and fuel consumption
• Ambient air conditions
• Gas pressure and temperature
• Exhaust and cooling system conditions
• Electricity import and export
Take Immediate Action On Detecting a Fault
When your technicians identify faults on your CHP plant parts, take action and repair the issues immediately to prevent a total shutdown of the engine. Procrastinating to solve a problem, such as replacing a faulty plug, can be more costly because you may experience more frequent misfires and downtime. Unchecked faults can make the CHP plant less efficient and also cause other parts to fail.
Purchase Genuine, Manufacturer-Approved Components
Avoid the purchase of substandard or counterfeit CHP plant components. Such parts are often incompatible with your CHP engine and can cause damage to other components. For genuine, manufacturer-approved components, make purchases from legitimate providers with established supply partnerships and accreditations. Opt for a company dealing with the sales, servicing, and warranty handling of the most common CHP plant parts and products.
Regularly Retrain Your Team
Regardless of the design of your CHP plant, it cannot run efficiently if the operators are inexperienced, or their training is out of date. Consider investing in refresher training for your employees in the specifics of effectively running a CHP plant, whether they are part-time or permanent workers. Provide operators with the appropriate material and tools and enough time to perform their duties effectively.
Next Steps
Your CHP plant can avoid or significantly minimise the risk of downtime by following these steps, saving you money, and increasing productivity. If you want to upgrade your CHP plant’s efficiency, our technicians can conduct regular servicing of your plant’s systems and provide reports. R&M Walsh can also replace faulty or broken CHP plant components with genuine manufacturer parts. Contact us today for more information on minimising and eventually avoiding CHP plant downtime.Shoes are really nice, and they protect your feet quite a lot!

Which is pretty simple, isn’t it? At its most straightforward, you can think of programming as giving directions to a computer to do some thing you want it to do – which might sound nearly the same as how you operate your desktop computer. Simplistically, the only distinction between what you are doing now as a computer user and what you might do as being a computer developer is that the instructions are stored somewhere so they can be utilized over and over. As a matter of truth, in case you have utilized macros within a computer software like anything processor or spreadsheet (or numerous other programs that are macro enabled) you have done Matlab代写 of a kind.
Programs can be as basic as a set of instructions stored in a textual content file for doing a bit of mundane task, like creating backups of all of the computer files within a folder, or as complicated as some thing like a word processor chip, or even the operating system that your particular computer uses which can require an incredible number of outlines of program code. We have to recognize that computer systems, which can be typically just bits of metal, plastic, silicon, along with other materials stuck together in a fashion that enables them to carry out some amazing stuff that appear like pondering, can’t actually think in any way. But what they can do very well is follow instructions. So what are these directions, anyhow? On the level that the computer understands, these have to be very precise, really detailed, and extremely complete stage-by-step instructions, and they have to be within a form that this processor and other areas of your computer can comprehend – and that is very little electric pulses which people aren’t competent at giving off (a minimum of not currently).
In ways, you can think about C代写 like a formula: a set of directions that can be implemented to produce a result. In the case of the formula, the directions are used by way of a human and can consequently be considered a bit descriptive, departing out a few of the details. For example, if a formula coaching would be to “pour the mixture into a blender and whip till frothy”, it really is presuming the human understands what a mixer is, and in which it is, and ways to set it up, and how to utilize it – and also what put indicates, and what frothy indicates, and so forth. A persons cook is predicted to fill out the spaces. A computer can’t do that – it has no clue what anything at all means, other than for a couple very easy instructions. So the way we do this is always to provide the human being a method to compose directions that can then be interpreted into some thing your computer can understand. The “method to write instructions” is called a programming language.
Exactly what a programming language allows us to do is to compose directions for the computer within a essentially human easily readable type that can then be translated into some thing the computer can work with. A persons easily readable directions are usually called (you suspected it) – code! Each line of human easily readable code translates into thousands of detailed computer instructions. A special system (or set of applications) is utilized to achieve this translation – each computer vocabulary has its own translators, which are called compilers or interpreters. When the interpretation is carried out the end result is saved in some form such as a file or set of documents (or even in computer memory in some cases), and each time the Cs代写 is operate, your computer will refer to the instructions and (ideally) this system is going to do anything that it must be said to be performing.
Although it is often thought that you must become a wizard so that you can compose useful software, just about anyone who may be computer knowledgeable and it has an interest in becoming an electric power user can learn to program. Most wusehr is written by average people with specific information and abilities. Learning computer programming can become a long term quest, but gathering sufficient knowledge and ability to be able to do helpful things isn’t unattainable for anybody who knows how to make use of a computer and it is prepared to devote some time… or maybe lots of time, but nonetheless – it isn’t out of reach.Wolves are trying to turn Liverpool target Hee-chan Hwang’s loan move into a permanent deal in early 2022, the Mirror report.
He has made a brilliant start to life in the Premier League after signing for the Molineux men from RB Leipzig this summer.
Hwang has scored four goals in eight division outings and his all-round showings have also caught the eye at the Etihad and Anfield.
Both sides have had him watched multiple times, with Liverpool looking at stars who can provide competition and cover for Diogo Jota, Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah.
Wolves’ board are aware that admiring glances are being cast in the player’s direction and are keen to get Hee-chan snapped up at the midway point of his one-year loan to avoid any complications next year.
The 25-year-old South Korea international joined the German outfit last year from RB Salzburg after five seasons in Austria.
He is already a fan favourite at the West Midlands outfit, winning the vote for Wolves’ player of the month award for October.
The star has been a key part of the impressive start to life manager Bruno Lage has enjoyed since taking the reins at the club.So, there are two Super Mario All-Stars patches that I'd like to apply (preferably to a copy of Mario All-Stars + World). The first is some graphics edits to SMB1 to bring it a bit more in line with the original: and the second fixes the infamous brick physics glitch in its version of SMB1: Both of these patches say they can be applied together, but there's some weird stuff about the ROM headers that I think I'm messing up, I guess I don't really understand the process. (Also, should my ROM collection have headers or not? What's the difference?) Also, only one says that it can be applied to +World, and the other one is ambiguous. Is there anyone that could help me with these problems/questions? (And if it can't be applied to +World, I guess I'll just use the vanilla ROM.

Manifesto – Some considerations on astrology, oracle and dramatic function
Translated by Adriana Ferreira Heery
An oracle card spread is any game, operated according to chance, which is structured and speaks following its own grammar and deals with luck and its vicissitudes.
Every query to an oracle produces a throw of the dice.
The oracle card spread is a narrative structure, it produces a web of meanings.
When one draws the first card from an oracle deck, the course of the narrative begins its journey.
There is no chance for grammar, much less for narrative or plot.
Chance is at the heart of the text.
The oracle (narrative) does not exist, it is necessary to create it.
The oracle (answer) only exists if someone consults it.
The first step is in the embodiment of the seeker’s voice.
It is not wise to offer fortune-telling like the seller who shouts his offers in the aisles of a market.
Decks, runes, stars – the game channel doesn’t matter, what matters is the narrative resulting from the dice throw.
Luck has its way, but the oracle is a return to the center of the world.
The oracle is the navel of the world.
And the navel is the mark between worlds.
The oracle unites us with those who left and those who will come.
The oracle is a hole.
The oracle is a bow.
Those who seek the oracle do so with the ambition of giving legs to Fate, this invisible actor.
“Who will I become at the end of my life?”
“Who am I becoming at every step?”
“Am I becoming who I am?”
The oracle is a lucky horse, television of the world, a bite into an ancient apple.
The oracular text is about the future, the present and the past, but the time of the oracle is now and timeless.
Temporal.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There is no truth, what exist are narratives.
“Scripts scripts scripts scripts scripts.” (Oswald de Andrade)
Reading an oracle is equivalent to making a world: talking movies.
– it is a poetic act.
poiésis: making worlds with words.
It’s a terrible act.
It is an ancient act.
poiésis: “a production that gives shape, a manufacturing that engenders, a creation that organizes, orders and establishes a new reality, a being.” (Benedito Nunes)
The voice of the oracle speaks a ritual language.
The breath of the verb binds atoms together.
The oracle card spread composes a dramatic scene as old as the sign.
“How to overcome death and mystery with the help of some grammatical formulas?” (Oswald de Andrade)
The translator uses the word.
The querent uses the word.
Inside the mouth we have a roof shaped as the sky.
Its representation is the world, and also not.
//
Poet, Astrologer and Saturn, I believe, are synonymous. Poetry is the marrow of Saturn. Or rather: the gelatinous tissues of the marrow of Saturn, the moss. The moss of time. Each map has an inner voice, as well as a good poem and the spirit of each day. To translate a map is to write it, to nail it to the back of Time. And, to translate, it is necessary to make narrative choices that the oracular structure itself proposes. Saturn is Mercury. But the one who prepares the object-celestial-poem is the poet-soothsayer-astrologer. And it is their responsibility to create the text.
//
The actors:
The respective roles of asking, answering, and translating.
The one who asks is the Moon.
The tool that delimits the answer is Mars.
The one who translates is Mercury.
Moon
The one who asks suffers from doubt – it is the reason for the existence of the oracle query.
The following maxim has been tattooed on the eyelids: belief is prophecy, belief is prophecy, belief is prophecy…
The querent is Tiresias in reverse.
Whoever asks loves the oracle.
Whoever asks hates the oracle.
Whoever asks transfers their hopes to the oracle.
Whoever asks transfers their horror.
Whoever asks transfers their love.
Mars
The machine reminds you that there is a way to operate it.
The oracle is a machine that unpacks meaning, pulls the grenade pin, separates chaos from the lynx.
The oracle is meter, rhyme, media – it is the labyrinth and the thread of the narrative.
Its main blade is the analogic one.
It has the following phrase written on its metal:
“Bad omen is not a prognosis.”
Mercury
You have an obligation to master the analogic machine, the art of correspondence.
The translator joins those who once gave their lives and were injured in the reflection of Mars’ knives.
Tradition takes him back to the modus operandi of those who once walked this same road.
Mercury is the bridge between the Moon and Mars, and Mars has its own secrets with Hades.
The persona of the oracle translator does not exist, at least this is his quest, his Fortune.
He is just the messenger.
Respect for tradition evokes the protection of the spirit of the dead.
Disdain for tradition evokes the indifference of the underworld.
Whoever looks into the lynx’s eyes is committed to being faithful to the lynx.
After much use of the tool, an alliance is created with the listening itself and a mark on the knife edge to be left for posterity.
Oracle is the ability to listen.
Oracle is the craft of translation secrets.
Mercury finds himself between translation and betrayal.
Translating is being true to the lynx’s path.
But when faced with a crossroads, it is the interpreter who arbitrates which path to choose in the translation.
When the oracle speaks more about the person of the translator than the text to be translated, the mystery closes like a player folding their cards.
“There is only determinism where there is no mystery.” (Oswald de Andrade)
The dramatic function
The oracular query is a performance art.
Performance art: work structured under the sign of chance, impossible to be reproduced.
Its function is to prepare those who ask their announced fate.
“Between yes and no there is a gap.” (Itamar Assumpção)
The performance
It is what happens during a dramatic action.
Chances are played.
On the board or in the skies, an alliance is created between the querent, the answerer and the interpreter.
The translator makes use of the analog machine.
You have an obligation to master this knife.
The one who asks looks in the mirror.
“I was born with my ascendant in the sign of the crab, so my life goes backwards. One walks back and forth to go forward.”
The logic of correspondence detaches us from the farce of the logic of cause and effect.
Breaking the mirror means seven years of bad luck.
The construction of the analog text comes in waves, has rhythm, meter and pain, it follows the machine’s pace.
Analogy: as if he didn’t want anything, he gradually spreads his senses everywhere.
The logic of correspondence unites the vital points, forming a constellation of meanings, a web of significations, to the point of extracting a sliver of light from the sheet of darkness.
As the word ‘port’ within ‘purport’, the final destination is connected with the intended meaning of the communication.
Reading the oracular text manufactures a world of words.
When luck is recreated, reread, the world is reinvented.
The world is healed.
Oracle reading performance is a co-creation, just as Fate needs Free Will.
It is a creative act.
Smoothly creative.
Terribly creative.
And then the translator invents himself as a demiurge.
Demiurge, French démiurge (demiourgon) < Latin demiurgis borrowed from Greek démiourgós, meaning “artist, doctor, artisan”.
In addition to the analogy, the translator makes use of metaphor, the talking movies, the rupture of belief, the saturnine verse, and the rite. Oh, and of course, Mercury’s sense of humor. The range of resources to achieve the purpose of the dramatic function (preparing the person for the fate that is being announced) will depend on the type of question and the draw, of course.
Performance is a rite. There is no need to value the setting. Don’t be wishing for anything else, just let yourself be enough.
The oracle is already a profane and sacred place.
If the performance reaches its goal, the querent is no longer the Moon, and it has become the Fortune.
The machine, in addition to becoming dirtier with grease, achieves its luck of being a tool of Fortune.
And the interpreter achieves his ambition, his destiny, his Fortune, that of being just the messenger.
After reading the oracle, fold it as a tomb closes.
Put away the bow.
Oracle care (machine hazard icon)
The translator can intoxicate himself with Mercury.
The one who asks may not stop asking.
The machine can jam the wheel with the veils of illusion.
Reading oracles is translation art.
A bandit art.
Stealing the fire of the gods.
“A throw of the dice will never abolish chance.” (Mallarmé)
And the next step is the listening of those who seek the oracle.

An alternative to taking another complement is that many individuals are consuming healthier diets total and engaged on lowering the fat on their body by going to the gym and doing both cardio workouts or energy coaching workouts with weights.

Hip eating places and bars are making their own bitter blends, and herb retailers, meals co-ops and health food shops are stocking up on more bottles. I normally give herbal treatments on daily basis until the state of affairs is “cured” to my satisfaction. Though, many people find herbal therapies more practical when used 5-7 days in a row (“on”) and two days off, 5 days on, two days of, and so forth. It’s possible you’ll want to experiment.

The killing of Soleimani has heightened tensions with Iran. The circumstances of a Ukrainian airliner’s crash in Tehran are murky. Iran has targeted US bases in Iraq. It is a real morass.
There is little doubt that Soleimani was not a nice guy. There is little doubt that the Iranian regime is problematic at best. And yet, we worry about the possibility of an armed conflict and what it might mean for those who will have to fight it…as well as those who may get caught in the crossfire–including those in Israel.
I am reminded of my study of Talmud. The Talmud’s style is to ask every question imaginable (even those you could not imagine!). It debates each opinion and even itself. It digs deeper and deeper until we may forget the original question. Rabbis disagree with each other on issues of law and conduct. It is full of “on the one hand…and on the other hand.”
What is happening in the Middle East now (as always) is more complicated than it seems. Nothing is truly clear cut. It is difficult to know what the US Administration’s motives are. We cannot know what the Iranian regime is thinking. We do not know all the intelligence that is out there. We tend to follow whatever news source confirms what we already think from our own political or emotional perspective.
It is not easy to know what to think for certain…which is why the last week has felt like a dive into the Talmud for me. And why so many of us are so worried.
One thing that is clear from our tradition is that there are times when values may clash with each other. Sometimes there are two options that both seem right, or that both seem wrong. How do we know what to choose? How do we know what to believe? Judaism teaches us that when values come into conflict we must try to follow the example set by the students of Aaron the Priest: we must love peace and pursue it.
There are times when war is necessary. First, however, we must seek to avoid it all costs. If there is a way to save a life, it must be a priority. May our tradition guide us and our leaders through the rough waters ahead.
Shabbat Shalom!Maricopa and Pima community colleges will require employees to get the COVID-19 vaccine
Arizona’s two largest community college systems will require employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to meet federal mandates, officials announced this week.
The Maricopa County Community College District emailed employees Monday to alert them to the new requirement. Pima Community College approved its plan at a Wednesday governing board meeting.
Arizona's three public universities announced employee vaccine requirements last month. The universities and community colleges are following President Joe Biden’s executive order for federal contractors, which requires all employees to be fully vaccinated, with limited accommodations.
Maricopa Community Colleges' about 12,500 employees will have until Jan. 7 to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or apply for an accommodation. That employee count includes faculty, staff, student workers, and full-time, part-time and temporary employees, according to a spokesperson. The requirement will apply to volunteers and remote and virtual employees.
Pima Community College’s about 2,400 full-time, part-time and temporary employees likely will have until Jan. 4. About 1,000 employees already have voluntarily shown proof of full vaccination, per the college.
Both Maricopa and Pima community college districts will have to provide reasonable accommodations for employees who decline vaccination for medical, disability or religious reasons.
Arizona State University, the University of Arizona and Northern Arizona University in mid-October announced their more than 52,000 employees, including student workers, would have to be fully vaccinated or receive a religious, disability or medical accommodation by Dec. 8, although the deadline has been pushed back to January, per university websites.
Details of the colleges' requirements
MCCCD, which includes 10 community colleges across the Valley, listed in its email to employees a number of federal contracts that necessitate the vaccine requirement.
The district works with federal agencies including the Department of Defense, military branches, Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security and the National Science Foundation.
“Among other things, these contracts and programs allow MCCCD to provide career training and degree opportunities to members of the military and veterans,” interim Chancellor Steven Gonzales wrote in the email to employees, which was provided to The Arizona Republic by a spokesperson.
The district has organized virtual "Federal COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate Town Halls" next week to explain the requirements and process to employees and answer questions.
Pima Community College Chancellor Lee Lambert told the governing board that the requirement was necessary because the college contracts with the federal government. Its contracts total more than $4 million, with the biggest partner being the United States Air Force, he said.
“This is about safety and the health of our employees,” Lambert said. “It’s about the health and safety of our community, so I don’t want us to lose sight of that bigger picture piece.”
In documents shared with the board, district officials said employee sickness due to COVID-19 has a direct negative impact on the college through disruption and health insurance claims.
The board unanimously approved the employee vaccine requirement.
Pima will need to develop a plan to implement the mandate, including a verification and accommodations system and "contingency plans to minimize disruption of services and operations due to employees who are terminated due to refusal to comply," according to board documents.
Students at both the community college systems will not have to get vaccinated under current requirements, unless they are student workers for the college.
Biden signed an executive order on Sept. 9 requiring vaccinations for federal contractors, which includes universities and colleges that have contracts with the United States government.
Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey maintained opposition to vaccine mandates when the three public universities announced their employee requirements last month, reiterating his view that the vaccine should be a choice rather than a requirement.
Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich's effort to halt implementation of the mandate was denied by a federal judge earlier this week.

Source File(s):fiendish?
I’ve been an outlining fiend today. I finished outlining book 1 and have started in on book 2, up to page 160 already (of the manuscript, not the outline!).
Book 1’s outline ended up being 17 pages. A little over my target of 15, but the 15 was just a loose guideline, not anything I had to strictly adhere to, so I think I did well.
Book 2 is already another 17 pages and I still have a ways to go. I may take a second pass at it and not be quite so detailed, but I feel like there are lots of seemingly minor things in this one that are important to the ending.
Peace and love, everyone. Be good to yourself!In the year since the book sold, I’ve seen several instances of authors stalking or threatening reviewers. So, first off because it’s most important:
Threatening and/or stalking someone is never, ever okay.
It is so Not Okay that I don’t even have a metaphor for how Not Okay it is.
In fact, “Not Okay” is a huge understatement. It is wrong. It is illegal. It is evil. No one should ever do it.
I have never been the subject of a bad review. (Because my book isn’t out yet. I’m sure that I will get some when it starts to be available. That is life. Can’t be all things to all people/there are bad reviews for classics/etc.)
But I have been stalked and threatened.
And it is terrifying.
Is a bad review terrifying? … Maybe? But not in the same way. If someone hates my work, I do not fear for my life. And if they somehow make me fear for my life with personal threats and calling my private cell and heavy-breathing their review into my ear, then, you know, I go through appropriate channels to try to protect myself. And “Appropriate Channels” is NOT threatening or stalking.
(Nor is it using a large platform to sic fans on reviewers. I don’t have a large platform so this may never be applicable to me, but it should be said because apparently some people don’t know this?)
So, okay, with the internet the way it is, people are more accessible than ever. We can tweet and email and chat and crosstalk and argue and all that, and I love that, I love connecting with people. And as the pub date approaches and my circle widens, there is more opportunity for cool conversation but also more risk. And I never want to make anyone feel unsafe, ever.
So I want to just include a personal policy, of sorts, for social media. As time goes forward, I will be thinking about and developing this policy further, but for now this is what I’ve got.
–If you ask me questions directly online, or invite me into a conversation, I will happily and respectfully try to respond. I love talking to people (though I am awkward about it at times) and appreciate conversation.
–If you Tweet about me but do not appear to be inviting me into conversation, I will err on the side of not responding. I’m not ignoring you to be rude! But I would rather risk appearing rude than making you feel unsafe.
–If you review my work, I may or may not read it, but I will always appreciate it–even if you hate the book. Why? Because you took the time, and time is your most precious resource. Thank you, truly.
–If you review my work and loved it and rave about it and it comes to my attention, I may in fact print out your review and keep it to look at when I’m unsure of myself. It means the world to me to know I did well in the eyes of a reader.
–I will always support a better safety and harassment policy on all social media platforms.
–If I hurt someone or cause harm, I will want to apologize. I will feel sorry. I will likely make some kind of public announcement of what I did wrong (keeping names out of it) and my intent to do better and any plans I have to that effect. I may or may not apologize directly, depending on my sense of whether or not a direct apology/contact is wanted by the person I hurt. (I am aware that sometimes, when harm is caused, the person harmed wants nothing more to do with the person who has harmed them and that’s okay too. Stuff is complicated and I want to try to do the right thing.)
Okay. I think this is a good policy, though again, it is evolving. And I always want to do better so feedback is welcome.Retreats

Refiners cope as lubricant business slipsLocal oil refiners are boosting production of paraxylene (PX) products as earnings from their lucrative high-end lubricant business plunge due to the worldwide economic slump.
According to SK Innovation, a holding company?of oil refining businesses within SK Group, its affiliate SK Lubricants saw its operating profit drop 92.8 percent compared to a year ago in the first quarter taking in revenues of only 7.6 billion won ($6.7 million). The nation’s largest oil refiner’s sales also went down 13.5 percent year-on-year to 681.1 billion won.
GS Caltex, the second-largest oil refiner, saw first quarter year-on-year operating profit from its lubricant business drop to 31 billion won from 69 billion won. Sales shrunk from 490.4 billion to 350.7 billion won.
S-Oil’s first-quarter lubricant business generated 14.2 billion won in operating profit, down 86 percent from 105.9 billion won a year ago. Sales decreased 31 percent year-on-year to 432.8 billion won.
In recent years, the lubricant business has been an important source of profits for refiners. For GS Caltex, lubricant products accounted for only 3.7 percent of sales in 2012, but nearly half of the company’s operating profits came from lubricants. Likewise, the lubricant business generated 42 percent of S-Oil operating profits last year.
Experts said these companies have benefited from producing top quality Group III lubricants which have the highest margin. But as the global economic slump continues, demand has fallen as customers try to cut costs.
“Our inventory started to increase following low demand from China and other countries,” said an oil company official. “As our stocks piled up, it led to decline in lubricant prices and profit margins, which has created a vicious cycle.”
As the oil refining business and lubricant sector start to lose energy, the companies have recently focused on petrochemical products like paraxylene to fill the void.
Paraxylene is primarily used as a feedstock for the manufacture of purified terephthalic acid (PTA), an important chemical in the production of fiber and plastic bottles.?PTA costs about $1,500 per metric ton and has a higher margin than other petrochemicals. Demand has soared in recent years and China is now the world’s top producer of PTAs. Last year, total PTA capacity reached 26 million metric tons per year with the addition of 10.2 million metric tons of capacity in 2012 alone, according to China’s General Administration of Customs. Korean oil refiners can produce 5 million metric tons of PX lubricants, but SK Innovation is building a plant that will be able to produce 1.3 million metric tons.

Taking sustainability to the next level: X-Europe’s cohort 4 in numbers
X-Europe fourth cohort is well on its way and we are thrilled to share statistics behind the startups that will introduce new sustainable practices and technologies to make our cities smarter.
The fourth X-Europe open call for startups and scaleups closed on the 31st March 2021, with 119 applications. As with cohort 2 and 3, X-Europe has chosen 27 most promising to join our third cohort - Smart Cities and Sustainability.
Our sustainability innovators will embark on an engaging programme, filled with demanding yet thrilling activities, webinars, events, mentorships sessions over the 5 month period, that we cannot wait to see how they will bask in the tales of triumph.
Company and Product Stage
As with all the open calls X-Europe has run, we had a difficult time selecting the most promising ones that will have the opportunity to excel in the programme. This time around we’ve seen the greatest competition among the early stage startups.
In the fourth open call, we’ve seen greater innovativeness and competitiveness coming from more developed startups, especially since we had only 5 spots dedicated for this maturity stage. On the other hand, we had seen promising startups in the growing and scaling stage (live funding & product market fit, and scaling), resulting in 9 and 13 startups being accepted from the respective stages.
Unlike our precious cohorts, we have a greater distribution of startups when it comes to the founding year, however, the majority of those (59%) come from 2018 and 2019.
Following a similar trend from the first three X-Europe cohorts, the most popular business model among our Cohort 4 selected startups is the B2B Model (52%), while this time around we seen an increase in those startups operating under the B2G (25%), B2C (14.5%), and B2C2B (8.5%) follow behind.
Home sweet home: the location of our startups & scaleups
While focusing on providing services that support internationalization to specific regions (Visegrad 4, the Baltics, and Benelux), X-Europe is a pan-European growth programme that welcomes startups and scaleups from all European Union (EU) and H2020 associated countries. The programme enjoys a high degree of geographical diversity when it comes to its participants. In total, the 27 participating companies come from 15 different countries (7 being from our specific regions), ensuring X-Europe’s wide impact.
The company focus and requested services
Cohort 4 shares interest in Smart Cities and Sustainability technologies, however, we are also seeing a dominant presence of our startups with technologies in Software, IoT, Smart Cities, Energy & Clean Tech.
To conclude, let’s take a look into the X-Europe services requested by our startups and scaleups. Yet again, the top four selected services were matchmaking with investors, matchmaking with corporations, one-on-one mentoring, and access to talent. Other services that were chosen and will be delivered by the X-Europe programme were growth hacking training, incubation (at TNW Amsterdam or TechChill Riga), TNW conference attendance and the pitch competition, acceleration. The partners’ network and expertise will enable X-Europe to provide the spotlight for our startups as well as facilitate the right connections that will foster their future growth.
Take a look at the Smart Cities & Sustainability portfolio to learn more about the solutions being developed.
Heads up!
Open Call 5 for Aerospace & Spacetech is closing on the 30th of June and we are inviting all startups operating with these technologies to seize this opportunity!
X-Europe will also have a final open call focused on FinTech (Expected to start in mid-July 2021).

In: Journal of Molecular Endocrinology, 11 (1). pp. 91-101.Full text not available from this repository. (Request a copy)
Abstract
Inhibition of aromatase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of oestradiol-17 beta, by the addition of 1,4,6-androstatrien-3,17-dione resulted in a significant increase in the levels of immunoreactive human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) in the medium and tissue. This increase was partially reversed by the simultaneous addition of oestradiol-17 beta. These effects on the levels of immunoreactive hCG were also reflected by the increased levels of mRNA specific for the alpha and beta subunits of hCG following the addition of the aromatase inhibitor. However, addition of tamoxifen resulted in a drastic decrease in the levels of both the messages. Based on these results, it is suggested that the synthesis of hCG is negatively modulated by oestradiol-17 beta in the human placenta.Prince made more than the music of a generation, he made music that defined generations. The world was collectively shocked when they heard that the Purple One passed, possibly from complications due to the flu. You would be hard pressed to find someone he didn’t influence.
Some simply couldn’t even talk about it just now, Clarence Avant, Quincy Jones, Bruno Mars, Trombone Shorty and Janelle Monae amongst them.
Here’s how so many – from every genre of music – reacted.
President Barack Obama took to Facebook with a short memorial, saying in part: .”
And then Erica and Tina Campbell of Mary Mary echoed what many have said over the years: that Prince was a musical giant. “”So sad to hear of [his] passing,” the sisters told EBONY, lamenting the loss to the music industry. “Such a creative genius.”
Tina took it a step further, adding: “Prince is one of thee most creative, innovative, passionate and fearless artist musicians that ever walked the planet. Every artist wants ‘it’ but he actually had ‘it’ and no one watching or listening every doubted it.”
Singer Andra Day remembered the years she spent listening to Prince. “I feel like I lost a member of my family today,” she said. “We grew up listening to Prince in every aspect of our daily lives. His brilliance inspired me to color outside of the lines. He was soul, funk, rock, pop, and all of the above. Myself, and the entire artistic community are indebted to him. What a great loss we have experienced today.”
Then there were the other tributes.

The registered unemployment rate decreased to 8.8% in September from 9.0% in August. The number of unemployed persons decreased 2.6% to 147,434 in September from 151,368 in the previous month.
At the same time, employment fell moderately to 1.528 million persons in September from 1.534 million in the preceding month, data showed. In a separate statement, the Zagreb-based statistics agency said that the average net monthly wage in Croatia grew by a real 3.1% year-on-year in August, after rising by 3.2% in July.
On month, the average net monthly wage added 0.1% to HRK 6,723 (EUR 886) in August, after losing 0.3% in the previous month. The highest average net monthly wage in August, of HRK 10,006, was paid out in the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum.Tax Incentives

The amount of credit available under this program equals 20% of the qualifying expenses of your rehabilitation
Property Tax Exemption
The State Historic Preservation Office administers the County Historic Property Tax Exemption Program in partnership with County Boards of Supervisors.
The program offers a local property tax incentive for the sensitive “substantial rehabilitation” of historic buildings. It includes a 4-year “freeze” on property tax increases, followed by increases of 25% per year for the following four years to adjusted value post rehabilitation.Objectives: To verify if the electrical stimulation (ES) associated with the training of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) as conservative treatment reduces urinary incontinence (UI) in prostatectomy men. Patients and methods: Patients with UI were randomized into two groups: PFM Exercises (PFME group) and electrical stimulation exercises more PFM (EE + EPFM group), with a weekly frequency from twice to 20 sessions. Results: Five of the 20 patients EPFM group and 10 patients in the 15 EE group + EPFM become continents, or no longer needed daily use protectors contain urine lost. Thus, the absolute risk of remaining in EPFM incontinent group was 0.75, whereas in the EE + EPFM group was 0.33. Electrical stimulation reduced the absolute risk of being incontinent at 42%. Relatively, this risk has been reduced from 56% (95% CI = 0.21 to 0.95). Conclusions: The data obtained in this study showed that the combination of electrostimulation the years of MAPs significantly reduced urinary incontinence in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.Spencer Harris

“I mean, it’s really just less is more… For the last year at least I’ve been working on canvases, treating them more as surfaces rather than pictorial space. Meaning that I treat the canvas or the panel like I would treat a wall to adorn with iconography, imagery, stickers, paintings, drawings, collage, posters, yada yada… But I’ve really been focusing on kind of emptying out and curating down the amount of imagery that I include in each image or each painting because I’ve discovered that the more pictoral space and void that I allowed to come through in the work, the tighter the connections and the links in between these images become. I feel like their done now when I feel like I can get this balance between narrative link, improvisational narrative link, and implied nothingness.”City Clerk/Treasurer

For over a decade my aloe plant was the only other living thing that took up space in my condo. Aloe plants make the best kind of partner; they aren’t too needy, but they are reliable and strong. I treasured my aloe, even using it as a Christmas tree for a few years. No judgement please! About two years ago I added one more plant to the family, a money tree (hoping it would somehow add dollar dollar bills to my account). When I transitioned from the condo to my new home I envisioned what I wanted my new space to look and feel like. Tapping into the lifestyle of hygge and Feng Shui I knew I had to add more life to my home, so I turned to plants! Consequently, curating a space that feeds my soul mentally, physically and spiritually.
In less than I year I have gone from 3 plants to almost 30 and about 90% of them are alive and healthy! These little green creatures have become my babies. They have added life and a peacefulness that you can feel as soon as you walk through the door. The act of keeping them alive has become a weekly mindfulness practice. I observe the light, their leaves and their stature. To my surprise, it’s been enlightening to learn about the living energy of plants. We all know that plants provide oxygen, but in the practice of Feng Shui did you know they can bring you protection, money and peace?
Those who know me, know I will go to a class on just about anything. Let me tell y’all something, plants aint cheap! So, as soon as I bought my first $50 plant I knew I needed to learn a little something about lighting, soil and feeding these green babies. I have taken three free classes to figure out which plants need the least amount of light and water! I have one diva plant that I added to the family and only because it is SUCH a cutie, it is the infamous fiddle leaf fig.
To date here are my favorite low maintenance plants:
Favorite book is Wild At Home by Hilton Carter.
You can’t go wrong with any of these four plants. I have added a variety of plants to my collection, but always keeping in mind the amount of watering needed and light. For those who like artificial plants, try adding a Zz plant to your home. It’s BEAUTIFUL and easy to care for. Need a new birthday gift idea, instead of giving someone a birthday gift they will not use consider giving a plant!

The court, however, disagreed concluding that it can determine the trade secret status of the materials just as it would any secular work by comparing the material to what is generally known to the public, considering whether plaintiff derived economic value from the nondisclosure, and evaluating whether plaintiff took reasonable measures to maintain the secrecy of the information. Quoting from an earlier case, the court said:
"While the trade secret laws did not necessarily develop to allow a religion to protect a monopoly in its religious practices, the laws have nonetheless expanded such that [a religious entity's] techniques, [if] 'used in the operation of the enterprise,' are deserving of protection if secret and valuable."The court then added:
A defendant cannot deprive a plaintiff's materials of trade secret protection simply by invoking the Free Exercise Clause through allegations that the materials overlap with religious doctrinal principles.Publishing with a purpose

I have fewer goals this go around to limit my stress level. I’ve been very stressed out in the past few months and need a break from it all.
So here are my goals:
~Publish Ever Touched on May 1st (on track to complete as of right now)
~Add 10k to Covenant
~Start formulating a plan for Fireborn (looks like a rewrite as of right now)
~Drink a glass of water 5x a week
~Start working on FYFB class once things settle down
And that’s it! No exercise-related goals yet because I seem to have reinjured my knee. 😦 Once that gets worked out, I may add an exercise-related goal to the mix.
I would also like to add in some mental downtime per week. I’m not making it an official goal, but we’ll see once Ever Touched is published. I had some of that with Guild Wars, but since I’ve been so busy with edits and such, I haven’t been able to play this week at all. So we will see on that as well.

How human migration patterns shaped the response to anthrax disease
Now more than ever, it is important think about not only how our societies influence the emergence and distribution of global pathogens, but also how pathogens have shaped human evolution—or the process of human-pathogen coevolution. For our study, now published in in Nature Communications, we sought to characterize how historic geographic localization of pathogens and human migration patterns influenced the response to pathogens in modern humans. Our model for this was the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, which produces the toxin that induces anthrax disease. The primary host of anthrax disease is not humans, but rather grazing ruminants such as cattle or other herd animals. Humans can be exposed to anthrax bacteria or anthrax toxin when they come into contact with infected ruminants, often in the context of agriculture, hunting or processes of animal pelts.
It is likely that Bacillus pathogens causative for anthrax disease evolved in sub-Saharan Africa, where early humans in Africa were most likely exposed to the pathogen as hunter-gatherer cultures emerged. B. anthracis radiated into Europe and the middle east around 3-6ka, well after human migration out of Africa and around the globe. The timeframe of B. anthracis becoming endemic outside of Africa corresponds closely to the expansion of Neolithic agricultural practices and was likely carried to Europe and the middle east during this process. This was then followed much later by movement of B. anthracis out of Europe alongside colonization and global trade practices. The repeated timeframes of exposure makes anthrax disease a great model for human-pathogen co-evolution because differences in response to anthrax toxin can be correlated with the historic exposure timeline.
Our interest in anthrax disease began when anthrax toxin receptor 2 (ANTXR2) emerged as one of the genes most differentially expressed between humans and non-human primate immune cells in an earlier study (1). ANTXR2 is a receptor present on all cells that allows the toxins produced by B. anthracis to enter cells and cause cell death and misregulation of the immune response. Greater ANTXR2 expression is known to increase sensitivity to anthrax toxins, suggesting that a human loss of ANTXR2 expression could be an adaptive change in response to anthrax exposure. Thus, our work aimed to study how repeated intermittent exposures to anthrax disease drove selection for reduced ANTXR2 gene expression in immune cells.
We found a human-specific decrease of ANTXR2 expression compared to non-human primates in several types of immune cells, including CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, our study showed that expression of ANTXR2 is anti-correlated with cell viability suggesting that non-human primates may be more susceptible to anthrax disease than humans due to the expression of this receptor. We characterized the gene regulatory landscape at the ANTXR2 locus and found a decrease of chromatin contacts along with reduced activity of cis-regulatory elements in humans compared to non-human primates, providing a mechanism for this human-specific decrease in ANTXR2.
Cis-regulatory elements significantly decreased in humans around ANTXR2. Image edited from (2).
In addition to the significant difference between human and non-human primate expression of ANTXR2 in immune cells, we also found a large amount of variability in expression among individual humans and among human organ systems. There is significantly greater expression of ANTXR2 in hunter-gather populations compared to agrarian populations within Africa, consistent with initial adaption to B. anthracis occurring prior to the pathogen’s movement out of Africa (3). Humans with northern and western European ancestry (CEU) display reduced expression of the receptor in tissues important for anthrax pathogenesis compared to the CHB (Chinese ancestry), JPT (Japanese ancestry), and YRI (Yoruba ancestry) populations. This is in line with previous reports (4) that show decreased sensitivity to anthrax toxins in cell lines derived from CEU compared to CHB, JPT, and YRI. We found evidence of both hard and soft selective sweeps around cis-regulatory elements acting on the ANTXR2 gene that also differed in function between humans and non-human primates. This indicated that selection for decreased expression occurred by targeting ANTXR2 regulatory mechanisms. Together, these results suggest that anthrax disease caused multiple rounds of selective pressure on human populations resulting in distinct disease susceptibility among populations based on their ancestral localization.
Comparison of patterns in human migration, Neolithic culture, and anthrax disease distribution. Image from (2).
Our work on ANTXR2 led us to an increased understanding of how molecular evolution at the level of gene regulation and expression can cause a distinct phenotype—e.g., the response to anthrax disease. The response to anthrax disease was heavily influenced by historic human migration patterns and cultural spread of agricultural practices and trade across the globe. Anthrax disease remains a cause of human mortality in the present and individuals whose ancestors were not heavily exposed to anthrax disease may respond differently than those whose ancestors had repeated exposure.
Many questions remain about this response within the broader scope of historic human migration patterns. The more recent European strain of B. anthracis has become dominant throughout the world, and it would be interesting to see how this has driven evolution in additional human populations. It will be particularly important to tease out how the introduction of European alleles into more isolated populations over the last several hundred years has affected their response to anthrax. Would we see a replicated response as European alleles are introduced to populations along with their cultural practices, mimicking how Neolithic culture spread into Europe thousands of years ago? And what effect would that have on how those individuals respond when they have anthrax disease.
Human-pathogen coevolution has a profound effect on human health. Our research was able to better characterize a small part of how humans evolved in response to anthrax disease and what that means for modern humans. Additional work to understand coevolution may lead to new information for individualized treatments in the future.

I ordered a fried chicken dinner, it came with two sides. I’m always nervous about mac and cheese, so I went with collard greens and yams. They give you any two pieces you want, that was a nice surprise. The chicken was crispy, hot and moist. It was seasoned like my Aunt Sally’s. The collards were okay, better with hot sauce, yams were on point. Next time I’ll try the mac and cheese. They had some smothered turkey wings they looked really good. Definitely worth the trip uptown.

polyModifierCmd encapsulates the generic process and interface with the Maya architecture for creating a command that can modify a polygonal mesh. Although it deals entirely with polygons, it can be extended to other object types in Maya as the DG concepts are closely knit.
This process is as follows:
This part of the process deals only with the geometry or mesh data.
Common to all poly modifier commands, this part of the process contains all the interaction with the Maya architecture regarding construction history, tweaks, and the polyShape node.
Because this is a single action, to apply a modifier to a polyShape node you can make use of the doIt(), undoIt() and redoIt() class structure to implement the class. However, since polyModifierCmd is a subset of MPxCommand, it can derive itself off of MPxCommand so that any derived polyModifierCmd classes will inherit the full command architecture. The only consequence of this is that you cannot override the doIt(), undoIt() and redoIt() methods as they are required by the actual command class to perform the operation. Instead you define our own group of similar methods: doModifyPoly(), undoModifyPoly() and redoModifyPoly().
A derived class can initialize the polyModifierCmd and proceed to call doModifyPoly() inside the doIt() and can then extend the respective capabilities to the undo and redo. The splitUVCmd example shows the implementation of a derived polyModifierCmd command. Below is the class interface for the polyModifierCmd.

In section of the class interface labeled // polyModifierCmd Execution //, notice the corresponding doModifyPoly(), undoModifyPoly() and redoModifyPoly() method definitions. These three methods represent the core of the interface that derived commands will interface with.
polyModifierCmd has three basic stages:
See polyModifierCmd initialization.
See polyModifierCmd preprocessing.
See polyModifierCmd processing.
Of the most importance however is to understand the basic class interface of polyModifierCmd (doModifyPoly(), undoModifyPoly(), redoModifyPoly()).
Before any modifier can be applied to a polyShape node, the polyModifierCmd requires some initialization data to guide the process. This data is distinctive from preprocessing data, since this is the required input to get the ball rolling, while preprocessing data is data extracted from our initial data. There are only two pieces of initialization data necessary to perform the operation, through which all other data can be extracted:
("A modifier", means the actual modification made to the mesh data, exclusive of the manner through which it is applied. For example, the modifier in the case where construction history exists would be applied as a modifier node.)
The polyShape node can be stored in the form of a DAG path. It is recommended that you use a DAG path rather than an MObject since the DAG path is absolute and guaranteed to be pointing to the proper object, whereas the MObject is a handle to an object owned by Maya which could change between calls to a plug-in. The polyShape input is represented in the class interface as:
// Prototypes // void setMeshNode( MDagPath mesh ); MDagPath getMeshNode() const; MDagPath fDagPath; // Implementations // void polyModifierCmd::setMeshNode( MDagPath mesh ) { fDagPath = mesh; } MDagPath polyModifierCmd::getMeshNode() const { return fDagPath; }
The modifier can be applied in two forms:
Applying the modifier through a modifier node requires a DG node type that you can create and connect to the polyShape. Since it provides something tangible to work with, we provide an interface for you to initialize polyModifierCmd with a node type or node name:
// Prototypes // void setModifierNodeType( MTypeId type ); void setModifierNodeName( MString name ); MTypeId getModifierNodeType() const; MString getModifierNodeName() const; virtual MStatus initModifierNode( MObject modifierNode ); bool fModifierNodeTypeInitialized; bool fModifierNodeNameInitialized; MTypeId fModifierNodeType; MString fModifierNodeName; // Implementations // void polyModifierCmd::setModifierNodeType( MTypeId type ) { fModifierNodeType = type; fModifierNodeTypeInitialized = true; } void polyModifierCmd::setModifierNodeName( MString name ) { fModifierNodeName = name; fModifierNodeNameInitialized = true; } MTypeId polyModifierCmd::getModifierNodeType() const { return fModifierNodeType; } MString polyModifierCmd::getModifierNodeName() const { return fModifierNodeName; } MStatus polyModifierCmd::initModifierNode( MObject modifierNode ) { return MS::kSuccess; }
The initModifierNode() method does not have any role in the node type that is created but rather the node creation. Often modifier nodes require an absolute input to tell the node how to modify the data. The splitUVNode, for example, requires a list of UVs to split. The problem that arises here is that if polyModifierCmd creates the node, how does the derived command initialize other data on the node? polyModifierCmd cannot do this because it is indifferent to the modifier—it just knows how to connect it. To get past this problem, we provide a callback in the form of a virtual method for derived commands to override and expect to be executed prior to the use of a modifier node.
In contrast to the modifier node, applying the modifier by direct means provides nothing tangible to store and apply. That is, while a modifier node contains the modification inside an object thereby separating the modification from the polyShape node, a direct modifier does not. Since a direct modifier works directly on the polyShape node and polyModifierCmd needs to be independent of the modification process, we provide a callback to derived commands. This callback would be executed when there is a need for a direct modifier (that is, in the case with no construction history and construction history is turned off). Below, the code for the directModifier callback is present in the form of a virtual method that is called when the polyModifierCmd deems it appropriate.
// Prototypes // virtual MStatus directModifier( MObject mesh ); // Implementations // MStatus polyModifierCmd::directModifier( MObject /* mesh */ ) { return MS::kSuccess; }
Once you have our initialization data you can extract the rest of the data necessary to apply the modifier. In addition to our initialization data you need to know if:
The first piece of information is a check to ensure that you can continue on with the given data. It consists of a check of the initialization of a polyShape node and modifier node information. If the data is invalid, polyModifierCmd cannot continue to execute and returns a failure:
// Prototypes // bool isCommandDataValid() // Implementations // bool polyModifierCmd::isCommandDataValid() { bool valid = true; // Check the validity of the DAG path // if( fDagPathInitialized ) { // Ensure we are pointing to a shape node // fDagPath.extendToShape(); if( !fDagPath.isValid() || fDagPath.apiType != MFn::kMesh ) { valid = false; } } else { valid = false; } // Check the validity of the modifier node type/name. // Can only check that it has been set. // if( !fModifierNodeTypeInitialized && !fModifierNodeNameInitialized ) { valid = false; } }
The next three pieces of information relate to the node state of the polyShape node. Since these three pieces of data require the polyShape node in order to extract out their data, the validity of the polyShape node is required. The data extraction is straightforward and compiled into a single method, collectNodeState:
// Prototypes // void collectNodeState(); // Implementations // void polyModifierCmd::collectNodeState() { MStatus status; // Collect the node state information on the given mesh // // -HasHistory // -HasTweaks // -HasRecordHistory // fDagPath.extendToShape(); MObject meshNodeShape = fDagPath.node(); MFnDependencyNode depNodeFn( meshNodeShape ); // If the inMesh is connected, we have history // MPlug inMeshPlug = depNodeFn.findPlug( "inMesh" ); fHasHistory = inMeshPlug.isConnected(); // Tweaks exist only if the multi "pnts" attribute contains // plugs that contain non-zero tweak values. Use false, // until proven true search pattern. // fHasTweaks = false; MPlug tweakPlug = depNodeFn.findPlug( "pnts" ); if( !tweakPlug.isNull() ) { // ASSERT : tweakPlug should be an array plug // MAssert( tweakPlug.isArray(), "tweakPlug.isArray()" ); MPlug tweak; MFloatVector tweakData; int i; int numElements = tweakPlug.numElements; for( i = 0; i < numElements; i++ ) { tweak = tweakPlug.elementByPhysicalIndex( i, &status ); if( status == MS::kSuccess && !tweak.isNull() ) { // Retrieve the float vector from the plug // getFloat3PlugValue( tweak, tweakData ); if( 0 != tweakData.x || 0 != tweakData.y || 0 != tweakData.z ) { fHasTweaks = true; break; } } } } // Query the constructionHistory command for the preference // of recording history // int result; MGlobal::executeCommand( "constructionHistory –q –tgl", result ); fHasRecordHistory = (0 != result ); }
doModifyPoly() is the most complex piece and the core of the polyModifierCmd. In here all the data is parsed and the appropriate action given. Rather than implementing the entire process in a single method, doModifyPoly() only focuses on quickly scanning the node states and passes control over the appropriate method based on the state:
MStatus polyModifierCmd::doModifyPoly() { MStatus status = MS::kFailure; if( isCommandDataValid() ) { // Get the state of the polyMesh // collectNodeState(); if( !fHasHistory && !fHasRecordHistory ) { MObject meshNode = fDagPath.node(); // Pre-process the mesh – Cache the old mesh // cacheMeshData(); cacheMeshTweaks(); // Call the directModifier // status = directModifier( meshNode ); } else { MObject modifierNode; createModifierNode( modifierNode ); initModifierNode( modifierNode ); connectNodes( modifierNode ); } } }
The skeleton of doModifyPoly() shows the concepts of how to interface with a polyShape node given its state. If you have no history and recording history is turned off, you cache the mesh data for undo purposes (explained with undoModifyPoly()) and proceed to call the directModifier callback. Otherwise the modifierNode approach is taken. Calls are made to create the modifier node, initialize it (through the callback) and subsequently passed on to attempt to connect the nodes.
Note that doModifyPoly() processes only the construction history states. Though tweaks do play a role in the process, they are considered further on in the process separately since they are independent from construction history. The following table shows the code path that is followed based on the node’s construction history state:
The directModifier line of code is implemented by the derived command and as such has nothing complex to worry about. It passes the derived command the mesh node to operate on directly—all the control rests with the derived command.
In contrast, the three other cases regarding history are more involved. Beginning with the creation of the modifierNode:
MStatus polyModifierCmd::createModifierNode( MObject& modifier ) { MStatus status = MS::kFailure; if( fModifierNodeTypeInitialized || fModifierNodeNameInitialized ) { if( fModifierNodeTypeInitialized ) { modifier = fDGModifier.createNode(fModifierNodeType, &status); } else if( fModifierNodeNameInitialized ) { modifier = fDGModifier.createNode(fModifierNodeName, &status); } // Check to make sure that we have a modifier node of the // appropriate type. Requires an inMesh and outMesh // attribute. // MFnDependencyNode depNodeFn( modifier ); MObject inMeshAttr; MObject outMeshAttr; inMeshAttr = depNodeFn.attribute( "inMesh" ); outMeshAttr = depNodeFn.attribute( "outMesh" ); if( inMeshAttr.isNull() || outMeshAttr.isNull() ) { displayError("Invalid Modifier: inMesh/outMesh needed"); status = MS::kFailure; } } return status; }
createModifierNode() uses the initialized data for the modifier node type or modifier node name to create the modifier node via the local DG modifier. Use of the DG modifier is essential to keep the undo/redo relatively simple. Though the DG modifier has not created the node yet, it allows you to queue up actions for that node such as connections, so that once the DG modifier’s doIt() is called everything is executed in order. This helps alleviate rollback issues in case of errors. createModifierNode() also does a few checks to ensure that you have an inMesh and outMesh attribute on the node. Though the names may seem restrictive they keep a standard in the chains of modifier nodes. A helper class named polyModifierNode (discussed in a later section) automatically generates these two key attributes.
Following the createModifierNode() the callback to the initModifierNode() is made through which a derived class can initialize node data. This also lies under the control of the derived command. From there you enter the final stage of the process—connectNodes().
connectNodes() is a larger method which processes all the variables of the polyShape and modifier nodes and connects them. Look at the connectNodes() implementation for a higher level view of what it controls:
MStatus polyModifierCmd::connectNodes( MObject& modifierNode ) { MStatus status; // Declare our internal processing data structure // modifyPolyData data; // Get the mesh node attrs and plugs // status = processMeshNode( data ); MCheckStatus( status, "processMeshNode" ); // Get the upstream node attrs and plugs // status = processUpstreamNode( data ); MCheckStatus( status, "processUpstreamNode" ); // Get the modifierNode attributes // status = processModifierNode( modifierNode, data ); MCheckStatus( status, "processModifierNode" ); // Process the tweaks on the meshNode // status = processTweaks( data ); MCheckStatus( status, "processTweaks" ); // Connect the nodes // if( fHasTweaks ) { status = fDGModifier.connect( data.upstreamNodeShape, data.upstreamNodeSrcAttr, data.tweakNode, data.tweakNodeDestAttr ); MCheckStatus( status, "upstream-tweak connect" ); status = fDGModifier.connect( data.tweakNode, data.tweakNodeSrcAttr, modifierNode, data.modifierNodeDestAttr ); MCheckStatus( status, "tweak-modifier connect" ); } else { status = fDGModifier.connect( data.upstreamNodeShape, data.upstreamNodeSrcAttr, modifierNode, data.modifierNodeDestAttr ); MCheckStatus( status, "upstream-modifier connect" ); } status = fDGModifier.connect( modifierNode, data.modifierNodeSrcAttr, data.meshNodeShape, data.meshNodeDestAttr ); MCheckStatus( status, "modifier-mesh connect" ); status = fDGModifier.doIt(); return status; }
connectNodes() is broken down into several subsections. First a general processing data structure is constructed. This contains all of the processing variables required between each of the processing methods. The structure was created to reduce the amount of argument passing between processing methods. From there a set of processing methods are called to collect the necessary data to connect the nodes and also to process node state specific intricacies. Following that it uses the collected data to connect the nodes.
For details on each of the processing methods that follow, refer to the source code in polyModifierCmd.cpp, which is documented thoroughly.
The first process method that the connectNodes() runs through is processMeshNode(). It processes all that’s necessary of the polyShape node, which is comprised of the node shape, node transform and connection data (the inMesh plug and attribute). This data is stored inside the passed in modifyPolyData data structure to be used further on in the other process methods. The order that these process methods are run is important.
For the second process method, processUpstreamNode(), there is a difference between the history exists case and the history does not exist case. connectNodes() is only called in the case where history exists or the case where history does not exist but history recording is turned on. The reason for this is that in each of those cases, the addition of history is permissible and more stable and flexible so we process it that way.
If history already exists, processUpstreamNode() uses the inMesh plug obtained in processMeshNode() to retrieve the node directly upstream from the polyShape node. Once you’ve obtained the node, you disconnect the node from the polyShape node so that you’re prepared to insert the modifier node further on. Since all DG connections take place between the mesh node and the upstream node you only retrieve the outMesh plug and attribute for connections further on.
If history does not exist, you need to create the history chain. At the start of each history chain there is a hidden intermediate node that represents the initial state of the polyShape node at the time history was created. processUpstreamNode() does this by calling an MFnDagNode::duplicate() on the polyShape node. Since the duplicate() method also creates a new transform for the duplicate shape, you re-parent the shape node under the same transform as the original shape and delete the transform through the DAG modifier. To the DG, this duplicate shape node behaves the same as the upstream node processed in the case where history exists. That is, all connections take place between this duplicate shape node and the original shape node. Thus you set the upstream node information to the duplicate shape and retrieve the outMesh plug and attribute for connections further on.
Like processMeshNode() the third process method, processModifierNode(), retrieves the inMesh and outMesh attributes of the modifier node for the connection of the nodes at the base of connectNodes().
Because of history, tweaks need to be extracted prior to the addition of the modifier node to maintain the order of operations. So if tweaks exist, you go through two stages:
Begin by creating a tweak node (polyTweak) to store the tweaks and begin to parse the pnts attribute for tweaks. The tweaks are individually cached into a class array member for undo purposes as well as in a local MObject array for the purposes of transferring over to the tweak node. Although tweaks are composed of the vector arrays that you just extracted, that is not all that you must account for during the extraction. Tweaks are stored on a pnts attribute. As an attribute in the DG, it can also contain connections. These connections must be preserved and transferred over to the tweak node to maintain the DG structure.
In addition to each vector array, you extract a plug array of each node that is connected to the pnts attribute as well as each plug in the pnts attribute that is connected. Note that each attribute in the pnts array attribute is a compound attribute. Each attribute in the compound attribute is associated with a single axial translation for the given vertex tweak vector (that is, x, y, z).
Once you’ve extracted the data, you apply the tweak vectors on the polyTweak node and reconnect any connections on each tweak vector. Now you have a tweak node that is ready to be connected to the history stream. But if you connect it as is, you would expect the resulting mesh to have double the tweaks. This is because the tweaks have not been removed from the mesh node. So the tweaks would be applied twice, once from the tweak node and once from the mesh node. However, recall that you used an MObject array to retrieve the plugs. These retrieved an MObject reference to the compound plug that was contained in the array attribute. Setting these back onto the tweak node moved them over to the tweak node. There is a large segment of code that is commented out in processTweaks() that removes the tweaks from the mesh node. Executing this code gives the same result, however it slows down the performance with no apparent benefit.
Like the other process methods, processTweaks() also retrieves connection data for the tweak node to allow connectNodes() to connect all the nodes.
All the necessary nodes have been set up and the connection data extracted. The node connections are set up via MDGModifier::connect() calls. And all the operations are executed via a final MDGModifier::doIt() call. From there you can implement undo support by calling the undoIt() in the opposite order that the DG modifiers were executed in, and implement redo support as the doIt() calls in the same order as before. This is accomplished since the DG modifier caches all the executions that it made. Likewise, polyModifierCmd caches all the necessary data through the doModifyPoly() call. This leaves the undoModifyPoly() and redoModifyPoly() relatively simple.
undoModifyPoly is very similar to the doModifyPoly() method in structure and level of abstraction. It looks at the scenario from which it is being called (that is, node states) and caters the control over to the appropriate methods:
MStatus polyModifierCmd::undoModifyPoly() { MStatus status; if( !fHasHistory && !fHasRecordHistory ) { status = undoDirectModifier(); } else { fDGModifier.undoIt(); // undoCachedMesh() must be called prior to // undoTweakProcessing() because undoCachedMesh() // copies the original mesh without tweaks back // onto the existing mesh. Any changes made before // the copy will be lost. // if( !fHasHistory ) { status = undoCachedMesh(); fDagModifier.undoIt(); } status = undoTweakProcessing(); } return status; }
The undoDirectModifier is not as simple as directModifier. Since polyModifierCmd is not aware of what the directModifier does, it must revert the entire mesh back into its original state. It does this through a unique use of MObject handles, making use of the knowledge of how MObjects work.
MObjects are said to be handles to internal objects owned by Maya. That is partly true. MObjects are handles, but Maya does not always own them. There are certain objects in Maya that are reference counted. That is, for each reference to the object a count is incremented. Once each reference is deleted the count is decremented until it reaches zero where the object is deleted. It’s like an object that lives only if it is being used. MObjects may refer to such reference counted objects that increment the reference count. Thus even though Maya owns these objects, you can have some control over the lifetime of that object by holding onto the MObject handle to such an object. For other types of objects the general tip for not hanging onto an MObject is valid and still highly recommended as the data can change between calls to a plug-in (for example, a deleted node).
The types of data that are reference counted are objects classified under the MFnData and MFnComponent class hierarchy. Fortunately the MFnData object type includes the entire contents of a mesh. Using this concept as a foundation for backing up a mesh we can properly undo the direct modifier.
cacheMeshData() caches the data on the use of the mesh prior to the directModifier(). Caching the mesh data makes use of the MObject concept (see undoDirectModifier()). To make a backup of the data you must be careful not to retrieve the reference to the current object, as you will then be holding onto a reference of possibly dirtied data. To get around this duplicate the current mesh and retrieve an MFnData object by extracting an MObject off the outMesh attribute of the duplicate mesh. The MObject that you retrieved is a reference to the original mesh data and thus it increases the reference count. To make this transparent to the user finish up by deleting the nodes created by the duplicate. Note that this does not delete the mesh data since you now have a reference to it.
This method is similar to the processTweaks() method except it does not deal with tweak nodes. Instead it parses the pnts attribute and extracts the tweak vectors into the tweak cache data members.
You can put the caching of data required to backup our mesh to use in undoDirectModifier(). There is a distinct difference in the data flow of a polyShape node with tweaks and without. This directly affects the way the backup mesh is reapplied.
Tweaks affect the point of reapplication of the backup mesh for reasons of the data flow inside the node. For a node without tweaks you can set the value of the outMesh to the backup mesh.
For a node with tweaks you have to use a trick to force the copy of the backup mesh to the cachedInMesh to keep the node in sync. In this case you duplicate the polyShape node, set the outMesh of the duplicate shape to the backup mesh, and then connect the duplicate shape node to the original node. After forcing an evaluation, disconnect the duplicate shape node and delete it. This implicitly forces the outMesh to hold the backup mesh. Then reapply the initial tweaks to the node via undoTweaksProcessing, forcing the node to copy the backup mesh to the cachedInMesh and perform the internal node synchronization.
For the case where connectNodes() needs to be undone, the MDGModifier::undoIt() method recalls all the connections and nodes created by connectNodes(). Recall that processUpstreamNode() also made use of a DAG modifier in the case where there was no history initially. In this case you need to perform some extra operations prior to calling the MDagModifier::undoIt().
The reason for this is that since you created history and you’re undoing the operation you need to remove history. Removing is straightforward, however the node’s outMesh attribute still holds the last known evaluation of the node—it still contains the modifier. As a result you need to undo the "cached" mesh on the node. To do this, call the method undoCachedMesh(). Following the restoration of the mesh data, restore the tweaks leaving ~ with the original mesh.
Similar to the undoDirectModifier() case, the operations contained in undoCachedMesh() are dependent on the presence of tweaks due to the change in data flow through the node. This is because you are reverting to a node without history and you need to restore the mesh by directly interfacing with the node.
For the case where tweaks do not exist, you only need to restore the outMesh since it becomes the geometry that represents the node. To do this, use the duplicate shape node that was created to start a history chain (recall that this is only done if history was not initially present). Retrieve the outMesh of the duplicate shape node and copy that mesh data over to the outMesh of the shape node, restoring the node to its initial state.
For the case where tweaks do exist, you need to access the node in a similar manner to the way undoDirectModifier handles the tweaks case, however this time you don’t need to duplicate the shape node since you already have one. Similarly reconnect the outMesh of the duplicate shape to the inMesh of the original shape through a local DG modifier and force a DG evaluation. Then undo the connection via the same DG modifier. The original mesh data is subsequently forced into the outMesh prior to the reapplication of tweaks whereupon the outMesh will be copied to the cachedInMesh.
redoModifyPoly() is straightforward because doModifyPoly() initialized and set up all that was necessary for the operation. redoModifyPoly() holds a similar structure to its counterparts. For the directModifier() case, the doModifyPoly() recalls that method without caching any of the mesh data again, since the class already has it. Otherwise, in the connectNodes() case, it recalls the MDGModifier::doIt() to redo the operations previously set up by doModifyPoly():
MStatus polyModifierCmd::redoModifyPoly() { MStatus status = MS::kSuccess; if( !fHasHistory && !fHasRecordHistory ) { MObject meshNode = fDagPath.node(); // Call the directModifier – No need to pre-process the // mesh data again. // status = directModifier( meshNode ); } else { // Call the redo on the DG and DAG modifiers // if( !fHasHistory ) { status = fDagModifier.doIt(); } status = fDGModifier.doIt(); } return status; }
With a general understanding of what polyModifierCmd is capable of, we are faced with the issue of how to implement a command based on it. The rules are fairly straightforward. polyModifierCmd structures its process in a similar manner as Maya treats its nodes. It is here where the concept of a factory is introduced. The following sections introduce the polyModifierFty and polyModifierNode in the context of implementing a command based on polyModifierCmd. For further details on how these work, please see the respective source file.
From the inner workings of polyModifierCmd, you see that there are two spots where we could potentially have redundant code: directModifier() and inside the modifier node. Effectively they do the same thing, except have a different means of retrieving their inputs. To reduce code duplication, the concept of a factory is introduced. The factory exists solely as a class structure which implements a modification to a mesh. It possesses a basic interface through which the modifier can be called.
To help guide you, a base factory class named polyModiferFty is provided from which a factory can be derived. Though it serves no functional purpose, it provides an outline through which you can implement your modification:
class polyModifierFty { public: polyModifierFty(); virtual ~polyModifierFty(); // Pure virtual doIt() // virtual MStatus doIt() = 0; };
Similar to polyModifierFty, another guidance class is provided to give a framework for all modifier nodes to be used in association with polyModifierCmd. This class suggests things such as, the modifier node requires an inMesh and outMesh attribute to work:
class polyModifierNode { public: polyModifierNode(); virtual ~polyModifierNode(); // There needs to be an MObject handle declared for // each attribute that the node will have. These handles // are needed for getting and setting the attribute // values later. // static MObject inMesh; static MObject outMesh; };
For further details on implementing a polyModifierCmd command, refer to both the splitUVCmd example (next) and the source code. Inside the source code a general set of guidelines for each class is provided.Andersson, R;

Abstract
A review of all patients treated for acute cholecystitis (n = 5848) during an 18-year period (1969-1986) at two hospitals (one practising early surgery in patients with acute cholecystitis and the other not) disclosed that 104 (1.8%) had bile within the abdominal cavity at surgery; 71 with a visible perforation of the gallbladder and 33 without. The bile was infected in 82% of performed cultures (most commonly with Escherichia coli). Mortality was 7.7% (8/104 patients), being 20% (4/20) in the hospital practising delayed surgery and 5% (4/84) in the hospital practising early surgery (p less than 0.10). Infectious complications were responsible for the deaths by leading to multiple organ failure with pulmonary or renal insufficiency or gastro-intestinal bleeding. The timing of surgery was the only factor that had prognostic significance, i.e. the longer the hospital delay before surgery the higher the mortality, although elderly patients or patients with perforation tended to have a worse prognosis. In conclusion, the results of this study indicated that early surgery is important in patients with acute cholecystitis as a means of lowering mortality in bile peritonitis in this condition.Here's How to Book The Safest Room in a Hotel (Video)

The space agency said they had sent the rider for a closer look at the strange object. The rock was nicknamed by an agency – the little Colonsay & And was first detected when Robert took a broad picture of the Mars landscape. NASA said in a statement: "One of the examples we are trying to see better is Little Colonsai. "The planning team thinks it could be a meteorite because it's so brilliant.
"But looks can deceive, and the proof only comes from chemistry."
They added: "Unfortunately, the small target missed the previous attempt, and with this information, Curiosity will try again."
Curiosity operators will now use ChemCam with six wheels, which will allow them to continue exploring the rock.
ChemCam shoots laser at the rocks and stones found at a distance and analyzes the elementary component of vaporised materials from areas smaller than 1mm on the surface of Mars rocks such as soils.
The spectrograph then provides the agency with details on minerals and microstructures in rocks.
This is done by measuring the resulting plasma composition, a very hot gas made of free floating ions and electrons.
The camera has been programmed to solve features 5 to 10 times smaller than those visible with cameras on Mars two of the Mars exploration Rovers that first began exploring the Red Planet in January 2004.
NASA has some rocks they are eager to explore.
One of them is called "Flanders Moss", a rock that NASA shows shows "an interesting, dark colored coating, which chemistry is required to confirm its nature."
Curiosity was recently re-established due to software and hardware problems and moved to its free A-Side computers in October, after memory studies were deleted in September.
This allowed engineers to diagnose the problem while the robot continued to walk on its operations.
Part of the party was quarantined while Rover continued to store data on the unaffected side.

“This is not a protest against downtown or capitalism,” said Ivan Parra, lead organizer of Durham CAN. “If you are here for that, you’re on the wrong flight.
“This is an explanation of what’s happened in downtown and what it can become. If we don’t work together, it could become unaffordable and very white. But this is not an effort to blame elected officials. There’s not a single person here who doesn’t enjoy the amenities of downtown.”
So with Parra’s advisement that the audience tuck away any copies of Das Kapital, Mel Norton of the Durham People’s Alliance and Durham CAN outlined economic data that shows the enormous growth that has occurred downtown over the past 15 years.
In 1993, the year Downtown Durham, Inc. organized to advocate for an economic revival of the central business district, the Old Bull building at Blackwell and Pettigrew streets was slathered in aluminum siding. Empty storefronts created dead zones along Main and Chapel Hill streets. The old tobacco warehouses were abandoned.
Like many U.S. cities in the mid-20th century, Durham was reaping the karma of poor planning (the Downtown Loop, one-way streets), white flight and a job exodus to the suburbs, on top of a disinvestment in its urban core.
But, as Norton said, “The landscape of issues has changed since 1993.”
- According to DDI data, in 1993, 3,800 people worked downtown; by 2015, that figure had increased to 16,500.
- Over the same time period, the number of residential units grew from 112 to 1,700.
- Likewise, 1.1 million people visited downtown in 1993, compared with 2.3 million last year.
- There was less than 1 million square feet of commercial space in 1993, and only 70 percent of it was occupied; in 2015, there was 3 million, with an occupancy rate of 93 percent.
Downtown boundaries have expanded to reach Buchanan Avenue and Golden Belt to the west and east; the Durham Freeway and Trinity Avenue to the south and north. That explosive growth, Norton said, requires us to “advocate for an inclusive central city.”
“We are at the end of the beginning,” said Geoff Durham, president and CEO of DDI. “The next wave becomes a lot more complex.”
Those complexities came to light last year, when DDI held public input sessions for the next iteration of its master plan, due out this spring. The obvious concerns — parking, walkability, green space and connectivity — were trumped by the smoldering issue of racial and economic diversity, particularly as it relates to local businesses and housing. “This is what we received the most feedback about,” Durham said.
“Without this diversity, downtown becomes generic, a downtown in a box,” Durham said. “It needs to be affordable for people — where they work, live and the goods they buy. A sustainable downtown has a wide array of options, starting with free events all the way to fancy restaurants. If you have only a certain type of experiences, then you have a moat around downtown.”
The doling out of tax incentives to high-end projects and out-of-town developers has concerned many social and economic justice advocates. However, incentives are a state push as much as a city one. In the past, Durham, like many North Carolina cities, negotiated with outside companies from position of weakness, as the textile and tobacco industries folded. The state pushed economic incentives and tax breaks as a way to lure new, high-wage industries, particularly biotech, to its cities.
On that point, the strategy succeeded. Since 2000, public and private investment in downtown has totaled $1.2 billion. Tax credits and incentives, the latter granted only after the projects are complete and generating additional property tax revenue —helped Durham and the private sector upfit old tobacco warehouses, which became the American Tobacco Campus — a life science and technology hub — and West Village.
In the past three years, the city and county have awarded tax incentives — to be paid only after the projects are finished and achieve certain project-specific benchmarks — to six additional ventures:
- The 21c Museum Hotel (Cost, $48 million; tax incentives, $5.7 million, city; $2 million, county)
- Durham Hotel (Cost, $11 million; incentives, $1.2 million, city)
- Residence Inn at Marriott (Cost, $29.5 million; incentives, $1.3 million city; $400,000 county)
- City Center, skyscraper and Jack Tar motel (Total cost, $85 million; incentives, $3.9 million, city)
- Durham Innovation District (Cost, $87 million; incentives, $5.25 million, city)
- Chesterfield building (Cost, $80 million; incentives $6 million, city; $1.2 million, county)
Durham of DDI said several questions factor into whether a project receives incentives.
“We have to ask, When is right time to incentivize something? Does the project meet the goals of the Downtown Master Plan? Does it ensures racial and economic diversity downtown? Does it make sense for taxpayers? And is the incentive necessary for the project?”
Those questions become more critical in the city's negotiations now that “Downtown is holding some cards. Commercial developers are salivating,” Durham said. “There’s feeding frenzy and we have to stay ahead of it. We have a position of authority, and we should get something invested back into the community.”
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
While commercial projects have received generous local, state and federal tax credits incentives, the city nor the county has awarded these subsidies for downtown residential projects; state legislation prohibits or restricts each from doing so.
Nonetheless, local governments have become creative in wooing developers to building affordable housing. For example, an affordable housing density bonus — allowing extra units to be built despite lower density zoning — is pending for a development near Duke Street and I-85.
In addition, the city and county have subsidized several affordable housing developments, if not in downtown, then on its edge.
The city contributed $11 million in tax incentives and land acquisition costs for the first phase of redevelopment of Southside neighborhood, which is less than a half-mile from downtown. Here, at the Lofts at Southside, 80 of 132 apartments are affordable for people earning 60, 50 even 30 percent of the area median household income, which is $50,000.
That partnership with McCormack Baron Salazar on the Lofts, formerly known as Rolling Hills, was funded in part by tens of millions of dollars of city and federal funding -- a number that, based on pre-project conversations, could exceed the amount of the downtown incentives in recent years combined.
Another $4 million in city funding is slated for Phase II.
The city awarded $600,000 in incentives for the Whitted School redevelopment, an affordable housing complex for seniors, plus a pre-K site. The county kicked in $2.3 million, and Durham Public Schools, another $5.8 million.
Durham Community Land Trustees, aided by city funds, rehabbed several affordable rental homes at Scout and Piedmont streets. Deed restrictions mean the homes will remain affordable. And the city recently issued a request for proposals for the construction of 19 additional homes in the neighborhood.
Some of the property tax revenue from six market-rate houses built by BW Wallace, which are selling for at least $265,000 on Enterprise Street, an area called "the tipping point," will be used to build four affordable homes nearby.
Incentives are available for other homes in the neighborhood. While those properties sell for the same price, subsidies offset some of the cost, helping prospective low-income homeowners buy a house. Elizabeth Gregory purchased a house in Southside this way. “I could not have afforded a home without it,” she said.
However, the goals for racial diversity have failed in some of these developments, which raises concerns for future projects downtown. On the Southside, the renters are majority African-American, but the homeowners are not. At last count, 24 of 25 homeowners in the new Southside houses are white.
Ray Eurquhart has lived on the South Side for all of his 67 years. He was born near Merrick Street, where the remains of Fayette Place lie. “We’re concerned about the lack of diversity,” he said.
The city should have enlisted community leaders to reach out to the churches in order to court more prospective African-American homeowners, he said. "Why didn’t we reach out to them?” There are 12 African-American churches in the area, “and young people want to live close to them.”
A nationwide cultural shift has whetted the public’s appetite to live downtown, which in turn, has sparked the local conversation about the need for affordable housing in the city center. Although local governments have few options to encourage developers to build affordable housing on private land, local officials can place stipulations on city- or county-owned property.
Downtown, three city- or county-owned parcels provide opportunities for affordable housing, either alone or as part of a mixed-use development.
- A county-owned parking lot on East Main Street between First Presbyterian Church and
St. Philip’s Episcopal Church;
- Four acres owned by the county near Dillard and Pettigrew streets;
- A little more than an acre of city-owned land adjacent to the Durham Transportation Center, likely to be opened up to an RFP this year;
- And though it’s still in private hands, potentially Fayette Place.
Built in 1967, Fayette Place was supposed to be replacement housing for those displaced by the construction of the Durham Freeway. Eventually it became public housing, run by the Durham Housing Authority, for low-income households.
But in the mid-2000s, DHA became saddled with a $1 million debt to the federal government because of several unapproved financial transactions regarding Fayette Place and DHA’s for-profit development offshoot. Most of the residents left or were relocated, and by 2007, only a few squatters remained in the abandoned buildings.
That year, DHA sold the property to a private developer out of Birmingham, Ala., Campus Apartments. The company razed the buildings in 2009 with plans to build housing for nearby North Carolina Central University students. Instead, the company did nothing, invested nothing, and the property has languished, even after the recession.
City Councilman Steve Schewel was among five elected officials — council members Don Moffitt and Jillian Johnson and county commissioners Wendy Jacobs and Ellen Reckhow — who went on the subsidy tour. He explained that Campus Apartments’ option expires in August 2017. If it has made no movement on the property by then, DHA can buy back property for either the sale price — $4 million — or the market rate, whichever is greater.
But, Schewel said, “DHA doesn’t have the money. It needs help from the city. Our ability to get this is uncertain. But you can see what an opportunity this is.”
Fayette Place is near a proposed light-rail stop, and close to downtown, social services, a branch library, a JobLink Center, N.C. Central and the Lincoln Health clinic.
Pastor Lucas pointed to the slabs and broken brick behind him. “This is a wonderful opportunity to take the land and build up Hayti.”
No artisan sells their goods cheaply: it would put them out of business. That's why you go to Costco or Walmart for lower cost goods. If it's going to be in anyone's interest to invest money in developing low cost downtown real estate, then the real estate has to be developed in bulk: hundreds of $50K apartments on a single small footprint (built up, not out, to save on land cost). If we want that kind of real estate in downtown, then we can have affordable real estate. If not, good luck convincing property owners to sell or rent their properties way below market value.

The edge of downtown, indeed.
Southside: "Look over there! Downtown - it's only 1/2 mile away. How do we get there?"
Fayette Place: "This is great! We're near downtown. Right? Isn't that downtown? Where am I?"
Posted by: Erik Landfried | January 31, 2016 at 10:58 PM
@Erik: Do you think it's a stretch to think of Southside (5 minute walk to American Tobacco) or Fayette Place as being a part of a "greater" downtown? I certainly include Ninth Street in my conceptualization of the city's core. Not downtown per se, but living there makes downtown highly accessible.
There are some opportunities to add affordability downtown; many more on the outside of downtown, in places like these. If we treat those as unnecessarily inferior, I think we discount valuable opportunities to add equitable options in the central district.
Posted by: Kevin Davis | February 01, 2016 at 06:39 AM
I think they could both be considered part of greater downtown someday, but until safe access to downtown from both places is addressed, they will never feel connected to downtown in any meaningful way. We need affordable transportation just as much as we need affordable housing. The Freeway and the giant streets that feed it like Roxboro, Mangum, and Fayetteville present an enormous barrier to making these places part of a greater downtown.
Posted by: Erik | February 01, 2016 at 08:38 AM
We live in one of the new houses in Southside with our four children ranging in age from 9-15 and walk regularly to the American Tobacco Campus. It doesn't feel far away or difficult to get to at all. From there it again doesn't feel like much of a walk to get into the heart of downtown. I'm confused as to how the access from where we are to downtown is unsafe. It certainly doesn't strike us that way. We have lived in more urban environments than this though so maybe we see it differently than those for whom this is an urban as they have ever experienced.

I've been reading for some time on affordable housing in Durham and my opinion has changed some as I have educated myself.
That said, the one thing I still don't understand is why there is such a 'push' for the overwhelming majority of affordable housing to be downtown? That makes no sense to me. I would think the entire community would benefit by spreading out the affordable housing across the city and/or county. I am sure the first reply with be transportation but a large number of people that move in these units have cars.
I'd like to see economic diversity throughout the city and not just downtown. What am I missing here?
Posted by: Eric | February 01, 2016 at 11:43 AM
@Kevin and/or Lisa:
I must be missing something or mis-reading the article. It sounded like the city spent $11 million and we are getting 80 units of affordable housing. By my math that's $137,500 per unit.
Posted by: Jeff Bakalchuck | February 01, 2016 at 11:59 AM
Eric – these are great questions. Despite all the rhetoric, affordable housing has always been provided at the fringe of cities. Where cities are allowed to grow, they stay affordable. Where cities are restricted, they become unaffordable. Durham's determination to create affordable housing downtown is a market manipulation, and is certain to have SOME negative effect. At its worst, it is a gross misallocation of very limited resources: should we provide 2 suburban families a house OR 1 childless couple a downtown condominium? That's a legitimate question, and Council needs to be asking itself the same questions you've asked here.

I'm happy to see that affordable housing is actually being discussed, at least. I agree with some of the comments that transportation is almost as important as housing when planning. Location can be more flexible than just "downtown", meaning the actual Center of It All. But not sprawl. Infill may be feasible or even preferred.
I am an older woman with a dwindling IRA. I will be living on Soc. Sec., only, in 5-8 years and apartments are very hard to find in the 700/mo range. (That would be 50% of my SS.) Subsidized sr. housing is limited and some of it looks in disrepair to me. What to do?
Posted by: Geraldine Conley | February 01, 2016 at 08:12 PM
@Kim, I was thinking more about the apartments that were built on the corner of Roxboro and Lakewood - that's the intersection I linked to in my comment. And it's a very difficult one to cross on foot. If you're talking about houses closer to South St, then I agree that walk is pretty good, but that is much lower density than the stuff east of Roxboro, right?
Posted by: Erik Landfried | February 01, 2016 at 08:24 PM
Housing is less expensive as you move away employment centers which in Durham is north and east. There are hidden costs to living further out (yes...gas is cheaper now) like needing a personal vehicle for EVERY situation in your life. This is an expense along with emergency maintenance that can stretch any budget and can lead to cycles of predatory lending.
We need affordable (40 - 80% AMI) AND workforce (80-120% AMI...my definitions...not scientific) housing options near employment centers and transit stops. I'm not talking about the typical LIHTC project here that is a mixed "low"-income property but market rate with a certain number of subsidized units.
We are providing less and less subsidy to attract development and investment downtown but we should be using those dollars to create an inclusive downtown. Left to market forces alone...there would be nowhere for people of modest means to easily get to work. There would be high-rent apartments and public housing with a huge gap in between.

Does anyone have any idea what is proposed for the abandoned lot of Fayette Place? I am looking at a property (restored home) on Umstead St. My motivation for living near downtown is my lifestyle but I would like to see a return of my investment later on if I chose to sell. I get concerned with the failures of socially engineered housing (I.e. Rolling Hills, Fayette Place) and wouldn't want to invest in a home if they're going to be building low income housing projects again in the same place. I would hope if the Campus Apartment deal expires and DHA buys back the property they've learned their lesson. Personally I would rather have a private developer with an option for some affordable units to take over and raise the property value of the surrounding neighborhoods.
Posted by: Rob | February 03, 2016 at 09:29 PM
@Rob-
There's really nothing proposed as of now, except it seems like it certainly won't be the campus apartments as the option expires soon. That site was a proposed location for police dept HQ, but the city chose the area next to the county's human services building instead.
DHA has a large number of units aging out over the next decade, so I would assume that we'll see some form of subsidized housing on the site. Whether it becomes traditional public housing, section 8, or some other form of affordable housing remains to be seen.
In terms of raising the value of the surrounding neighborhood, I think that replacing the 360 unit McDougald Terrace, one of those communities which is aging out, with something in better shape would benefit the community greatly. Maybe DHA could look at building two mixed-income communities to replace the Terraces; one on the fayette place site and one on the existing terraces site.
Posted by: Rob G | February 04, 2016 at 09:24 AM
@Rob G, do you really think that DHA will put up another public housing community in such close proximity to downtown considering the past failure of such an endeavor? I can't imagine they would undermine the revitalization efforts happening downtown and with the new community built on Rolling Hills?
Posted by: Rob | February 04, 2016 at 11:19 AM
@Rob-
DHA has been trying to spread public housing out a bit now, that's for sure. For example, their replacement for the Club Blvd project has considered a "scattered site" approach. This was covered here in August:
That being said, a mixed income project the size and scope of Rolling Hills on the Fayette Place parcel would be transformative for the NC Central area. The only question is how to pay for it. Private dollars would certainly help, but there's plenty of projects in the LIHTC queue already. I think we're 5 years away from even beginning to talk about the Fayette Place site in a serious capacity.
Posted by: Rob G | February 04, 2016 at 11:26 AM
If I remember correctly, Fayette Place must contain some affordable housing, or at least that was the DHA requirement for the private developer. That company was supposed to do mixed-use with housing for low-income NCCU students.
I don't know if the entire complex can be affordable housing, though, because HUD regulations are steering housing authorities away from clustering low-income dwellings in one neighborhood. Thus, the scattered sites approach.
Fayette Place might turn out to be something similar to the Lofts at Southside, which mixes market-rate with subsidized housing at different income levels. But I agree, Rob G, it's a ways off. That's sad, because the demand is there -- and the condition of the acreage really drags down the neighborhood.
Posted by: Lisa Sorg | February 04, 2016 at 11:36 AM
I'm not entirely familiar with how HUD and DHA works in this case but my understanding is that the land is owned currently by Campus Apartments, a private developer in PA. The contract between NCCU and them to build campus housing at the site expires next year at which point DHA can purchase the land back. The question is can they? Is there enough revenue considering the shortages to buy back the property? And if not, can Campus Apartments put it on sale to the general market and a private developer at that point pick it up and develop it at market rates? Just curious..
Posted by: Rob | February 04, 2016 at 11:49 AM
That site is the epitome of the downfall of the traditional capital AND LIHTC markets. It is screaming for a DYNAMIC mixed-use and mixed-income development to support a severely underserved market. YES I SAID UNDERSERVED...in every way.
Retail - The Hester's strip center is constantly packed even though it is depressingly maintained and definitely not the prettiest. The middle class communities near NCCU though aging have been largely ignored for years.
Residential - NCCU for years has shuttled students from South Durham apartments due to housing shortages. Upperclassmen have never had a decent option near campus.
Redevelopment of this anchor site would have been a catalyst for the entire Fayetteville 'Street" corridor. The capital markets have deemed it to be too risky because they do not understand the market dynamics. It does not fit within their cookie-cutter models.
It is definitely time for some alternative capital and development options...

those that are 25 or 30 kilos obese,” says Dr. Aileen Takahashi,
medical director of the Torrance Memorial bariatric surgical procedure program. In
very heavy folks, the “starvation hormones go off-kilter,” she explains.
In these instances—particularly when there are different well being issues—the

the foundations of wellness earlier than weight reduction apply.

There are three sorts of weight reduction surgical procedures:

putting a silicon band across the higher abdomen. The band, which could be
regularly tightened by including saline, limits the quantity of meals you’ll be able to
comfortably eat.
- Gastric bypass surgical procedure completely reduces the dimensions of the abdomen and reconfigures the digestive
system, bypassing many of the abdomen and the small gut the place meals

- In
Gastric Sleeve Surgery, a big a part of the abdomen is eliminated. Greatly shrunk, the

Approximately 45 people rallied in front of Massachusetts Hall yesterday afternoon to laud Harvard President Derek C. Bok and the Corporation for divesting of $157 million of stocks and bonds in companies doing business in South Africa.
The demonstration, organized by the Southern African Solidarity Committee (SASC), also urged Harvard to totally divest its remaining $360 million in similar investments.
Speaking to the crowd in front of Massachusetts Hall, rally organizer Kim Laydin '87-'88 said that she wanted to "extend congratulations to Derek Bok and the Harvard Corporation for recognizing the role Harvard plays in world politics." She also congratulated all the divestment activists for their part in protests which led to Harvard's action last week.
Although the rally advertised that Thembea Villekazi, a member of the African National Congress, would speak to the group, he did not show up.

GPA Fix | Client QuestionsBy William Haupt III (The Center Square)
“In a republic, the will of the majority prevails. But the majority must recognize and protect the rights of the minority. And neither shall violate or oppress the rights of the other.”
– Thomas Jefferson
Critical race theory, or CRT, is a disproven progressive theory that advocates all accepted normal, neutral laws, regulations, and social and political traditions impact minority racial groups differently. It examines how legislatures target racial minorities for adverse treatment, such as voter suppression laws, employment and social policies, cultural and institutional requirements outside of the majority.
CRT was developed by Black civil-rights academia activists to challenge the interaction of race and law in America. They theorize American institutions and laws were created by whites to declassify people of color whose values, needs, morals and ideas receive differing social justice.
Those who surrender to CRT preach America is a racist nation with codified institutional racism and prejudice against those of color. CRT rejects real facts that racism actually exists only within small groups. They believe racism is written in law, innate in society, and part of all public policy.
Purveyors of CRT dismiss statistical evidence that racist incidents of whites against people of color are few. And racial episodes of violence against whites by people of color and acts they inflict on others of color are only promulgated to enforce American structural systemic racism.
“America was created by white supremacists who felt that all people of color were inferior.”
– Alexandria O. Cortez
CRT was an anemic academic study. But it reared its ugly head when leftists resurrected it to try and discredit Donald Trump and the GOP. It soon became the fight-song for the socialists and the radical female House “Hit-Squad” led by AOC. It is their weapon of choice to disrupt Congress.

CRT is a radical minority school of thought based on biased opinions, not evidence. Its adherents, mostly minority academics, have fueled dozens of books, legal reviews and countless conferences trying to force public officials and whites in America to buy into an implausible, unsupported theory.
The majority of Americans do not support the tenets of CRT because it refuses to accept historical facts. This is disturbing since America has a history of correcting her problems and improving lives.
Since her founding, America has adapted to domestic and global evolution as well as social needs while defending world liberty.
“America is great because God make her so.”
– Bishop Fulton Sheen
Pew Research Center polling from both parties and independents after Barack Obama’s reelection in 2014 revealed that 73% of Blacks and whites believed there was no need for our nation to revisit laws addressing black-white inequality. This group also agreed that discrimination was no longer a barrier for Black mobility. And SCOTUS even removed preclearance from the Voting Rights Act.
RELATED: Indoctrination Begins Before Classes Even Start
It’s a fact that CRT would still be languishing in the graveyard of lost socio-cultural hypothesis today if Hillary Clinton had won in 2016. But when voters chose Trump, the left did an about face on race. Political scientist Lisa Clark theorizes that the Democrats feared Trump’s patriotism and populism with blue collar whites and middle class Blacks was a threat to their dependence on identity politics.
“When Americans have patriotism in their hearts, there is no room for prejudice!”
– Donald Trump
Labeling the GOP racist is the leftist weapon to control the Black vote. It’s a self-sustained antithetic moral ethos. Disgraced former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo once said, “I can’t believe that conservatives call Black Lives Matter and Antifa radical!” At the Women’s March in Washington shortly after Trump’s inauguration, pop star Madonna said, “I have thought an awful lot of blowing up the White House.”
In the 1960s, when Republicans and northern Democrats humiliated southern segregationists into ending segregation, the left eagerly laid claim to it. Former segregationist Lyndon Johnson seized the moment to impose a New Leftist moral imperative on American society dictated by Democrats.
Last year, before George Floyd had been laid to rest, as America was burning, the left demanded CRT be integrated into public education and every U.S. business and institution. They said Floyd’s death was not an isolated incident by one bad cop but a way of life for people of color in America.
“If CRT seems Marxist, it is. It was Marxists that coined the phrase whiteness.
– Mike Gonzalez
When the U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona sent out a directive that states must teach CRT, they were more upset than the segregationists were about Brown v Education! State legislatures across the U.S. started banning CRT from schools claiming it was unconstitutional for the DOED to dictate state curriculum. They also refuse to teach innocent students they are racist.
Law professor Suzan Sherry verified CRT dismisses all factual evidence. It is built around radical, false opinions that replace historical fact with storytelling? It rebuffs truth and merit as white opinion and rejects the rule of law. She points to the success of Jews and Asians, yet CRT ignores it. They falsely accuse all whites of racism against Blacks and never mention Black racism against whites?
RELATED: Donald Trump Declares ‘Everything Woke Turns To S***’
Constitutional scholars and attorneys ague that CRT advocates are “forcing minority ‘opinions’ on the majority,” which is not constitutional. America is a republic, with a government that guarantees that “the minority is never disenfranchised by the majority.” Accordingly, “no minority can force their beliefs on the majority.” CRT is forcing the majority to accept the opinions of a small minority.
“The sole purpose of CRT is to create as much guilt as possible within the white race.”
– Mike Gonzalez
As he left office, Thomas Jefferson said, “Only honorable discourse will keep us from tyranny.” CRT is dishonorable discourse, and denial of the success of the world’s longest-standing Constitution. It breeds contempt for past Americans who stepped forward to correct social and cultural wrongs. It discredits the efforts of our Enlightenment founders. They make false allegations that all whites are guilty of racism and they flat out deny that there is Black racism against whites, which is totally false.
Princeton law professor Jennifer Hochschild said CRT is flawed from the start. They claim “people of color” in their dictum, yet they focus only on Blacks, which is 13% of the population? According to Census data, over 50% of Black America is classified as middle class. She concludes that this upward mobility in socioeconomic status has been due to social and cultural American assimilation.
During the Civil Rights Movement, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. told us that the Declaration of Independence was “a promissory note” guaranteeing all Americans “the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” As Jefferson said, “Only honorable discourse will keep us from tyranny.” In America, everyone has an equal right to work within our judicial system to improve our nation for everyone. Anyone who doesn’t can’t call themselves American.
“CRT is well-established in every American institution. It is driving decision-making according to skin color, not individual value and talent.”

This guide provides an extensive list of reasons why you might choose to use Linux instead of Windows 10 because what is suitable for one person isn't necessarily good for another. Lifewire / Daniel Fishel Windows 10 Is Slow on Older Hardware If you use Windows XP, Vista, or an older Windows 7 PC, chances are your computer isn't powerful enough to run Windows 8 or Windows 10. You have two choices. You can either buy a computer running Windows 10 or run Linux. Certain Linux distributions don't provide much of a performance boost as their desktop environments use a decent amount of memory. However, some versions of Linux work brilliantly on older hardware. For newer hardware, try Linux Mint with the Cinnamon Desktop Environment or Ubuntu. For hardware that is two to four years old, try Linux Mint but use the MATE or XFCE desktop environment, which provides a lighter footprint. For older hardware, go for AntiX, Q4OS, Xubuntu, or Lubuntu.. You Don't Like the Windows 10 User Interface Most people become disoriented when they first use a new operating system, especially if the user interface has changed in any way. However, when they get used to a new way of doing things, they end up liking the new interface more than the old one. If you can't get to grips with the way Windows 10 does things, you might prefer things to look like Windows 7, or you might decide to try something different. Linux Mint provides a modern look and feel, but with menus and toolbars working the way they always have. The learning curve to Linux Mint is no more difficult than upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10. The Size of the Windows 10 Download Is Huge If you use Windows 7 or Windows 8 and are thinking about upgrading to Windows 10, the download for Windows 10 is very large. Do you have a download limit with your broadband provider? Most Linux distributions can be downloaded in under 2 gigabytes. If you are tight on bandwidth, some can be installed for around 600 megabytes. Some are smaller than that. You can buy the Windows 10 USB drive, but it costs a decent sum of money. Linux Is Free The free upgrade that Microsoft offered a couple of years ago has run out. This means you now have to pay for it. Many manufacturers ship computers with Windows 10 installed. If you are happy with your current computer, the only way to get a new operating system is to pay for the latest version of Windows or download and install Linux for free. Linux has all the features you need in an operating system and is fully hardware compatible. Some people say that you get what you pay for, but this is one example where that doesn't ring true. If Linux is good enough for the top companies in the tech industry, then it's good enough to run on a home computer. Linux Has More Free Applications Windows has a few flagship products such as Microsoft Office and Visual Studio, which make some people feel locked in. You can, however, run Microsoft Office on Linux using virtualization software or running the online versions. Most software development is web-based, and there are many good IDEs available for Linux. With the advance of .NET Core, you can create APIs to use with your JavaScript web applications. Python is also a major programming language that can be used cross-platform on Windows, Linux, and Macs. The PyCharm IDE is as good as Visual Studio. The point here is that Visual Studio isn't the only option. Linux has a great set of applications that, for most people, provide all the features they. There are free applications on popular Windows download sites such as CNET, but you must know how to safely download and install software because bad things can happen when you use those sites. Security While no operating system is completely risk-free, Windows is a big target for developers of viruses and malware. There is little that Microsoft can do about this issue. As such, you must install an antivirus application and firewall software which eats into your memory and CPU usage as the constant stream of downloads required to keep this software up to date. With Linux, you only need to be clever, stick to trusted software repositories, and avoid using risky programs such as Adobe Flash. Linux is more secure than Windows because of the way it's designed and handles user permissions. This is one reason why most of the web runs on Linux. Performance Linux, even with all the effects and shiny features of modern desktop environments, runs faster than Windows 8.1 and Windows 10. Users are becoming less reliant on the desktop and more reliant on the web. Do you need all your processing power taken up with the operating system, or do you want something with a lighter footprint, letting you get on with your work and play? Privacy The Windows 10 privacy policy has been well-documented in the press. It isn't as bad as some people would have you believe, and Microsoft isn't doing anything that Facebook, Google, Amazon, and others haven't been doing for years. For instance, the voice control system Cortana learns the way you talk and gets better as it goes along by sending usage data to Microsoft. Microsoft uses this data to improve the way Cortana works. Cortana sends targeted advertisements, but Google already does this, and it is a part of modern life. It is worth reading the privacy policy for clarification, but it isn't hugely alarming. Most Linux distributions don't collect your data. You can remain hidden away from Big Brother (as long as you never use the internet). Reliability Windows is not as reliable as Linux. How many times have you, as a Windows user, had a program hang, and when you try to close it from the Task Manager (assuming you can get it to open), it remains open, and it takes several attempts to close the offending program? With Linux, each application is self-contained, and you can kill any application with the XKill command. Aside from all that, Linux applications tend to lock up less frequently. Because Linux and many of its applications are open-source, anyone can look at, review, and improve the underlying code. This leads to a stable system with quick fixes for bugs and security issues. Updates It can be frustrating when you want to print theater tickets, cinema tickets, or directions to a venue and you turn on your computer to see the following message: "Installing Update 1 of 356" Even more annoying is that Windows chooses when to install updates, and it displays a message saying that your computer is going to be rebooted. As a user, it should be up to you when to install updates, and updates shouldn't be forced on you or you should, at least, get a notice. Another downside is that Windows often needs to be rebooted to install the way you want. Windows has a limited set of tweaks available, but Linux lets you alter absolutely everything. Support Microsoft has a lot of documentation, but when you get stuck, you may need to search their forums, and other people may have asked a question that has no good answers. It isn't that Microsoft's support is bad; on the contrary, it is in-depth and good. The truth is, however, that they employ people to offer support, and there is only so much money that is budgeted for this support, and the wealth of knowledge is spread thinly. Linux support is easier to find, and there are dozens of forums, hundreds of chat rooms, and even more websites dedicated to helping people learn and understand Linux. Unlike Microsoft support, which is likely coming from an employee, Linux support generally comes from enthusiasts. These people genuinely enjoy working with their operating system and probably do so professionally. In some cases, you can talk with the developer that wrote the piece of software that you need assistanceVector Tan+6010-768 5879

Most of these happen between medical doctors and nurse practitioners in imaginary settings, from “Scrubs” to “times of our way of life” and also the Spanish prime-time “medical center fundamental.”
Not that plainly, rather than exactly the same these relationships become romanticized on-screen, as indicated by anecdotal verification and medical corporations.
For one thing, a few of the meet-cute and hookup on-the-clock tv story twists are not probable for real life medical experts, nursing assistant.org mentioned. “Nurses hardly ever break off to on-call areas in the exact middle of a shift. The reality is, medical center label suite have somewhat little, squeaky beds and really thin walls!” they listed.
In addition really worth keeping in mind is the fact that there are just various flicks and tv reveals with this 100 years inside greatest 30 from IMDb’s report on “leading cinema with doctor-nurse associations,” and so the move is actually diminishing a little bit even at imaginary “General medical facilities.”
Scrubs newspaper drove in terms of to label nurses online dating medical doctors “a myth,” painting a no-win end result for nurses concerned.
“Yes, nurse practitioners and health practitioners accomplish go out one another, not almost in the scale that Entertainment might have you consider,” it stated. “Nurses evening nurse practitioners, nurse practitioners date EMTs, nurses evening cafeteria staff, nursing staff evening custodial workers. Somehow, however, whenever nurse practitioners create time professionals, that romance is actually prone to more rigorous examination than many other relationships.”
There is however no doubting that nurses and professionals do build enchanting parts and sometimes even get married. As summed up by a health-related scholar aided by the login wanderingorion to the beginner physician internet message board, the causes medical practioners and nurse practitioners hook-up is not very insidious and perks both sides. “i am joined to a nurse,” he or she said. “Although, we were matchmaking long before she become one. I do believe your lifestyles engage effectively, and it also helps get an individual who will realize what you are going through while you’re at school and your career. In addition, a person literally make use of nurses day to day, and the industry is basically female. Combining switched off is bound to encounter.”
In addition to being not too long ago as 2016, Adam Pearce and Dorothy Gambrell learned that many doctors and nursing staff remained engaged and getting married to each other. Interestingly, female professionals happened to be significantly more more likely to wed their particular high-earning colleagues, while male doctors happened to be way more happy to marry somebody who had a great deal less. “High-earning females (doctors, solicitors) may set up with their financial equals, while middle- and lower-tier female typically wed awake. Quite simply, feminine CEOs are inclined to get married various other Chief Executive Officer; male Chief Executive Officer happen to be okay marrying their secretaries,” a chart while using reports bashing determined.
The large numbers of nursing staff supporting the doctor-nurse union picture inside the healthcare business.
There have been about 3.6 million subscribed nursing jobs in 2018, according to research by the Bureau of job statistics, outnumbering the 756,800 physicians and surgeons by over four to just one. Between that statistic, better girls than before growing to be MDs, increasing same-sex interactions and marriages and males nowadays making up around 9% from the health professional staff, you will find more chance of lower-earning nursing staff to pair with higher-earning doctors.
On top of that, a lot more nurses become reaching improved getting level on their own as nurse anesthetists and nurse specialists, making them more prone to get married associate highest earners, a few of them doctors. These reports assisted to pave the way in which for added connected discoveries by Gambrell and Pearce, as mentioned in insurance on the Gambrell and Pearce analysis performed by businesses Insider and Becker’s medical facility examine.
- Feminine medical professionals and surgeons are likely to wed man or woman medical professionals and professionals.
- Male doctors and doctors are usually to get married feminine doctors and doctors or male authorized nurses.
- Woman recorded nurses are most likely to get married male executives or feminine authorized nurses.
- Mens recorded nursing staff are in all likelihood to get married feminine or male subscribed nurse practitioners.
- Health professional providers and midwives are likely to get married various owners, doctors and cosmetic surgeons.

His background philosophy
For many years, I believed and taught a philosophy and religion, which I called Humanism — a religion that was man-centered rather than God-centered, a doctrine that man has within him the ability to work out his own salvation if only he will call it forth and use it. I did not believe that the particular theory of the universe which man may hold was important. I believed that it was man’s business, regardless of his belief or unbelief concerning God, to use his intelligence and his energy to develop human personality to the limit of its capacity, and to create a social order in which this would be easy and not difficult. I believed that if we could coordinate all the new ideas, new idealism, new methods and new values that have been brought to light as the byproducts of the sciences, philosophies, religions, arts and practical adventures of the modern mind, and use them wisely in the rearing of our families, the administering of our schools, the running of our governments, our industries and our professions, we might remove most of the evils which tend to destroy us. Man’s chief business was to discover and disclose the unused resources of vitality and power in human nature and in our civilization, and suggest a working technique for using them. It was not a philosophy of either blind optimism or dark despair, but it did believe that we are the architects of our own future and within certain limits of our environment and of our own natures, we could gradually fashion it to our desires.
His shift in thinking
I still think that the positive side of that program is valid – its insistence upon the enrichment of human life in its every form, but its negative side, cutting itself off from all cosmic relationship and denying or ignoring every influence outside of humanity itself, was and is very shortsighted and ineffectual. I see now how my utter reliance upon science and reason and my contempt for any intuitive insights and intangible values, which are the very essence of art and religion, was a great mistake.
… I do not assert that I have made a discovery. But I am exploring. I am a finite intelligence reaching out for a reality that extends infinitely beyond me. The further I go the more I am conscious of the inconceivable vastness that lies beyond the borders of our knowledge. But we try to express our attitude toward it by symbols and myths, through which we make some contact with it, but we must not identify these with the reality itself. We get occasional glimpses through the curtain of mystery – sometimes from the search of the scientists, more often from the intuition of the mystics, but no humble and honest person would have the temerity to attempt to describe it and claim that his description represented the reality.
I would not attempt to define it or even explain its workings, but I believe that by meditation and reflection, we can experience its presence and bring ourselves into harmony, in rapport with it. I have become convinced that this all-penetrating and all-embracing spiritual power, in spite of all the ups and downs of evolution and of human history, is slowly but surely driving toward excellence in every form.
Structure of Universe?
I am convinced that there is at least a trend, a forward pushing principle… I have come to the conclusion that our life on this planet is not the result of mere chance, the succession of lucky coincidences. Somehow behind it and part of it there has been an irresistible organic drive toward an ideal end…
It was natural in earlier times that men should think of God as an absolute monarch, all-wise and all-powerful. To them the world was a finished product, which had been created at some time and was then left to run according to certain fixed laws. But a tremendous revolution in human thought occurred when the theory of evolution was established. We learned then that this is not a fixed static world, but an organic world, which is constantly growing and changing all the time, and the old figure of a machine running according to fixed laws is displaced by that of the growing plant.
John Fiske described the change in our point of view when he said: “[The] simile of the watch must be replaced by the simile of the flower. The universe is not a machine, but an organism with an indwelling principle of life. It was not made, but has grown.” So the world is at every level, limited, imperfect, incomplete.
Why then may we not assume that God is similar to his universe? Perhaps he too is evolving and growing all of the time… [it] helps to answer a good many questions, such as the problem of evil, which the older absolutist concept was never able to explain satisfactorily. This theory assumes the immanence of God, and suggests that God needs our cooperation and help for the fulfillment of his purposes, and this greatly emphasizes the importance of human life. So we may think of God not as the goal but the road, not the victory but the struggle.
On Atheism
Frequently the repudiation of God is the repudiation of a kind of God that deserves to be repudiated… In most cases I think atheism is largely a difference of vocabulary. It drops the word “God,” but selects another and imbues it with the essential qualities of Godhood. Vitalism, order, energy, cause, intelligence.
Practically everyone believes in an indwelling spirit or energy in the universe, which they call by different names. It is the “Everlasting Yea” of Thomas Carlyle; it is “the Categorical Imperative” of Immanual Kant; it is “the Will to live” of Schopenhauer, and the “Will to Power” of Nietzsche; it is the “Absolute” of the Platonist; it is the “potent felt interior command” and the “urge and ardor” of Walt Whitman; it is the “power, not ourselves, which makes for righteousness” of Matthew Arnold; it is the “passionate aspiration after the perfect from which all great work springs” of Bertrand Russell; it is the “presence that disturbs… with… elevated thoughts” of Wordsworth; it is the “Elan Vital” of Bergson and the “Vital Force” of Bernard Shaw; it is the Force of the scientist and the God of the religionist.”
… So whether they call it force or power or energy; mind or will or love; truth or beauty or good, they are using different terms to describe the great Reality which is in all and though all.
On personal evolution
I would take no pride in belonging to that group of men whose ways of thinking were set in their youth and who react at sixty as they did at twenty. I pride myself in thinking that I have made some progress in thought. If I thought exactly as I did 40 years ago, it would perhaps be a sign that I have not given those ideas enough attention.”
… All of history has taught us that…, violence selfishness has overcome altruism, and a crass materialism has supplanted all spiritual values until our civilization stands on the brink of disaster for want of moral integrity and spiritual fibre.
On morality
… I believe the religious experience is not an exceptional thing reserved for privileged souls, nor exceptional even in the sense that it occurs only at rare moments in life. It is the normal experience of the ordinary man, grasped in its entirety and deeply felt.… In short, I believe that all human experience, when deeply understood, turns out to be spiritual.
… Morality has in it something permanent and yet is subject to change. The principles are always the same, but the way in which they are applied at different times is somewhat determined by the circumstances… We can still believe that the moral life is rooted in the cosmos… I think that we must believe that our values, our moral ideals, are not mere empty conceits, mere products of human assertion, but are indicative of the true nature of reality.
… The conviction that the whole of which we are a part shares with us in ideal-achieving capacity gives indispensable courage and comfort.
What is life?
… What is life? We know it only as animating force appearing in matter. It is intangible, not to be measured, and known to us only as it manifests itself in and through matter. Whether it exists or could exist apart from matter no one knows because it has never been identified apart from matter… Even though science may throw doubts about things that cannot be seen or touched, it certainly denies these doubts by asserting unseen things all about us, more active than the seen. It tells of atoms never seen, yet assures us that they are about the most active things in the universe.
… Water only becomes a mighty force as it vanishes into steam, and still more powerful when dissolved into its elements, for one of those invisible hydrogen atoms, we are told, is the mightiest of all forces. Gasoline in its liquid form is powerless and harmless, but when it evaporates into an invisible gas it propels most of the wheels of modern industry. So matters seems to become vigorous by vanishing, and to become most active when on the edge of annihilation. The evidence of things growing active when they slip beyond the reach of sense and science gives hope that a human life may survive in some form even though we may not see or touch it after the dissolution of the body.
… Life has been defined as a function of matter, like the flame of a candle, and we are told that when the flame is snuffed out the function ceases and no longer exists; yet that flame has released energy in the forms of light and heat, which is not and cannot be destroyed.Buying a Car in Australia
Buying a car in Australia can be a confusing task, as rules and costs vary from state to state. When buying a vehicle you need to factor in all the 'hidden' costs & taxes that the various state governments throw in.
A few key points worth noting are:
- In Australia, you pay stamp duty to the state government when you buy a car (How much depends on which state you are in, and what type of car you are buying)
- New cars are subject to 10% GST (Some 2nd hand cars may also be subject to GST)
- Stamp duty is charged on the full price of the car, INCLUDING GST
- Rules vary from state to state about roadworthy certificates (the equivalent of an MOT, for those from the UK).
- Fuel prices, although significantly cheaper than the UK & europe, are, like everywhere else, climbing steeply.
- Luxury Car Tax applies on new cars over $57,009
- Car Registration is an annual road tax that varies from state to state

This summer school was fully supported by a Simula Travel Grant (15,000 NOK) and took place in Oslo (2 weeks) and San Diego (1.5 weeks). During the summer, Henry worked together with Ana Maria Sanchez de la Nava (Hospital GU Gregorio Marañón, IiSGM, CIBERCV,Madrid – PI Maria Guillem, PhD) and Savannah Bifulco (University of Washington, Seattle – PI Patrick Boyle PhD) on a project entitled “Machine learning tools to uncover ischemic markers in a population of image-based virtual hearts”. This summer project was supervised by three outstanding Simula supervisors: Valeriya Naumova, PhD; Hermenegild Arevalo, PhD and Per Magne Florvaag, and was presented in UC San Diego in August 2019. Overall, their summer project is the first to employ machine learning on cardiac fibrosis detection in patient-specific virtual hearts.
You’ve probably read dozens of articles that offer advice on how to “survive the holidays” when you’re trying to lose weight. Survive? What happened to experiencing the joy of the season, feeling merry and being happy? No one wants to just survive the holidays, like they’re a lagoon full of crocodiles. You want to enjoy them! By making just a few strategic preparations beforehand, you can experience a healthy and happy holiday.
Here are 10 simple ways to prepare for a healthy and happy holiday season:
1. Define “happy”.
What are your favorite things about the holidays? Make a list of what makes you happy during this special time of year. Gift-giving, gift-getting, bringing out the family heirloom table or tree decorations, writing cards, making holiday crafts, the annual neighborhood party or the delicious tastes of family meals: mom’s stuffing, Nana’s pizzelles, the buttery taste of Aunt Rose’s challah bread.
Chances are, one of your favorite things is the feeling of warmth and togetherness as the whole family draws together to enjoy each other. When you’re tempted to eat one extra holiday cookie or take another dip into the party punch, pull out your list. It will serve as a reminder that you have plenty of other ways to enjoy the holidays, so you won’t feel the least bit deprived.
2. Don’t skip meals.
Even if you know there’s a big feed on the agenda, don’t “save up” for it by skipping your healthy Nutrisystem meals. You don’t want to face temptation hungry.
3. Stock up on seltzer.
According to the National Health Service, alcoholic drinks may affect the brain chemicals that tell your appetite to call it a day. Researchers explain that despite consuming loads of calories in alcoholic beverages, you may end up eating more than when you are sober.
If you’d like to indulge in a glass of wine at the holiday party, fill your glass half or two-thirds of the way up with seltzer water before you add any alcohol. Bonus: Holding a glass of plain or mixed seltzer usually stops your host from trying to give you more!
4. Volunteer.
Consider signing up to help at the local soup kitchen or pet shelter over the holidays. You’re not only helping others in need, you’re helping yourself. According to Mayo Clinic, studies have found that people who volunteer can beat depression and lower stress levels, both common risks over the holidays. It can also help with keeping you physically and mentally healthy. Bring the family with you and start a new, happy holiday tradition.
5. Dance.
If you get stressed or depressed when the holidays roll around, turn on the music and get moving. You don’t have to be a scientist to figure out that it’s really hard to feel bad when you’re dancing. But science can prove it: A 2015 study, published in European Journal of Sport Science, compared the moods of recreational ballroom dancers and those who dance competitively. Researchers found that the less rigorous workout by amateurs resulted in less stress and more pleasure, even after the last notes were sounded. Even better: Dancing away the blues can burn up to 518 calories per hour (depending on the type of dance and speed), says the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. So, dance away the blues and stay happy this holiday season.
6. Plan a holiday hike… or two.
And bring as many family members along as you can! According to Healthline, walking provides a host of health benefits, such as burning calories, increasing energy and improving heart health, immunity and mood. Along with these perks, family walks also offer an interrupted time to connect with each other without distraction.
7. Keep your hands (and mind) busy.
If you relish the time you spend making holiday cookies, transfer your DIY yearnings to something that isn’t food. Many park departments, arboretums and garden clubs offer classes on how to make holiday wreaths and centerpieces, force bulbs or create fairy gardens. Learn to bead, knit and quilt at your local fabric store or art center to create homemade holiday gifts your family will love.
8. Take a moment—often.
It’s so easy to get carried away over the holidays—planning, prepping, shopping, buying, decorating, cooking, wrapping. Just the thought can make your blood pressure rise. Mindfulness—a meditative technique that helps you focus on the present moment (and not all the other moments you’re planning for)—may be your solution.
According to the magazine Today’s Dietitian, mindful practices have been shown to help develop better eating habits and a “higher well-being in daily life.” Think of it as putting yourself on pause, during which you pay close attention to what you’re feeling and sensing in the moment, without making any judgments. It can help you calm down, sidestep a craving and remind yourself of your ultimate goals, leading to better choices.
9. Relax anywhere.
Become instantly calm with simple, deep breathing techniques, no matter what’s going on around you. According to Medical News Today, a specific breathing technique called “4-7-8” may help decrease stress, improve sleep and control cravings. It involves breathing in quietly through your nose for four seconds, holding for seven seconds, then exhaling for eight seconds, making a soft whoosh sound (repeat up to four times). Just make sure to speak with your doctor before adding this practice to your routine to ensure this is the right technique for you.
10. Give yourself the gift of forgiveness.
You planned ahead to do the right thing and stick to your diet program. However, holiday treats still tempt you and a few sneak onto your plate. Don’t beat yourself up. Shame may lead you to give up and derail your diet permanently. Cut yourself a break. Everyone has a bad day, but it doesn’t have to lead to a bad life. Forgive yourself and hop right back on the diet train at your very next meal.How to cook a boiled fish boil in a crockpot
The most important thing to do with a boiled boil is to make sure it’s done right, so let’s take a look at how to cook it right in your crock pot.
The simplest way to do it is to simply add water to the pot and cover it with a lid.
As soon as the water is gone, turn the heat down to medium-low and simmer the fish for at least 10 minutes.
You don’t need to make any changes to the recipe, so the most important part is just ensuring that you cover the crock in a lid and the lid is up.
When done, drain the fish, rinse the fillets and drain on paper towels.
If you want to save time and cut down on cleanup time, simply discard the water.
If it’s time to serve the fish later, simply put the lid back on the pot, flip the fish over, add a spoonful of rice, toss with a few drops of vinegar, and serve.
Here are some other ideas for cooking a boiled crock.
If the fish is too big to fit in the crocks, you can put it in a smaller pot or even the microwave, but remember to cover the pot completely.
You can even use a crook to cook the fish in.
When it’s ready to be served, simply flip it over and serve with a bowl of noodles, veggies, rice, or even a salad.
It can be served in a bowl or bowl of soup.
A crock can also be used to prepare a wide variety of Asian dishes like noodles with soy sauce, stir fried vegetables, and noodles in soup.
This method is a great way to prepare an entire pot of stir fry noodles, and it can even be used for making rice noodles.

Leading public sector organisations in Wolverhampton have joined forces in a new community wealth building initiative, aimed at keeping more of their £835 million collective spending power within the city.
A select committee meeting next week will see representatives from the City of Wolverhampton College, Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, University of Wolverhampton and Wolverhampton Homes coming together with the council to discuss how to keep maximum funds in the city’s economy.
The ‘Wolverhampton Pound’ scheme is committed to working with and uniting businesses and the voluntary sector, with a view to spending more money within the city in order to retain wealth locally and create new jobs.
Council leader, Councillor Ian Brookfield (Lab. Bushbury South and Low Hill) said: “The Wolverhampton Pound is about keeping more of our city’s money right here so that it benefits local people.
“The city’s public sector has massive spending power and what we are envisaging is prioritising local firms and organisations when it comes to decisions over where to spend it.
“If you take the city council, we employ 4,500 people and own 20 per cent of land in the city. When you combine our spending power with our partners, we are looking at more than £835 million annually and 14,000 employees.
“Together, we can really benefit our local economy and our communities by harnessing the power of the Wolverhampton Pound to deliver projects which benefit our people, rather than lining the pockets of shareholders who have probably never set foot in Wolverhampton,” he added.
The idea, known as community wealth building, has already been successfully adopted in Preston, Lancashire, where council chiefs credit the initiative with creating 1,600 new jobs, £74 million of investment into the city and £200 million into the regional economy.
“This approach really works. Up in Preston millions has been invested into the city directly as a result of institutions choosing to spend money locally,” said Cllr Brookfield.
“They have made it easier for local businesses to bid for contracts and set up local firms to provide local services, created jobs, paid more people the living wage and moved the city out of the 20 most deprived places in the UK.”
The five main partners have been tasked with sharing current and emerging approaches for reducing carbon in the supply chain, with a particular focus on waste, food supply chains, cleaning materials, construction standards and IT equipment to create a shared roadmap to 2028.
Shaun Aldis, Chief Executive of Wolverhampton Homes, added: “I am delighted that Wolverhampton Homes is able to be part of this fantastic initiative. As a major employer within the city, we see it as our duty to give back to the communities we serve.
“With a property portfolio of around 22,000 homes and over 700 staff, we invest millions in projects and programmes every year to maintain and uplift neighbourhoods across Wolverhampton.
“By utilising this spending power closer to home, we hope to not only boost local business and create job opportunities, but also to reduce our carbon footprint as we strive towards a greener city,” he said.
Wolverhapton Council’s select committee will discuss procurement of the ‘Wolverhampton Pound’ scheme at a meeting next Wednesday (November 24).

My mother first set foot in France when she was fourteen, all skinny, curious and scared, hiding in my grandmother’s skirts. They came from Algeria a few years after the liberation, to find work and hope. My grandmother was tall and funny, and all she wanted was to make an honest living to see that her daughter and her son would have better lives than her own.
They settled in Corsica, where the first generation of immigrants from Maghreb were already making an impression. It was the time of the “good Arab” – the one that would settle, work hard, look down and send money to the family back in the homeland.
The homeland they would dream about going back to, one day.
My mother didn’t see it like that. Unlike my grandmother, she could read. She had been to school in Oran, loved books, and if she did have an accent, she spoke French to perfection.
She also had a wild beauty and a fierceness in her eye that burns through the photos of this era. She was beautiful, with the brightest smile you could ever see. She had grown in poverty and had learned to be quick on her feet, to never complain and only rely on herself.
—
My grandmother’s name was Tahmanent, but we just called her Mina. She was Muslim. Well, Muslim and other things, as it appears that a lot of Berbers from the Moroccan mountains, where she originally came from, had woven an artful mix of their endemic beliefs in spirits and little devils into their worshipping of Allah.
She never cut her hair, colored it with henna, always wore a scarf over her head and would never be caught in pants. She also had traditional Berber tattoos on her face and legs, beautiful crosses and lines that made her look like the heroine of a science fiction movie.
She had pretty clear ambitions for my mother. She was to marry a good Muslim, work hard, have children and make her proud.
A thing my grandmother had never been able to do herself by the way, as one of the family stories I heard was that she killed her abusing husband with a soap (!!!), and then stayed single for the rest of her life, which is another tale for another day.
—
Confidence and beauty opens a lot of doors. Add brains and style to that and very soon my mother was making her way into the very tight Corsican youth society. She won’t tell me much about the racism she endured at that time but I know it to have been brutal, as I can still see the remains of it in France today, half a century later.
Her name is Kheira, but it probably sounded too Arab, so it got changed, by whom I don’t know. That’s what they used to do in those days. She became Irène.
She was this rebel spirit, one who powered through the insults and the judgements and even made friends outside or her community. And one day, she met my father.
—
Louis was also the splendid product of immigration, from the other side of the Mediterranean this time. He was of Italian descent. His mother had come from Tuscany, and his father from Sardinia. I thought I’d entertain you by reporting that “Sardace”, which means “from Sardinia”, is still a very well know insult in Corsica. Yes, yes. Hate of the other has no boundaries, rhyme, reason, or tangible roots in race, actually.
He was raised by his grandmother, Nathalie, all round and smily and matronly and the owner of the famous restaurant Da Mamma. You can’t make up how cool this name is. This little place I wish I had known was tucked in a tiny back alley of the old town. You had to walk up a few stairs to get inside and you’d be welcomed by my father, who had left school early to go work with Nathalie.
Ajaccio was a typical Mediterranean town, all gorgeous, elegant and airy, with rows of beautiful classic cafés where people would sit, smoke and people watch.
It is at one of these cafés that my mother and father met.
—
It was more than love. It was instant and burning passion.
I still hear about it when I talk to the old people of my island. They were so beautiful! The old people say. They were so in love! I was so jealous because I was so infatuated with your father! A lady from my village told me. Ah! Irène and Louis. What a story.
—
Easy to reminisce about this picturesque love story now, ladies and gentlemen of Ajaccio. Because very soon, they found themselves all alone in the world.
To their families, their encounter was anything but romantic.
It was, actually, an absolute disgrace. A Catholic and a Muslim? An Arab with our prodigal son? A infidel with our beautiful daughter? Wait… She was promised to be married!!!
Shame on us! Shame on them!
But you know how love goes, don’t you. Nothing would stop them. And so my father lost his work and his relationship with the woman that had raised him and whom he adored. My mother got kicked out of her home and shunned by her community. They would spit at her feet when they saw her walking down the street.
My grandmother would never talk to her, ever again.
All that was left for them was to leave.
—
So they did. My father found a job in a restaurant out of town. They packed and left.
This was not any place. They arrived in Girolata, the secluded Corsican village with no road, no electricity and no telephone. A heaven for wealthy tourists in the summer, but a real daily challenge for anyone trying to live there.
They had always struggled for money.
Now there were living the real hard life.
But they were young and they loved each other, so unless anything out of the ordinary happened, all would be fine.
And that’s when my mother realized she was pregnant with me.
She was nineteen.
—
I was born on the first of May. It’s a beautiful date and a glorious time of the year in Corsica, except if you’re a chef, like my father. Because where I come from, May is the beginning of the high season. It is when restaurants start going into high gear, and a moment when no excuse would have you leave your little, sweaty corner in the kitchen.
It’s no joke. I’ve seen a chef work with a broken skull once.
Girolata was exactly a two hour hike, followed by a three hour drive through the Corsican mountains from the first hospital. When the weather was good you could take a boat instead of hiking, but if you know the Mediterranean and its surprisingly violent bouts of anger, as a pregnant woman, you wouldn’t take any bet on this.
So with a lot of tears and kisses, one day my mother and her belly hoped on a boat and left the village. She settled in an empty apartment a friend had lent her in the city, right next to the hospital.
And because there was no more family, and because no one was there to tell her she should have known better, she thought she would figure it out on her own.
—
It was a hard one.
I was a first born, it took hours for her to push me out. She lost a lot of blood and had to get a transfusion. They didn’t have enough blood for her at the hospital. Then they forgot some placenta and she had a septicemia. She had to go under a few days later to get an operation to remove it.
She then left the hospital and it was her, and me.
—
I was the same at her age. I thought myself invincible. She probably sent a message to my father that everything was fine. Remember, no phone. She probably thought she’d sleep it off and all would be okay. I don’t know what the fuck she thought.
But here she was, weak and alone, with a newborn crying for food and attention.
She would give me her breast and doze back to sleep, barely conscious and losing the sense of time and space. For how long it went on I don’t know. She could barely feed herself.
She didn’t know what it was at the time, but she had a major post partum depression. She couldn’t recuperate from the operation. She was emaciated, her body was letting go.
She was going to die.
—
And one day, in a blur, my mother opened her eyes. And there she was standing, in front of her.
My grandmother.
These are the fathomless mysteries of life. She felt it, she said. My grandmother was never a person of a lot of words, so I’ll leave you with that. Intuition, I think. Or maybe a guardian angel. Something. She felt the death and she felt the life and she knew my mother was in danger.
She asked around and she figured out where she was.
She had sworn to never talk with her daughter again, to never acknowledge this man who had stole her and this child born outside of any religion.
And yet here she was.
She took my exhausted mother in her arms, they both cried for a long time.
She then fed her, put her to sleep, wrapped me on her back like women have done since the dawn of time, and went to work. She mothered me and carried me around everywhere she went so that she could give my mother all the rest she needed.
And just like that, my mother didn’t die.
And just like that, for the love of an infant and for the love of life itself, peace came back slowly in the families. I got to be held and cherished and I got to grow up, happily, between spaghetti and couscous and between God and Allah, between Christmas and Eid – never judged by anyone in my family.
I still don’t claim a religion and I see the beauty in all of them. I even have brought in my life some of the joys of the Jewish traditions through Emily who’s teaching me a little bit everyday.
So I know Hanukkah just ended. Happy Hanukkah my beautiful friends. Happy celebrations to everyone who has a tradition to celebrate, and Merry Christmas.
This year, we might be far from our families, but always we know.
Love is everywhere, love transcends, and love heals.
May love guide us all.Walk In Wardrobe Design
Designing a walk in robe - In The Begining
When planning your wardrobe space, consider colours, style and hardware and look for accessories that add style and efficiency. Just some of many options available include drawers, double hanging shelves, movable shelving for organising shoes, purses and folded items, plus a hamper to keep laundry hidden as well as pull-out pants, belts, ties and valet rods to get your clothes ready for the next day.
Start by taking measurements of the inside of your wardrobe to determine how much space you have to work with. As you sketch, be sure to include any obstacles, such as: note the location and type of door, including the swing direction, light fixtures, switch plates, outlets and ductwork and windows etc.
How to organize a walk in robe .
- Depending on who is using the wardrobe, you will want to determine how much space you and your partner will need. Is it divided 50/50? 60/40? 75/25? From extra shelving to baskets and hanging space, what kind of wardrobe storage suits your needs:
- For dresses and longer clothing items, consider adding full hanging space.
- For hanging coates,shirts, and pants, you can add double hanging space.
- Store folded items such as jumpers ,jeans, tee shirts and extra folded items on the open shelves.
- Accessories such as belt, tie and valet rod, to get your clothes ready for the next day. Plus slanted shoe shelves that keep footwear organised and visual.
Planning & Fitting Out
- A few key points to keep in mind as one designs functionality, organisation and beauty.
- Use space above the hanging areas for storing hand bags and folded items.
- Designate top shelves as travel bags, seasonal clothing and slow moving items.
- Create a central point by positioning a built-in drawer unit, also serves as a dresser.
- Adjustable hanging rods to double the storage area and keep clothing organized.
- Position hanging rods and shelving nearest the entryway to the wardrobe, to give a relaxed feeling as one enters.

Very Autumn Leaves
Hi and thanks for dropping by for a peek at another project.
Today's inspiration came from a lovely set of cards by Lauren at Crafty Little Peach and I have to say that the colours she used, Cherry Cobbler and Crushed Curry, are not colours I naturally reach for when creating but I do love the combination of the two.
I stamped in Gold Embossing Powder on watercolour paper and blended the two colours for the leaves, added a piece of Corrugated Vellum as the background and lots of gold die-cuts.
I also die-cut some stitched ovals and circles and stamped the leaves in Pumpkin Pie, adding a 2" Gray Granite circle.

I am definitely signing up for your next NE Summit – I am ready to go where ever you host. Thanks again it was AWESOME…you did an excellent job, truly professional, fabulous networking!!!!
Jeannemarie Denslow, Director of Northeast Accounts, Eau Palm Beach Resort & Spa
Danielle comes from the sales-side of the business which gives her an advantage on how to run events. That advantage is an understanding of "ratio integrity" of clients to resorts. We all know trade shows are weak. The new way to forge meaningful relationships is unique and memorable events such as hers. Give it a try.
Eric Kuester, Director of Sales, Pinehurst Resort
Danielle is a professional who understands the hotel market and the needs of current meeting planners. She does an excellent job of bringing highly qualified and relevant meeting professionals to first class events to meet unique hotel properties. The events provide plenty of reception time for hotels and meeting professionals to talk, before sitting down to a memorable dinner. The hotel to meeting professional ratio is the best I have seen with truly qualified clients.
Joe Barrow, Director of Sales, Kingsmill Resort
I have been singing your praises with the Summit…you did a fantastic job from start to finish. I can honestly tell you, the feedback I have received so far will come back tenfold with business opportunities not only for Kiawah but the others as well. Thank you and The Pinehurst team for executing a seamless client event, nothing was overlooked, great job to all. Your hard work was very much appreciated; the bar has been raised…
Marty Couch, Director of Sales, Kiawah Island Golf Resort
WOW! What an incredible event— well planned and executed with an exceptional turn out with high level planners and hoteliers. I've done hundreds of events over my career and they all pale in comparison to yours. Seriously. The fact that, as a group, we pulled key accounts together to share best practices, enjoy networking and learn about a myriad of different business and high end resorts was fantastic. You have set the bar VERY high for everything I look to emulate with my company events in the future but know that from this day forward, I am a big fan of HB Hospitality.

Nutritional information:
Brussel Sprouts-
- High in vitamin K– which is wonderful for bone health.

- Healthy Weight- Brussels sprouts can help you to reach a healthy weight, give you more energy, aid in muscle growth, and improve your eyesight and complexion.
Kale-
- Anti-Inflammatory- is one of the most beneficial properties of eating kale. Helpful for the chronic inflammatory markers.
- Rich in antioxidants– just like Brussel Sprout’s, kale is also rich in antioxidants needed to fight daily free radical damage from our environment.

Green Lentils-
- High in Protein- 18 grams of protein per 200 grams, makes this a plant protein superfood. It is also high in iron, which is essential for plant-based diets.

Back to the Detox Buddha Bowl recipe:
This bowl is super easy to make. You just need an oven, cutting board, 2 cookie sheets and a knife to make. Making clean up quick and easy.
Not everyone likes Brussel sprouts, but I think that is because they are cooked the wrong way. Most people boil them. Which in my opinion they don’t taste very good. But when you roast them in the oven, they get crispy and they have a flavour that is amazing. Even my picky husband likes them this way.
Substitutions:
- You can sub the potatoes for sweet potatoes.
- If you don’t have any hummus on hand you can make your own.
- You can do any colour of kale you like.
- You could sub the Brussel sprouts for broccoli.
- Whatever colours of lentils you have on hand will work too.

SO… the thing about food is, well, there’s many things, but lets look at one often overlooked item. Connectedness. Yeah, not only to the food, but the people you are sitting with. In many cultures, in fact most outside of north america, meal time is a sacred time in which we share, and nourish. Mind and body. And I totally do not mean sitting on the couch eating microwave dinner, watching grey’s anatomy. Trust me, we’ve all been there, It does do the trick time to time. Never judgement here.
Although many cultures share this value, even here in Canada, few seem to practice this. We have a million things to do. AND even when we don’t, we have a million EXCUSES. Sure it takes some planning, some prep. Worth the cost? Maybe. I see this value so evident in Indian families. I also happen to love their cuisine (win win). So recently at the urging of my friend, Erin Ireland, I took part in a spectacular plant based South Indian cooking class held by Feed Life. side note…Check them out, it makes for a beautiful night. I realized as I was cooking, the best thing for me to do shortly thereafter was to have people over to enjoy some new skills, some new recipes and more importantly, some memories! The thing is, its all about sharing, you dip, you scoop, you pour, you pile. Sampling so many different flavours. It wouldn’t be nearly as enjoyable unless enjoyed amongst others and with multiple dishes. You realize how deep the traditions run within this culture when you understand that each household has its very own masalas to suit its family members taste. That’s right, its not a jar that you buy from the store. It is a carefully formulated, often generations old, recipe of ratios of spices. The spice can hold stories! Isn’t that remarkable?! We look at what we can get from food, satisfaction. But beneath the surface is so much to receive, nutritionally and even energetically. Spiritually and soulfully. It has been said that food for the body is not enough, there must be food for the soul. I whole heartedly agree and cannot wait to explore this more!
I wish I could give you all the recipes I learned, seriously, they are superb and i’ve made numerous times since. BUT, I’ll tempt you with one that I developed, the dessert I created to go along with it. Because what is a great meal without dessert?! The rest you can get by checking out Colin’s site and maybe signing up for a class. I cant wait to do another. You’ll probably meet his mom there too, who’s eyes and presence alone add to such a beautiful experience and worth the price of admission.
So to keep in theme, and to build onto a favourite, ice cream that is, CARDAMOM ICE CREAM seemed like the way to travel. Oh yeah, Cauliflower. Again. I have a thing for it, not going to lie, you will see it up on this site often. But hey, this means you can totally eat an extra scoop and have the perfect excuse, you needed more veggies!!Wait, veggies for breakfast totally sounds legit right?
K, give it a shot. TRUST ME, or else. just kidding. but seriously….
RECIPE
INGREDIENTS
- 1 1/4 cup Coconut water
- 1 1/2 cup Coconut meat
- 8-10 Dates pitted
- 2 Tbls Agave, maple syrup
- 1/2 tsp Vanilla powder
- 1 tsp Cinnamon
- 1 tsp Cardamom (you can add more or adjust to your liking)
- 1/4 tsp Himalayan Salt
- 1 cup steamed Cauliflower
- 1/4 cup coconut oil (melted)
METHOD
Aside from pure divinity in taste, texture and pleasure…its stupid easy to make. SO yeah we are talking about one incredible meal…ahem, dessert 😉
Examine your dates (how many times have we done this ladies 😉 and if the appear dry, well, give them a soak. You can apply this to all areas of your life
Lightly steam your cauliflower, just until fork tender
Comibine all of your ingredients into your high speed blender or Vitamix but hold off on the oil. Blend until super creamy and smooth and at that time you can funnel in your oil to really give it the finishing touch. Taste to adjust your spices as needed and pour into a parchment lined loaf pan. It probably will only fill half unless you have a small one, so you can put something in your pan to block off one half, that way you will have nice depth. We all like at least a bit of depth.
Place in freezer and let set for 3-6 hours.
I prefer to let the ice cream get nice and soft as it has such a beautiful texture. So you may want to leave it out a bit before scooping
2 scoops or three?
what is a great meal without dessert?!
Only 28% of spring and 17% of stream water sources are safe for drinking
Water: A huge majority, 97.7 percent, of the Bhutanese population may have access to improved drinking water, but what they are consuming is not the safest.
A rapid assessment of rural drinking water quality carried out by the centre for disease control in 2012 shows that only 17 percent of stream water and 28 percent of spring water sources are safe for use as drinking water. Ensuring safe drinking water is still a major challenge in the country.
This is set to change with the launch of the Bhutan Drinking Water Quality Standard (BDWQS) 2016 yesterday coinciding with the celebration of World Water Day and World Forestry Day at Samtengang Central School in Wangdue.
With the absence of drinking water quality standards, many water service providers did not feel the need to carry out water quality testing, and majority of service providers in dzongkhags do not test the quality of drinking water.
Water used for drinking must be regularly monitored and treated to protect the health of consumers, and thus, the need for BDWQS.
Tenzin Wangmo, chief environment officer with National Environment Commission (NEC), said that the Water Act 2011 mandates NEC to come up with a drinking water quality standard. World Health Organisation (WHO) has provided technical support for the development of national drinking water quality standard, she said.
As of now Bhutan has been using WHO guidelines for drinking water quality. However, since WHO guidelines were made for the region, it does not capture all local problems and issues of the country.
With accelerating development and increase in anthropogenic activities, quality of raw water sources could be deteriorating. This concern was recognized and a range of policies, guidelines and regulations, including rural water supply scheme policy, the water Act, water regulation 2014, the environmental standard 2010 and watershed management guidelines were passed to ensure the sustainability and protection of quality of drinking water sources.
Tenzin Wangmo said that NEC will ensure implementation and enforcement of drinking water quality standard, review and revise the quality standard in consultation with relevant stakeholders. The commission will also publish an annual report on drinking water quality.
She said that works and human settlement ministry will ensure safe and adequate drinking water and sustainability of infrastructure in collaboration with the dzongkhags. It will also ensure operational monitoring of water quality and train engineers and technicians working in water sector to provide safe drinking water.
Health ministry’s centre for disease control as lead institution, will implement drinking water quality standard and conduct surveillance and serve as national reference laboratory for drinking water quality testing and monitoring. The health ministry will also compile data and submit to NEC and undertake water quality testing in Thimphu Thromde.
While dzongkhag hospitals will conduct urban water testing, basic health units (BHU) will do rural water testing. The hospitals and BHUs will disseminate water quality test reports and carry out advocacy and awareness programmes for consumers.
Themed “Better water, Better Jobs,” the World Water Day was celebrated together with World Forestry Day with the theme “How do forest contribute to our water needs”.
NEC coordinated the event in collaboration with watershed management division and Wangdue dzongkhag administration with technical assistance from Asian Development Bank.
The National Integrated Water Resource Management Plan, 2016, Baychhu Watershed Management Plan, Framework for Payment for Environmental Services, and field guide and a book titled “Water- Securing Bhutan’s future” were also launched yesterday.
Health minister Tandin Wangchuk, WHO representative, officials from ADB, member of parliament from Wangdue, Tashi Dorji, Wangdue dzongdag and officials, students and teachers of Samtengang Central School attended the launch.

Walk-in clinics or FHT/FHOs with urgent care clinics can now use Check-In Kiosks for walk-in patients. After swiping their health card or entering in their health number at the kiosk, patients without existing appointments are automatically matched with the next available appointment slot in the “Walk-In Provider Schedule”.
For automated appointment scheduling, use Tablet Rules and Keywords to assign patients to different provider schedules based on specific criteria. In the example below, only patients under the age of 18 are booked with provider A while provider B sees everyone else.

We’ve simplified the process of managing new patients at check-in for Accuro users. Upon arrival, new patients complete a blank demographic form. Once they are done, Ocean creates a new patient chart using the demographic information and automatically populates a new encounter note. Collecting email consent during this part of the process is also made easy if an email consent form is added to the kiosks’s standard queue. If the email consent tool bar is installed in the EMR, the consent status will update in the chart upon creation.
This feature is also available for accepted submissions from Website Forms and incoming eReferrals. To enable this feature, log in to the Ocean Portal, go to the Admin tab and under “Site Features” and check the box for “Allow accepted eRequests/eReferrals to create patients in your EMR.”

Tuesday’s announcement that the United States would release 50 million barrels was made after an official said Washington had approached major Asian energy consumers. Officials said it was the first time that the United States had coordinated such a move with some of the world’s largest oil consumers.
OPEC+, which includes Saudi Arabia and other U.S. allies in the Gulf, as well as Russia, has rebuffed requests to pump more at its monthly meetings. It meets again on Dec. 2 to discuss policy but has so far shown no indication it will change tack.
The group has been struggling to meet existing targets under its agreement to gradually increase production by 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) each month – a pace Washington sees as too slow – and it remains worried that a resurgence of coronavirus cases could once again drive down demand.
Recent high oil prices have been caused by a sharp rebound in global demand, which cratered early in the pandemic in 2021, and analysts have said that releasing reserves may not be enough to curb further rises..
India said detail its plans on Wednesday.
Benchmark Brent crude was trading above $80 a barrel on Tuesday, up from its levels before the announcement but still well below last month’s three-year high of more than $86.
An OPEC+ source and several market analysts said the release was not as big as the headline figure suggested. On the figures announced, they said Britain and India were releasing modest amounts and the United States had already announced some releases and so the additional quantity was less than expected.
But the effort by Washington to team up with major Asian economies to lower energy prices sends a warning to OPEC and other big producers that they need to address concerns about high crude prices, up more than 50% so far this year.
COMPLICATION
Suhail Al-Mazrouei, energy minister of the United Arab Emirates, one of OPEC’s biggest producers, said before details of the release from U.S. reserves was announced that he saw “no logic” in lifting UAE supply for global markets.
An OPEC+ source said releasing reserves would complicate calculations for OPEC+, as it monitors the market on a monthly basis.
.
Japan and South Korea are IEA members. China and India are only associate members.
Under a swap from U.S. reserves, oil companies taking crude must return it – or the refined product – plus interest. Swaps are typically offered when oil firms face supply disruptions, such as a pipeline outage or damage from a hurricane.
Outright sales are less common. U.S. presidents have authorized emergency sales three times, most recently in 2011 during a war in OPEC member Libya. Sales also took place during the Gulf War in 1991 and after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

9. TECHNICAL DATA (20oC) Kennel & Cattery.Since the start of the pandemic, the false narrative that children are not susceptible to COVID-19 was plastered on every surface. Now, almost two years later, recent data shows that kids are equally likely, if not more likely, to catch the deadly virus than adults. It is essential to end the misinformation surrounding children and COVID and encourage parents to vaccinate themselves and their children.
Many experts suggest that the spike in COVID cases among children is related to the return to in-person learning. At the beginning of the school year, there was no vaccine available to those aged 12 and under, causing them to be more susceptible to infection. Most of these children have been quarantined and away from most of their peers for an extended period. By entering a germ-infested school with no protection from this virus, it was only a matter of time before infection rates spiked. California already requires students to be vaccinated against a majority of viruses, and pending FDA approval, children K-12 will be required to be immunized against COVID-19 to attend public schools.
Within recent months, the rate of children infected with COVID-19 has grown exponentially. In fact, children make up the bulk of the infected; this is partly due to the increase in vaccination rates among the older population. The good news is that as of Nov. 2, 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has authorized and recommended that all children aged five and older get vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech pediatric vaccine.
COVID-19 cases in children can result in severe health problems. During the summer, the CDC reported a five-fold increase in COVID cases among children, many of which resulted in hospitalization. Symptoms in children can last for months on end, resulting in “long COVID,” causing future complications for the child including fatigue, joint pain, myalgia, headache, breathing problems, concentration issues and disturbances of sensory function. During trials with ages 5-11, the authorized Pfizer vaccine was shown to be 91% effective; these numbers are similar to those presented during the testing phases of adults and adolescence.
Getting children vaccinated is beneficial not only for their health but also for their education. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona believes that vaccinating elementary-level kids will be a “game-changer” for the public school system. Not only will the vaccine keep schools open and prevent further quarantines it also will give parents peace of mind when sending their young and vulnerable children into public school environments. By increasing the percentage of vaccinated students within elementary and middle schools, the probability of returning to online school dramatically diminishes. While health and safety should always remain a priority in schools, educators and administrators will now be able to shift their focus to academics, making up for lost time caused by the pandemic.
The distribution of the pediatric vaccine began on Nov. 3 and is set to scale up to full capacity starting Nov. 8, 2021. All information regarding vaccination can be found on the official CDC website. Widespread vaccination is critical to protect everyone from being infected with COVID-19. Fully vaccinated individuals have been awarded the privilege of returning to a certain degree of normalcy; the sooner vaccination rates increase, the sooner people can safely return to pre-pandemic life.Intellectual PropertyAngola

Everyone was friendly and professional and the doctor went out of her way to get a second opinion based on my situation to see the alternative options that I had. Everything was explained fully and in terms easy enough for anyone to understand. I highly recommend this office to anyone in need of advice when it comes to stem cell treatment.

I Iove the adjustments and massages. However, the ripped adjustment table that sometimes doesn’t maintain its height is a serious issue. It’s time to invest in a new table. Also, the lighting in the massage room is too bright.

The services I have received at Optimum health have helped me on my path of healing. When I started I was in much and frequent pain. Now it is both less frequent and less intense. Adjustments by Dr Steve have helped as well as his coaching on ways to stretch and exercise to promote healing. The star of the group is the massage therapist, Petra. I have had massages by a number of professionals in my life, and she is the best by far. She is the reason that I drive 50 miles to the Cumming location for treatment.

Endless piles of what most consider trash fill the gigantic rooms of the facility. Those heaps are destined to filtered, compacted, and shipped to the nearest landfill. The Portland dump has a different approach. They have programs that allow artists and others to sort through trash that has been safely filtered through the system so that they can recycle their finds. I saw plenty of things that could be reused and made new again as I made my way through the mountains of junk.
Just ask artist Leslie Vigeant. Her project the Material Rescue League incorporated her precious finds from the dump. Leslie collected non-recyclable items and rehabilitated them into boutique products. Take a look at the final photo posted above, with interesting colors and materials packaged and displayed with care, all in the name of art and making the world a better and cleaner place.
As the birthday of this nation rolls around, keep those in mind who go out of their way to preserve the beauty of America. Be motivated by strong women like Leslie, who aren’t daunted by piles of stinky trash. Find the beauty in everything and use a little elbow grease to help others see that beauty as well.
Take a look at Leslie’s work gear: Carhartt Women’s Minot Shirt, Clarkston Cami Tank, Relaxed-Fit Canvas Kane Dungaree, & Carhartt Women’s Quick Flex Glove.Mozilla seems to be quite active these days. Not only for the Firefox browser, but the non-profit organization is working on some interesting products and future-oriented technology. After the announcement of Firefox Send and Lockbox, now the company is bringing one of the biggest updates for web browsers.
Mozilla’s Pyodide Project Brings Python Data Science to Browsers
According to a recent report by VentureBeat, Mozilla’s experimental Pyodide project is bringing Python data science stack to the web browser by compiling it to WebAssembly. Similar to Mozilla’s Iodide project, developers can use Pyodide as standalone or with context to run python in a browser.
If you are unaware, Pyodide is an implementation of Python’s Numpy scientific computing library, Pandas data analysis library, some parts of the SciPy library for math, science, and engineering. There’s also some contribution of Python’s Matplotib plotting library as well.
It provides transparent conversion of objects between Javascript and Python. When inside a browser, this means Python has full access to the Web APIs. Basic data types are implicitly converted and JavaScript typed arrays are converted to Python memoryviews.
JavaScript is the reason behind Pyodide. It’s already known as the language of the browser but does not have many features of data science libraries. Numerical computing features such as operator overloading are also missing as well. Mozilla may want to see the JavaScript data science ecosystem succeed, but bringing a complete Python scientific stack to the browser is definitely useful.
Pyodide compiles the standard Python interpreter, CPython, NumPy to WebAssembly binary format using Emscripten, and runs alongside the JavaScript in the browser. If you want to load the Pyodide into the browser, it will require the following things:
- Compiled Python interpreter as WebAssembly
- JavaScript from Emscripten that emulate system capabilities such as a virtual file system like a one expected by the Python interpreter
- Python interpreter supportive files including the Python standard library
As the files can be large, you have to only download the packages only once and they will be stored in the browser cache. You can try Pyodide by running a demo notebook from the Iodide website. If you are interested in building Pyodide, instructions are given on the Github.

Talking about other products, Mozilla keeps updating its Firefox browser to cope with the latest user tracking methods. The company is currently working to add Tor’s Anti-Fingerprinting technique dubbed as ‘Letterboxing’ in Firefox 67. The updated is expected to be released in May 2018.
Related PostsAn unorthodox start. Approaching the Accademia is easy, yellow signs at eye level encourage visitors. A bridge and an art gallery each bear the same name. It translates as Academy and was usually a place of study and learning for art, music or literature. So I’ll start here.
ACCADEMIA – La Carità Chiesa is the home of an art collection assembled from the houses, palaces, guilds and churches of Venice. The great artists Bellini, Carpaccio, Giorgione, Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese are all found here. A synopsis of Venetian art elegantly displayed in a series of rooms conveys the depth and talent of painting in the maritime republic of Venezia. It’s rich and deep and broad.
BARCA – this is Italian for boat and they come in all shapes and sizes in Venice. There’s a boat for every purpose; topo, sandolo, gondola. They are all powered by people, rowing with wooden oars. A barca a remi, typical Venetian rowing boat is ubiquitous in the lagoon. Several times a year there are regattas and teams from all of the lagoon compete for prizes. Every day in Venice you’ll see boats; ambulance boats, funeral boats, delivery boats and gondolas – the boats are all there defining the city and establishing it’s unique maritime heritage.
CANALETTO was inspired by Venice, the quality of the light radiating from sky to sea. The waters of the lagoon in perpetual movement, the whiteness of the stone, hauled block by block from Istria to sparkle in the midday sun. Canvases followed in great numbers, views of Venice. The ultimate souvenir for wealthy visitors. Canaletto’s paintings sprinkle the country houses of the British Isles. There’s a veritable horde in Buckingham Palace. A lasting testimony to the beguiling and enduring appeal of Venice.
DORSODURO is a district of Venice, one of six sestiere. It extends from San Polo and Rialto towards the Dogana or Customs Point. Here at the entrance to the Grand Canal was the cash office, the place where ships paid their dues. Imagine lines of desks, each with a clerk earnestly recording the cargoes arriving from far flung places. Velvets and silks from Constantinople, Spices and herbs from Alexandria, Olive oil from Monopoli, Grain from Sicily. Each clerk assiduously writing out a receipt of goods and demanding the necessary fees and charges.
FONDAMENTA a wide pavement that runs along the edge of the lagoon. A place for mooring boats, where people would meet and chat, buy and sell goods, smoke and gossip, scheme and plan. A place brimming with life and energy, joy and desperation.
GIUDECCA is an island. It sprawls like a lazy snake running parallel with the Grand Canal, a suggestion of a river’s meander making its way across the lagoon to the sea. An island of working people, plumbers and bricklayers, hod carriers and housing. Noisy and crowded, serving the palaces and merchants across the water.
LAGUNA – the waters of The Venetian Lagoon have protected and enshrined Venice for centuries. A scintillating green and blue solution of shallow, lapping water, reflecting the sun’s rays from its ruffled surface. Nestling in this watery hinterland, a unique city was built on a series of mud flats. A watery haven, quite literally, protected by the lagoon and threatened by the sea, a delicious dichotomy of bounty and threat. A huge natural harbour offering safe anchorage for ships. A vast wetland sanctuary for all types of birds. Shallow and sometimes brackish waters for fish and molluscs, clams and vongole.
MERCATI – the markets bustled with life from dawn until dusk, selling everything imaginable. Loading and unloading barrels, boxes and sacks from every corner of the lagoon. Rialto was the beating heart of the market, noise and madness, grit and determination. The inspiration for Shakespeare when he developed Shylock’s character in ‘The Merchant of Venice’. Even today the fish market especially in springtime is a visual feast for the eyes, fabulous fish, crabs, prawns and seafood of all types, straight from the waters of the lagoon and the Adriatic beyond. In May the unique and prized ‘carciofi’ of Sant’Erasmo hit the stands, succulent and juicy, prized for their tender and slightly saline taste. So typical of Venice.
PALAZZO – hundreds of elegant palaces line the Grand Canal in Venice, at least three hundred, side by side along the most historic, architectural waterway in Italy. The palaces were private homes for wealthy Venetians, family homes but also places to entertain visitors from abroad and business associates. Every palace had an entrance from the canal and an entrance from the street. Important guests would always arrive by boat directly to the private landing stage of the palace. Only the staff arrived on foot!
QUERINI – a wealthy Venetian family, one of the oldest and most prestigious families in the city. The Palazzo Querini was built adjacent to the Church of Santa Maria Formosa just east of Piazza San Marco and the Doge’s Palace. The Querini were an intelligent bunch, creating and building a library. When the last family member died in the 1860s they left the palace as a centre for learning, open to all. Today the library of the Querini-Stampalia is one of the most popular and welcoming in Venice. Perhaps the Querini were Venice’s first philanthropists.
QUARANTENA – the term Quarantine originated in Venice. As an international trading city from the 12th century onwards, ships arrived in Venice from all corners of the Mediterranean. The plague and other noxious diseases arrived in Venice from time to time. The city recognised the need to hold ships suspected of carrying disease at the edge of the lagoon, originally for a period of thirty days, later extended to forty days. The Italian word for forty is quaranta, and the term became synonymous with a period of isolation enforced on crews and vessels prior to being permitted to set foot on foreign shores.
RIALTO – The most famous bridge in Venice links the districts of San Marco and San Polo, lined with small shops, the bridge spans the Grand Canal. The shallow steps leading up to the top of the bridge have been worn smooth over the years by the Venetians and visitors to the city. Shylock, the money lender would meet his customers in the shadows of the Rialto Bridge. But beware the interest rate charged whilst always high was usually negotiable.
SCHIAVONI – Riva degli Schiavoni was one of the busiest waterfront piers in the city of Venice. Just a few paces from the Doge’s Palace and San Marco. Crowded with people and parcels, morning, noon and night. When Carlo Goldoni, the famous playwright arrived back in Venice, after a number of years, he described the vibrancy and vitality of his home town. The smell of food cooking in the streets, wine pouring, friends joking. Traders shouting, people drinking and dancing, children romping. Folks from Greece, Turkey, Croatia and Armenia laughing, debating, playing cards. All this in the early hours of the morning. Venice was the original city that never sleeps.
SOTOPORTEGO – An archway or covered alley way leading from a square into another narrow walk way (these walk ways are known as ‘calle’ in Venetian). The ‘sotoportego’ literally means under the door frame or under the porch. There are numerous ‘sotoportego’ archways in Venice linking one area with another. They were a necessity in a city where buildings covered every inch of the habitable area. A ‘sotoportego’ provided access to people and hand carts, even if there was a palace above and to both sides of the alley way. The ‘sotoportego’ often has a colourful names that helps us to imagine what happened here in days gone by. For example ‘Sotoportego del Carbon’ which translates to ‘Archway of the Coal’. Another favourite is ‘Sotoportego dei Preti’ which is Archway of the Priests.
TEDESCHI – it’s the Germans and their timber yard at the Rialto. Venice was built on a series of mud flats, meandering like stepping stones from the edge of the lagoon towards the open sea. These mud flats were shifting sands, quite literally. They had to be consolidated and strengthened to provide solid foundations for building. The Venetians did this by importing logs from the mountains to the north. These logs were floated down the rivers to the lagoon where they were loaded and sorted in the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, the German Warehouse. The Fondaco dei Tedeschi was a timber exchange, where timber was stored, weighed, examined and sold. In the shadow of the Rialto Bridge, this is a building that has seen it all over the years. It’s seen them come and it has seen them go.
VENEZIA – La Serenissima, a unique trading republic, built in the middle of a lagoon, by a small group of tough and independent people, who created the city from nothing. Originally fishermen, living in timber huts, then boat builders and finally traders. The Venetians were canny and resilient, they still are, they created a trading empire that stretched from Venice to Constantinople in the east. The Venetians controlled all of north-eastern Italy, including Verona, Padova and Trieste. In the Mediterranean the Venetians controlled Cyprus and Crete and the island of Corfu along with the whole of the Dalmatian Coast (modern day Dubrovnik). At home in the lagoon, the Venetians developed public buildings, churches and squares (campos). As ships flowed into the lagoon so too did money. The Venetians became rich, and magnificent palaces were constructed along the banks of the Grand Canal.
WEDDING – technically ‘matrimonio’ in Italian. But there isn’t a ‘w’ in the Italian alphabet so I thought I’d cheat with the fabulous, fairy-tale wedding that I was fortunate to experience just one year ago, at the peerless ‘Cipriani’ Hotel on Venice’s Giudecca island. The views across the lagoon to San Marco are superlative. A young Venetian couple were determined that their special day should be thoroughly Venetian – they totally succeeded. You can read the full story here: A Perfect Wedding in Venice.
XE – in Venetian dialect xe = e in Italian. The Venetian dialect is difficult for visitors to understand, it was a means of keeping strangers at a distance. An unfamiliar language. A perfect example might be as follows, a Venetian might say to you……..’No xe vero ti xe bugiaro?’ which means ‘Is it true you are a liar?’ or in Italian you’d say ‘Non e vero sei bugiardo’. The visitor would suspect that they had just been insulted, but they couldn’t be certain. A perfect way of excluding a visitor from conversation if necessary.
ZATTERE – the most scenic waterfront in Venice, this fondamenta is lined with elegant shipping offices including the magnificent Adriatica Building and the wonderful Baroque church of The Jesuits. For me this is the true beating heart of Venice. Many Venetians choose to live here. It’s a neighbourhood of elegant apartments, art galleries and funky little artisan shops. Across the water on Giudecca is the Fortuny factory. They make fabulous silks and rich, embroidered fabrics typical and unique to the city of Venice. Mariano Fortuny the founder was from Spain. He was enchanted by the beauty of Venice, the colours and views. The unique combination of sky and sea. He wasn’t the first and he certainly won’t be the last.

Please indulge my idiosyncratic wander through the alphabet of Venice. A purely personal glimpse of a city that has intrigued me for years. ‘Veneziani sono furbi‘ a friend said to me once, this means the Venetians are crafty, sly, devious even. Maybe they are and maybe they are not, but what they are is hard-working, tough, resilient and kind. If I needed help I know who I’d turn to in a crisis without a second thought. It would be a Venetian, as we say in England, any day of the week. That means always!

Thank you so much Janet. I am flattered by your generous words. Attending university as an undergraduate at Oxford would have been a dream come true for me.

The reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles are suffering from a ton of injuries, raiding of their offensive staff and just a wee bit of hangover from winning the big game. The New York Giants, after selecting running back Saquon Barkley at number two overall in the draft, have realized that *gasp* maybe it is time to give up on Eli Manning after all. And, the Washington Redskins, who looked like the team to beat in the division just five days ago, will now limp their way to the finish, with Colt McCoy as their starting quarterback.READ MORE: TCU Falls 48-14 To Iowa State
That leaves the Cowboys as the likely favorites. Granted, all four teams are within three games of first place (yes, even the lowly Giants are still alive). But Dallas seems to be playing the best football and remains the healthiest team. They have a chance to take over the division lead tomorrow, while America sits down to Thanksgiving dinner. To get some insight into the game, and several others on tap for the weekend, we caught up with CBS Dallas reporter Ken Molestina.
Washington Redskins @ Dallas Cowboys, Thursday 4:30 p.m. Eastern (FOX)
Washington, at 6-4, with the Cowboys just a game back, at 5-5. Even though Washington won in the first game this year, the Cowboys are looking to claim the W this time around. They have a lot of momentum going into this game, winning their last two on the road, when no one really expected them to do so. The Cowboys defense is still looking strong, while the Cowboys offense remains pretty steady.
Unfortunately for Washington, their ace quarterback Alex Smith is out for the rest of the season with a broken leg. Backup quarterback Colt McCoy will be stepping in, and I’m not expecting him to have a breakthrough performance. Dallas is a much more complete team going into this game, my money is on the Cowboys.
Miami Dolphins @ Indianapolis Colts, Sunday 4:25 p.m. Eastern (CBS)READ MORE: Happy Black Friday! Experts Predict 159 Million People Ready To Shop This Weekend
The Dolphins and Colts are both 5-5 heading into this game. The Dolphins got off to a hot start, winning three straight games this season, but they have only won two since. Still keeping an eye on Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill, who could return to this game after a shoulder injury. But, that is not for sure.
Andrew Luck and the Colts are looking much stronger as of late compared to the Dolphins. I love the Dolphins, but I do not see them winning this game. Winner: Colts
Pittsburgh Steelers @ Denver Broncos, Sunday 4:25 p.m. Eastern (CBS)
Both teams are coming off of wins. The Steelers, however, have won six straight, and they lead the AFC North. Roethlisberger is having a fantastic season, and so is the Steeler defense. The Broncos have been moving the ball well, but they haven’t always turned that into points. Their defense, though, is tough to beat. This is a close one, but I’m going to go ahead and take the Steelers in this matchup.
Green Bay Packers @ Minnesota Vikings, Sunday, 8:25 p.m. Eastern (NBC)MORE NEWS: Missing Canadian Aaron Tschritter Last Seen In Deep Ellum Came For Cowboys Game, Never Made It
Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers is having another phenomenal season with 19 touchdowns and just one interception. As for the Vikings, they are looking good but so far, not playoff good, in my opinion. The two teams tied in Week 2, and this time I see the Packers taking the win. I think Aaron Rodgers is awesome.Ulster Unionist Health spokesperson, Alan Chambers MLA, has described as ‘intolerable’ the situation whereby under the NI Protocol, medicines that are readily available in Great Britain would be restricted or even unavailable in Northern Ireland.
Alan Chambers said:
“Earlier this year under the NI Protocol we saw the EU move to limit the movement of certain types of goods and foodstuffs from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Now, also via the Protocol, the EU is seeking to restrict the movement of medicines from one part of the UK to another.
“This is intolerable and a world away from claims of ‘the best of both worlds’ that some people and parties once promised us. It is also a salutary lesson for those who demanded the ‘rigorous implementation’ of the Protocol.
“With the grace period due to end on 1st January 2022 there has been considerable concern about the effect that the Northern Ireland Protocol is going to have on the supply of medicines and medical devices into Northern Ireland after that date. Suppliers of these goods had to serve notice on the UK Government by the end of June 2021 if they intended to cease sending products to Northern Ireland.
“Lord Frost, who had previously given general evidence to the Lords EU Sub-Committee on the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland on the 14th July 2021, wrote to the Chair of the Committee, Lord Jay, on the 28th July 2021 (see attached). In that letter Lord Frost offered more details, in particular on supply of medicines to Northern Ireland. He revealed that to date formal notifications of between 280 and 290 confirmed medicine discontinuations of supply to Northern Ireland had been received. He stated that the DHSC had also been alerted by suppliers to a number of additional potential discontinuations from 1st January 2022 which are yet to be confirmed and that DHSC are currently in discussion with those suppliers.
“We have already witnessed the EU peddle the complete fiction that the Protocol is designed to protect the Belfast Agreement whilst simultaneously denying us the right to bring in goods from the rest of our own country. It would be insulting our intelligence for anyone to try to claim that denying us the right to bring in medicines from the rest of our own country is in any way protecting the Belfast Agreement.
“The Ulster Unionist Party regards the situation affecting the supply of medicines and medical devices as absolutely unacceptable and it must not be allowed. We welcome, and fully support, the comments contained in the recently published UK Government Command Paper that ‘given the range and depth of these challenges, the simplest way forward may be to remove all medicines from the scope of the Protocol entirely.”

PRESS RELEASE
PASO DEL NORTE CIVIL RIGHTS CENTER BRINGS FIRST LAWSUIT, SUES
EL PASO COUNTY OVER SHERIFF SAMANIEGOS OPERATION LINEBACKER
The Paso del Norte Civil Rights Center, which held its inaugural reception just last Tuesday, has filed its first lawsuit. The Center has taken over a pro se federal complaint, filed by El Paso resident Carl Starr on May 26, against Sheriff Leo Samaniegos Operation Linebacker program.
The amended complaint, filed today in U.S. District Court in El Paso, adds El Paso County as a defendant because Operation Linebacker is a program of the county sheriff and thus of the county.
The suit alleges that Carl Starr, of Hispanic origin, was on a public county bus en route to El Paso from Tornillo, on March 21, 2006, when an El Paso deputy sheriff began following the bus, and pulled it over. This occurred about four miles west of Fabens on highway Texas 20.
The deputy sheriff then came up to the bus drivers window and asked the driver for identification. The deputy told the driver he had touched or crossed the white line. Mr. Starr did not notice the bus cross any white line.
The deputy then asked the driver to open the bus door. He boarded the bus, and without legal cause or justification, asked Plaintiff and other passengers for identification. The deputy removed five or six passengers, of Hispanic origin, who had no identification. During this time, Mr. Starr asked the deputy if he was with Operation Linebacker, and the deputy said yes.
Ultimately, the deputy wrote the bus driver a warning ticket, and kept the men behind whom he had taken from the bus. This incident and detention lasted about thirty (30) minutes.
The suit says the deputy conducted his unlawful activities pursuant to Operation Linebacker, and the deputy engaged in illegal racial and ethnic profiling, and also sought to implement federal immigration laws without legal authority to do so. The suit also alleges that any number of unlawful searches, seizures, and detentions are conducted as part of the Countys Operation Linebacker.
Operation Linebacker has drawn severe criticism for its operation, and last week 3000 El Paso residents filed a petition, asking Sheriff Samaniego to resign because county residents have been asked for their Social Security cards and immigration papers by sheriff’s deputies during regular traffic stops, traffic checkpoints or while traveling by bus in the past few months. They said they have even been driven to immigration offices in sheriff’s patrol cars.
The suit asks for reasonable damages and that the federal judge halt Operation Linebacker.
Carl Starr is represented by two attorneys for the Paso del Norte Civil Rights Center, Ed Hernández of El Paso and Jim Harrington of Austin, also director of the Texas Civil Rights Project, which supports the Paso del Norte Center.Enjoy our selection of 186 best No1 World Beautiful Girl HD XXX videos! 100% Free!!!

No Crisis Travels: 10 Methods For Preventing Psychological Family Members Snares
Christmas are made to generally be a contented season—a opportunity any time relatives and buddies get together to commemorate and reflect on the season.
For many of us, however, christmas can spark sensations of tension, disenchantment, and also dread. Versus relishing energy with families, the summer season reminds all of them of dissatisfied memories, financial obligations, run-ins with dysfunctional family members, and old household heritages that will no longer bring delight. Since vacation are made to act as really a time for rest and enjoyment, numerous would argue these are usually the other.
You are unable to handle other individuals or functions. But with the right centered understanding you are able to actively prefer to react other than respond. Mahatma Gandhi once recommended that many of us “be the change all of us would like to notice in our world.” Taking responsibility for how you interpret and navigate your experiences is the first step in successfully managing any tumultuous circumstance.
Decide to try one—or all—of these 10 ways to have actually a more tranquil, drama-free retreat, contains how to proceed if competition spiral out of control.
Devote more time to Out-of-doors in Nature
Being exterior in nature can help elevate emotional quality, stimulate the mind and the entire body, and hook that you your loved ones and also the location. Timetable some backyard efforts with nearest and dearest during travels get-togethers. Get an early on morning hours walk by the recreation area, an afternoon increase throughout the mountains, or an evening walk around a lake. Throwing a football, generating accumulated snow angels, or ice-skating are several outdoor work which is able to disturb the psychological agitation that creeps in during a lengthy retreat weekend with kids.
Commit to Trying To Keep it Positive
It’s better to uphold a good personality when you arrive in this particular state of mind.
Maybe you’ve experienced the returning pessimist, who floats around personal get-togethers leaching pessimism into every conversation. You aren’t going to change that person’s manners. Their mindset and ways in which your plan your situation offer a broad ripple impact the earth that you’re in.
A beneficial outlook makes interactions nicer; it will change up the energy of an area quickly and has now the energy to inspire and enable those surrounding you execute alike. Imagine simply what you would enjoy seeing occur in certain circumstances unlike every thing you ought not arise. Make sure to agree to trying to keep the talk and state of mind mild and favorable.
Allow Yourself to Disengage
At some point via holiday breaks, a colleague, family member or houseguest might being more and more bad. Perhaps the largest trap of being around adverse individuals is actually the propensity to react to the case by arguing or defending our selves. Often the very best responses is definitely a non-response. The okay wander aside as soon as a scenario warrants some separation. Giving on your own license to gently remove yourself from equation, you can sustain your personal restrictions and guard your energy.
Prepare Exciting Inside Tasks Get Ready To Enjoy Along
Starting actions together is a good way to connection looked after encourages possibilities to generate greater emotional connections with those you enjoy. Joy is actually treatments. Produce popcorn and watch comedies jointly to create an air of lightheartedness into your opportunity along. Baking and designing travels cookies tends to be a creative way to communicate, and playing board games or Charades may help encourage cluster participation.
Have actually an idea to help you Anticipated Dangers
You typically get a variety in the way you behave. Once you learn you are going into a scenario with repeatedly verified intense with a member of family, attempt to identify the manner in which you might possibly behave in different ways than you’ve got during the past.
If you already know that their mother-in-law desires to prepare every minute associated with retreat escape and you simply prefer to get natural, treat it advance with the intention that everyone is clear just before arriving. So long as you despise sports the kids would like to obtain across the lifeless display enjoying tennis on Thanksgiving night, make a strategy taking your self out purchasing, go for a walk, check out with somebody which resides near, or take in a movie. The good to say no to a few work that will later make you feel confused or resentful. Most likely, here’s your holiday also.
Encourage Fun Talk
Have some innovative conversation going. Go around the treat desk and invite everyone to express a common memories from the past yr or their own desire to become together the holiday season. Query everyone precisely what inspires these people or just who their most favorite friend is—and precisely why. A lighthearted and centered dialogue that everyone can get involved in helps in keeping the feeling favorable and can also also make exciting and lasting memories.
Take some time in Stillness and Quiet
Yoga is often a great way to resume your own peaceful center, nevertheless we frequently neglect our religious procedures when we finally’ve walked considering the usual program. A consistent practicing meditation application establishes one awake for success in working with being’s most difficult challenges and situations. Christmas aren’t any exception.
Be sure to take minutes at the outset of on a daily basis to sit down in stillness and silence getting attached to your very own core. Done continually, reflection will assist you to determine situation and events from a better viewpoint, and you may start to feel much less triggered by annoyances.
Be asleep with anxiety and flaw
The holidays is generally filled with focus, shame, and attitude of duty. Pressure throughout the day to look smoothly, foods to become absolutely timed, and all in order to get along contributes unnecessary worry to a gathering of friends. The holiday season don’t need to be perfect.A number of commentators on this new map of food deserts in the United States suggest the reason there are rural food deserts out West is because few people live in these areas. Here is a sample of the comments (from three different people):
surprise surprise……grocery stores don’t exist where people don’t live. It doesn’t take a statistician to figure that out. (Only to spend the time to show people that in a brightly-colored graph.)
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Commenters here have it correct. This graph is an absolute waste of time given that there SHOULDN’T be fresh food available where there are no people to eat it. “You can see the number of grocery stores multiply as you start in Nevada and enter into California’s urban areas.” Duh.
Crisis creation. Move along folks. Nothing to see here but smoke and mirrors.
The creator of the map explains how he measured food deserts in more rural areas:.”
There are two issues at work. One is how exactly to define a food desert. One mile might make sense in a city but is 10 miles a good measure in a more rural area? The second issue is behind the scenes and concerns more than just grocery stores in rural areas: how exactly should services and businesses be distributed in rural areas? How many health care facilities should there be? What about social services? Businesses and organizations could make a case that it is difficult to make money or cover their costs in such a rural environment.
One way around this would be to distinguish between urban food deserts and rural food deserts.This sample explains how to restrict the addition of files having a particular media type.. Copy the

Hi folks,
When we work with VMCs containing dozens of components it is necessary to scroll down the "Component visibility" sub-menu in order to reach the option "View Components", which is a much more convenient way to use when you want to change the visibility of several components at once. The way it is now, when we want to change the visibility of multiple components we have to scroll down this menu (Which is a little slow for the sake of accuracy - I'm Ok with that) and uncheck one by one, starting over the launch of this sub-menu for each item.
I'd like to see a change where the option "View components" is shown at the top of the list, this way we don't have to scroll down the menu (and wait to reach the bottom of the list) when dealing with VMCs containing several components. We would be able to open the menu in the very first option and thus select what we want to view/hide.
This one is also a small improvement in the software ergonomy.

Looking for the best cryptocurrency to buy now in August week 1? We have an interesting lineup for the first week of August. Let’s check them out.
1. Stacks (STX)
Starting off the list is STX, the native token of the layer-1 Bitcoin blockchain solution, Stacks. The price of the STX token gained 15.93% in the last 24 hours and is currently trading at $1.41.
With a market cap of $1.7billion and a solid ranking on the chart, the STX coin should definitely be considered a top cryptocurrency to buy now.
The Stacks Foundation, which governs the Stacks technology, has been actively developing the network recently. The foundation announced a few days ago that crypto firm, Blockchain.com has listed the STX token on their Exchange.
The listing includes STX-USDT, STX-USDC, and STX-USD pairs.
Last month, the Stacks Foundation also kicked off a new portal called Clarity Universe. The portal is focused on creating awareness for the Clarity smart contract language. The clarity language event is meant to mark the beginning of a new era of smart contracts on Bitcoin.
2. THORChain (RUNE)
The RUNE token of the THORChain network is next on our roundup of the cryptocurrency to buy now. The asset has been on an uptrend since last week and is currently still gaining numbers.
At press time, RUNE is trading at $6.96, with the price moving up by 8.61% in the last 24 hours. RUNE is ranked at number 59 of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap.
By the end of the year, the THORChain network worked on upgrades to transition into a multi-chain network.
Earlier this year, the network already launched its cross-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) THORSwap and its Chaosnet platform. The latest rollout is the collaboration between THORChain and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Synthetix. The partnership, which was announced in June, led to the ThorChain Synthetics project on THORSwap.
3. Decentraland (MANA)
With such a strong presence in the virtual reality world, Decentraland’s MANA is one major cryptocurrency to buy now.
The ERC-20 token used for governance and payment tasks on the blockchain-based game platform has a market capitalization of about $1.2 billion. MANA ranks among the top 70 most valuable cryptocurrencies on the market.
Although MANA is currently down by 0.78%, that should not deter investors from prioritizing it as a cryptocurrency to buy now.
The asset which trades at $0.695 has a good standing because it is a token that involves NFTs. With the way NFTs have gained momentum this year, MANA is on its way to breaking over its present price.
This strong NFT standing can be seen in Decentraland’s recent partnership with popular brand Coca-cola. The blockchain firm happened to be among the partners for Coca-Cola’s launch and auction of its first-ever NFT collection. The global beverage company also collaborated with NFT marketplace OpenSea and designer Tafi.
In June, the world’s oldest auction house Sotheby’s, chose Decentraland as its preferred destination for a virtual gallery. Sotheby’s claim of its stake in the metaverse by opening its first-ever virtual gallery shows the popularity of the Decentraland project.
4. Shiba Inu (SHIB)
Known popularly as the “Dogecoin killer,” Shiba Inu broke into the crypto scene following a 21,000% increase in just one week. This has seen several investors stack up on SHIB and why we believe it is one of the best cryptocurrency to buy now given its relatively cheap price.
Following hot on Dogecoin’s heels, Shiba Inu has been a revelation and has become a clear favorite in the hot meme coins scene. After Dogecoin, Shiba Inu is the next most popular dog-themed cryptocurrency.
This has seen it become one of the top meme-based cryptocurrencies.
It recently launched its decentralized exchange (DEX) platform ShibaSwap which enables users to DIG (provide liquidity), BURY (stake), and SWP tokens to gain WOOF returns. It also allows users to generate passive income from their SHIB tokens.
Aside from being a liquidity protocol, ShibaSwap also supports digital collectibles or non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
Currently, 1 SHIB goes for $0.000006 having dipped by 0.35% in the last 24 hours. However, SHIB is still a high ranking coin with a market cap of roughly $2.5 billion and is the 44th most valuable crypto asset.
Looking beyond its price action, Shiba Inu has seen growing adoption and this should be a good reason to add it among your cryptocurrency to buy now list.
The Dogecoin spinoff was recently added to social trading platform eToro over the weekend. The online broker added support for the SHIB token following growing demand from users.
5. Polkadot (DOT)
Polkadot’s unique value proposition and strong affiliation with the Ethereum network makes it a cryptocurrency to buy now.
Founded by former Ethereum co-founder and CTO Dr.Gavin Wood, Polkadot is a multi-chain heterogeneous blockchain platform that enables both private and public blockchains to communicate using sharded technology.
In essence, it enables the trustless transfer of value between blockchain platforms.
Polkadot sports four core components, including a relay chain, parachain, parathreads, and bridges. Its Relay Chain serves as the heart of the blockchain platform and enables consensus and interoperability across several blockchains.
Parachains are independent blockchains that have their own tokens while leveraging on the Polkadot protocol. On the other hand, parathreads enable flexible connectivity as crypto protocols can choose to host their platforms temporarily on the Polkadot network.
At press time, Polkadot was trading at $17.43 and is down by 3.49%. Even though the DOT token price is currently down, it has a large trading volume of $1.4billion in the last 24 hours.
Polkadot is one of the popular ‘Ethereum killers’ and its growing adoption by dapps have seen it become one of the top ten most valuable cryptocurrencies.
Although Polkadot has not fully launched its dapps platform, its sister canary network Kusama is expected to herald in parachain auctions for the network.
Last month, the first decentralized exchange on the Kusama ecosystem was launched by Karura, the decentralized finance (DeFi) network of the Acala Foundation. According to the announcement, Karura Swap opened for trading with $3.4 million in total value locked.
Once the Kusama parachain auction is complete, Polkadot will commence its parachain auctioning and this would likely see its DOT token surge.
Capital at risk.

-.The recent changes, disruption if you will, to the supply-demand balance of North American construction framing softwood lumber and panel products have worked their way through the market. Last week customers came back to suppliers with higher-volume orders than in recent weeks. This provided sawmills the ability to hold steady on prices for benchmark Western Spruce-Pine-Fir 2×4 #2&Btr KD (RL), at US$310 mfbm.
Producers in other regions like the US south or Quebec dropped prices slightly but refused to go any lower.
Western S-P-F traders in the United States reported a steadier pace to sales activity last week as reduced production helped stabilize business and slow the bleeding of prices. Substantial volumes of low grade were ear-marked for shipment to China. There are many questions about home building and construction activity in the US. Last week buying from reloads and stocking wholesalers was relatively strong, however the final destination is remodelling and home improvement rather than new housing starts. Expectations are that major construction activity in the US will return later this summer.
“Western Spruce-Pine-Fir prices flattened out following sweeping sawmill curtailments; plywood prices were flat while Oriented Strand Board prices slid further down.” — Madison’s Lumber Reporter
Widespread curtailments at virtually every major Canadian lumber producer stopped the freefall in WSPF pricing last week. Order files at sawmills began to stretch out up to two weeks depending on the product. A burgeoning sense of panic spread among customers with depleted inventories as they realized the lion’s share of extremely limited production was spoken for. Major suppliers had already designated virtually all their low grade production for shipment to China.
In week ending April 10, 2020, benchmark Western Spruce-Pine-Fir 2×4 prices were US$310 mfbm, unchanged from the previous week. Last week’s price was down US$136, or -31%, compared to one month ago.
Madison’s Lumber Prices, weekly, are a good forecast indicator of US home builder’s current lumber buying activity ——> DETAILS
Be ahead of these data releases … Don’t delay, this week’s softwood lumber market comment was published to the website Monday morning.
“Both supply and demand stumbled again last week according to Eastern Canadian lumber purveyors. Buyers were apparently active early in the week, mostly probing the wholesale community for any remaining loads selling below replacement.” — Madison’s Lumber Reporter
Last week’s Western S-P-F 2×4 prices is down -$66, or -18%, relative to the 1-year rolling average price of US$376 mfbm and is down -$109, or -26% relative to the 2-year rolling average price of US$419 mfbm.

Dataform will connect to BigQuery using Application Default Credentials or using a service account.
If using Application Default Credentials ensure that the service account or user has
BigQuery Admin role or equivalent. (Dataform requires access to create queries and list tables.) Read this if you need help.
You’ll need to create a service account from your Google Cloud Console and assign it permissions to access BigQuery.
BigQuery Adminrole. (Admin access is required by Dataform so that it can create datasets and list tables.) Read this if you need help.
BigQuery specific options can be applied to tables using the
bigquery configuration parameter.
BigQuery supports partitioned tables. These can be useful when you have data spread across many different dates but usually query the table on only a small range of dates. In these circumstances, partitioning will increase query performance and reduce cost.
BigQuery partitions can be configured in Dataform using the
partitionBy option:
1config { 2 type: "table", 3 bigquery: { 4 partitionBy: "DATE(ts)" 5 } 6} 7SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS ts
This query compiles to the following statement which takes advantage of BigQuery's DDL to configure partitioning:
1CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE dataform.example 2PARTITION BY DATE(ts) 3AS (SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS ts)
Tables can also be partitioned by hour,
1config { 2 type: "table", 3 bigquery: { 4 partitionBy: "DATETIME_TRUNC(<timestamp_column>, HOUR)" 5 } 6}
... month,
1config { 2 type: "table", 3 bigquery: { 4 partitionBy: "DATE_TRUNC(<date_column>, MONTH)" 5 } 6}
... or an integer value.
1config { 2 type: "table", 3 bigquery: { 4 partitionBy: "RANGE_BUCKET(<integer_column>, GENERATE_ARRAY(0, 1000000, 1000))" 5 } 6}
If desired, tables can be clustered by using the
clusterBy option, for example:
1config { 2 type: "table", 3 bigquery: { 4 partitionBy: "DATE(ts)", 5 clusterBy: ["name", "revenue"] 6 } 7} 8SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() as ts, name, revenue
In order to be able to query Google Sheets tables via BigQuery, you'll need to share the sheet with the service account that is used by Dataform.
.df-credentials.jsonfile.
BigQuery labels are key-value pairs that help you organize your Google Cloud BigQuery resources. To use them in Dataform, add them to the config block:
1config { 2 type: "table", 3 bigquery: { 4 labels: { 5 label1: "val1", 6 /* If the label name contains special characters, e.g. hyphens, then quote its name. */ 7 "label-2": "val2" 8 } 9 } 10} 11 12select "test" as column1
You can both read from and publish to two separate GCP project_ids within a single Dataform project. For example, you may have a project_id called
raw that contains raw data loaded in your warehouse and a project_id called
analytics in which you create data tables you use for analytics and reporting.
Your default project id is defined in the
defaultDatabase field in your
dataform.json file.
1{ 2 "warehouse": "bigquery", 3 "defaultSchema": "dataform", 4 "assertionSchema": "dataform_assertions", 5 "defaultDatabase": "raw" 6}
You can then override the default gcp project id in the
database field in the config block of your SQLX files
1config { 2 type: "table", 3 database: "analytics" 4}
You can configure separate project-ids for development and production in your
environment.json file. The process is described on this page.
When creating incremental tables from partitioned tables in BigQuery, some extra care needs to be taken to avoid full table scans, as BigQuery can't optimize
where statements that are computed from inline select statements. To work around this, values used in the where clause should be moved to a
pre_operations block and saved into a variable using BigQuery scripting.
Here's a simple incremental example for BigQuery that follows this pattern, where the source table
raw_events is already partitioned by
event_timestamp .
1config { 2 type: "incremental", 3} 4 5pre_operations { 6 declare event_timestamp_checkpoint default ( 7 ${when(incremental(), 8 `select max(event_timestamp) from ${self()}`, 9 `select timestamp("2000-01-01")`)} 10 ) 11} 12 13select 14 * 15from 16 ${ref("raw_events")} 17where event_timestamp > event_timestamp_checkpoint
This will avoid a full table scan on the
raw_events table when inserting new rows, only looking at the most recent partitions it needs to.
If you use policy tags for managing column-level security in BigQuery, then you can set policy tags on columns in tables via the Dataform config block. Note that any policy tags created directly in BigQuery will get overwritten when Dataform updates the table, so make sure that you configure all policy tags within Dataform.
Policy Tag Adminpermission.
Here's an example of setting a policy tag on a column. The full tag identifier must be used as in the example below. This can be easily copied to your clipboard from the taxonomies and tags page inside the Google Catalog.
my_table.sqlx
1config { 2 type: "table", 3 columns: { 4 column1: { 5 description: "Some description", 6 bigqueryPolicyTags: ["projects/dataform-integration-tests/locations/us/taxonomies/800183280162998443/policyTags/494923997126550963"] 7 } 8 } 9} 10 11select "test" as column1
Dataform validates the compiled script you are editing against BigQuery in real time. It will let you know if the query is valid (or won’t run) before having to run it.
Dataform displays Bytes processed and Bytes billed for every run you do in Dataform in the run logs page. You can then estimate the cost of those queries by multiplying the bytes billed by your company price per Byte.
We prepared the following sample project using the Stackoverflow public dataset.
We published a package that helps the analysis of BigQuery usage logs. You can find more information by reading the related blog post or the package page.
We published the following blog post specifically for BigQuery users.
The blog post offers a walkthrough to use Google Cloud Functions to push data from tables and views in BigQuery to third party services like Intercom.

Understanding Abuse & Harassment Laws
When someone is abused or harassed, he or she needs to decide on the best way to get legal protection from the abuse or harassment. To do that, several things must be considered, such as:).
Keep in mind that abuse and domestic violence do not have to be only physical. Abuse can be verbal (spoken), emotional, or psychological. Someone does not have to be physically hit to be abused. Often, abuse takes many forms, and abusers use a combination of tactics to control and have power over the person being abused.
Someone being abused in any of these ways or feeling afraid or controlled by a partner/spouse or someone they are close with, it may help to talk to a domestic violence counselor, even if the victim does not want (or is not sure if they want) to ask for legal protection. victim out of the state against the victim’s will), or other behavior that causes physical harm, pain, or mental suffering; OR
- Deprivation by a caregiver of things or services that the elder or dependent adult needs to avoid physical harm or mental suffering.
Civil Harassment
Civil harassment is harassment by:
- Unlawful violence, like assault or battery or stalking; OR
- A credible threat of violence. ); AND
- The violence or threats seriously scare, annoy, or harass someone and there is no valid reason for it.
The harassment must be by someone the victim has not dated and does NOT have a close family relationship with, like a neighbor, a roommate, or a friend (that they have never dated). It is also civil harassment if the abuse is from a family member that is not included in the list under domestic violence..
A person being abused or harassed who meets the criteria above can seek a restraining order to prevent further abuse or harassment. Self-help resources are available atthe California Judicial Council Website at. Alternatively (or additionally) a victim may seek the assistance of an attorney. If a corporation or LLC is seeking the restraining order, it must be represented by an attorney.

Serves 3
(yields 6 to 7 kabobs)
Ingredients:
1 pound extra-firm tofu, pressed and cut into 18 to 21 1-inch cubes
1 pineapple, cut into 1-inch cubes (enough for three pieces for each skewer)
1 large red pepper

Grated zest from l lemon
1 lemon, juiced
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/3 teaspoon dried thyme
1⁄4 cup vegetable broth

Preparation:
In a baking pan, mix marinade ingredients. Place tofu cubes in the pan and coat all side with marinade. Cover and refrigerate several hours or overnight. Cut pepper and onion into 1-inch chunks, and steam vegetables for 1 to 2 minutes until just tender. A microwave works well for steaming. Remove tofu from marinade, and thread 3 tofu chunks onto each skewer, alternating with pineapple chunks and vegetables.
To cook, place skewers on a flat grill sprayed with non-stick cooking oil. Brush lightly with oil and grill over medium heat for about 10 minutes, turning every couple of minutes to brown and cook on all sides. Leave kabobs on bamboo skewers and serve on a plate with cooked Jasmine rice.

The functionality is to add "LIVE CHECKSUM" for InnoDB tables. That means command
"CHECKSUM TABLE t_innodb_table" returns result almost immediately.
More on design:
The feature is turn on by parameter
innodb_
Functionality works with next pre-requirements:
innodb_
checksum is stored in .ibd table header
In case of crash - checksum is getting state "UNKNOWN"
To calculate initial checksum one should execute command
ANALYZE TABLE t_innodb_table
The re-calculation of checksum is done in real-time when we change ( insert, delete, update) rows.
This is done in READ-UNCOMMITED way, so new checksum is available even transaction is not committed.
Information about checksums also will be available in INFORMATION_

Design Team Member Cynthia here with a final project featuring several of the latest Kat Scrappiness goodies. For this card, I have used the gorgeous Lacy Layered Heart Dies, and the I Love You Shadow Dies. Let’s go ahead and start walking through the steps I used to create my project.
My first step was to do some ink blending with a variety of Distress Oxide inks. For the background of the “love” die I used Worn Lipstick fading into Picked Raspberry. For the “you” die I selected Abandoned Coral fading into Candied Apple. There are two tips I can give when it comes to creating a soft fade. One: Use a very smooth card stock. For this I chose Neenah’s Solar White 80-lb card stock. Two: Start at the bottom with your lightest color and blend upwards, letting the ink fade as your sponge runs out of color. Then come in with the darkest color and, starting at the bottom, blend up into the first color. Using less ink in your sponge and repeating application is better than over-saturating your paper, too.
And now comes the ink splattering! If you haven’t tried this technique, I don’t know what you’re doing with your life (haha!) But honestly, this is so much fun to do. I used regular dye Distress Inks in both Worn Lipstick and Candied Apple. I smooshed the ink onto one of my acrylic blocks, spritzed it with a bit of water, then mixed it right into the bristles of a chubby paintbrush. The thirsty fibers will draw up a bunch of color, then you just tap your brush over your paper. I used a piece of Canson watercolor card stock for this because it’s best suited for handling the water and giving you great results. Another key bit of info is to let the first color fully dry before flicking on the second color. If the first layer is still wet, the inks will blend together and it will all look the same in the end. NOTE: You will want to protect your work area from the ink because it WILL splatter all over the place – trust me!
I definitely wanted to use the gorgeous Lacy Layered Heart Die on my card, so I cut it out of a piece of black card stock. I can’t get enough of this die! It cuts out perfectly every single time, and it has the perfect amount of lacy-ness. It’s delicate, but holds up beautifully. I honestly encourage you to get this die set for yourself – you’ll be reaching for it again and again 🙂
Now it’s time to assemble some layers. I used a standard A2 size card base in White, then added a layer of black card stock to act as a mat for my ink-splattered panel. I decided to trim down my heart a bit at the edge, which lets the pretty ink colors get more attention. When adhering a lacy die such as this, I like to dip my fingertip into a paste adhesive and gently rub it across the back of the die. The paste isn’t as wet as a standard liquid adhesive so there’s less squishing, and using your finger helps give you a nice thin layer.
My final step was to paste my ombre-inked words down to their shadow layers, then adhere them to the card using a layer of foam tape. Since the entire card is flat, popping up the words helps them stand out very well. I hope that you had fun with this project, and that you’ll give these techniques a try. Be sure to head on over to Kat Scrappiness and grab these dies for yourself. I’ve included a shopping link below, and don’t forget about the coupon code “CYNTHIA10” that will save you 10% off your entire purchase. Have a wonderful day!

By: Barry_Grey.”
Here Zoellick is referring to the announcement by the US Federal Reserve last week of a second round of “quantitative easing”—the printing of hundreds of billions of dollars to buy US Treasury securities—and the sharp criticisms of this move by major US trade competitors including China, Germany, South Africa and Brazil. The US move is seen correctly as an intensification of a deliberate policy to cheapen the dollar in order to make exports less expensive and foreign imports more expensive.
The Obama administration is focusing its economic attack on China. It wants to line up Europe, Japan, India and other Asian countries at the G20 summit behind its demand that China allow its currency to appreciate more rapidly.
However, its cheap dollar policy is roiling relations with other export-oriented, surplus nations, most notably Germany. In unusually bellicose language, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble denounced the US in an interview this week with Spiegel magazine. Saying the American “growth model” is in “deep crisis,” he added, “The United States lived on borrowed money for too long, inflating its financial sector and neglecting its small and mid-sized industrial companies.”
He went on to declare: “The Fed’s decisions bring more uncertainty to the global economy… It’s inconsistent for the Americans to accuse the Chinese of manipulating exchange rates and then to artificially depress the dollar exchange rate by printing money.”
The US—the world’s biggest debtor nation—is exploiting the privileged position of the dollar as the primary world reserve and trading currency to drive up the exchange rates of its rivals, in essence a trade war measure. It is unleashing a flood of speculative capital into so-called emerging economies in Asia, Latin America and Africa, pushing their currencies even higher and creating the danger of speculative bubbles and inflation.
This aggressive and unilateralist policy on the part of the United States is exacerbating global tensions and destabilizing the world monetary and financial system. It is heightening the likelihood of a breakdown of international relations and the outbreak of the type of uncontrolled currency and trade warfare that characterized the Great Depression and led ultimately to World War II.
In his column, Zoellick urges the G20 to “build a cooperative monetary system that reflects emerging economic conditions.” He continues: “This new system is likely to need to involve the dollar, the euro, the yen, the pound and a [Chinese] renminbi that moves towards internationalization and then an open capital account.”
The new system, he writes, “should also consider employing gold as an international reference point of market expectations about inflation, deflation and future currency values. Although text books may view gold as the old money, markets are using gold as an alternative money asset today.”
This is a tacit acknowledgment that the monetary system that has existed since 1971 and is rooted in the system established at the end of World War II—and which is anchored by the US dollar—is no longer viable. It is furthermore an admission that there is no other national currency that can replace the dollar as the basis of global currency relations.
One expression of eroding confidence in the US dollar—and the monetary system based on the dollar—is the spectacular surge in gold prices. On Monday, gold for December delivery set new records, closing above $1,400 an ounce.
Zoellick argues that the “scope of changes since 1971” justifies the erection of a new monetary system. However, he is silent on the most important of these changes—the vast decline in the global economic position of the United States and the decay of American capitalism.
The United States emerged from the wreckage of World War II as the unchallenged global economic hegemon. Its industry dominated world markets. The US share of world auto production in 1950 was 79 percent. In 1955, it accounted for nearly 40 percent of world steel production. At the same time, the vast bulk of the world supply of gold was in Fort Knox.
The US engineered the postwar recovery of world capitalism, ensuring that the monetary and trade architecture was favorable to its interests. Key to the postwar recovery and expansion was the establishment of a new monetary system, the Bretton Woods system, under which exchange rates were fixed and pegged to the dollar. The dollar served as the world reserve and trading currency, but it was backed by gold at the rate of $35 per ounce.
However, this arrangement contained a fundamental contradiction—the attempt to use a national currency as a world currency. Even the massive economic wealth and power of the United States could not override the basic contradiction between the global economy and the nation-state system of capitalism.
By the late 1960s, the quantity of dollars held overseas far outstripped US gold reserves, and the US was facing growing competition from resurgent Germany and Japan. The Bretton Woods system collapsed in August of 1971 when the Nixon administration, facing a run on the dollar, removed the gold backing from the US currency.
That ushered in so-called Bretton Woods II, a system of floating exchange rates tied to the dollar—an arrangement that was even more dependent on international confidence in the strength of American capitalism. That confidence has progressively eroded as the US has built up ever-greater debts and its industrial base has withered, leaving its economy increasingly dependent on financial speculation.
The financial crash of September 2008, which was centered on Wall Street, has fatally undermined confidence in the dollar. The fact that the financial crisis takes the form of a currency war and breakdown in the system of exchange rates—what had been the pillar of the postwar recovery of world capitalism—underscores the fact that the current crisis is not merely a conjunctural downturn, but rather a systemic breakdown of the system.
Zoellick’s proposal for a return to some form of gold standard is both utopian and reactionary. There is no possibility that the dramatic shift in economic weight between the older imperialist powers—first and foremost, the US—and emerging economies such as China and India can peacefully produce a new international economic equilibrium based on a reduced role for the US dollar. As in the twentieth century, so in the twenty first, the declining powers will not willingly accept a lesser position and the struggle for control of markets, raw materials and sources of cheap labor inevitably leads toward world war.
Were the proposal for a new gold standard to be carried out, moreover, it would result in a catastrophic contraction of credit, plunging the world into a depression exceeding that of the 1930s.
The breakdown of the currency system is an expression of an insoluble crisis of the capitalist system that can be resolved in a progressive manner only through the international revolutionary movement of the working class and the establishment of world socialism..Hello, James here: I don't have access to Builderall affiliates statistics anymore.

We have been teaching Transcendental Meditation (TM) in Great Britain for nearly sixty years. Founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, TM is a simple, natural procedure practised for 15 to 20 minutes in the morning and evening, while sitting comfortably with eyes closed. It can be learned easily by anyone.
During TM one’s awareness settles down to experience a state of restful alertness. As the mind transcends mental activity to experience the simplest form of human awareness – Transcendental Consciousness – one’s body becomes deeply relaxed.
Scientific research has shown that regular practice brings a wide range of benefits including decreased anxiety and depression, improved memory and clearer thinking, reduced high blood pressure, decreased illness and more harmonious relationships.
The UK has over 120 certified Teachers of Transcendental Meditation. We are passionate about making TM widely available – most especially in these days of rising anxiety, an affliction which is addressed so effectively by TM.
Maharishi Foundation Appeal for Financial Support
Event dates: Saturday 20th November – Monday 31st January 2022
We were very grateful for the kind generosity of Meditators, Sidhas and TM Teachers in November last year, when we asked for donations to help see Maharishi Foundation through until TM teaching returned to pre-pandemic levels. Together with Government furlough grants, donations received for specific projects, and economies in costs, your generosity has enabled the charity to continue its work. But now, faced with Covid-constrained teaching numbers 40% below normal times, there is still great pressure on our finances, forcing us to appeal once again for your kind support. We estimate Maharishi Foundation needs another £30,000 if it is to reach the end of 2021 in the black and continue to operate effectively.
Despite the ups and downs of Covid in 2021, TM Teachers across the country continue to teach Transcendental Meditation (following all necessary safety protocols). Many hundreds more people have been able to learn. Funds have been raised to support TM scholarships for people in need and for students. TM courses have been run for workers in the emergency services, and for NHS staff.
'Maharishi Foundation continues to advertise Transcendental Meditation nationwide. Work is underway to upgrade the TM website. Live interactive courses via the Maharishi.Online platform have proved a great success; so far Dr Peter Warburton has run sixteen such courses, and Dr Bevan Morris four, each attracting between 150 and 300 participants. Most of our top Teachers have trained in the use of a smartphone App which further extends the depth of support and beautiful knowledge available to those who learn TM.
We are passionate about making TM widely available across the UK – most especially today. For example, you will have read in the press about the UK's rise in anxiety, which is addressed directly by TM. Maharishi’s knowledge is in greater need than ever, and we appeal to your generosity to help via this Appeal. Please support with a hearty donation towards our £30,000 target, so we can join in making this precious knowledge more widely available.

One of the most crucial tasks was to develop a data quality control system for the automatic verification of product information. Our experts designed a module that revealed any inaccuracies made by the operator.
We also developed a program with Excel spreadsheet features within the browser. We implemented the feature that allowed data to be extracted, copied, and replaced in one click which significantly speeded up the workflow.
Our developers configured a treelike structure of products in the system for optimizing the search process. The dev team also synchronized the application with both the client’s online store and system for creating/printing catalogs.
To ensure security, our team took the following measures:
- built a channel for secure data transfer;
- implemented a system of access rights separation;
- used HTTPS protocols and encryption at all stages of interaction with the program.
Our team followed the Waterfall development model, which was the most suitable for the project in terms of a well-defined budget and strict requirements.
We provided the customer with access to the corporate project management system. Project managers from both sides organized regular meetings to discuss all current issues related to the development of the service.Functionalism Case type that served each function (plus some examples) is:
-Adaptation: organizations oriented to economic production – business firms.
-Goal attainment – organizations oriented to political goals – government agencies, banks.
-Integration – integrative organizations – courts, political parties, social control agencies.
-Latency – pattern maintenance organizations – museums, educational organizations, and religious organizations.
What is a goal for a specific organization is a function for the larger society. An organization may expect to get resources and approval based on the importance of its function in society. This goal/function system can also be reproduced at the formal organizational level through examination of subunits. While he didn’t insist that specific subunits will be created, he does imply they will form based on these four divisions because the various functional needs is somewhat in conflict.
Looking at Parson’s action systems and their basic assumptions we can see the functionalists concern with order. The actions systems are cultural, societal, behavioral, and personality. Parsons posits several assumptions about these systems. The first assumption says that systems have order and interdependent parts. The second one states that systems lean toward self-maintaining order or equilibrium. The third assumption claims that the system may be static or involved in an ordered process of change. The fourth assumption sees the nature of one part of the system as having an impact on the form that the other parts can take. The next of Parson’s assumptions says that systems maintain boundaries with their environments. Parson’s sixth assumption about systems says that allocation and integration are necessary for a given state of equilibrium of a system. This assumption show how view change as a slow process. The last of his assumptions views systems as tending toward self-maintenance involving the maintenance of boundaries and of the relationship of the parts to the whole, control of environmental, variations, and control of tendencies to change the system from within. These assumptions also illustrate the functionalist view of shared norms and values being fundamental to society.
One criticism of Parsons pertains to his personality system. It is said that he does not give the personality enough characteristics and mechanisms for it to be able to function. Supposedly when Parsons is speaking about the personality system he seems to actually be focusing on social systems. This is illustrated in the ways the he links personality to the social system.
Functionalism has been criticized for being politically conservative and unable to deal with social change because of its focus on static structures. They are also incapable of dealing with social conflict. Another major criticism of structural functionalism is that it does not adequately deal with history. It is ahistorical. They also see individuals as passive actors, which leads them to a too conservative view of society. They see social and cultural forces as constraining actors.
Teleology and tautology are methodological or logical criticisms of functionalism. A tautological explanation either explains a process by the end-state towards which it is directed, or explains the existence of something by the function it fulfills. Tautology is the use of words to repeat the same statement or meaning. Early functionalists were prone to argue that, because certain social practices existed then they must have a social function – and that one could assume they had that function precisely because the practices themselves existed.
In neofunctionalism, Jeffery Alexander makes an effort to draw upon the best part of functionalism while making it a more fluid theory that would permit a more liberal or radical view. He tries to do this by creating a system with interconnected parts that has a more open nature that could be reinterpreted. They might be connected in various ways for various reasons.
Alexander also tries to address order and action equalities. He says that action can be rational and be either aimed at functions within the system or simply expressing nature. He also views Parsons’ systems in a much different way. He sees the dimensions of personality, culture, and the social system through the lens of conflict and change instead of through a constant state of harmony. He notes that adaptation through differentiation can often occur because of strain or conflict. He also sees integration of the parts of a system and equilibrium as possibilities, not a given.
In my opinion, Alexander only partially solves the problems faced by functionalism. His view on the interconnectedness of the parts of a system opens up the possibility for change, but does not allow for major social changes. In addressing order and action equality, Alexander does not adequately explain how action can function within the system. While still able to be expressive in nature when dealing with the problem of conflict, he should consider the various systems both through conflict, change, and order. I believe this to be the only way to get a true picture of the various systems. Alexander makes a few strides in his attempt to evolve functionalism, but the core structural problems are still there.“Every September, I feel refreshed and inspired, ready to spend a little more time in the kitchen.“ – Abigail Thorpe
It’s as though Abigail Thorpe’s default setting is to cultivate.
“I’m always creating something,” she says. “Cooking and growing food are two of the things that make me the happiest.”
Some would call her childhood—growing up on Thorpe’s Organic Family Farm outside East Aurora—a bit unconventional. Owned by her family and still a working farm today, it’s complete with crop shares, uPick options, a bakery and a farm store. She was in charge of the bakery for six years and still acts as general manager.
Now 31, Abigail says her late 20s represented more of a branching off from a childhood spent on the farm.
Home these days is an old farmhouse in Alden, which features more than 100 acres out back farmed by (who else?) her family. The crown jewel in Abigail’s eye: A large garden.
“90% of what I’m cooking, three meals a day, comes from my garden,” she says.
A brewmaster in her own right, Abigail sources medicinal herbs from her garden as well, using them to concoct herbal potions and natural skincare products for her brand, Abskeefe.
“As a kid, I was always making little potions with weeds,” she remembers. “Nothing with efficacy, of course.”
Abigail’s products, which include immune support elixirs, body oils, serums, soaps and salves— all sourced from the Earth—are available in her online shop, abskeefe.com, as well as at her family’s farm store.
“It sounds a little precious, but it’s mostly about connecting to the land,” she says. “You don’t always save money with a garden—all that time spent growing something, and then it can be wiped out by a bug, or it’s just not a productive plant.”
Had she worked a desk job or lived a slightly more urban lifestyle, Abigail says she might question all of it: “the time and effort put into growing something.” But instead, there’s an appreciation for the process as much as the product.
“Once you start growing things, it just gets inside you,” she says.
As an avid gardener and home chef, she seeks nutrition from the food she’s eating. Then again, as an herbalist and small business owner, Abigail knows herbs can be a helpful supplement.
“When you’re trying to get nutrition from your food, there are gaps,” she says. “Herbs can fill those gaps in your diet.”
Right now, Abskeefe is all Abigail.
“In the summer, it’s a lot of outdoor labor,” she says. “I’ll spend four to five hours of the day planting, weeding, harvesting, drying, infusing herbs into oils.”
Abigail Thorpe tends daily to her large garden—which is not only where she harvests most of the food eats, but also the medicinal herbs she brews for her Abskeefe herbal potions.
But in the fall months, she relishes the sense of change.
“Every September, I feel refreshed and inspired, ready to spend a little more time in the kitchen,” she says.
All year long, Abigail looks forward to the bounty of the fall months in Western New York.
“From a cooking perspective, it’s just a dream,” she says. “In these fall months, you’re still getting summer vegetables, and early fall as well.”
As for her favorite part of the season?
“Oh god, everything.”
Roasted chicken thighs with winter squash, potatoes and cilantro coconut chutney
This dinner favorite of Abigail Thorpe's, which starts in the skillet and finishes on a sheet pan, simply showcases fresh-from-the-garden ingredients like winter squash, potatoes and cilantro.
Ingredients
- 1½ lbs. bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 6 thighs, depending on size)
- 1½ lbs. potatoes (golf-ball sized or cut into wedges)
- 1 medium winter squash, such as honeynut, cut into 1/4 inch slices (leave the skin on for the simplest preparation)
- 1 large red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 head garlic, cloves separated with skin on
- 4 tbsp. olive oil
- 1 tsp. ground cumin
- 1 tsp. Aleppo pepper (or crushed red chili flake if you’d like more heat)
- Juice of one lemon
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
Preparation | Preheat oven to 425 F. In a large, 12-inch cast iron skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat until oil is hot but not smoking. Place chicken thighs in skillet, skin side down, then season liberally with salt and pepper. Cook thighs undisturbed for 3-5 minutes to allow the skin to take on some color.
While the chicken sears, place a half sheet pan (18-by-13-inches) near the skillet. After a few minutes of searing, use tongs or a thin spatula to carefully transfer the chicken from the skillet to the sheet pan, flipping the chicken to be skin side up this time—you want the heat from the oven to continue crisping the skin. If any skin tears when you’re transferring the chicken, just pull it back over the chicken thigh.
In the skillet you seared the chicken in, add the sliced onion, skin-on garlic cloves, cumin and potatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir so everything is coated in the rendered chicken fat and olive oil and cook over medium-high heat for 3-5 minutes, until the onions turn translucent and start taking on some color. Remove vegetables from skillet, scattering around the chicken thighs on the sheet pan.
Add the sliced squash to the sheet pan, nestling it in among the chicken and potatoes so some pieces lay flat on the sheet pan (these pieces will become caramelized and super sweet). Drizzle remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil over squash, and season squash with salt. Sprinkle everything with Aleppo pepper, or chili flakes if desired.
Bake for 35-45 minutes, until vegetables are tender and beginning to caramelize, and the chicken juices run clear when cut into at the thickest point near the bone.
Serve with cilantro coconut chutney, and good sourdough or flatbread if you have it.
For the Chutney
Ingredients
- 1 bunch fresh cilantro, stems included
- 1 garlic clove, peeled
- 1 thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated
- 1 jalapeno, seeds and white inner membrane removed
- Juice and zest of 1 lime (a lemon is a fine substitute)
- 2 tbsp. coconut cream, skimmed from the top of a can of full fat, unsweetened coconut cream
- 1 tsp. sugar
- Salt to taste
Preparation | Place all ingredients in a food processor or blender and pulse until everything is combined. Add a couple tablespoons of water, blending briefly again to combine. Taste for salt and adjust seasoning as needed, adding more water 1 tablespoon at a time if needed until desired consistency is reached.
“I like this chutney as a spoonable consistency—not too runny, but not as thick as porridge,” Abigail says.Today for you to be relevant in the social media space you must have great content every day to give to your audience or followers, either you are into text content or video content creation.

On today’s episode of The Good Dirt, we’re speaking with Liz Riffle of Riffle Farm in Preston County, WV, which is a small bison farm raising grass-fed and finished animals. Owner and Operator Liz is a U.S Navy Nurse Corps veteran and her husband, Jimmie, is currently still serving on active-duty as a Navy Nurse Corps Nurse Practitioner. Jimmie was born and raised in Grafton, WV. In their own words, Jimmie and Liz are homegrown and proud to now serve this great nation by feeding it!
After near extinction in the 1880s bison have made a comeback, and are now thriving on small operations such as Riffle Farm. Liz says she and her husband discovered bison burgers while traveling in Wyoming, and became interested in the idea of raising them. They eventually found a 64-acre spot where they could let bison roam and graze, and opened for business in 2017. Fast forward to today, and they’ve almost doubled their operation. Liz shares with us their journey from those beginnings until now, during which she’s learned much about regenerative agriculture, working with nature, slowing down and listening to the land.
Liz believes that she has a responsibility to honorably raise as well as humanely harvest the bison on her farm. The regulatory system is set up for large-scale meat producers and sometimes makes it difficult for small scale farmers to accomplish their sustainability goals. Liz has started a new business, The Honest Carnivore, as a means of teaching other small farmers how to navigate that system, empowering them to continue providing sustainable meat solutions.
Join us on this week’s episode to learn more about building trust and transparency in the food chain with bison farmer Liz Riffle.
Listen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Podchaser, Simplecast, Podtail, or on your favorite podcast platform.
Topics Covered:
- Daily life of a bison farmer
- How bison grazing patterns help the local flora and fauna
- Farming regulations and how they can work against small farmers
- Certification processes and marketing strategies of large food corporations
- Keeping it simple when it comes to buying food

Hook
When writing verse – it fills long hours –
I like a hook to hang it on;
it may be conversation heard,
or observation of the herd,
a picture with its questions posed,
or challenge, teaser, crossword clues.
The theme established, pleasure flows,
in exploration, phrases, words,
and finding where the rainbow ends,
most times, to me, a pot of gold,
so even when poorly expressed,
I’ve learnt of others, more myself.
I’m sad that, wrestling, only some
can understand my eroteme;
but then that pathway’s mine alone,
while readers’ road, another turn,
so common ground will be reduced,
without appeal or ring of bells.
My metric from my breathing, lungs,
the beat of heart which chimes with soul,
its rhyming blank, no forced pretence.
If further, find concerns addressed,
and join me, interrogatives,
what more could would-be poet ask?
###
Quick Win, Slow Lose
Tree felling today – toil, flume, soil,
fresh dawn eroded, tap roots sluiced,
bound harvest leaves clean washed away,
in timber chips, chute, mound found lost,
gush sediment sunk river bed,
the delta claiming mountain head.
With winter’s ways the seed preserved,
straight drill or furrow ploughed for home
land loam loaned as its growing ground,
but currency of quick return,
reaps unintended consequence;
if a trained fool will tell you, sound,
myopic sight still turns eyes green,
creation’s green blind-sided, greed.
###
For everything, a season
The soil receives its autumn dead,
for re-birth in the spring ahead;
until we till and turn the ground
intensively, and grain rebounds.
We store in barns, where mounds surround,
some millstone, ground, knead, feed our needs,
but leave the hungry round the globe,
to fill our stores with cupboard love.
Then turn that land once more around,
to bury tarnished treasure there.
The cycle, seasons, we endorse,
the buried seed, with unearthed greed,
though fruit now processed, plastic wrapped,
that human mark, blot, intercede,
our stewardship, what God provides.
###
Dylan
A poem for the music man
or music for the poem slam,
an interchange of scoring charts,
where beat and rhythm takes them both;
the Nobel shock to classicists,
that guitar, mic and tousled hair,
acoustic to electric strings,
could contribute, to those who hear,
a mastery of literature.
So what’s the box you put him in –
for some The Magic Roundabout,
with hippie rabbit, stylised,
for Zimmerman, new living room;
son of the sea, born ocean waves,
where thrash of rock dredged deeper folk,
back onto Highway 61,
all changing like a rolling stone,
next year’s octogenarian?
###
Semaphore
Dad speaks of war and Vera Lynn,
as does her majesty, the Queen,
knows oil, mechanics, truck engines;
his prison cell, square metric space –
though he measures imperial,
is lockdown shield, vulnerable.
The landline wire, invading space –
as minefields crossed on D-Day beach –
brings voices to his muddled head;
his rations set outside the door,
a smiling wave, like semaphore,
retreats down-wind, escaping air.
He scans his album, photo leaves –
no change to Facebook, Instagram –
new lamps for old, of no appeal;
ironical that more have called
beyond the birds on terrace struts.
Tweets alone brought company.
He wonders that claimed crisis draws,
new guidance – now instruction termed –
improves his daily living norms;
but when the plague has been seen off,
will loneliness return to stare –
or will the neighbours yet appear?
###
Love in the Time of Corona
Both our houses plague-locked down,
rings of roses blooming soon,
tissues captured, sneezes thrown;
eyes of wights too close at hand –
will it soon mean we fall down?
Love is stretched, a metre plus,
party line agreed by both;
skin masks now become our front,
bubble wrap scarf, calmer throats,
fear in the wind as sailing by.
Cataclysmic, silent fiend,
rescind rape, pillage image;
water, earth, air, fire descend;
winding sheets may play their part
in shaking palms, laughing friends.
Global bell takes toll with us –
hear it ringing in our ears,
campanile towers too close;
wedding peels now funeral biers,
isolated, own, alone.
Very nice poetry. Engaging, smart, filled with many unique insights about life, our times, your visions. Thanks for sharing them. They inspire me to find my own path just as you found yours. Je
Thank you.

GlóRí is a speech analysis interface which offers a exibility and multiplicity of approaches to voice analysis. The system allows for fully automatic processing, for instance for analysis of large corpora. However, for more ne-grained studies, which may require precise voice source measurements, the systems facilitates manual optimisation of parameter settings. The present paper highlights the main features of the Gl ́oR ́ı system and provides illustrations of the usefulness of this approach.

- Pages: 4
- Word count: 846
- Category: Fiction Novel Stephen King mother of the virgin Misery. She prevents Paul from letting Misery Chastain die in child-birth in his new novel. She must live and a new novel must be born. Annie nurtures Misery’s return as well. Nothing will interfere with Misery’s safety or the birth of the book she is nurturing. There are no doubts as to the significance of Annie’s maternal image in the novel.
Behind Annie’s destructiveness lies a so-called goddess figure–a goddess in charge of Paul’s, as well as Misery’s, destiny. Paul is constantly at the mercy of Annie. He makes it through the days, but only in a complete fear of being murdered by Annie. This illustrates Annie’s powerful grip over Paul, and she will hunt him down if he tries to escape. Annie is also a protective goddess of Misery Chastain. By saving Paul’s life, she ultimately saves the life of Misery. Annie knows that upon completion of Misery’s return, she and Sheldon must die. Therefore, bringing about Misery’s return is her main objective. In order to eliminate any distractions, Annie fashions a self-enclosed world within the confines of her home. She is a kind of like a psychic vampire; she sucks out Paul’s inspiration and creativity in order to fashion a self-enclosed world. As the goddess of this imaginary world, Annie must limit Paul’s physical and mental, recuperation so that her authority is not challenged. She destroys his independent life, and plunges him back into ancient darkness. To put it shortly, Annie’s dark goddess figure helps her retain control in her self-enclosed world.
Annie is a continuous reader of the fictional novels. Her obsession with Sheldon’s romance novels reflects the demands of an eager audience. Sheldon’s writing is her reading addiction. Linked with the pain-killing drugs, she alternately offers and withholds from him. Annie, therefore, is a direct result of Paul’s success in attracting and addicting readers. In fact, Annie comes to embody all that the heroine Misery suggests. Annie must also be recognized as the disapproving remarks of academic critic. She prominently dictates the course of Sheldon’s newest book. Anything less than perfect receives harsh criticism at the least. Sheldon receives direct feedback from his ‘readers’ and is therefore able to produce his best Misery novel, ever. Annie’s destructiveness takes ‘constructive criticism’ to a whole new meaning. In the long run, Sheldon needs the terrible Annie more than he ever thought possible. It’s strange to think that King made Annie’s character a replica of his religious followers. Is this really how he sees all his fans? They can’t all be as psychotic as she was.
Misery is about the powerful hold fiction can achieve over the reader, as personified in Annie Wilkes. Annie comes to embody a mother, goddess like figure and the audience image in the novel. At whatever the price, Annie’s creative force will live on. Her death will never be a reality, any more than Misery Chastain’s death is a reality. She would never be able to understand that her mind doesn’t work like ours. She is unable to decipher the differences and similarities of an imaginary tale and real life. Clearly, Annie has a psychotic personality with slight traits of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. She is definitely one I would stay far away from.Title: Regional Business Directory – Los Angeles County Author: Mergent (Corporate Author).

During the years you served in the Waterdeep guard, you were devoted to many things–to the worship of Helm, to the glory of Waterdeep, to the protection of its people, and to the care of the orphans at Helm’s Hall. But there was one thing you were devoted to most of all …
Her name was Allura Fairweather.
Like you, the half-elf was raised as an orphan in Helm’s Hall, and in your youth the two of you often played together. Like you, Allura became a lamplighter, and you spent many evenings together exploring the city’s winding streets, pretending to be wealthy nobles, dastardly pirates, or brave adventurers. As you both grew, your friendship deepened into something more, and your nights were spent in quiet inns and secluded streets, the world falling away as you retreated into each other’s company. Though you loved the work of your twilight hours, you lived for the night, and welcomed its dark embrace.
But Allura was never entirely yours. Ever since you’d known her, Allura had been consumed by a deep grief over the loss of her younger sister, whom she had tried, and failed, to defend from the same brigands who killed their parents. The brigands had kept Allura alive for “sport,” but ran into a Waterdeep patrol before they got her back to their camp. The rescue was small comfort to Allura, who for years afterwards would sometimes cry for hours at the memory of her sister’s body lying lifeless on the side of the road.
Then, one night, Allura failed to show up at your usual trysting spot. You waited for hours, but eventually went home to bed, alternately worried and vexed. She didn’t show up the next night, either. Finally, on the third night, Allura was back, but there was something different about her. She was cool, reserved. She seemed less sad, but also somehow less happy. She apologized for her absence, and reassured you she was well. Better than that, actually–she said she had finally found something to take her pain away. Was it a spell, you asked? A drug? She wouldn’t say. Your temper flared. Had she found a new lover? She bristled at your accusation. “You wouldn’t understand,” she spat, and left. For the first time in a long time, the night felt cold.
After that, you threw yourself into your work, trying to push the argument, push Allura, from your mind. Then, one evening while on patrol, you heard shouts and the sounds of fighting. Rushing down an alleyway, you saw a flash of light, and in the afterglow the fleeing silhouettes of several robed figures. Before you stood the sisters of Selune, and High Priestess Naneatha stood with them, the moon’s radiance fading from her outstretched hand.
“Guard!” she cried. “We require your assistance. We have discovered a cult of Shar operating illegally within the city. Help us bring them to justice!”
With no time to call for your squad, you charged ahead into the alleyway with the sisters of Selune at your back. Ahead you could hear the cultists scattering. Catching a glimpse of two of them, you pursued them around a corner into a dead-end. The robed figures, trapped, turned to face you. From behind you, High Priestess Naneatha stepped out around the corner, her hand a cold blaze of radiance. The light fell upon the hooded figures’ faces, and there …. was Allura.
In your shock, you didn’t even feel the sword slip from your grasp–the sound of it striking the cobblestones seemed to come from a distant dream. For a moment, the world fell away, and it was once again just the two of you, alone in the night. Once more, Allura’s face was full of sadness, but this time, you knew, she was grieving a different loss. Suddenly, her companion lashed out, and your face stung with the bite of his blade. The spell was broken, there was a rush of smoke, and when it cleared, Allura was gone.
For months afterwards you scoured the city for any sign of the cult of Shar. Many times you found pockets of cultists, but Allura was never amongst them. Your zeal attracted the notice of your superiors–you were lauded for your determination, for your unwavering conviction, for your service to the city. You were even promoted. It meant nothing to you. The only thing you had ever loved in this life had been taken by the night.
Eventually you found solace in the teachings of a priest of twilight who came to Helm’s service. You even hung up your cloak and took orders as a faithful of the church. But you never stopped searching for Allura. From time to time, some rumor or piece of information would find its way to you. There are four things you now know for certain:
- You know she is no longer in Waterdeep.
- You know she has grown more active, and more radical, in her support for the dispossessed.
- You know she has changed her name to Allura Nighthawk.
- You know you still love her.
What you don’t know is what you’ll do if you ever find her again …About 200 personnel – which include workers in the actual air traffic control centre, as well as those working on the airport tarmac – will take part in the stoppage beginning at 3 pm and lasting until 10 pm, according to the GdF trade union.
“We assume that air traffic will be massively affected,” said Markus Siebers, a GdF spokesman, saying that airport operator Fraport had missed a noon deadline to resolve the union’s complaints.
The heart of the labour dispute: money and working hours. GdF has said workers in Frankfurt are underpaid and overworked compared to air traffic controllers at other German airports.
They’ve been involved in a long-running labour dispute with Fraport that’s dovetailed with complaints among controllers at airports around the country. Last year, the nation’s air traffic control union called for a general strike, which was only averted at the last moment.
At negotiations over higher wages have brought little movement and Fraport has rejected settlement offers brokered by outside mediators.
Fraport denounced the action as “irresponsible” and “incomprehensible”, but pledged to limit disruption as much as possible.
“If someone refuses to budge an inch on double-digit demands that include increases of between 50-70 percent in wages, working hours and bonuses, they’re acting irresponsibly,” said Fraport board member and industrial relations director Herbert Mai.
Fraport said it had already drawn up contingency measures “to keep operations up and running as far as possible. But delays and cancellations cannot be ruled out.”

Download PDF
Filed Washington State Court of Appeals Division Two October 27, 2020 IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON DIVISION II STATE OF WASHINGTON, No. 53133-0-II Respondent, v. ANJELA HASSERIES, UNPUBLISHED OPINION Appellant. WORSWICK, J. — During an altercation with her husband, Anjela Hasseries stabbed him in the arm twice with a 26-inch-long Lord of the Rings replica sword. Hasseries appeals her conviction and sentence for one count of second degree assault—domestic violence, with deadly weapon enhancements. She argues that the State provided insufficient evidence that she intentionally assaulted her husband and insufficient evidence that she did not act in self-defense. She also argues that she received ineffective assistance of counsel because her trial counsel did not object to language in the first aggressor instruction permitting the jury to base a first aggressor finding on her words alone. Finally, Hasseries argues that the trial court erred by imposing community custody conditions that were not crime-related. We disagree and affirm her conviction and sentence. No. 53133-0-II FACTS Following an altercation between Hasseries and her husband, Patrick1, the State charged Hasseries with one count of second degree assault with domestic violence and deadly weapon special allegations. At trial, Hasseries and Patrick testified to different versions of the incident. Patrick recalled learning that Hasseries was having an affair with a close friend in July 2018. She briefly moved out of their home and in with her boyfriend. About a week later, Patrick convinced Hasseries to move back into their home to try and salvage their marriage. A few days after moving back into their home, Hasseries was smoking marijuana and watching videos on her phone on their back porch. Patrick convinced Hasseries to come inside so they could watch videos together. According to Patrick, when he learned that Hasseries was still seeing her boyfriend, the two began arguing. Hasseries told Patrick she would not stop seeing her boyfriend, but would remain living in her and Patrick’s house because her name was on the deed. Hasseries then went to the second floor of their home to retrieve the deed to the house, but Patrick told her he had hidden the safety deposit box from her. Hasseries screamed with rage and threw a box of objects across the room, not in Patrick’s direction. Hasseries continued to rage, throwing laundry buckets against the wall. 1 Because Anjela Hasseries and Patrick Hasseries share a last name, we refer to Patrick by his first name. We intend no disrespect. 2 No. 53133-0-II Hasseries then began slapping, punching, and attempting to kick Patrick. Patrick did not attack Hasseries at any point. When Hasseries tried to kick Patrick, he caught her foot with his left hand and pushed her forward away from him with his right hand. Hasseries bounced off the bed and landed on her back on the floor. Hasseries resumed attacking Patrick, and Patrick once again caught her foot and pushed her away from him and onto the ground. After Patrick pushed her a second time, Hasseries ran down the stairs. Patrick remained upstairs for about 30 seconds, believing that Hasseries had left the home. Patrick went down the stairs and walked to look out a window. While he was standing at the window, Hasseries approached him from behind with a Lord of the Rings replica sword in her hands. Hasseries stood in an “attack-ready stance” with both hands on the hilt. Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Feb. 27, 2019) at 172. Hasseries continued to move closer to Patrick, in an offensive stance,2 until he was cornered. Patrick moved into a defensive stance. Hasseries moved closer to Patrick, and the blade of the sword entered his right arm. Patrick grabbed the sword with his left hand to try and disarm Hasseries. During the struggle, Patrick incurred some minor cuts on his palms and sustained another slice in his arm. At some point, the sword left Hasseries’s hands, and Patrick began focusing on his wounds. Patrick called 911 and attempted to put pressure on his wounds, which were bleeding profusely. While Patrick was on the phone, Hasseries attempted to mop the blood off the floor in the kitchen. 2 Patrick testified that both he and Hasseries had taken fencing lessons where they learned that in an offensive stance, a person turns their body sideways to minimize their body profile and keeps their legs at an angle to easily retreat or lunge in. 3 No. 53133-0-II Patrick was ultimately flown in a helicopter to Harborview Medical Center for surgery on his arm. Hasseries’s testimony about the incident was consistent with Patrick’s up until their argument about whether she would stop seeing her boyfriend. She recalled Patrick telling her to get out of the house and her insisting she would not because she owned their home too. According to Hasseries, while she was squatting down and looking for the safety deposit box containing the deed to the house, Patrick put his hand on Hasseries’s head and threw her to the ground. Hasseries believed she suffered a concussion as a result. She recalled lying on the ground with her head spinning as Patrick screamed at her to get out of his room. Hasseries got up and continued to look for the safety deposit box when Patrick started hitting and kicking her and threw her to the ground a second time. Hasseries quickly moved down the stairs. She heard Patrick running down the stairs behind her. Patrick had a “god awful look on his face” and was “bee lining” towards Hasseries. VRP (Feb. 28, 2019) at 279. Hasseries feared that Patrick would hurt her again, so she grabbed the closest thing to her to create some space between the two of them—the 26-inch-long Lord of the Rings replica sword. Within seconds, Patrick was grabbing the end of the sword and trying to rip it from her hands. The two engaged in a tug-of-war over the sword, eventually winding up in the kitchen. Suddenly, Patrick said “ow” and released the sword. VRP (Feb. 28, 2019) at 281. Patrick went into the bathroom, and Hasseries put the sword back on the mantle. 4 No. 53133-0-II While Patrick was on the phone with 911, Hasseries began cleaning up the blood in the kitchen so their son would not see it when he woke up. Hasseries went to her bedroom to change out of her pajamas. Law enforcement arrived at the house and arrested her. The trial court instructed the jury on self-defense. The trial court also issued a pattern “first aggressor” instruction to the jury: No person may, by any intentional act reasonably likely to provoke a belligerent response, create a necessity for acting in self-defense and thereupon use or attempt to use force upon or toward another person. Therefore, if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the aggressor, and that defendant’s acts and conduct provoked or commenced the fight, then self-defense is not available as a defense. Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 60; See 11 WASHINGTON PATTERN JURY INSTRUCTIONS: CRIMINAL 16.04, at 173-74 (2016). Hasseries’s trial counsel stated he did not believe he had any authority to object to the first aggressor instruction and believed the instruction to be appropriate. In closing argument, the State focused on Hasseries’s and Patrick’s credibility. As to the first aggressor instruction, the State argued that under either Hasseries’s or Patrick’s version of events, Hasseries’s actions provoked an alleged need for self-defense. The jury found Hasseries guilty of second degree assault with domestic violence and deadly weapon special verdicts. Patrick filed a victim impact statement with the trial court for sentencing. In his statement, Patrick expressed concerns about Hasseries’s mental health and substance abuse. He recalled Hasseries’s struggles with bipolar disorder, suicidal ideation, and self-harm. At sentencing, the trial court remarked: The fact pattern was an unusual one. And in some ways tending towards a little bit on the bizarre in the sense that the reaction that Ms. Hasseries had to the situation was grossly disproportionate to what was occurring at the time . . . . 5 No. 53133-0-II For that reason, I have some concerns about mental health as well as whether or not there was some drug issues. I know that there was some use of marijuana that maybe preceded— —this incident. And I’m not sure how much that might have played a part into what happened. I think there was also some reference in the victim impact statement to some drug use, I believe. And I’m not sure what is going on. There’s also references to mental health issues in the victim impact statement that is somewhat consistent with the fact pattern that the court observed. VRP (March 22, 2019) at 11. The trial court stated “I think the larger issue in this case is somewhere in line with mental health issues and/or drug issues.” VRP (March 22, 2019) at 12. The trial court imposed drug and alcohol related community custody conditions as part of Hasseries’s sentence and ordered Hasseries to complete substance use disorder and mental health evaluations. Hasseries appeals her judgment and sentence. ANALYSIS I. INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE Hasseries argues that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she committed second degree assault because there was insufficient evidence to prove intent and there was insufficient evidence to prove the absence of self-defense. We disagree. Due process requires that the State prove every element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Johnson, 188 Wn.2d 742, 750, 399 P.3d 507 (2017). In order to convict Hasseries of second degree assault, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she intentionally assaulted Patrick thereby recklessly inflicting substantial bodily harm. RCW 9A.36.021(1)(a). The State also had the burden of proving the absence of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Kyllo, 166 Wn.2d 856, 862, 215 P.3d 177 (2009). 6 No. 53133-0-II Evidence is sufficient to support a guilty verdict if any rational trier of fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, could find the elements of the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Longshore, 141 Wn.2d 414, 420-21, 5 P.3d 1256 (2000). “In claiming insufficient evidence, the defendant necessarily admits the truth of the State’s evidence and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from it.” State v. Homan, 181 Wn.2d 102, 106, 330 P.3d 182 (2014). Such inferences must be drawn in favor of the State and interpreted most strongly against the defendant. State v. Kintz, 169 Wn.2d 537, 551, 238 P.3d 470 (2010). “We defer to the jury ‘on issues of conflicting testimony, credibility of witnesses, and the persuasiveness of the evidence.’” State v. Andy, 182 Wn.2d 294, 303, 340 P.3d 840 (2014) (quoting State v. Thomas, 150 Wn.2d 821, 874-75, 83 P.3d 970 (2004)). We may infer specific criminal intent from conduct that plainly indicates such intent as a matter of logical probability. State v. Goodman, 150 Wn.2d 774, 781, 83 P.3d 410 (2004). Circumstantial evidence is not any less reliable or probative than direct evidence in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a jury verdict. Kintz, 169 Wn.2d at 551. A. Intent Hasseries argues that the State failed to present sufficient evidence that she intentionally assaulted Patrick. We disagree. Hasseries argues that the evidence only showed accidental contact during a struggle over the sword after she armed herself in self-defense. But the jury rejected her version of events, and we defer to the jury on issues of conflicting testimony, credibility of witnesses, and the persuasiveness of the evidence. Andy, 182 Wn.2d at 303. And on a claim of insufficient 7 No. 53133-0-II evidence, the defendant admits the truth of the State’s evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom. Homan, 181 Wn.2d at 106. Viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence showed that Hasseries intentionally assaulted Patrick. Patrick testified that after Hasseries repeatedly hit and kicked him upstairs, Hasseries armed herself with a 26-inch sword. Hasseries cornered Patrick with the sword in an “attack-ready stance.” VRP (February 27, 2019) at 172. She then sliced Patrick’s arm with the sword before he attempted to disarm her. This evidence indicates criminal intent as a matter of logical probability. Goodman, 150 Wn.2d at 781. Based on this evidence, a rational trier of fact could have found that Hasseries intentionally assaulted Patrick beyond a reasonable doubt. B. Self-Defense Hasseries also argues that the State failed to present sufficient evidence to establish the absence of self-defense. We disagree. The State had the burden of proving the absence of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Kyllo, 166 Wn.2d at 862. The jury evaluates evidence of self-defense from the standpoint of the reasonably prudent person, knowing all that the defendant knows and seeing all that the defendant sees. State v. Janes, 121 Wn.2d 220, 238, 850 P.2d 495 (1993). The degree of force used in self-defense is limited to what a reasonably prudent person would find necessary under the conditions as they appeared to the defendant. State v. Walden, 131 Wn.2d 469, 474, 932 P.2d 1237 (1997). 8 No. 53133-0-II Hasseries relies on her trial testimony to support her argument. But the jury was not required to believe her testimony. The State’s evidence, which we take as true on a sufficiency challenge, shows that the argument turned physical when Hasseries began hitting and kicking Patrick upstairs, and that she then escalated by arming herself with a sword and cornering him before cutting his arm. There is no evidence that Patrick threatened Hasseries or pursued her with a weapon such that it would justify Hasseries’s need to stab Patrick with the sword. We defer to the jury on issues of conflicting testimony, credibility of witnesses, and the persuasiveness of the evidence. Andy, 182 Wn.2d at 303. Based on the evidence presented at trial, a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Hasseries did not act in self-defense when she assaulted Patrick. II. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL Hasseries argues that she received ineffective assistance of counsel when counsel failed to object to the first aggressor instruction. Specifically, Hasseries argues that the first aggressor instruction given to the jury contained language that permitted the jury to determine that she was the first aggressor based on her words alone. We disagree. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 22 of the Washington Constitution guarantee effective assistance of counsel. State v. Grier, 171 Wn.2d 17, 32, 246 P.3d 1260 (2011). We review ineffective assistance claims de novo. State v. Sutherby, 165 Wn.2d 870, 883, 204 P.3d 916 (2009). To prove that she received ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show (1) that defense counsel’s conduct was deficient and (2) that the deficient performance resulted in prejudice. State v. Linville, 191 Wn.2d 513, 9 No. 53133-0-II 524, 423 P.3d 842 (2018). “Because both prongs must be met, a failure to show either prong will end our inquiry.” State v. Classen, 4 Wn. App. 2d 520, 535, 422 P.3d 489 (2018). To establish deficient performance, the defendant must show that trial counsel’s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. State v. Estes, 188 Wn.2d 450, 458, 395 P.3d 1045 (2017). We strongly presume that defense counsel’s conduct was not deficient. State v. Emery, 174 Wn.2d 741, 755, 278 P.3d 653 (2012). To establish prejudice, the defendant must show a reasonable probability that, absent counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Estes, 188 Wn.2d at 458. Generally, a defendant cannot claim self-defense when she was the aggressor provoking an altercation. State v. Riley, 137 Wn.2d 904, 909, 976 P.2d 624 (1999). The first provoking act must be an act that a “‘jury could reasonably assume would provoke a belligerent response by the victim.’” State v. Bea, 162 Wn. App. 570, 577, 254 P.3d 948 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Wasson, 54 Wn. App. 156, 159, 772 P.2d 1039 (1989)). A first aggressor jury instruction is based on the principle that a defendant cannot claim self-defense when she is the initial aggressor because the victim of the aggressive act is entitled to respond with lawful force. Riley, 137 Wn.2d at 912. But a victim cannot lawfully respond with force to a defendant’s use of words alone. State v. Kee, 6 Wn. App. 2d 874, 880-81, 431 P.3d 1080 (2018). “Jury instructions are sufficient when they are supported by substantial evidence, permit the parties to argue their theories of the case, and properly inform the jury of the applicable law. Self-defense instructions are subject to heightened scrutiny and ‘must make the relevant legal 10 No. 53133-0-II standard manifestly apparent to the average juror.’” Kee, 6 Wn. App. 2d at 880 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Woods, 138 Wn. App. 191, 196, 156 P.3d 309 (2007)). In Kee, this court held that the trial court erred in giving a first aggressor jury instruction that permitted the jury to find that the defendant provoked the altercation based on mere words where a reasonable juror could have concluded, based on the evidence, that the defendant’s comments to the victim provoked the assault. 6 Wn. App. 2d at 880-82. Hasseries cannot show that her trial counsel’s failure to object to the language of the first aggressor instruction prejudiced her. This is not a case where, from the evidence presented at trial, a reasonable juror could have concluded that Hasseries’s words alone provoked the altercation. Nor did the State rely on Hasseries’s words to support a first aggressor theory. In its closing argument, the State emphasized that the first aggressor doctrine is focused on actions. The State acknowledged, “If you believe her story, then she wasn’t the aggressor [upstairs].” VRP (Feb.28, 2019) at 379. The State argued that, even under Hasseries’s version of events, once Hasseries came downstairs, she was the first aggressor based not on her words, but on her action of arming herself with the sword. Regardless of which of those stories you believe, the moment she came downstairs and she said she was no longer afraid of him and she walked through that living room, the first thing that happened was she grabbed the sword. He didn’t strike her. He didn’t threaten to strike her. He didn’t raise his fist. And so the very first force that was used downstairs was started with her grabbing the sword off the mantle and lunging forward at him. VRP (Feb. 28, 2019) at 379-80. Under either Hasseries’s or Patrick’s version of events, a reasonable juror could not have concluded that Hasseries’s words alone provoked the need for self-defense. Hasseries cannot 11 No. 53133-0-II show that had her trial counsel objected to the first aggressor instruction’s lack of clarification that the provoking act cannot be words alone that the outcome of the trial would have been different. See Estes, 188 Wn.2d at 458. Accordingly, her argument that she received ineffective assistance of counsel fails. III. COMMUNITY CUSTODY CONDITIONS Finally, Hasseries argues that the trial court erred by imposing community custody conditions that are not crime-related. Specifically, Hasseries challenges the trial court’s requirement that she undergo mental health and substance use evaluations and the trial court’s imposition of alcohol and drug related conditions. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by ordering Hasseries to undergo mental health and substance use evaluations or by imposing alcohol and drug related community custody conditions. Under the terms of community custody, a sentencing court has discretionary authority to impose crime-related prohibitions and order participation in crime-related treatment or counseling services. RCW 9.94A.703(3)(c), (f); State v. Land, 172 Wn. App. 593, 605, 295 P.3d 782 (2013). A “crime-related prohibition” is one that involves “conduct that directly relates to the circumstances of the crime for which the offender has been convicted.” RCW 9.94A.030(10). We review the trial court’s decision to impose such conditions for an abuse of discretion. State v. Armendariz¸160 Wn.2d 106, 110, 156 P.3d 201 (2007). An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial court’s imposition of a condition is manifestly unreasonable. State v. Hai Minh Nguyen, 191 Wn.2d 671, 678, 425 P.3d 847 (2018). Crime-related prohibitions disallow conduct that directly or reasonably relates to the circumstances of the offense. Nguyen, 12 No. 53133-0-II 191 Wn.2d at 683-84. “The prohibited conduct need not be identical to the crime of conviction, but there must be ‘some basis for the connection.’” Nguyen, 191 Wn.2d at 684 (quoting State v. Irwin, 191 Wn. App. 644, 657, 364 P.3d 830 (2015)). The evidence shows that Hasseries used marijuana before the altercation with Patrick ensued. The trial court also considered Patrick’s victim impact statement that alleged that Hasseries’s use of mind-altering substances had increased in the time leading up to the assault. The trial court found that drug issues could be the “larger issue” underlying the case. VRP (March 22, 2019) at 12. Because there is some basis for the connection between Hasseries’s substance use and her crime, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by imposing drug related conditions or by ordering a substance use evaluation. Additionally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by ordering a mental health evaluation. Patrick’s victim impact statement outlined Hasseries’s significant history with mental illness, which the trial court found consistent with the fact pattern of the case. The trial court found that Hasseries’s reaction to the situation was grossly disproportionate to what occurred during the assault and expressed concern that mental health issues could have been a contributing factor to the crime. Accordingly, ordering a mental health evaluation was reasonably related to the circumstances of the assault, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion. A trial court also has authority to prohibit alcohol possession or consumption as a community custody condition, regardless of the underlying offense’s nature. RCW 13 No. 53133-0-II 9.94A.703(3)(e). Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by prohibiting Hasseries from possessing or consuming alcohol. CONCLUSION In conclusion, we hold that the State presented sufficient evidence that a reasonable juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Hasseries intentionally assaulted Patrick and did not act in self-defense. We further hold that Hasseries failed to show that she received ineffective assistance of counsel. Finally, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by imposing drug and alcohol related community custody conditions or by requiring Hasseries to undergo mental health and substance use evaluations. We affirm Hasseries’s conviction and sentence. A majority of the panel having determined that this opinion will not be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports, but will be filed for public record in accordance with RCW 2.06.040, it is so ordered. ______________________________ Worswick, P.J. _______________________________ Melnick, J. _______________________________ Cruser, J. 14Our innovative and industry-leading GYN specialty clinic in NYC performs hundreds of clitoral hood reduction procedures each year. Our highly certified clinic has perfected the clitoral hood reduction procedure and has an extremely high success rate.
Most often the clitoral hood is ignored during cosmetic vaginal procedure such as labiaplasty, leaving an unwanted result or a clitoral hood protrusion that may lead to an unnatural “top-heavy” appearance that many patients seek to have revised or surgically corrected. Often this excess skin is left behind by other plastic and cosmetic surgeons due to lack of experience with operating in this sensitive area.
Our cosmetic surgeon, Dr. Ammar Mahmoud, has extensive experience performing the clitoral hood reduction procedure by tailoring the amount reduced to meet the desired aesthetic and/or functional goal of the patient. During a hood reduction procedure there is no surgical alteration of the clitoris itself. Dr. Mahmoud focuses solely on reducing the skin surrounding the clitoral hood to significantly improve the appearance and increased sensation if so desired by the patient. If the procedure is performed for pure cosmetic reasons, then the postoperative sensation of the clitoris during intercourse is not altered at all.
Dr. Mahmoud is a professional member of the following prestigious societies and congress:
Dr. Mahmoud utilizes the latest cutting-edge techniques such as laser and radiofrequency technology for safe and satisfactory clitoral hood reduction. This allows for optimal healing and the best results for patients.
Our clinic takes a more conservative approach that is individualized specifically for each patient’s unique anatomy.
The results speak for themselves, as you can see by our genuine patient testimonials and our patient gallery. Our patients praise the lack of discomfort they feel during and after the procedure and the pleasant, specialized staff along with a private environment that helps make the entire experience stress-free, quick and painless.
There are two reasons patients come into our Vaginal Surgery Center in New York City seeking a clitoris reduction; also termed clitoral hoodectomy, clitoral unhooding, or partial hoodectomy.
Patients often request a clitoral hood reduction for aesthetic purposes. If a patient has excessive skin in the clitoral hood causing the female genitalia to look like its protuberant, the surgeon can reduce the skin using a minimally invasive technique that doesn’t affect the sensation and exposure of the clitoris. Our gynecological surgeons have performed hundreds of clitoral hood reductions that have resulted in improved vaginal appearance and aesthetic harmony.
Aging, childbirth and weight fluctuation can cause the skin surrounding the clitoris to elongate. Some patients wish to expose the clitoris with a clitoral hood reduction for more sensation and sensitivity during sexual intercourse with a partner or during self-stimulation. We have many years of experience helping patients achieve these exact outcomes.
The appearance of the clitoral hood can be transformed and improved as per the patient’s specific request using a minimally invasive laser and radiofrequency technique. This cutting-edge technology doesn’t go deeper than 1 millimeter below the skin’s surface to promote quick and painless healing. Our industry-leading techniques lead to incredible results, both cosmetically and functionally, with no scarring.
Clit reduction surgery, also known as clitoral hood reduction, can be done as a standalone procedure or as part of a labiaplasty or vaginoplasty procedure. We will reduce the projection or protrusion of the labia minora as well as the clitoral hood so that there is improved vaginal symmetry and harmony.
Many patients who come in for other treatments opt to have a clitoral hood reduction procedure done at the same time to achieve synergistic results. Here are some related procedures to clitoral hood reductions in New York City:
One of the most relevant complementary services to a clitoral hood reduction is a labia reduction. Labiaplasty is another one of our specialties. Whether it’s a labia minora reduction or a labia majora reduction, this procedure, in tandem with a clitoral hood reduction, helps patients achieve improved comfort, sexual satisfaction and vaginal harmony. Check out our gallery to see our Labial Reduction Before And After Photos.
Additionally, we have many patients who have received a labiaplasty procedure at another clinic, which resulted in a top-heavy, abnormal look. We have the expertise to perform corrective clitoral hood reductions when another surgeon has done a labia reduction causing the patient to have irregular-looking skin on the folds of the clitoral hood. Our surgeons have the skills to improve the appearance of the clitoral hood and allow for better, natural, flow of the patient’s external genitalia. Results are often so natural that even an experienced gynecologist will not be able to tell that you’ve had a cosmetic procedure performed.
Clitoral hood reduction is often performed in conjunction with a perineal scar revision for patients. This procedure aims to return the target area between the anus and the vagina to its pre-pregnancy state and tighten the entrance of the vagina to improve penetrative intercourse, sensation, and appearance. A clitoral hood reduction can further improve sexual sensation by increasing the clitoris’ sensitivity.
When patients come to our vaginal surgical center in New York City looking to improve sexual dysfunction due to vaginal laxity, they often request a clitoral hood reduction. Increased exposure of the clitoris combined with increased vaginal tightness leads to optimal sexual performance and satisfaction.
A fat transfer to the labia majora procedure is perfect for patients looking for a more youthful and plump appearance in their labia and increased comfort during sex. A labia puffing procedure adds fat to the labia majora, which will help conceal the clitoris. A clitoral hood reduction will make the clitoris look less pronounced and allow for an even more aesthetically pleasing look.
Combining vaginal laser rejuvenation with a clitoral hood reduction procedure will increase sexual sensation and vaginal lubrication. This combination will not only improve the appearance of the clitoris but will also improve a patient’s sexual function and confidence.
The price for a clitoral hood reduction in NYC ranges from $6000 to $8000USD.

Here in the UK all athletics has been suspended by the governing body, our track is closed, both the local universities from which I get athletes have also shut up shop and cancelled all remaining lectures and exams are being shifted to other methods such as online where possible.
Last weeks training and rant HERE
I mentioned last week I would most likely have a rant about books but as things stand there are far more important things to be worrying about at this time. And so, will leave that for another week. I’m not going to use this blog to discuss the social and economic concerns that this global pandemic has caused and will still cause as it progresses. I wish to remain focused on the task at hand and that is primarily the “conditioning” of my athletes which is now about keeping them motivated and involved at a time where social distancing is the new norm and with limited access to any facilities. The importance of continuing in some vain is crucial, aiming for what might be a late summer reduced season.
I’m somewhat ready for the task, I’ve been in similar situations before and not only that but I am well read and importantly imaginative, which I actually think is the crucial part now, so it comes down to reviewing the existing programme and simply going to plan B or even C, heck all the way down to what ever it ends up being so that when we can commence, we are ready! But now more than ever, each individual is accountable for their actions and focus.
Its hard of course with our governing body shutting down facilities and the IOC saying the Olympics will still go ahead. We have our local leagues and events saying they have already cancelled the first half of the season, they are not offering any discussion on how we can then salvage competition when the doors are re-opened, they obviously just cant re-start at what ever point in the season it should have been! That would be stupid! And I fear it’s a bigger picture of highlighting the old mindset of our sport!
We now have an opportunity to really reconsider the format of competitions for Track and Field and how we can really bring people into the sport, giving the athletes the best possible competitions and more of a spectacle, but nope it simply looks like it will juts re start in the same old format at whatever point it was meant to be. This sport really does need a shake up and some new blood, from the top down to the locally organised athletics events.
Anyway, I’ll post below what the training was meant to be but ill put in the details what I ended up doing….
- Sunday, Track & Gym. – 6x50m half BW sleds, this was a good session, though was in the rain so the friction was slightly reduced.
- Gym, Hang cleans 4×2 80kg, Olympic bar Deadlift 3×5 140-150-160
- Monday, Gym. – Full Clean 2×5 80kg, Full Squat 5×2 110 120 130 130 130. Bench 3×6 85kg, Kettlebell swings and some hamstring complex. Core.
- Tuesday, Track. The track was closed down today, this is when it started. We ended up moving a session into the local park. 4x approx. 170 slight uphills on path with 2.5 min recover these were ran in 20seconds. Followed this with 6x20m accels
- Wed, Off
- Thursday, Track. – We were lucky in that we realised the university had actually left the track open. I informed the squad that all training was now not sanctioned. Managed the session as written 3x split 300s, however I completely messed up the timing on this and so don’t have any
- Friday, Tempo. This of course will be completed later, with no access to the track this will be some form of extensive fitness in the Park again, will update what I ended up doing later once I can device what that will be.
- Update, amended this session to K reps in Memorial park (local park) aimed at a steady consistent pace, 5 efforts with just under 5min recovery. 3.34 3.32 3.29 3.18 2.54 (decided to keep pushing on the last run)
This next week is going to be interesting, I’m likely to drop into a more fitness routine, as I am working from home this may allow some more use of home circuits and on the bike in addition to the sessions that will be in the park.
Obviously, my weight has not dropped, way too much stress to think about reducing those snacks this week lol
As an addition, i have set my squad some home circuits to complete during this time, as below:Quarentine CircuitsDark, long and sexy! These high impact earrings are unbelievably light weight. Dark coloring is oxidation on silver, with selective additions of 22k Gold.

30X40's Residential Outline Specification + SchedulesWatch Promo
Save time by starting with the right template for your residential project specification. A specification is a simplified listing of all the materials, expectations, standards and performance criteria for your project. It lists, in detail, all the information that the drawings aren't able to. This is the outline specification I use as the starting point for all my residential architecture projects at 30X40 Design Workshop.

See the how Eric organizes his drawing set, schedules + specifications in this video.
Architectural Specifications form an important part of the Contract Documents; they describe - with specificity - aspects of the work that the drawings can't. This specification has been carefully crafted, revised and developed over many years in my studio. You can use this as the foundation and starting point for creating your own custom set of specifications, tailored to your work and standards. Because my practice is focused on residential arcitecture, this document has been designed to be used for light wood construction and covers projects of residential scope + scale.
These are NOT 3-part specifications, they are outline specifications, meaning they're general in nature and describe systems, reference some manufacturer's + products, materials + thicknesses. Some aspects of the work are described in general terms using performance requirements. For example: how a structure is expected to perform during a blower door test. You'll want to review this document carefully and tailor it to your needs, treating it as a template for crafting your own personalized version.
Why do you need them?
Specifications include references to aspects of the work it would be difficult or impossible to include in your drawing set. They cover information and details you might not have thought to include as well. They complement the drawings and make the pricing or bidding process more efficient ensuring you're left nothing to chance or for someone else to decide for you. They're part of making sure you have a complete project and accurate pricing.

I will hand out the social commentary assignment overview. We will review the big requirements and I will allow students to ask questions. I will make sure to point out key information about how I will grade these social commentaries from the rubric on the back making sure to tell students that I will chiefly be looking to their content/message and how their style enhances this.
This assessment is one of the required assessments for 10th grade in my district. I'm actually really excited to have students engage with it, though, as I think it is a great way for them to put into practice all the work they've done with rhetorical analysis this year. Now they will have to consider how they as authors/artists will use structure, genre, etc. to convey message. To do this well, they will have to be keenly aware of what they are trying to argue and then work really hard to make sure that their format/genre enhances that message. I think they are more than capable of doing this and am looking forward to what gets created over the next few days.
I will ask students to take their social commentary stations sheet out and will give students a few minutes to refresh/add to their two-column notes from yesterday. By returning to this discussion of the importance of considering genre/form as a means for promoting a message, I hope that students will be primed to think about their own messages and genres.
After about five minutes of this, I will review the big definition of social commentary and some key ideas to remember when beginning the process of drafting/planning their pieces. As I go through these slides, I will ask students to share examples/ideas from the model texts we reviewed. I will ask them to comment on how each writer/artist achieved the goals and/or answered the questions that I am asking students to think about. I will also ask them to consider the rubric categories and ask them to think what they will need to think about as they start to draft their message/piece (SL.9-10.1). Unfortunately, copyright restrictions make it hard for me to show you the contemporary/modern examples I am using in class, but here is an explanation of an older version of the kind of cartoons/images I might include in this review.
I really hope that by taking the time to do this whole class review of social commentary, students will be more mindful about the choices they make in regards to their language, page layout, message, etc. (L.9-10.3). I really want them to consider their choices and make sure that they are matching their message and audience to the appropriate style.SIT BACK, RELAX AND WATCH YOUR FINANCES GROW!

Having proper eye health and maintaining it is as important as the importance of the eye to the human body because good eye health assures a general average performance of a person. Although eye health is usually ignored unless there are symptoms, it is best advisable to always have an eye check to ensure overall wellness. Eye problems are gender and age-insensitive, although more common to older people.
No matter what the eye problem, it can be treated if diagnosed early, either through surgery or the use of medicine or supplements. A well-known supplement for the treatment of eye problems is ReVision.
Things To Know About ReVision
Made from natural ingredients and resources, ReVision is a supplement made from natural resources specifically created to improve the eyesight of people as well as their brain health. The supplement, according to its creators, when consumed, finds its way into the cells to start a natural restoration and rejuvenation process.
The ReVision, by virtue of the ingredients used in producing it, flushes out toxins from the body, thereby making the brain cells healthier that aids the regeneration of the eye cells, which in turn helps in the maintenance and restoration of good eyesight. Safe to say, made from natural ingredients, the ReVision eye supplement is totally safe and very effective.

How Does ReVision Help?
Glaucoma: the damage of the optic nerve and it getting worse over time is called glaucoma. This usually arises when pressure builds up fluid within the eye, which causes damage to the optic nerve that is responsible for sending messages to the brain.
There are two types of glaucoma: open-angle (also called wide-angle glaucoma is the condition where the drain structure looks normal but the fluid within it isn’t normal) and angle-closure (known as acute glaucoma, it occurs when the angle between the cornea and iris gets too narrow thus causing drainage of the eye fluids).
Glaucoma is symptomized by peripheral loss of vision, eye pains, loss of vision, and light disturbance and redness of the eyes. With the accurate dosage of ReVision and a healthy meal as prescribed by the doctor and dietician, respectively, this can be corrected without surgery because when it goes totally bad, it may be irreversible.
Cataracts: one of the most widely existing eye problems which arise from the formation of cloud-like substances in the eye lens. The mechanism of the eye involves light passing through the eye lens to the retina, where images are processed and formed and when the cataract is formed, the images become dusty. The formation of a cataract is usually a slow process as its symptoms do not involve pains, redness of the eyes or even tears from the eyes. Some of the symptoms of cataract are:
- Problem with looking at bright lights
- Blurred, dim or clouded vision
- Constant changing of the lens without finding a matching lens
The ability of the ReVision supplement to regenerate brain cells, thus aiding vision improvement, helps in the control of the spread of cataracts as well as its reversal.
Macular Degeneration: affecting a large group of people above 40years, while there are no existing symptoms or signs at the early stage of Macular Degeneration, the sudden change in vision quality and appearance of distorted lines coupled with blurriness, partial vision and objects seeming smaller are symptoms of macular Degeneration. This supplement aids in the regeneration of the blood cells and strengthening of the weak blood cells.
Diabetic Retinopathy: rising from a diabetes complication, it affects the eyes by damaging the blood cells that send light sensitive issues to the retina. There are noticeable symptoms from the early stages of diabetic Retinopathy, from impaired colourations to blurred vision and vision loss, amongst others.
There are several known ways to cure and treat this, but none is as reliable as the use of the ReVision supplement. It offers a 100% total reversal of diabetic Retinopathy.
The ReVision Supplement Also Helps To Do The Following
Eliminates the need for surgery: like stated earlier, eye problems can only be treated either by surgery or the use of supplements; ReVision helps in the total recovery of the normality of the eye and its functions.
Boosts energy and brain health: just like it aids eye function and treats eye problems, ReVision also boosts energy and brain health and helps one to focus as it super recharges and helps the brain cells maintain a high level of energy.
Improves eye vision: ReVision helps to improve the vision of people with issues like distorted images, flashes and floaters. The reVision also restores degenerated eyesight to normal.
Eliminates the use of lenses or eye aids: eye lenses (eyeglasses, contact lens, Polaroid lenses, bifocal lenses), eye aids or anything that aids in vision and sight can be weaned off with the use of ReVision supplements.
Reduces the need for sunglasses: just unexpectedly, this supplement, ReVision, acts as an external natural protector and sun-blocker by filtering out ultraviolet rays, thus keeping the eyes safe and reducing the need for sunglasses. It also helps the eye become stronger and more resistant to ultraviolet rays, although it’s best advised to avoid unnecessary exposure to large amounts of light.
Improves the Immune System: the ReVision supplement is made up of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory natural resources and supports the production of chemicals like adrenaline and dopamine.
Ingredients Used In This Product
There are well-sort ingredients used in the production of ReVision that has proven potent and powerful, and they work in a synergistic manner to improve brain and eye function.
These ingredients include:
- Huperzine-A: this ingredient of the ReVision supplement helps improve memory and cognitive retention, and functions because it is a natural brain enhancer.
- Niacin: a natural antioxidant that is rich in vitamin B, which removes toxins and helps in the regeneration of body cells, healthy cell production and optimal cell functions.
- Alpha GPC: the Alpha GPC has been said to aid mental acuity by researchers. It serves as an energy drink to the brain by helping it recharge, enhance thinking, experience clarity and improving focus.
- Caffeine Anhydrous: although required in small quantities and has a very slow distribution rate around the body, it refreshes the mind, helps retain focus and provides energy for the brain cell.
- Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid: known for performing several functions from muscle growth to fat-burning to stabilizing blood pressure and as pain relief, it is also good for relieving anxiety, improving mood and thus improving eye and brain function.
- L-Theanie: L-Theanie has the ability to aid regeneration and facilitate overall well-being. It also prevents anxiety as well as promotes relaxation as it helps the brain become sharper, alert, awake and more relaxed.
- Bacopa Extract: another antioxidant that protects cellular damages; helps vision improvement, mental well-being and memory retention.
- B-Vitamins: vitamin-B is an essential nutrient that helps in the absorption of other essential nutrients in the body as well as acting as a coenzyme the helps the brain functionality and energizes the body.
- Phosphatidylserine: This is important for the eyes and nerve cells.
- L-Tyrosine: just like the L-Theanine, this also helps in becoming focused by improving the brain’s production of dopamine, adrenaline and other hormones, which boosts the brain’s health.
Dosage Of This Supplement
It is important to consult a doctor before medication. However, results gotten from the ReVision supplement are not instant, but with adherence to the instructions, goals will be achieved. It is recommended to be taken twice daily with a good meal and consistently for 90days, although results can be visible from the 7th day.
Final Thoughts On ReVision
Of all the challenges that can be managed, having poor or totally damaged eyesight should not be inclusive as it impounds more stress on the patient. ReVision supplement does not only provide safety and treatment for the eyes, but it also provides a boost for the brain as it aims to rejuvenate age-related vision issues and other related eye health challenges. Its ability to trim down stress and enhance relaxation helps the brain stay healthy and improves functionality.
ReVision is non-toxic and also enhances the general production of blood cells, restores vision and prevents further future damages.Preorder price: 3100

In the United States, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), estimated the prevalence of BV was 29% in the general population of women aged 14 to 49 years and 50% in African-American women. It is characterized by a shift in vaginal flora from an acidic environment due to acid-producing lactobacilli to a mixture of anaerobic and facultative microorganisms. BV symptoms include vaginal odor, itching, discharge, and irritation and can greatly impact a woman’s health, quality of life, sexual relations, self-image, and well-being. BV has also been associated with an increased risk of preterm labor, STD acquisition, and vaginal cuff cellulitis after hysterectomy6. After treatment with antibiotics, recurrences are common. About 15-30% will have a recurrence in 3 months7.
Normal vaginal flora is lactobacilli dominant. Lactobacilli maintain vaginal pH in the acidic range and keep the growth of BV associated bacteria at low levels. Lactobacilli also produce proteins with the bactericidal activity which help to maintain their dominance. Anything that alters the vaginal flora and changes the pH to a more basic environment may increase the risk of BV.
Currently, there are many sexual lubricants and vaginal moisturizers available on the market. It has recently been shown that many of these are hyperosmolar and it is thought that hyperosmolar lubricants can be damaging to the epithelium and may alter the pH of the vagina.* It is postulated that lubricants and moisturizers may predispose to BV by altering the pH of the vagina.

(Reuters) – Apple Inc said on Friday it had tightened some of its rules for responding to legal demands after the U.S. Department of Justice subpoenaed it during Donald Trump’s presidency to seek information on Democratic lawmakers.
Apple said it recently instituted a limit of 25 identifiers such as email addresses or phone numbers by legal request.
The Cupertino, Calif.-Based company said it received a subpoena from the Department of Justice in February 2018 to obtain information on 109 IDs made up of 73 phone numbers and 36 email addresses, but that it does not had not disclosed content such as emails and images to prosecutors.
The New York Times reported Thursday that federal prosecutors have subpoenaed Apple and other companies as part of an investigation into the sources behind media reports of contacts between Trump associates and Russia.
The investigation targeted at least two Democrats from the House Intelligence Committee, aides and family members, including a minor, the Times reported.
Apple said it had no way of telling what the nature of the investigation was and only released basic “subscriber account information” such as names, addresses, email addresses and phone numbers, as well as connection logs and IP addresses.
Apple said it did not provide data indicating to whom or when messages of any kind were sent.
Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz said on Friday he would investigate the department’s efforts under Trump to seize communications data from lawmakers and members of the media.
(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; editing by Leslie Adler and Will Dunham)We’ve started getting back into our regular bush ventures now that the weather is cooling down here, but this past week we had some outings which weren’t done with the intention of nature study, but it occurred anyhow. Bengy found a very large, fat eel while swimming with some friends at a local waterhole; Moozle & I came across a mother duck and three little ducklings in a stream nearby when I took her on a short bike ride; we all saw and identified a ‘moor hen’ and we sat watching & listening to some large ravens in the park yesterday when we met my eldest daughter for lunch.
Our ‘intentional’ nature study was diverted a little when I found this wasp nest on the wall outside. We have been studying insects and were going to find out more about bees or mosquitoes until I saw this wasp nest – a ready made opportunity for study:
Insect Life in Australasia by William Gillies is our main book for studying insects but we also use The Handbook of Nature Study by Anna Comstock and The Wonderland of Nature by Nuri Mass.
Moozle has been experimenting with various coloured pencils to get the colouring right on the rainbow lorikeet, one of our most common native birds. The outline was done for her so she could concentrate on the colouring.
Characteristics of insects – the last sentence was meant to say that they had three types of mouths, not three mouths:
16 thoughts on “Keeping Company – Nature & Science Notebooks”
Beautiful sketches, Carol. We have Nature journals, but I have seen and read so much about Science journals that we want really want to begin those, too. We are in week 1 of Term 3. Do you think it's too late in the year to begin those? Or should I wait until next year?
Lovely!! And I agree that's likely a raven, as I see crows all the time :)Lisa – it is never too late to begin! And as soon as you're ready is the best time.
That lorikeet is beautiful! I can't believe that's a common bird where you are. :)I absolutely love the sketch of the paper wasp nest. We get discarded bits of wasp nests all the time around here; I need to plan to do a bit of a study of one this summer.
HOW awesome!!!!!!!!!!! This is so encouraging and inspiring. Love the duck! Quack! 🙂
I was just looking back over 'The Living Page' & the pictures of nature notebooks in the book included entries that would be considered more science. eg on p.137 the human ear is in a nature notebook of a student in form IV (8th/9th grade). I don't think it's rigid. We just tended to start a separate notebook for science when we were doing more formal science around about age 12 as we tend to do nature study together whilst science is a separate subject according to their year/age. Bengy's science notebook is mostly narrations on what he's studying. So, in (a long-winded) answer to your question, Lisa, if they're doing their own science it might be easier to start a separate notebook…
Thanks Laura, although our crows might be different to yours?? These were making a sound I always associated with a crow but when I saw them I thought they were ravens.
Yes, I love them too. Pity I didn't have my camera with me when we saw the baby ducklings.
If you heard the racket they make when they all gather together you might change your opinion, Celeste! We have some gorgeously coloured birds but their voices don't match their beauty.
The younger 4 are doing Apologia Astronomy and my 16 yr-old is doing Apologia Physics. I really wish I had known about Science notebooks earlier in the year, because I think they would have been so beneficial to my children, a Science \”keeping\”, of sorts.But better late than never; we are beginning Science notebooks next week. :)Thank you, Carol.
I like the idea of a separate formal science notebook. My son has been writing answers to exercises and definitions his dad wants him to go over, but no drawings or diagrams or narrations. Again the blank notebook allows for more flexibility, so perhaps I should switch him over. thanks for sharing all these lovely photos and explanations.
How inspiring!!!!
Hi Carol, I am very eager to begin note books with my young children, miss 9, master 7 and miss 5. Could you please tell me, as a guide, how many note book entries each child should be expected to do at these ages, and how many we should work towards doing per day as they grow? Is it one for each subject everyday, or every week? Some more guidance on how to implement it in my home would be so appreciated, thank you 😊
Hi Miriam,
The notebooks I have here are Science & Nature Study. In a Charlotte Mason context, a nature notebook would begin whenever the child was ready but any ‘formal’ requirements aren’t started until a child is 6 years of age. Before that spending time outside just paying attention & being curious is the best preparation for nature study & science. I think there is a bit of confusion regarding notebooks. You don’t have to have them for everything – a nature journal is the best one to start with and you only need to have them draw an entry in once a week – it’s a long term habit you’re establishing & on the other days you can just keep an eye on the weather, birds you see in the garden. It’s pretty simple. I kept one along with my kids.
Nature study is the foundation for science.
As my children got older I had them start a science notebook for writing up experiments or doing s written narration on something they’ve read about.
Some children and especially some boys struggle with the physical act of writing – doing some copy work each day, even if it’s only a few words or a sentence, is fine.
The most important requirement with your 9 & 7 year old is to have them ‘tell back’ (.e. narrate) what you’ve read aloud to them. This is much more important than having them write something in a notebook at this stage. I know that seeing something written down looks like learning is happening but it’s not always the case.
It’s a bit hard not knowing your situation and if you need more clarification feel free to email me:

Pingback: A 16 Year Old’s Written Narration Samples | journey & destination
Hi Carol,
I have really enjoyed perusing your children’s beautiful notebooks here on your blog. Maybe one of your posts already contains an answer to my question, but I’m sort of flitting from post to post and I haven’t seen it. Can you describe the process – how your children started and how they got to the point of doing such neat, creative, thorough work?
I had my 14 year old start a science notebook last year (he was 13 then, obviously), and I’m having my 12 year old begin one this year. Last year, all my oldest did in his book was write his science narrations. No drawing. He didn’t want to. This week I required a diagram. My younger one was happy to oblige. His diagram wasn’t very detailed, but I was fairly pleased, given his age, abilities, and the newness of the activity. My older one, on the other hand, was exasperated. “I don’t know how to draw a diagram!” He exclaimed. I told him he could simply copy one from the book if he wanted to. So that’s what he did. Almost exactly. However, I don’t think he had an exact understanding of what he was drawing. They narrated to me orally, using their drawings, and the older one’s narration didn’t show a good grasp of the subject.
Have your children learned their notebooking skills from you? Or did you show them other examples in the beginning? I showed my children an example of one of your children’s pages (on a different science topic so they wouldn’t feel they had to do exactly the same), but they still don’t have an idea of drawing diagrams, ordering the information, either in frames or bubbles or some other flow, or putting in small bits of text with arrows pointing to the diagram.
How can I help them learn to do this?
Hi Hannah! I don’t think I’ve posted about how we got started with notebooking. I started blogging 9 years ago when we’d already been homeschooling for years. However, I’ve been asked this question a bit more recently so I will have a think and put together a post soon.
To give you a short answer though, I think there is a personality thing to it. There is also a confidence aspect, too – and I think from what you said about your 13/14 yr old that might be the case. This can happen with gifted kids who are perfectionists & also with those who believe they can’t draw. I’ll go into this on my post as it was something I had to address.
I hadn’t seen examples of notebooking when my children started theirs but I found that their work did reflect their personalities somewhat. One or two were artistic, a couple were more succinct & technical.
If they have done an experiment you could get them to describe what they’ve done in writing or draw a picture of what they used for the experiment & what the result was with some labels.
I did start out with nature notebooks with each of them. They didn’t always like doing them but they did it once a week generally.
I’ll try & find some of their earlier work and post it. BTW. I saw some Charlotte Mason nature notebooks when we were in the UK & posted about them here:
(Scroll down the page a bit) They weren’t fancy & reflected the personalities of those who did them – some were interested more in journal type entries while others focussed on drawing.
Anyhow, I’ll have a dig into the recesses of my brain & see what I come up with. 🙂When you own a home, as so many people do, maintaining and improving it is a high priority. Although you may be frustrated by the results you have had in the past, this article is meant to guide you through the home improvement process with helpful tips and advice.
Buy new furniture every once and a while, refreshing the appearance and keeping the rooms looking new. Add some spice to your home by buying vintage furniture. You could find a true treasure in a collection of used items, like furniture. Some may require a bit of work, but with the right time invested, they can be a real asset to your household.
If your floor is squeaking, utilize construction adhesive to halt the squeaks. You have to work in your crawlspace or in the basement, but it is going to be worth it. Use a caulking gun to place glue between each floor joist, while making sure each planks is secure.
When deciding on which home improvements you are going to do, consider only those that make sense. Forgetting things like insulation in the North, or sun-shielding in the South, will seriously lower the value of any renovations you make. Go with what is normally desired for the area you live in.
When you decide to begin a home improvement project, know how much work is required. Get a notebook, and list everything that must be done. Don’t forget to ask a friend or family member to take a look at your list to make sure nothing was missed. Once you have created a clear, accurate list, it will be easier to keep the project on track in terms of cost.
Safety Escape Routes
You can greatly improve the safety in your home by gathering your family members and discussing safety escape routes. In an emergency, it is easy to panic. Working out safety escape routes before an emergency strikes can save you and your family members’ lives. Make the meeting, discuss the necessities and stay prepared for the unexpected.
Don’t throw out your small baby food jars; instead, use them to organize your workspace. Just screw the jar lids onto the bottom of a shelf above your work bench. Have small items put into these jars, including jewelry parts, nails, screws, and beads. Twist them back under the shelf. This saves you a ton of counter space.
Take a moment to review the ingredients of your cleansers before you try to flush out a clogged drain. Cleaners can differ a great deal, and many of them are quite harsh. Avoid anything that comes in a crystallized form as the crystals can stick to pipes, causing corrosion and damage. If you have a septic tank, be especially careful to use only products that are approved for use with it.
Solar lights won’t do anything to improve the value of your home. If you need lights in your hallway or outside try electric ones. Although these models can be more costly, they’re also more reliable, and you’ll get a lot more out of them than the average solar model.
It can be very expensive to replace your flooring, no matter what material you use. If you are looking to save money, think about staining the concrete subfloor instead of going with one of the above options. It will create an industrial look that is versatile can can be changed with the decor.
When you mount a television onto the wall using the appropriate bracket, you can free much much needed floor space. Installing a wall mount is fairly simple, and if you follow the instructions, it generally only takes around 30 minutes or so.
Replacing drafty older windows is a great way to keep the cold out in the winter months, and bugs out during summertime. Most homeowners are very satisfied with their decision to purchase new windows.
Make sure you get your plumbing and electric squared away before anything else. These projects often require you to work with wires or pipes inside your walls; finish these repairs before you tackle any other jobs. Furthermore, walls that are exposed during renovations are more easily accessible for wiring and plumbing projects.
When you are getting ready to sell your home and want to make your landscaping look as attractive as possible, try planting fully-grown flowers instead of seeds or seedlings. The mature plants and flowers can add some immediate life and color to a potentially drab area. You may not have big enough plants to change anything if you use seedlings. Blooming plants make your landscape look “finished,” which helps buyers see that they do not have to do any additional work into the yard.
When planning out home improvements, one has to consider the climate and prevailing local conditions before choosing a project. Think about things like the wind or how much sun you get when remodeling. Not taking into consideration things like this can make your home improvement efforts worthless because they might not be the best fit for your home.
Think about adding paneling onto your walls for a fresh and fast new look. It’s fast, cheap, and easy to accomplish, and if you don’t like it, you can just take them down and repaint.
Flexibility is key when it comes to home improvement. While you should always set a time frame, sometimes you simply won’t be able to make your deadline. You should also have a budget and an absolute maximum in case something goes wrong or you get a great deal on an upgrade. It is important that you are flexible during these situations.
The key to improving your home is to take things slowly and be brave enough to go outside of your comfort zone. Nothing should be out of your reach if you prepare yourself thoroughly. If you follow these tips, your project will probably go off fairly smoothly.
FSC announces plan to bolster Kosdaq
A stock board at the headquarters of KEB Hana Bank in central Seoul shows the Kosdaq market closing at 829.99 on Tuesday, down 1.13 percent from the previous trading day. [YONHAP]
A 300 billion won ($282 million) fund will be created by Korea Exchange, Korea Securities Depository, and other capital market-related government bodies to invest in Kosdaq-listed companies.
“The 300 billion won fund, dubbed the Kosdaq Scale-Up Fund, will be used to invest in undervalued Kosdaq stocks,” said Choi Jong-ku, head of the Financial Services Commission.
Choi also vowed to ease the financial listing requirements of the index to attract more high-tech companies with the potential to grow.
Currently, a unit must maintain positive cash flow from operating activities to be listed on the Kosdaq while not having impaired capital or capital that is worth less than its stated value in the company’s capital stock account.
The chairman said that the two requirements will be removed, adding that the regulator will apply less strict rules in gauging market cap and profit.
“We will make a new listing system so that if a company meets one of three conditions - pre-tax profit, market capitalization and owner’s capital - the company will be listed,” Choi said.
A committee dedicated to the Kosdaq market at the Korea Exchange will be granted more independence and regulatory discretion, according to the Financial Services Commission.
Observers noted that the Kosdaq Committee under the Korea Exchange lacks independence, and as such it lacks a sufficient budget and regulatory support.
Choi said that the head of the committee will be recruited externally.
“Now, Korea Exchange’s director doubles as the head of the Kosdaq Committee, but the position will be separated and an outside expert will head the division,” Choi said.
“The committee will also be entitled to fully review and screen listing processes,” he added.
The Financial Services Commission will announce more specific measures on Thursday.
Potential tax benefits and incentives for institutional investors investing in the Kosdaq were not mentioned on Tuesday, although these details may follow later in the week.
The government wants to bring in institutional investors because the Kosdaq is heavily dependent on retail investors, responsible for 87.4 percent of transactions. Retail investment is typically short-term and vulnerable to market fluctuations. Foreign investors account for 7.2 percent, while institutions, including pension funds, take up 4.4 percent as of October, according to the Korea Exchange.
The regulatory agency mentioned last year that one option could be offering incentives to institutions that expand the proportion of their pension fund that is invested in Kosdaq stocks.

Constitutional laws and religious laws are often referred to by the writers. Thus, looking at a comparative essay example available in our site is a good way to learn how to write such type of essays. Janise are among the most respected teachers in our school, their teaching styles differ significantly. Just as looking through a pair of glasses changes the way you see an object, using A as a framework for understanding B changes the way you see B.
Writing the comparative essay is an important skill that you will use many times throughout your scholastic career. Do not be afraid to write what your thoughts. In a way, you may be right. The composer responds in terms of the context and the situation surrounding them. As well, recent or relevant discoveries.

You have to use all the correct citations, including indirect and direct quotes to make your text even more believable. While these wars were fought in different times of American history, you will see how much they have in common. Here comes the challenge - you have to do the in-depth study of both principles you compare.
The thesis statement usually goes in the first paragraph, somewhere around the last sentence of it. Referencing and giving citations in your work is one of the best ways of proving your points, hence explaining why you chose a particular stand. There are some common and annoying mistakes which may significantly harm your grade. So now you know how to choose the best compare and contrast topics and the different segments that you need to address when writing. Think about it this way—if someone handed you this list… …you would probably wonder why the heck the person just did that.
Once you have defined your points of comparison, choose the structure for the body paragraphs where your comparisons go that makes the most sense for your data. As in any argumentative paper, your thesis statement will convey the gist of your argument, which necessarily follows from your frame of reference. In addition, these essays allow students develop critical thinking skills to approach a variety of topics. You will use these observations, along with your list of similarities and differences, to construct your thesis statement and an outline for your comparative essay.

Adeline struggles through life up to the age of fourteen when she proves to her family that she is more than what meets the eye, and proves to them that she is equal to everyone else, and tries her hardest so that she can be accepted for who she is.
This is because unlike most kinds of essays, it is hardly possible to get writer's block when you are handling these. You do not have to spend equal amounts of time discussing similarities and differences; you can emphasize either of them, depending on your thesis. Thus, a paper on two evolutionary theorists' different interpretations of specific archaeological findings might have as few as two or three sentences in the introduction on similarities and at most a paragraph or two to set up the contrast between the theorists' positions.

Genius as we make with certainty what it imbues in the department of education and design practices. Listed below are the steps that you may use when developing the content of your comparative essay. Compare and Contrast A compare and contrast essay is a type of writing in which you explain the similarities and differences between two things. These points should be backed by actual researchers, factual information, and other reliable evidence. Among other things, the basis could be a theoretical approach, such as feminism or multiculturalism; a question or problem that you wish to discover an answer for; or a historical theme, such as colonialism or emancipation. The rest of the paper, whether organized text- by-text or point-by-point, will treat the two theorists' differences.
When opting to use the alternating method, you should try to group several similar points together and discuss them as a whole, to avoid the excessively frequent switching from one item to another which can confuse the reader and make your essay seem chaotic and hard to follow. This article puts more focus on subjects and topic for these types of essays since without a good topic, you might end up getting stuck and have to start over and over again.

We received this report from correspondents in the S.F. Bay Area:
On a typical weekday morning, the only boats in the San Francisco Bay are commuter ferries, and the only aircraft crossing overhead are traffic helicopters or high-flying commercial jets.
But Monday morning, March 15, was different. Beginning at 8 a.m. waves of huge military helicopters took off from aircraft carriers anchored in the Bay and landed at the Alameda Naval Air Station near Oakland. When they touched down, dozens of Marines poured out in full combat gear. After the helicopters came and went, a half-dozen 88-ton armored amphibious landing craft came ashore, dumping Marines, tanks and armored personnel carriers.
The Marines had invaded Oakland. Operation Urban Warrior--a week of urban military exercises--had begun. And a wild, interesting, and revealing week it was--in more ways than one. While the Marines tested strategies for suppressing the people's struggles around the world, some real people's struggle broke out against them. Throughout the week there were more than a half-dozen demonstrations in Oakland and Monterey to the south (where the Marines were carrying out a similar operation called Sea Dragon). There was broad debate in the media and among many people throughout the area. Protesters took over Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown's office and waged an hour-long struggle with the police.
The Marines repeated over and over that Urban Warrior was about training to give disaster relief and humanitarian aid to help people around the world. They invited the local media to a tour of the exercise to sell this point--and we took part in this tour. The minute we walked into the Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in southeast Oakland--where the Marines carried out their combat exercises from March 16 through 18--it was clear we were entering a war zone, not a humanitarian relief operation. The first thing you heard were gunshots, and the first thing you saw were Marines running across the street with M-16s and tanks rolling down the streets.
The Marines tested a scenario called a "3 block war in 3 dimensions." The "3 blocks" refers to the escalation from "humanitarian relief" to riot suppression to urban combat. The "3 dimensions" are tall buildings, the street level, and the underground tunnels and sewers that crisscross major urban areas. Local people were hired to play the required roles: pleading refugees, angry civilians, cops, even reporters.
As we watched this exercise unfold, it was clear the Marines considered the masses potential enemies from jump. Under their scenario, the Marines were on a mission to give "humanitarian relief" to refugees fleeing a natural disaster. While those playing the role of refugees were transported by bus, a Marine officer told them, "Keep your heads down and your hands up." The point was to keep them disoriented so they couldn't scope the area, just in case they were guerrillas. There were also "checkpoints" where Marines stopped, frisked, and IDed refugees. It brought to mind police checkpoints in South Central L.A. or apartheid South Africa.
The refugees were eventually taken to a Marine processing center and then to a migrant shelter. Everyone was frisked for weapons. The Marines then interrogated them to find out who was who, get intelligence on the local situation, and meet any officials in the crowd. All this information was typed into computers linked with a central command post on a ship in the Bay.
In the scenario that the Marines practiced, tensions built up among the refugees and a mock riot erupted outside the processing center. Refugees threw things at the Marines and yelled, "I want food now." The Marines then practiced "controlling" the situation.
Just then, a group acting as anti-U.S. guerrillas drove up and threw a simulated grenade at the Marines. One Marine went down, while the others deployed and returned fire. The refugees were still in an uproar, so more Marines were brought in keep them confined. Different ethnic groups among the refugees were separated--to supposedly keep them from fighting each other.
In the exercises in Monterey, some of the "rioters" were dressed in Arab head-wraps, others in bulky sweat shirts and baggy jeans, and still others pretended to be Korean. This effort to stigmatize different oppressed peoples as "the enemy" outraged many in the Bay Area.
Urban Warrior also involved British Royal Marines and U.S. Marines training for "hostage situations" in an urban housing area. They went into an apartment building in order to "take out" the "terrorists" who held refugees hostage. The idea was to "search and destroy without risking friendly forces." No doubt the British Marines drew on their experience in fighting the Irish Republican Army and suppressing the people in Northern Ireland.
Throughout the tour, the Marines showed off the latest technology. One was the "Mobile Counter Fire System"--an armored truck with cameras and audio sensors. If the truck is shot at, its audio sensors determine where the shot came from and automatically return fire in two seconds. Another was "SARGE--Surveillance and Reconnaissance Ground Equipment." SARGE is a remote-controlled vehicle that looks sort of like a dune buggy, which can be dropped into a combat zone from the air in order to scope out the situation.
Urban Warrior also tested computer and communications equipment that link individual soldiers in the field with each other and the central command. This is done by means of small computers worn by the Marines which are hooked into a global positioning satellite system. One Colonel said that this "cuts through the fog of war" and enables all the Marines on the ground as well as the commanders in ships offshore or planes to know where everyone is and coordinate their actions.
These high-tech weapons will pose challenges for the people resisting U.S. intervention. But they also made us think about the imperialists' vulnerabilities. The U.S. is afraid of getting caught in major ground wars for fear of being defeated and/or sparking political opposition at home. So they've devised a whole range of new technologies to try to limit casualties and the number of troops they need to deploy.
The scenarios tested during Urban Warrior are part of a much broader strategy. The rulers are planning to suppress and control the world's people in the difficult and complex terrain of large urban centers. (See RW #998, "Marines Invade Oakland.") In an article in Armed Forces Journal International, Major General Scales describes how the Marines see the world shaping up: "The future urban center will contain a mixed population, ranging from the rich elite to the poor and disenfranchised... Marines are not training to eliminate the horrors of starvation and disease--they are training to maintain and expand U.S. domination and global power. As the Marines themselves put it, they envision seizing the power, transport and distribution centers in a city to gain "control over the urban environment."
One colonel told us flatly that none of these scenarios could be used in the U.S. because it would violate the Constitution. But his boss, Marine Commandant General C.C. Krulack, recently wrote that Marine "deployments may well be in support of our own cities in response to possible terrorist acts in the future." And we witnessed some aspects of the growing militarization of U.S. police forces and the closer links between the police and military that is taking place. The Oakland PD surrounded and protected the Urban Warrior exercises from protests, while the Marines reportedly invited local police and fire officials to witness the exercises and share information.
Operation Urban Warrior was also a political invasion. While the troops deployed to Oak Knoll for combat exercises, Marine spokespeople deployed throughout the Bay Area media. These PR men in combat fatigues stressed the "humanitarianism" of their tanks, helicopters and M-16's.
The PR operation was integrated with the combat exercises. At Oak Knoll, when local media people were taken around to see the exercises and the new technology, there was always a Marine showing reporters what's what. It was interesting to see how the bourgeois journalists operated. Many asked technical questions about the equipment. No one asked about the politics of Urban Warrior, the impact of Marine assaults on the masses, or what else the Marines were training for.
The Marines emphasized that they were completely open and wanted the public to see everything they were doing. But we think our group included Marines in civilian clothes pretending to be journalists. They seemed to be observing the media's response to their show. They also asked questions so Marine spokespeople could say things they wanted us to hear. And they may also have been testing the Marine's ability to answer various questions and do PR work.
The Marine war machine may have been in high gear, but the people had done some planning and organizing of their own. It turned out to be a week of broad debate in society and nearly daily protests involving diverse forces--from long-time activists to radicalized high school students.
In both Monterey and Oakland, the Marines were confronted by about 100 people as soon as they landed. Many of the Oakland demonstrations were organized by the Coalition Against Urban Warrior which included anti-war veterans groups, church groups, American Federation of Teachers, American Friends Service Committee, Grey Panthers, Middle East Children's Alliance, Peace & Freedom Party, Physicians for Social Responsibility, and the Oakland Tenants Union. Views ranged from anti-imperialist and revolutionary to opposing Urban Warrior as a "waste of our tax money."
The Monterey coalition included Veterans for Peace, the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, the Green Party, local students, a Santa Cruz bicycle group and affinity groups from the Resource Center for Nonviolence of Santa Cruz.
Opponents of Urban Warrior were heard throughout the Bay Area media. Opinion pieces opposing Urban Warrior were published in the San Francisco Chronicle and the Oakland Tribune. The San Francisco Bay Guardian, a local alternative weekly, carried a major exposure of the exercises as urban counter-insurgency along with editorials denouncing the operation. Coalition members were interviewed a number of times in the media.
One Marine colonel spent an hour on Pacifica radio network's KPFA station in Berkeley in a revealing debate with opponents of the exercises, including RW correspondent Larry Everest. Guests and callers challenged the colonel on the imperialist character of U.S. actions around the world, as well as the bloody toll of the Marine intervention in Somalia, the militarization of the U.S.-Mexico border, and the Marine shooting of Esequiel Hernandez in Texas.
A bold action by youth sparked the biggest uproar and further spread the controversy over Urban Warrior. On March 16, the day after the Marine invasion, 100 people picketed City Hall in downtown Oakland. About 25 students, youth, and their supporters--called the Coalition for Justice--broke off, went into City Hall, and marched up to Mayor Jerry Brown's office.
Brown was elected Mayor of Oakland last year after campaigning on the basis of "inclusion" and making things "better" for the people. Yet, after San Francisco turned down the Marines and Urban Warrior, Brown welcomed them with open arms, saying how this would bring millions of dollars to the city. This outraged many who hoped he would be different than other establishment politicians.
One former student from Fremont High School in Oakland who works with the Coalition for Justice told the RW, "Brown talks about Urban Warrior bringing $4.5 million to Oakland, but who is getting that money? They should be spending it to teach teachers, not Marines." She added, "I think the Marines see the youth as `the enemy.'<|>"
When the students got to Brown's office they demanded a meeting. They were told he wasn't in and they had to make an appointment. Instead of leaving, the demonstrators walked into Brown's office, determined to stay until they saw him or made a statement against Urban Warrior.
One city official began calling the police on his cell phone, and the youth demanded he stop. Freaked out, this official locked himself in a closet so he could keeping calling. Meanwhile, the protesters reportedly unplugged phones and computers and put them in a corner so they wouldn't be damaged, then moved a desk and furniture to block the door.
According to witnesses on the scene, including city officials, when the police arrived they didn't try to negotiate with the protesters. The cops forced the door open with a crow bar. They pried it open a few inches, then reached in with a can of mace and started spraying. Soon the room was full of mace. The youth went to the back of the office and sat down with arms linked as a show of non-violent resistance. The police then knocked open the door with a battering ram and attacked and arrested the demonstrators, injuring one woman who was denied medical treatment.
Twenty-two protesters were arrested. Some were initially threatened with charges of felony assault, robbery, false imprisonment and misdemeanor trespassing. Two of the leaders of the protest were held for several days before their $16,000 bail was reduced.
The city administration tried to vilify the protest. The staffer who locked himself in a closet said he'd been "held hostage." Brown's press secretary claimed the protesters grabbed mace from the police and sprayed it around. At the same time that Marines were training in the city to use force and violence against the people, the head of the Oakland Police Officers Association declared with a straight face, "The group decided to take the `mob mentality' approach and used force and violence to achieve its goals."
The city's hostility further outraged the opponents of Urban Warrior and many throughout Oakland. The Coalition for Justice began a hunger strike to protest the continued imprisonment of two of its leaders, and over 60 people disrupted the City Council meeting on the night of the arrests.
Even some members of the city administration denounced the police action. One City Councilwoman said, "Usually, things don't turn violent until the police show up and there's an overreaction. Usually, it's not the protester starting the violence. They came to protest because Jerry wasn't coming to the meeting tonight. They have a right to protest." A City Council vote to oppose Urban Warrior ended in a 4- 4 tie.
One casualty of Urban Warrior was Mayor Brown's reputation as a "maverick," "New Age" politician who opposed the U.S.'s huge military budget and its interventions around the world. During the run-up to Urban Warrior he ducked the debate, even avoiding City Council meetings, and refused to meet with the opponents of the Marine exercise. After the occupation of his office, Brown stepped up his defense of the Marines and the Oakland PD's assault on the sit-in.
Brown repeated all the police lies about what happened and claimed the youth just wanted "to cynically exploit the Marine training exercise to get some publicity and indulge a misguided need for theater and futile gesture." He said, "There is no civil right to take over a public office." Brown also raised the ridiculous claim that opponents of Urban Warrior wanted the Marines to train in other countries, not in the U.S.
Brown's arguments for Urban Warrior were an explicit acceptance of the framework of the U.S. imperialist system. He wrote that opposing the Marine exercises was "narrow." And he argued, "Military policies like Star Wars and Central American policy are decided by the president and the congress. If you are against even military training, you are not going to be listened to on the really critical issues."
Brown's support for Urban Warrior came on top of his firing of the Chief of Police and an effort to force out the head of the school system. Both moves are preparation for clamping down harder on Oakland's masses, especially the youth. A rash of new nicknames for Brown sum up the feelings of many about his regime, including "Oaklander Uber Alles" and "from Governor Moonbeam to Mayor Mussolini."
The Marines and the City of Oakland wrapped up the week of counter-revolutionary military preparations with a pro-Marine carnival at Jack London Square. On sunny Saturdays and Sundays there are usually thousands of people strolling, shopping or taking in the sights in this area. But protest and controversy dogged Urban Warrior right until the end.
On Sunday, March 21, the Marines organized guided tours of the Bon Homme Richard--a new amphibious assault ship--hosted by smiling Navy and Marine personnel. They gave out posters and bumper stickers. There was a recruiting table and chin-up exhibition. A 20-foot-tall inflated Marine figure with weirdly huge biceps served as the backdrop. Further down the mall a Navy rock band played--in uniform. Red, white and blue balloons were hung all over the place.
At nearby Alameda Point, the warship USS Hornet and 60 different military technologies and weapons were on display. There were also aerial demonstrations, and Navy and Marine Corps bands and drill teams. Protesters called the displays a "weapons petting zoo."
But there were also 75 or so anti-Marine protesters on the scene. The police at first confined them to a "protest pen," separated from the crowds of shoppers and sightseers. But before long people left the pen and staged a spirited marched down the street and past many onlookers, led by a giant Art & Revolution puppet of the "two faces of Jerry Brown." The police dogged the march all the way, preventing the demonstration from marching through the heart of the Square. Meanwhile, three "Peace Navy" boats sailed back and forth past the people checking out the Bon Homme Richard, with signs saying "No Gunboat Diplomacy."
The RW was at events throughout the week, and paper sellers heard some interesting comments from the people. One 15-year-old student said that Urban Warrior had been discussed all day long at Castlemont High. "They are afraid of people opening their mouths or people rising up and protesting all sorts of things," she said. She saw Urban Warrior as connected to attacks on bilingual education and to police brutality.
Another young man told RW sellers that the rulers are afraid of everything the youth do today--"what we wear, what we think and do." One older man said, "We need revolution or radical change and the system is against that." Another added, "This is the most racist country in the world and now they are doing military training here to protect that."
RW sellers also talked to a number of off-duty Marines who watched the anti-Urban Warrior march with curiosity--and in some cases followed behind. They report that at first some of the Marines got the paper as sort of a joke or curiosity. But after actually looking through it, they got drawn in and began more seriously reading it. Some Marines began complaining about getting tested with an anti- anthrax vaccine. And a number had heard of--and were sympathetic to--the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal.
Urban Warrior was designed to build public support for the Marines, but opponents of the exercises not only sparked broad debate over the role of the U.S. and its military, but raised big questions among some of the Marines. It wasn't precisely what the Marines and the Bay Area establishment had hoped for.

Imagine you are on a 4 lane highway and the speed limit is 70 miles an hour. Suddenly a sign appears announcing that the speed limit has dropped to 55 miles an hour without any obvious reason for the change in speed. In that moment, you have to make a choice to either ignore the speed limit or honor it, even though the highway ahead is clear and straight for miles.
Of course you can make the decision to ignore it which then creates a potential risk of getting a speeding ticket. If that risk is not one you wish to take, then you must comply with the speed limit. It is here that the distinction becomes prominent in terms of your experience for the rest of your trip.
You can come into agreement with the posted speed limit meaning you agree to comply with the regulation even though you don't come to full peace with it. Your agreement truthfully comes from the fear of getting a ticket or the resistance to being told what to do. In other words you comply with some level of resentment present and we all know that resentment is a negative energy that robs you of the ability to feel and experience Love.
The other choice you have is to come into alignment with the speed limit. What this means is that you find unconditional acceptance and allowance about the regulation. In other words, you find a way to look at the positive aspects of slowing down so that there is no resentment, anger, or malice towards it. You actually feel your way into an alignment that is so clear and positive that you appreciate the request!
Through alignment you step into the energy of Love which allows you to fully enjoy all the moments to follow. Who knows, you may see something incredibly beautiful on this stretch of highway that you've never seen before!
I suggest to you that Love engages the world through alignment. Fear must rely on agreements that often fuel resentment unless alignment eventually emerges. As you move about your world today I hope you will test out this distinction in a situation in your life. The moment I did, everything shifted for me...and my ability Make my Love Visible vastly expanded.

Hyperlapse from Instagram
Last week, we brought you news of Instagram’s brand new Hyperlapse app, which beat Microsoft to the punch and heralded what looks to be a brand new age in smartphone photography: the ability to record super-smooth time lapse videos that won’t give your audience motion sickness. Today, we take a closer look at Hyperlapse from Instagram to find out if it’s all that.
The first thing you’ll notice after you download the app is the fact that you don’t need a working knowledge of photography to make it fly. In many ways it’s a video capture app far simpler than what’s likely already on your iOS device. Bonus points for Instagram for delivering an app that doesn’t force you tap through an endless tutorial or otherwise confusing wizard to show you how to use it. In the good old tradition of those easy to use cameras we all cut our teeth on, Hyperlapse from Instagram is an honest-to-goodness “point and shoot” experience.
Setup is minimal, and it doesn’t even require you to have an Instagram account. All it requires is access to your device’s camera (obviously) and your device’s microphone (which isn’t required, but is probably a good idea). At that point, you’re ready to rock and roll and capture all of your daring or ridiculous exploits in fast, fluid motion.
Recording is facilitated by tapping on a circular record button at the bottom of the screen. To stop recording, just tap the stop button in the same location. After recording has been completed, you’re instantly given a preview of your hyperlapse video playing in a constant loop at 6x speed. A slider at the bottom of the screen lets you adjust the playback speed, which ranges from 1x speed to 12x speed.
Once you’ve decided what speed your eyes are most comfortable with, a single tap of a green checkmark icon saves your hyperlapse video to your iOS device’s camera roll. A red X icon can also be tapped to discard the video, or defer selection of your desired speed for later by choosing an “Edit Later” option.
Naturally, because it’s an app developed by Instagram, Hyperlapse videos are fully sharable across that platform, as well as Facebook. Those hoping to bring Hyperlapse over to LinkedIn or those hanging out in the 140-character confines of Twitter need not apply.
Hyperlapse from Instagram (which has been named such to differentiate itself from another app also named Hyperlapse that does something totally different) requires iOS 7.0 or later and runs on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices. As with most other apps of any desirable caliber, it’s been optimized for the iPhone 5. It’s available now as a free download from iTunes.

Overview: Ketogenic Diets & Protein Powder
If you’re on the hunt for the best keto protein powder, chances are you’re already familiar with ketogenic diets. But for those who want more information, here’s a quick overview of keto itself.
We’ll cover keto’s benefits, side effects, and how certain supplements (including protein powder) can help.
What Is the Ketogenic Diet?
The ketogenic diet is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet designed to promote fat burning. Essentially, ketogenic diets encourage the body to switch from glucose (sugar) as a primary fuel source to ketone bodies, or ketones.
Glucose, which comes from carbohydrates, is the body’s usual primary energy source. However, when glucose becomes scarce (as is the case on a low-carb diet), the liver begins to break down fats into ketones, which are then used as fuel. This states is called ketosis, from which ketogenic diets get their name.
Entering & Maintaining Ketosis
Entering and maintaining ketosis isn’t a piece of cake. Most ketogenic diets require staying under 5% carbohydrates for your total daily macronutrient intake. This is usually between 20 to 50 grams of carbohydrates each day, or the equivalent of 1 to 2 bananas.
Once you’re maintaining under 5% carbs daily, it will still take a while for the body to enter ketosis. This length of time will be different from person to person, varying from a few days to a few weeks.
There are several signs that indicate you’ve entered ketosis. One of the simplest signs is bad breath. Acetone, one of the ketones produced in the liver, exits the body in the breath and urine. In a state of ketosis, it can give your breath an unpleasant, slightly sweet smell.
The most effective and consistent method of determining whether you’re in ketosis, however, is through the use of ketone test strips. You can use these strips to test the level of ketones in your urine, which will indicate with a high degree of accuracy whether you’re actually in a state of ketosis.
These ketosis urinalysis test strips take the guesswork out of determining whether you’re in a state of ketosis.
Benefits of Keto Diets
It’s not without reason that ketogenic diets have become immensely popular. For several decades, experts and practitioners alike have praised these diets for a slew of reported health benefits. More recently, studies have provided more solid evidence of the benefits of keto diets.

Side Effects of Keto Diets
As the body adapts to being in long-term state of ketosis, many people experience some unpleasant side effects. This condition is often called keto flu, and can last anywhere between a few days and a few weeks.
Possible Keto Diet Side Effects:
- Nausea and gastrointestinal discomfort
- Decreased energy levels
- Poor mental function
- Headaches
- Difficulty sleeping
Some of these symptoms can be mitigated with proper lifestyle and supplementation strategies.
Supplements for Keto Diets
Entering ketosis and maintaining a keto diet is no easy feat, and there are several supplements that can help.
- MCT Oil
MCT stands for medium-chain triglycerides, which are types of fatty acids that come from the diet. Since the body turns fats into ketones as a primary source of fuel during ketosis, MCTs can be a valuable source of energy while maintaining a ketogenic diet.
Without getting too much into the science behind MCTs, it’s helpful to know that the shorter the carbon chain (indicated by a C-number abbreviation), the quicker and easier it is for the body to turn the MCT into fuel.
The Four MCTs:
- C6: Caproic acid
- C8: Caprylic acid
- C10: Capric acid
- C12: Lauric acid
Since caproic acid and caprylic acid have the shortest carbon chains (C6 and C8, respectively), they are the most valuable MCTs for the keto diet.
There are plenty of foods that contain MCTs, such as coconut oil. However, coconut oil only contains roughly 50% MCT oils. About half of those are lauric acid, which is the most difficult and slowest to break down.
MCT oil is often used to more efficiently supply the body with the shortest MCTs, caproic acid (C6) and caprylic acid (C8). The oil can be 100% caproic acid, 100% caprylic acid, or a combination of the two. This makes it an incredibly helpful supplement for people on ketogenic diets.
Take a look at our MCT oil guide for more information and our top picks.
While some MCT oils contain high levels of non-ideal lauric acid, this oil consists of 99.8% caproic and caprylic acids.
- Caffeine
When first starting the keto diet, a common side effect is a lack of energy. To counteract this, many people will increase their caffeine intake by a small margin. This can be done by simply drinking an extra cup of coffee or caffeinated tea, which can provide the body with anywhere between 30 and 150 milligrams of caffeine.
While it’s not recommended to maintain a high level of caffeine consumption for a long period of time, it can be a decent short-term strategy for combating keto-induced fatigue.
Another option is take caffeinated keto-friendly protein powder. Ancient Nutrition’s caffeinated keto protein is a good option for this.
This keto-friendly protein powder fights the early-keto energy slump with caffeine, ashwagandha root, and more.
- Protein Powder
One of the biggest criticisms of ketogenic diets is their reliance on a high level of fatty foods. While a healthy diet absolutely needs some level of fats, some argue that the ketogenic diet takes fat consumption to the extreme.
In response, some variations of the keto diet reduce the fat intake and increase protein intake. This can be accomplished through selecting lean, protein-rich foods, such as turkey or nonfat dairy, or through supplementing with protein powder.
In addition, studies have indicated that increasing protein intake can help with managing appetite and increasing weight loss.25The effects of high protein diets on thermogenesis, satiety and weight loss: a critical review.26Effects of a high-protein ketogenic diet on hunger, appetite, and weight loss in obese men feeding ad libitum.27Dietary protein, weight loss, and weight maintenance.28Systematic review of randomized controlled trials of low-carbohydrate vs. low-fat/low-calorie diets in the management of obesity and its comorbidities. Since many people on ketogenic diets have fat loss as a primary goal, this makes supplementing with keto-friendly protein powders a popular option.
This blend of grass-fed whey isolate, collagen, butter, and pure C8 caprylic MCT is the prefect keto protein powder.
How to Take Keto Protein Powder
Once you’ve picked the best keto protein powder for your goals, you’ll need to figure out your dosage and timing. Here’s some helpful information.
How Much Protein to Take
- For Building Muscle
On a regular diet, for those wanting to build muscle mass, research has shown that it’s best to consume 0.73 to 1.1 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight daily (or 1.6 to 2.4 grams per kilogram of weight).29A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of the effect of protein supplementation on resistance training-induced gains in muscle mass and strength in healthy adults30Do athletes need more dietary protein and amino acids? The more you work out, the more you’ll have to lean toward the higher end of that scale.
However, this isn’t always possible on some ketogenic diets, which often limit protein to 20% of your total daily intake. For those who find this to be too low, it may be helpful to try a high-protein ketogenic diet, which typically allow up to 35% or 40% of your daily macronutrients to come from protein.
To build muscle with a keto-friendly protein powder, we recommend taking Isopure’s low-carb whey isolate for its high protein content.
- For Weight Loss
For those maintaining a regular ketogenic diet, it probably won’t take much extra effort to hit your ideal protein goals. Research has shown that 0.36 to 0.73 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight is ideal for fat loss (or 0.8 to 1.6 grams per kilogram of bodyweight).31A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of the effect of protein supplementation on resistance training-induced gains in muscle mass and strength in healthy adults32Dietary protein intake and human health. This range will usually be struck naturally when maintaining your keto macronutrient ratios.
To promote weight loss, we recommend Isopure Infusions’ light and fruity whey protein isolate.
When to Take Your Protein
- For Building Muscle
For those wanting to build muscle mass, research has shown fairly conclusively that the best time to take a protein supplement is right after each workout. These studies have shown that taking protein right after workout has a whole slew of benefits beyond simply increasing muscle mass.
Benefits of post-workout protein:
- Boosted muscle protein synthesis (muscle tissue building)33Reduced resting skeletal muscle protein synthesis is rescued by resistance exercise and protein ingestion following short-term energy deficit.34Regulation of Muscle Glycogen Repletion, Muscle Protein Synthesis and Repair Following Exercise
- Increased muscle mass over time35A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of the effect of protein supplementation on resistance training-induced gains in muscle mass and strength in healthy adults
- Improved glycogen production and storage (a form of muscle energy)36Early postexercise muscle glycogen recovery is enhanced with a carbohydrate-protein supplement37Postexercise protein-carbohydrate and carbohydrate supplements increase muscle glycogen in men and women
- Increased strength and performance levels38THE EFFECT OF A CARBOHYDRATE AND PROTEIN SUPPLEMENT ON RESISTANCE EXERCISE PERFORMANCE, HORMONAL RESPONSE, AND MUSCLE DAMAGE39Timing of postexercise protein intake is important for muscle hypertrophy with resistance training in elderly humans
- Decreased muscle damage40Effect of milk-based carbohydrate-protein supplement timing on the attenuation of exercise-induced muscle damage
- Decrease delayed-onset muscle soreness41Acute milk-based protein–CHO supplementation attenuates exercise-induced muscle damage
Building and maintaining muscle mass is incredibly important for both men and women. As muscle is some of the most calorie-hungry tissue, it has a lot of metabolism-boosting potential—even at rest. For more information, you can read our guide on the Top 20 Best Protein Powders for Women.
- For Weight Loss
For those wanting to lose fat, the best time to take protein is still right after each workout. As briefly touched on, building muscle mass will help with increased calorie consumption at rest. This, in turn, helps with weight loss.
For those that don’t work out, it’s best to take protein in between meals. Research has shown that this helps with boosting fat loss more than taking protein with meals.42Effects of protein supplements consumed with meals, versus between meals, on resistance training–induced body composition changes in adults: a systematic review

The joy and laughter it brings to family and friends truly make this show binge-worthy. But what if I were to tell you that The Office is not really the comedic show you all know and love? While it’s true that Pam and Jim’s heart-throbbing love story and all of Michael’s “That’s what she said” jokes are some of the many things that make this show so incredibly enjoyable, there is, without a doubt, a different meaning behind The Office. The only question is, what is The Office really trying to tell us?
There is reason to believe that there are already people who know the true meaning behind The Office. Who are these people you ask? Well, they are none other than our very own Jamesville Dewitt High School P.E. teachers. Last year, the gym teachers showed clips from The Office to their classes. One clip was of Dwight Schrute testing his co-workers on the safety protocol in case of a fire. The other clip was of Dwight butchering a CPR dummy trying to keep it alive. They claimed that it was to educate their students on CPR and what to do in case of a fire. But obviously that couldn’t have been their real intent. They most likely were trying to convey to their clueless students what The Office really means.
Sophomore Cielo Marintez quotes, “I was suspicious of The Office when I first saw it. No way could Jim and Pam’s love story be that perfect and not have a catch to it! After the gym teachers played those clips during class, I knew for sure that The Office wasn’t really the comedic show that everyone makes it out to be.” It was then that she ran off to rewatch Jim propose to Pam for the hundredth time so she could cry over how romantic and perfect they are together once again.
Who else knows the real meaning of this show? Are there other teachers that have tried to tell us what The Office really means? What secrets is this show hiding? So far there have been no theories as to what the real meaning of The Office is and some may believe I am just spewing out nonsense, but the truth will come out, and when it does, I will be able to say to you all, “I told you so!”Online Gambling Strategy – HOW EXACTLY TO Put More Money Into Your Pocket
Online Gambling Strategy – HOW EXACTLY TO Put More Money Into Your Pocket
Online gambling is any kind of gambling conducted over the internet. This includes casinos, live casinos and internet 라이브 카지노 sports betting. The very first online gambling site opened to the general public, was ticket selling for the first Liechtenstein International Lotto in October 1994. Since then there have been several other sites which have become integral parts of the web gambling experience. So long as these sites continue to exist there will be an ongoing interest generated by the general public in this form of gambling.
To be able to understand the selling point of online gambling you must look at its relative ease of availability and easy access. Gambling can be easily accessed from all over the world, as long as a computer with internet access is available. In addition easy access is afforded to people who are either very computer savvy or get access to credit cards and bank accounts. In this manner online gambling provides a gateway to easy access to potentially profitable gambling opportunities. The more easy it is to get and access gambling opportunities the simpler and more appealing the prospect becomes.
Another key factor that contributes to online gambling’s appeal is that there are various types of gambling on the Internet. There are casinos, sports betting, lotteries and racing, and other forms of online gambling. Online gamblers have the easy access that they need to be able to explore all the possibilities that are offered in their mind.
Online gamblers can choose the type of online gambling that attracts them, and they can perform so without fear of intrusion by physical persons, and physical property. You can find no real-time restrictions or identification required when you gamble on the Internet. The truth that online gambling has no physical locations does not necessarily mean that there are no regulations or laws connected with online gambling. Gambling is legal in some states, and illegal in others. A simple internet search can show you what the laws in your town are.

Discussion about this postI have had a good relationship with JWLabs since 2001. I had researched Rife Technology for years and discovered Rife used Hertz frequencies created with an analog device. Using this information, I went online to search for someone who used the same technology as Rife. After a few conversations I purchased a real large hertz frequency generating machine [Model B] with a catalog of frequencies from JWLabs. The machine worked great and I still have and use it. I recently received my model A-4 with all the sessions stored on board. The new A-4 makes it so easy to use….
Check out the Tactio® feature, taking music you listen to, (hertz frequencies) and playing the music frequencies directly into your body….I personally do not know of any other Rife devices that are as technically advanced and easy to use and purchasing said device from a more honest and caring company than JWLabs. JWLabs is the only Company that I know of that offers a lifetime of support with a life time warranty on your device.
Thats all I have to say,
Thank you for such a wonderful device.When it comes to certain things, I am incredibly indecisive. I spend entire days with clothing in my online shopping bin without ever clicking “Check Out.” I think about big life decisions longer than I should, weighing pros and cons until each list is perfectly even and I’m back at square one. I occasionally waver over which treadmill I want at the gym.
However, there is one thing that gives me comfort as I make a choice. It is something I’ve been told by my (infinitely wise) mother when I’m standing at a crossroads… or a bakery counter. And I will say it to you as you gallop towards the looming May 2nd deadline:
You cannot make a wrong choice.
“Preposterous!” you say (if you’re like 80). “Absolutely untrue!” But it is true. Hear me out:
If you are reading this blog post it is because you have options – good ones. And if that’s the case, there are no wrong choices, just different ones. Sure, you will make different friends at College X than you would at College Y, you may end up majoring in something different and even end up on a different career path. But that doesn’t mean one of those paths is good and the other is bad. In the end, you make your experience what it is, at either place. Whichever school you choose, you will ultimately (through effort) meet people and find friends you connect with. You will explore course options and choose a schedule that seems interesting and challenging. You will reach out to professors and mentors to find research opportunities, internships, and clubs to join. And that will be true anywhere.
I hope this doesn’t make this choice seem insignificant or small – I mean only to take some pressure off of you this month. You will be happy no matter where you go, because at each of the schools on your list, there are interesting people, cool classes, and fun and challenging opportunities. And wherever you go, you will continue to be you - and you will find friends, grow and change, and learn so much at your future home, wherever that may be. So all you can do at this moment is gather information, trust your gut, and make a choice. After that, don’t worry if you made the wrong one. You didn’t. Because there’s no such thing, remember?

On Friday, the Vancouver-based company reported overall revenues of US$10.6 million (CAD$14.2 million), up from US$8.7 million (CAD$11.6 million), the year prior. Overall revenue in the first half of fiscal 2020 climbed to US$23.4 million (CAD$31.3 million), from US$19.4 million (CAD$26 million) the year prior. As with prior quarters, Thunderbird said growth at Atomic Cartoons, which opened an LA studio earlier this year, was the reason for the revenue uptick.
Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA fell to US$600,000 (CAD$800,000), from US$1.1 million (CAD$1.5 million) in Q2 of the previous year, which it attributed to the timing of revenue recognition of an animation series, as well as a number of distribution contracts in Q2 2019 that had no comparable in the most recent quarter. Consolidated net losses were US$1 million (CAD$1.4 million) for the quarter, compared to net losses of US$4.5 million (CAD$6.1 million) a year ago.
During an investor call on Monday, Thunderbird CEO Jennifer Twiner McCarron said the Atomic Cartoons was in production on 14 animated TV series during the second quarter, including Hello Ninja (pictured) for Netflix, Molly of Denali for WGBH/ PBS KIDS and CBC, 101 Dalmatian Street for Disney+, and LEGO: Jurassic World for NBCUniversal.
Atomic will also be providing the animation for a new Netflix and Spin Master CG-animated series Mighty Express (52 x 11 minute). Debuting in September, the show hails from British writer and producer Keith Chapman, who also created PAW Patrol.
Outside of its animation business, Thunderbird premiered four proprietary series in January: Kim’s Convenience (CBC), High Arctic Haulers (Discovery Canada), Heavy Rescue: 401 (Discovery Canada) and $ave My Reno (HGTV Canada), with the latter receiving a season-four renewal last month.
Elsewhere in the quarter, Thunderbird said it paid down the remaining US$1 million (CAD$1.4 million) of a three-year non-revolving term loan that it initially drew in July 2018 in the amount of US$4.5 million (CAD$6 million).

One thought on “Italian Hoagie Dip”
Best dip I’ve had in a long time. I love hoagies!Boost your libido and enhance your sexual life. Improve your relationship quality with our testosterone therapy.Sexual desire is an instinctual force. While sexual intercourse is necessary for procreation, it is also a vital and pleasurable part of adult human relationships. Each person’s desire for sex is influenced by three main factors:
- Biological
- Social
- Psychological
A problem with any or all of those factors can lower one’s libido, or sex drive. A fourth factor concerns the physical aspect: being overweight or obese can also lead to low libido.
Low libido decreases the desire for sex, but it does not have to sound the death knell on intimate relationships. Hormone replacement therapy — in the form of estrogen and/or progestin for women, and testosterone for men — can remedy the situation. The drugs are available on prescription from your doctor.
Replacement Therapy for Women
A great many peri-menopausal, menopausal and post-menopausal women suffer from low libido that is caused by the changes in hormonal levels at/or around the time of menopause. Younger women who have had hysterectomies/removal of the ovaries will oftentimes experience menopausal symptoms and the attendant waning of sexual desire too.
In such cases, doctors may prescribe HRT to compensate for the lower levels of estrogen and progesterone. The drug is available in many forms, to include pills, trans-dermal patches and creams. HRT helps to decrease vaginal dryness, and it also increases sexual desire. Testosterone Therapy for Women Libido.
Furthermore, increased estrogen levels help to return muscle mass to pre-menopausal levels, and that should help with weight loss if you follow a weight-loss plan and exercise program.
Replacement Therapy for Men
There is not a male version of the menopause but, after age 30, a man’s testosterone levels decrease by one percent each year. A low level of testosterone is known as hypogonadism, and symptoms typically include:
- Erectile dysfunction
- Low libido
- Anxiety
- Depression
- Muscle loss
- Weight gain: typically around the abdomen
- Infertility
If your testosterone levels are not at optimal levels, you do not have to suffer in silence with any of the above symptoms. You can undertake Testosterone Therapy for Libido. Your doctor can prescribe testosterone supplements to augment the amount in your body.
Testosterone is not available in pill form, but can be administered via:
- Injections
- Patches
- Implants
- Gels
Many men on Testosterone Therapy for Libido claim to have regained their lost youth. You, too, can once again enjoy lasting and fulfilling sexual relationships.
You will see improvements in your body’s muscle mass, and your abdomen will certainly shrink. Along with a renewed sense of vitality, your mood will improve and anxiety will be diminished.
As a final thought, hormonal therapy may not be advisable for certain individuals. However, for most adult male and female patients, replacement hormones are viable treatment options that can lead to feelings of improved sexual well-being and a more positive body image.“We welcome today’s decision by the Reserve Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee to maintain the repo rate at 7% as it provides some relief to consumers dealing with rising food inflation and taxes”, says Bruce Swain, CEO of Leapfrog Property Group...
Retail Sales growth tends to be more cyclical than overall economic growth, outperforming the latter in good times, but often underperforming economic growth in tougher times.
The residential property market has had its ups and downs during 2016 as the economy stagnates, the Reserve Bank started hiking interest rates again and consumers struggle with household debt-to-income.
While political and economic uncertainty is likely to continue across the globe next year (2017), it is hoped that local economic growth will be modestly stronger, which will be more supportive for the South African housing market, says Dr Andrew Golding, CE of the Pam Golding Property group.
Quarterly property statistics released by ooba, South Africa’s largest bond originator, show that residential property price growth is slowing as the supply of residential property outstrips purchasing demand.

Abstract
Neuromuscular changes occur with aging, contributing to a decline in mobility and performance. The underlying cause of changes in gait and mobility limitations is a decrease in muscle function. However, additional factors like strength, balance, joint mobility, and fatigability can together lead to dynamic gait adaptations. Although there are numerous causes of muscle loss, including aging, evidence suggests physical activity can attenuate and possibly reverse these losses. With the significant economic cost associated with aging ($50 billion spent on non-fatal falls in 2014) and physical cost associated with aging (at least 30% of adults ≥65 report difficulty walking), there is a need for research focus to be placed on extending healthy life , or health-span, the part of one's life when they are in good health. The effect of an active lifestyle later into life as a preventive measure for age-related declines has been well defined for general health, but less is known about the influence on movement health. Specifically, with the increase in participation by older adults in endurance events, research is needed to evaluate how exercising throughout the life-span can affect the aging process and the injury risk of these individuals. Therefore, the purpose of this dissertation was to investigate the role of an active lifestyle on altering the progression of age-related gait changes. By following with a series of studies to assess the interaction of aging and 1) exercise modality, 2) fatigue, and 3) running, on locomotion we were able to identify similarities in gait mechanics in active older adults and young runners that may be the result of an active lifestyle.

Well, it looks like "29 Faces in September" has creeped into October (or should I say "Blogtober"?)...
This weekend, while I was painting (on walls, not faces), I did something funky to my neck. Sitting at my painting table for more than 5 minutes at a time is unbearable, so this is where I currently am...
The start of Larry - phthalo blue
(I bet you can guess who's next!)
My "Curly" underpainting is complete, I started "Larry" (but had to stop), and "Moe" will just have to wait... The Stooges are funny,
but the pain in my neck? Not so much.
I'm hoping to be back at my painting table soon, but in the meantime I leave you with a quote from "Twenty Five":
"Life is what happens while you are busy making other plans."
-John Lennon
p.s. It's "Blogtoberfest", so please check back tomorrow for a post that answers lots of questions I've been getting about my underpaintings.
Sorry about your neck, i just started having weird pain in my hip but sitting doesn't hurt, standing up does! Good luck, can't wait to hear more about these underpaintings!
Hope you are back in fit condition soon, Kristin. Your paintings of the 3 Stooges are wonderful. They would be surprised. but I am sure would have something humorous to say about the colors.
Sorry to hear about the neck, darn! Feel better soon!
Ouch!! Hope you are back in shape soon!!
Oh dear!! I hope your neck is better soon.
I truly admire your artwork, and the artistry you possess. You are amazing.

Paper type: Social concerns,
Words: 955 | Published: 04.06.20 | Views: 182 | Download now solved by the NAACP, it had one main goal that branched off to many successes. As stated in the 1st paragraph, their main goal was equality for all those people. Naturally , this was aimed at racial equal rights more than nearly anything. In their article, NAACP, Richard Foner and John A. Garraty discuss the early drives that the NAACP tried to execute. “¦NAACP dedicated to legal tactics designed to are up against the important civil privileges issues during. They required federal anti-lynching laws and coordinated several challenges to state-sponsored segregation in public colleges, an effort that led to the landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown sixth is v. Board of Education, which usually declared the doctrine of ‘separate nevertheless equal’ to be unconstitutional. inches Eric and John not merely described various achievements pertaining to the NAACP but how they went about achieving all those missions. Additional important desired goals for the NAACP vary from establishing solid communities to building reforms. In fact , the group manufactured nine reforms to advance possessing. Number one was to ensure nondiscriminatory lending. Number two was to assure a strong and autonomous customer financial safety bureau. The 3rd is support the government role in the secondary home loan market that also serves to protect the interests of homebuyers. Amount four is usually support risk retention while adopting a knowledgeable residential home loan rule that will not decrease homeownership opportunities. “” is to choose a qualified home loan definition that will not shut out most prospective minority homeowners. Quantity six is usually to provide continuing and improved funding pertaining to certified real estate counselors. Quantity seven much more assistance to help those persons devastated by the foreclosure problems. Number eight is any kind of institution managing your money must increase mortgage loan principal reductions tied to current home beliefs. Last but not least, quantity nine is usually to enhance national efforts to finish housing discrimination. I got this information from a duplicate of the unique copy with the NAACP’s 9 Reforms to progress Home Ownership. This group distributed the promo of municipal rights and was a important role in the ending of discrimination and segregation in the us.
The NAACP had many efficient methods to undertaking what they wanted in the most effective way possible. The members through this association would not back down by a challenge, giving them numerous victories in many areas. Etta Keep supports this kind of statement in her article, National Relationship for the Advancement of Colored Persons. “The NAACP’s political proposal has garnered numerous victories such as the moving of anti-lynching laws in certain states as well as the Brown vs . Board of Education circumstance, making education segregation illegal, and continue to be influence the issues of social and ethnicity injustices. inches Etta not only supports my own claim, although she gives examples to seal the offer. The NAACP uses the constitution against its foes and makes certain to have the wisest people about to back up and prove all their point and why it is valid. These kinds of grow to be much larger things, such as the Brown v. Board of Education. It had such accomplishment making units between equally black and white-colored people, this represented a variety of views and political standpoints. If you can aspecto an army of one-sided persons versus an army of people who more unorthadox methods of funding, each in their own several way, you will find that the military with the more robust thinking power will outlive the one-sided army ten out of ten instances. The NAACP was the armed service with the spectacular capability to think, this is the reasoning behind all their many victories resulting in the gain of equality and the end of segregation.
It is possible to say that the NAACP has already established some great successes. The Brownish v. Plank of Education is considered the biggest court instances during the municipal rights age. This was the start of the end of public and legal segregation. There were the number of Detrimental Rights Works passed in support of the initiatives to stop segregation. Act of 1860 helps to protect colored people from splendour due to race. The Take action of 1871 protected coloured people coming from terrorist organizations, such as the Klu Klux Klan. The Action of 1875 prohibited the denying of service to coloured people because of their race. Multiple Acts were put in place to fill most loopholes avoiding colored people to vote due to their race. All of these acts allowed colored visitors to be effective in personal events and also have a claim in their nation. The Montgomery Bus Bannissement got the NAACP in a lawsuit that went to the Supreme Courtroom. The Supreme Court decision was together with the NAACP, providing them with more and more self confidence as time goes on. The Sit-in Motion allowed 1000s of students to protest with out violence, thanks to the first four who chose to take action.
The NAACP acquired many opponents and handful of, to probably none, were organized. Obviously, the Klu Klux Klan had many difficulties with the success of the NAACP nevertheless at that point, there were laws to avoid them by acting on this. Just because there were laws, would not mean that the KKK did not react, it absolutely was simply against the law when they would.-  nails. Watched chick flick. Did interview for secret project.

PlayStation 2
Review by CelticWhisper
Reviewed: 06/15/07
Alis Landale is turning over in her grave.
First off, I want to specify that I bought this as an addition to my console RPG collection to be played as a single-player game. I will not be reviewing online mode here as I have not played it.
I've been a fan of Phantasy Star for about 15 years, give or take a month or two. I was introduced to the series by its "black sheep," Phantasy Star III and have since played every installment with the exception of PS Gaiden and PS Adventure which, to my knowledge, were never released in the States. After playing Phantasy Star Online for the GameCube, I found myself wanting the series to go back to its roots: long, intricate plots; character-driven story progression; a milieu that's a fusion of high technology and swords-'n'-sorcery, et cetera. When I heard about Universe, that it would have a "Story mode" with real characters and a definite plot, I hoped for the best.
I was sorely disappointed. Now, this is not just nostalgia talking: I enjoyed Phantasy Star Online for what it was and acknowledged that there would be some differences. However, at its core, it still had a certain je ne sais quoi that made it feel like a Phantasy Star game. Phantasy Star Universe, entirely apart from not feeling like a Phantasy Star game at all, is just plain bad.
First, the few redeeming factors the game can claim in its favour:
Graphics:
Graphics, for the most part, are decent. Not stellar, but cities feel large, character models have a good degree of detail, and spell and weapon effects look nice. Probably the best thing I can say about the graphics is that the game makes good use of a vivid and varied colour palette. Unfortunately, the explorable portions of many of the game's locales aren't nearly as vast as the designs would lead one to believe, and the largest explorable city in the game, the GUARDIANS Colony, suffers from having a more confining visual design and also from being frustratingly fragmented into 5 "tiers," with load times between each one.
Sound:
Music in the game, while not nearly as subtle and atmospheric as PSO's, nor as catchy and memorable as the tunes from the classic Genesis installments of the series, is good. There are a few dungeon themes that I would consider listening to outside the game, and field music tends to complement the settings and action well. There are a few tunes that get irritating in short order, namely those that occur when the player is required to utilize a special transport of some kind, but luckily they're few and far between.
Sound effects are generally good. Guns sound like guns, explosions sound like explosions, monster roars are appropriately menacing. However, there are some glaring issues here that must be addressed. Sword sound effects are a huge step backward from PSO. Gone are the Star Wars-like lightsaber hum sounds from PSO's energy weapons. They have been replaced by high-pitched, tinny-sounding whooshes and hisses that sound unimpressive at best and are physically painful to hear at worst. Compounding the problem of lackluster sword sound effects, weapon impact sounds seldom differ from the same flat "smack" or bass-heavy "boom." Again, this is not to say that explosive weapons don't sound appropriate, but a little variety would have been nice, and being run over by a charging beast sized at about 5 times the mass of the main character should produce more fitting sounds than an empty-sounding slap. I got the impression that Sonic Team really cut corners when it came to developing sound effects for the game's combat sections.
The worst offense, however, is one many players may be fortunate enough never to run across. Should one make the grave mistake of giving the main character magical skills to use, he will yell and scream loudly with every casting. If his vocalizations were primal roars of unbridled magical fury and rage boiling within him, there would be no problem. However, as it is, he sounds more like a pubescent 14-year-old yelling at a bus-stop bully to give him back his hat. There is no way to turn this off aside from simply not developing the main character as a magic-user. Stick to melee and projectile weapons if you don't care to hear failed Bruce Lee impersonations hundreds of times per mission.
Having credited the game for its accomplishments, it is time to move onto the game's shortcomings which, much to my dismay, are far more numerous, extensive, and severe.
Story:
Another reviewer here at GameFAQs noted that the game has a throwaway plot. I agree with this assessment, but would like to take it a step further. Not only is the plot uninspired and not only does it fail to engage the player, it's poorly developed on top of it all. It consists of entities called SEEDs wreaking havoc around the solar system as a result of experimentation on particles called A-Photons. The technobabble runs pretty high sometimes, and is seldom explained beyond a sentence or two on what it's possible applications or benefits are. There is also the Communion of Gurhal, a religious organization seemingly thrown in to provide a token church, to make for dramatic conflict between the heroes and yet another uncooperative authority, and a contrived reference to classic PS in the form of the Adjective Noun Name character Light Master Rutsu, whose name and demeanor implies that he is supposed to remind one of the Reverent Lutz, leader of the Espers of Dezolis. A pity, then, that the once-great wizard is reduced to little more than the church's political figurehead. Seldom do we see him wield any impressive magic as Rune Walsh did in PSIV, and for a reference to an all-knowing sage, he's pitifully short-sighted and narrow-minded when it comes to helping out the protagonists.
The story takes its time getting up to speed, which is not a good thing in this case as once the main story thread gets underway, it's over almost as quickly as it began. It all begins with an attack on the hero's city which finds him and his sister in some hot water, only to be rescued by an organization called the GUARDIANS. The GUARDIANS' role in the society presented by the game is never really explained, but I get the impression that they're less mercenaries a la the Hunters' Guild of PSIV and PSO, and more protectors and servants a la the Jedi of Star Wars. Inspired by the GUARDIANS' heroism in his rescue, the main character, Ethan, decides to join them. The next several hours of the game detail his experiences in GUARDIANS training and, in doing so, introduce a few more supporting characters and the beginnings of the story proper. After Ethan graduates from training, the mission to rid the Gurhal system of the SEEDs begins. It largely consists of traveling to the three planets: Moatoob, Neudaiz, and Parum, and activating reactors which, once activated, will transport the SEEDs to another dimension. If this sounds strained and contrived, it's because it is.
I was excited to hear that a PS game was being produced that was going to be story-centric and character-driven. After having played it, I long for the openness and ambiguity of PSO. Its paper-thin but quirkily acceptable plot stood well out of the way and let the gameplay shine. PSU's uninteresting, derivative, and woefully bland plot stands right in the way of enjoying the game and makes a veritable Pythonesque Black Knight of itself. Even after finishing the game, I can hear it screaming "Come back here and take what's coming to you! I'll bite your legs off!"
Characters:
Seldom when playing through an RPG am I asked to tolerate characters who are as flat, uninteresting, plain old stupid, uninspired, derivative, or otherwise as irritating as those who make up the cast of Phantasy Star Universe. Well, here I have been asked. In fact, the proverbial gun has been put to my head and I have had demands made of me to swallow these characters.
The lead protagonist, Ethan Waber, is easily the worst main character in Phantasy Star history. Flitting from dense to overconfident to confused to angry back to overconfident and right on down to dumb as two bags of bricks, sometimes all within 10 minutes, his character implements aspects of just about every archetype in existence and yet falls cleanly into none of them, perhaps with the catchall exception of "Irritating anime character that reminds you of people you knew back in high school." For someone who claims to want to be a warrior to protect the people he cares about, he is a world-class space cadet, needing every last detail of every situation explained to him in terms a four-year-old child could understand. There are better ways to develop a plot and present it to the player than by anticipating (wrongly, I might add) every stupid question they may have, and then answering them when asked by the idiot hero. Ethan as a character grates on every nerve he can, and Ethan as the player's in-game avatar is an insult to the player's intelligence.
However, the atrocities don't stop there. The next character we meet is Lumia, Ethan's little sister. It's interesting to note that the last time a main character had a sibling in a Phantasy Star game, which was the case in Phantasy Star 1, he (Nero Landale) died within the first 5 minutes of the game, which gave the game's heroine her motivation for undertaking her grand quest in the first place. Maybe Lumia is nostalgia in disguise, as I certainly wanted to see her shot out of an airlock within the first 5 minutes of Phantasy Star Universe. Again it seems the game is borrowing from anime cliches. Note to the script writers: "annoying little sibling" characters are not endearing or funny. They are, as their stereotype so plainly states, annoying. The one possible plot point that could have salvaged Lumia, which is her desire to join the GUARDIANS late in the game, was thrown away when she found out that boo-hoo, she wasn't old enough. So rather than showing the main character's sister undergoing the same hardships and tribulations that the main character did, a plot element that if done correctly would have enriched both Ethan and Lumia's characters and provided some nice full-circle development, we're instead treated to a despondent little girl who bemoans the cruelty of her youth, and then cheers right back up with a few "inspiring" sentences from big brother. It's unpleasantly reminiscent of the kid who's too short to ride a roller-coaster at a theme park, and then transitions (as only kids can do) from crying to cheering when promised cotton candy.
After Lumia, we're "treated" to Ethan's friend Hyuga, whom I suspect to be a veiled nod to Hugh of PS2, but who is far more pompous and pigheaded than the scholarly biologist who accompanied Rolf in his quest to defeat Mother Brain in A.W. 1284. Part socially-inept dreamer and part womanizer with a dash of pedophile thrown in for good measure (I wish I were making this up, but the man starts putting the moves on Lumia when he's visibly 10 years her senior, another plot point that inexplicably vanishes 3 hours later into the game), Hyuga is intended to be a somber counterpoint to Ethan's exuberance. To those who are familiar with the medical drama "House M.D.," Hyuga plays the game's version of Dr. Chase to Ethan's (considerably more whiny, though I didn't think it possible) Allison Cameron. A pity that there was no suitable version of Greg House himself to slap them both around in an hour-long cutscene.
The nearest we get to such a stern mentor comes in the form of the two "teacher" characters, Karen Erra and Lucaim Nav. Karen, a Numan/Newman, is Ethan's direct commanding officer and to this point she actually succeeds somewhat. All things considered, Karen is possibly one of very, very few tolerable characters in Phantasy Star Universe. However, any strength she has as a leader is drastically diminished whenever she has to interact with any other character in any position of authority. Put concisely, teacher becomes a doormat. Not once does Karen ever stand up to another character, be they friendly, hostile, or neutral. Military guards, villains, politicians, she "negotiates" with them all rather than putting her foot down and doing what she and the characters came to do. By "negotiating," I mean to say she bends over backwards to meet every demand and desire of those who would stand in her way, all the while accompanied by lightsaber-wielding bundles of muscle and testosterone, and sometimes an android toting a huge plasma cannon. Karen, if you came to save your friends, don't play nicey-nicey with the soldiers restricting access to their location (which happens to be scheduled for a fire-bombing). You explain that you are going to save your friends and they can help you, get out of your way, or find out what the business end of that plasma cannon feels like. For a para-military organization, the GUARDIANS kowtows to the government and military with painfully high frequency. This is certainly not the Hunters' Guild of Pioneer 2, and most definitely not the Guild of Aiedo. To top off the disappointment that is Karen, she turns from (slightly-less-than-)authoritative commander to giggling schoolgirl when she meets her "sister," who in reality is merely a close friend, and whom she hasn't seen for some time.
Oh, but what about the other "teacher" character, Lucaim Nav? Apparently the "headmaster" (though he has no office, insignia, or any other trappings of someone in a prestigious academic position) of the GUARDIANS, he's a kooky old man who, in an effort to "teach" Ethan how to fight like a GUARDIANS (more on arbitrary capitalization and improper use of plurals in a little while), cracks jokes and taunts him as he effortlessly pummels him in training session after training session. Never is he seen teaching a class on strategy in a proper classroom or even teaching any class of more than 3 people. It's just him, Hyuga, and Ethan sparring in an unfurnished room. Boy, I'd love to have his job and be paid a headmaster's salary. Oh, and I might add that his oddball mannerisms and sense of humour are made even more bizarre and inexplicable by the fact that he is an android, a class of character that has historically been perfectly stoical in the Phantasy Star series. Further compounding this incongruity is the fact that Lou, another robotic character in PSU, does exhibit such stoicism. I can think of little other explanation for Lucaim's animated joviality than that Sonic Team simply didn't care about consistency.
The next two characters we meet are Leo and Tonnio. Leo, in addition to Karen, is actually a relatively tolerable character. He's a seasoned fighter who's sensible, friendly, and competent. He doesn't launch into abrupt tirades of moralizing, he doesn't crack awkward jokes at other characters' expense, and he doesn't generally make an ass of himself at every possible opportunity. If I had to name a favourite character, Leo is most probably it. Tonnio, however, is another story. Aside from being involved in an ill-thought-out love triangle between himself, a lady whom he fancies, and a pirate captain (GUARDIANS of the Caribbean, anyone?), he's the game's requisite hothead character and, sadly, lives up to the role with next to no deviation. He's ever boastful and feels the need to constantly remind the other characters of his superiority, apparently owing to the fact that he is able to transform himself into a large beast. Never mind the fact that by the time you meet him, the heroes will have taken down monsters twice his size. He also has some truly bizarre lines, the most memorable of which being an accusation of soullessness made against Lou the CAST. Note that at the point in the game at which he makes this comment, there has been nary a mention of souls or anything like them, and the state of a person having or not having any such defining element of humanity has been, and remains for the rest of the game, a complete non-issue.
Lou herself is a relatively minor character, and my opinion of her is honestly neither here nor there. She has some cool scenes and some awkward moments, but ultimately her presence is neither a detractor nor a net gain for the game.
Finally, rounding off this misfit cast is the game's token Darky McBroodsalot antagonist, Magashi. Magashi is a winged robot from a mysterious organization known as the Endrum Collective. As a villain he is adequately intimidating in his mannerisms and personality, and certainly is shown to harbor malicious intent. The problem I have with Magashi is twofold: First of all, he is horribly inadequately developed. By the end of the game you will know very little about him or his organization, and the final confrontation with him, aside from having an admittedly impressive "Star Wars" style saber duel between him and Ethan, does little to grip the player or make any emotional impact whatsoever. Secondly, Magashi is the game's antagonist. Period. For those who have followed Phantasy Star since its inception, never before has the series had a game wherein the first introduced villain is the villain. From King Lassic to Mother Brain to the myriad villains in PS3 to Zio the Black Magician, there has always been a larger driving Force (no double-pun intended) behind the bad guy's badness. It's been a mainstay of PS plot revelation that once you defeat the current baddie, a new layer of story complexity is revealed, and by the end of the game everything comes together and also fits into the larger overarching series plot. Even PSO, which didn't have a traditional "villain" so much as it had a mystery to solve, followed a similar pattern in slowly revealing an epic scheme. Not so in the case of Magashi: he's the end-all be-all of antagonists in PSU, and he disappoints.
I have saved the worst for last. They're minor characters compared to the likes of Ethan, Karen, and Magashi, but I harbor a very special kind of contempt for characters like this. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you: The Vol Brothers. Well, as much as three completely non-identical people of three different species can be brothers. There's the weaselly leader, the big dumb oaf, and...the other guy, who really seems to serve no purpose whatsoever. The Vol Brothers are the para-antagonists who appear at the most inopportune times to make life tough on the heroes. Even in later parts of the game, when the heroes are considerably more powerful than they were during their first run-in with the VBs, these three cretins insist on showing up to detract from what little gravity the plot has to offer. They serve no purpose to further the plot and are there for...hell, I don't even know why they're there, other than to have another cheap reference to classic PS to try to win favour from the fans of old ("Vol" was an instant-death technique in PSIV). Either that or to make the player understand what it feels like to wish someone a very, very slow, protracted, and agonizing death. Such as being reduced to a pile of wet meat in a giant food processor or something to that effect. They remind me a lot of throwaway villains like Pokemon's Team Rocket or Ed, Ben, and Topo in Brave Fencer Musashi. However, the Musashi characters had the common decency to go down and stay down once defeated in the game's final stretch. If you ever wanted to become an atheist, play Phantasy Star Universe, because the fact that the Vol Brothers are alive and well in the end is irrefutable proof that there is no God.
Miscellany:
So with character this horrid and a plot this thin, can it get any worse? Sources say...yes. There are a few more aspects to PSU that a discerning gamer should know about. First off is the quality of voice-overs. They tried something different from most games here. During the cutscenes, the developers decided to space voice clips closer together to alleviate the stiff, stilted "one at a time" exchanges most other games have during voiced segments. The problem is that while they solved the problem of heated arguments still following a "take turns" pattern, they introduced the problem of everyone talking over everyone else as one character's line finishes and another begins, and the end result is even more unnatural sounding than the one-by-one approach taken in past games.
Another nitpick, albeit a minor one, is the needless and unexplained capitalization of certain key terms. Namely GUARDIANS, SEEDs, and my personal most hated, TECHNICs. It's one thing to have an acronym and explain what it's supposed to stand for. Wild Arms makes a point of doing this and thinking up new meanings for ARMS in each game. PSU, however, considers it appropriate to capitalize WORDS without telling you what those WORDS actually mean. I don't know if it's supposed to sound mysterious, hi-tech, futuristic, or what. The worst of these, however, is "TECHNICs." Previously, Phantasy Star games referred to magic as "techniques," implying that they were more akin to psionic abilities or some other feat attainable by the human body or mind. This was used to its fullest extent in Phantasy Star 4 to distinguish commonplace techniques from true magic, a mystical phenomenon wielded by only a select few. So why the change? For what good reason did they change the adequate, accepted, established moniker of "Techniques" into an all-caps monstrosity?
Finally, item synthesis. Gone are the hunts for special weapons and rare items that so many enjoyed in PSO. In their place is the Synthesis System, a broken version of the item-creation system found in Star Oceans 2 and 3. Rather than challenging the hardest possible enemies and quests to get the best possible superweapons, the player is instead asked to go on easter-egg hunts for materials that can be assembled into weapons or armor. Compounding this problem is the absolutely absurd idea of merchants across the various planets only offering to upgrade their own items or synthesized items, and the needless complexity of weapon ranks (with "S" inexplicably above "A" in the ranking scale when the rest of the scale follows the standard C, B, A progression). In PSO, you had weapons and grinders. A grinder would upgrade a weapon's power up to a certain point. They were usable by the player on the fly. You could pick one up and use it right away on your favourite weapon. They could be used on any weapon. And they came in good, better, and best varieties, varying in their rarity according to their usefulness. Well, ease of use was apparently a four-letter word around Sonic Team's office, and so the intuitive and simple grinding system went out the window in favor of this nightmare of a matching game.
This has been a very long review, and I appreciate your sticking with it. I hope I've been of some help to those pondering whether to buy PSU or go for another game. I'm not saying there's nothing at all to like about this game, just that the good is drastically overshadowed by the bad. If you're looking for the equivalent of a cheesy interactive anime, maybe this game is for you. If, however, you want either a rewarding RPG experience or to relive the glory days of Phantasy Star, look elsewhere. There are plenty of more deserving RPGs out there for the former, and for those interested in the latter, dust off your old Genesis gear and take a walk down memory lane the right way. You'll enjoy it much more.

We read reports that suggested that the Israelis reacted negatively to his warmongering initiative. As usual, we were mislead.

Czech Glass Earrings with sterling silver ear wires
Since she donated a pair of earrings for me to giveaway I thought I’d ask her a few questions and share her answers with you.
What is your favorite rock to work with?
Picture Jasper. I like it because it cuts so uniform and smooth and it’s really pretty. Even though it all cuts the same no two pieces look alike.
Do you have a favorite part of the lapidary process—slabbing, cutting, polishing?
Now that I have a slab saw I like slabbing the best. Once you cut that first end off you’re the first person to have ever seen the inside of the rock. It’s very exciting!
Are you more partial to making one piece of jewelry over another?
I really enjoy making necklaces probably because they are easier since they’re not matched like earrings or sized like rings.
What are you most excited about right now?
I am most excited about lapidary arts at the moment. I have acquired a nice selection of rocks and know some really good pieces are going to come from them.

Sherry WhitakerNovember 23, 2021 at 6:00 pm
Beautiful earrings…talented girls! Thankful for The Blind Pig & the Acorn.
Kimberly MooreNovember 23, 2021 at 3:02 pm
I enjoyed the YouTube video in which Chitter talked about selecting rocks for cutting. You can tell when someone is passionate about something, and she is! Hooray!
GigiNovember 23, 2021 at 2:54 pm
These. Are beautiful and unique. She definitely has many talents. I would love to win these earrings. Happy Thanksgiving to all of you.
Sandra HendersonNovember 23, 2021 at 1:59 pm
Those are so beautiful! She sure has grown in her art form very quickly! As I understand, she seems pretty much self taught! You go girl!
I sure would love to be able to wear these beauties and tell everyone around here about her in Franklin when I’m complimented on them.
ToniNovember 23, 2021 at 1:57 pm
I love rocks, too, and appreciate the hard work and creativity that goes into your jewelry.
Carol J GodwinNovember 23, 2021 at 12:27 pm
I would love to be entered in the giveaway. Lovely work by a lovely young lady.
Ron StephensNovember 23, 2021 at 12:03 pm
I am intrigued by the amazing variety of colors, textures, patterns etc of stones. I think they are more fun to.look for than sea shells. I can just imagine Chitter on a stony or pebbley seashore. I can also (to a lesser degree I’m sure) understand Chitter’s excitement to look inside the rock.
I so glad also that now Appalachian folks can stay in the hills yet have a nationwide business. It would have changed history if that had been possible 75 years ago or so. You three are such great examples of that possibility realized. You all could write a book about how it came to be and I’m sure you already have a market.

Such a gift…revealing the beauty inside something as common as a rock!
Roger GreeneNovember 23, 2021 at 10:39 am
Very generous of Katie to share her creations. She is talented in many ways.
Sharon ColeNovember 23, 2021 at 10:26 am
I would wear them proudly! She is so talented. God given talent. God bless!
CherylNovember 23, 2021 at 10:17 am
Oh, my! These are just beautiful! I would love to be entered in the giveaway! I cherish the beautiful earrings she sent me a while back. Your dear girls are so, so talented – I know you already know that, but they are just precious! I love all of you and hope you all have a wonderful Thanksgiving Day together filled with God’s abundant blessings!
CynthiaNovember 23, 2021 at 10:11 am
I have several pieces of her jewelry and so do my daughters. They’re some of my favorite pieces. Please leave me out of the drawing and let someone who doesn’t have any of her jewelry win these.
Donna BrewtonNovember 23, 2021 at 9:59 am
Thank you for the opportunity to win a pair of very unique earrings. Tipper, never having been to Katy’s ‘Esty store I’m going back to your post and go to the Stamey Store you posted. Gracias one more time.
Kat SwansonNovember 23, 2021 at 9:56 am
Your daughter is following so many Appalachian people that just are able to really SEE the beauty in common things….then, because we are a creative culture, she fashions the things she needs from those things she has in front to her. A wonderful talent.
I loved her comment of being the first to see inside that rock. I was reminded of a thought I had when I was a ridge running , hill climbing , feral child in these old mountains . I was determined to set my feet on odd , sloping pieces of mountain soil or rock . I remember being proud to go where I was so very sure no other person, including my four ugly brothers , had EVER stood before! I thought I was the very first …and remembering some of my treks, maybe I really was!

ShirlNovember 23, 2021 at 9:00 am
Chitter is so talented when it comes to making jewelry and music. I’ve always heard that a person runs a more productive business if they enjoy their job. As much as she loves rocks, it would have to be rewarding to see your own unique design take shape in the form of jewelry.
Janice McCallNovember 23, 2021 at 8:49 am
Love all her jewelry, but since I’m an earring nut, I’m especially drawn to them. So happy for Katie that her business is doing well.
Janet SmartNovember 23, 2021 at 8:48 am
Those earings are beautiful. Chitter is very talented. Thank her for donating it.
PinnacleCreekNovember 23, 2021 at 8:46 am
That is the Appalachian way. It is wonderful when one creates a job out of something they love and have the talent for. This is very unique, and I have followed her love for rocks when she was just collecting them from the creek. I would love to win this. I would be soooo proud of that child, Tipper. I know you all are just busting with pride.
Alma ByrdNovember 23, 2021 at 8:38 am

2 questions for Chitter:
Do you sell your jewelry at your musical shows?
Do you do anything with fairy crosses?
Thanks
TipperNovember 23, 2021 at 10:45 am
Oliver-Chitter’s answers: I only sell at musical performances if invited to by the organization and I would love to try working with fairy crosses but don’t have a large supply of them.
Brad ByersNovember 23, 2021 at 8:11 am
I can attest to the quality of her work. I’ve bought pieces for my wife and for my daughter. The video of her making a pendant just made everything more special.

“Lapidary process” is a new one on me but I’m actually in awe of Stamey Creek Creations. That’s artistic, creative, personally satisfying and beautiful no matter how one looks at it. It’s a wonderful thing to incorporate one’s dreams, abilities and art into a way to make a living. As my favorite chef/ former model says, “It’s a very good thing!”
Denise RNovember 23, 2021 at 7:14 am
I’ve watched your video’s you’ve posted of her working in her jewelry making process. The work she does is amazing and she has quite the talent and know how when it comes to picking her rocks out. The earrings you’ve pictured are beautiful!!!

Miss CindyNovember 23, 2021 at 6:55 am
Katy is one talented girl! I love to watch her working, especially the necklaces. She lays the parts out on her bench for several necklaces at a time and begins placing them together before she start the actual part of forming them together. She works quickly and efficiently! Then she attaches the pieces together to form one necklace at a time!
It is amazing to watch her create! She makes a Grandmother proud!
Wandena SwartzNovember 23, 2021 at 6:53 am
I love her work. I have ordered from her a couple of times! She is the best not just in design but quality and customer service well!

I had no idea Katie made jewelry as we are fairly new to your channel! I looked at her etsy page, and some very nice items pictured there. You have quite a talented family, and we are so enjoying learning about Appalachia! We live in East Tennessee for just over 2 years now, and love it! A blessed Thanksgiving to you and yours.

A strong cast (Armie Hammer, Evangeline Lilly, Greg Kinnear, Gary Oldman) examines the opioid issue from multiple angles – junkies, overdosers, recoverers, dealers, law enforcement, researchers and Big Pharma. It’s not pretty. There’s suspense, however, as you see various storylines careening toward each other and you’re trying to guess which ones are going to make it to the intersection, which ones are (literally) going to die trying, and if it’s possible for anybody to get away clean.
It’s kind of interesting watching a film try to do an autopsy on itself while the body’s still moving. That’s what you get with “Someone Like You” (2001), a rom-com starring Hugh Jackman, Ashley Judd and a strong supporting cast (including Marisa Tomei as the wacky BFF). Judd, perennially jilted, decides to take a scientific approach, deconstructing men’s romantic misbehavior (they’re cows with a hard-wired aversion to monogamy). Pre-Google mistaken identity hijinks ensue. Meanwhile, we’re all sitting there knowing she’s going to hook up with frenemy Jackman in the end (don’t act like I spoiled it – you knew it, too).

What is E-Cigarette? According to a definition, an electronic cigarette is really a device which simulates smoking tobacco. It basically includes a coil, an electrical power source just like a battery, and an atomizer. Instead of tobacco, the smoker inhales vapour instead.
Unlike traditional smoking materials, E-Cigarettes usually do not contain any harmful ingredients and tar. However, they can produce the same kind of effects of smoking cigarettes. Vaping is often referred to as the inhalation of liquid extracted from the lungs rather than the smoke. Inhaling the vapor via an electronic cigarette can also be in comparison to drinking herbal tea or medicine, as the liquid passes in to the bloodstream similar to the way a tea or potion is absorbed by your body.
Lots of people may be concerned about what E-Cigarette is doing to their lungs, in comparison to smoking tobacco. To put it simply, it is not. By all definitions, vaporizing does not harm the lungs in any way, shape or form. Many people may be concerned that the liquid may stay static in the lungs for some time and therefore go directly into the bloodstream. That is also not true.
The vapour made by many of cigarettes is quite like the saliva excreted by your body when one drinks a glass of water or tea. If anything, E-Cigarettes certainly are a safer choice than regular cigarettes for those who want to try to vaporize without causing irreparable harm to their lungs. Even young people that are very health conscious are using E-Cigarettes on a regular basis.
Could it be safe to use an E-Cigarette? E-Cigarettes are much safer than regular cigarettes since they do not contain any nicotine. Nicotine is the addictive ingredient found in cigarettes which makes them addictive. Teenagers are increasingly turning to electric cigarettes instead of regular cigarettes due to lack of nicotine addiction connected with regular cigarettes. Nicotine can be an addictive substance that triggers dependency on its use. Once a smoker is becoming dependent on nicotine, he is more likely to smoke repeatedly so that they can reach the same comfortableness and calm.
There are two different kinds of electronic cigarettes: analogues and digital ones. In analogues, liquid nicotine is utilised inside them rather than the gaseous kind. Digital ones, on the other hand, do not utilise any liquid but store the vapor created in the electronic cigarette unit in a built-in battery.
The effects of what is vaping may vary from person to person. Some people may experience slight to moderate side effects, while some may experience severe symptoms after just one or two uses. The symptoms may include increased heart rate and blood pressure, nervousness, anxiety, vomiting, and several other similar symptoms. These symptoms usually disappear completely once the individual stops smoking entirely.
What’s Vaping? Despite what is being said about how E-Cigs do not contain any harmful substances, it should still be remembered that vapors produced in an electronic cigarette device do have damaging effects on lungs when inhaled. This is the reason why electronic cigarettes are not vapinger’s vaporizing is much different from what is actually addicted to. While what is addictive to many smokers is the chemical element of the drug, what’s considered vaporizing is actually caused by the psychoactive chemical within marijuana, namely tetrahydrocannabinol. This substance is highly addictive as a result of chemical affects it has on the brain. Withdrawal out of this substance is extremely difficult and may take up to per year before complete withdrawal symptoms can be managed.
What is Vaping? There are two forms of electronic cigarettes: the traditional and the choice or long-term type. Conventional is the type that is found in public. Long-term use of the products results to what is called passive smoking. Therefore what is vaped stays in the lungs of the user. This in turn leads to what is called passive smoking, which according to some researchers, is as bad as actual smoking.
What’s Vaping? Experts and researchers have said that what’s vaporizing is not smoking. Hence, what’s quitting smoking isn’t necessarily what’s quitting. What’s stopping vaporizing is basically attempting to quit. A sensible way to stop your crave for nicotine addiction would be to find and use a highly effective method which will help you stop and get rid of your urge to smoke.Must Read: Women Buying Their Own Jewelry Is Impacting Holiday Sales, The Rise of Influencer-Driven Beauty Brands
These are the stories making headlines in fashion on Wednesday.
Women buying their own jewelry is impacting holiday sales
For some time, women have been buying their own jewelry and have stopped waiting on men to make the purchase first. Previously, the holidays were an important time for stores to sell jewelry but because of this paradigm shift, retailers are noticing a decline in annual sales coming from the holiday months of November and December. {Quartzy}
The rise of influencer-driven beauty brands
It seems as though every influencer or celebrity has started their own beauty line and many pose the question of whether or not there are too many and if the products in each collection are distinct enough to stand out from the rest. Ulta Beauty currently carries 600 individual beauty brands on its site, and since Glossier's launch, thousands of direct-to-consumer beauty lines have been created. Because of the rise of influencer-driven brands, the appeal of mass-market brands is declining. {Business of Fashion}
European fashion wins big with major trade agreement
Mercosur, one of the world's most closed-off trading blocs, has just come to an initial free trade agreement, granting access to fashion industries in the EU and South America. The trade agreement will give European brands connections to new customers and allow South American labels entry to the world's largest single market. Though the deal will save billions annually for European businesses, smaller South American labels may struggle in a more competitive market. {Vogue Business}

The appeal of super-high waisted jeans

When you need to spell something, make it harder. Instead of “A as in Alpha, X as in X-Ray” say “A as in are, X as in xenon”.
Here’s a list of possibilities. There are more than one option for each letter. Hopefully they get confused and you need to elaborate. “No, No, not ‘r’, A as in Aisle, A as in Aural.”
There are several tricks here. One is to use homophones like Hour, Our, Are; best used together in the same word. Some are a reference to a different thing that is non-obvious until explained like saying sleep when you mean “ZZZ”. Another is silent letter like “Gnat”. The most common is non-phonetic consonant combinations like “Chasm”.

1. Coverage of Hurricane Katrina's aftermath seems to concentrate primarily on the devastation of New Orleans, a place Mike describes as having descended into a "Hobbesian state of nature." Thomas Hobbes, you'll recall, famously claimed that life in a democracy would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." I stuck a comment on Mike's blog, which I'll reprint here:
This will be an interesting test case for people who are for and against the possession of firearms by law-abiding citizens. It's the case envisioned by the gun advocates: possessing a firearm increases your chance of survival in a hostile environment, or so goes the claim. I'm not really a fan of the frothier wing of the NRA, but I'm willing to listen to arguments from its moderates, and I'm open-minded about gun possession overall.
While there's a lot more to the current disaster than just the firearms aspect of it, I'll be watching how this plays out in the coming weeks.
Will we be seeing instances of frontier justice? I'm hoping not, but as the death toll is taken, I have to wonder how many cadavers will be found sporting bulletholes.
2. Taegu, a city that suffered an immense gas explosion in the mid-1990s and went through a devastating subway fire not long ago, is in the news again thanks to a bathhouse explosion that seems to have claimed several lives. Joel and Nomad have more. Nomad also has some interesting Katrina-related commentary about the sloppy nature of Konglish journalism here.
As I've noted on the blog before, "disaster" is a word whose etymology is linked to the notion of a "bad star (dis + aster)." Both Taegu and New Orleans seem to suffer quite a bit of ill fortune. New Orleans, even in the best of times, has to contend with problems like crime. Taegu, when not suffering natural disasters, still has to worry about the intense summer heat.
Should we start a "sister city" campaign? New Orleans and Taegu, members of the sorority of suffering. Could be a good idea: Koreans need to be exposed to the delights of eating nutria.
UPDATE: I forgot to mention that you should click the Dalma Daesa image on my sidebar. It's for a good cause.
UPDATE 2: In the comments section, the Nomad offers this lovely link to a storm headed Korea's way.

Tortugas Reef is one of Playa del Carmen most popular dive site due to the large amount of sea turtles, which live here. The reef is covered by corals and sponges, where it is common to find king crabs, nurse sharks, angelfish, groupers and tarpons among other type of marine life.

House Republicans are increasingly embracing Donald Trump’s “stolen” election narrative, underscoring the former president’s hold on the congressional GOP and raising questions about what might happen if they return to the majority.
Rep. Steve Scalise (La.), the Republican whip, raised eyebrows a week ago during an interview with Fox News’s Chris Wallace when he declined to say that Biden won last year’s election fairly.
The No. 2 House Repub-lican is far from an outlier.
Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), head of the far-right Freedom Caucus, continues to question the legitimacy of the outcome.
So are a host of Trump’s most ardent allies in the Capitol — including Reps. Jim Jordan (Ohio), Jim Banks (Ind.), Paul Gosar (Ariz.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.) — who have continued to raise questions about poll “irregularities.”
Other GOP lawmakers — like Iowa Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Ashley Hinson — have appeared recently with Trump at public events where the former president has riled the crowd with false claims that he’s the rightful commander in chief. Still others are pressing party leaders to make election integrity a central plank of the 2022 platform, even as many in the party are hoping to turn the page and focus on Biden’s challenges.
It’s little wonder that H-ouse Republicans are backing Trump’s claims, even a-fter they led to the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol that forc-ed their own evacuations.
The former president has spent the 11 months since his election defeat making bold but false claims that the process was rigged by a constellation of corrupt election officials, foreign governments and election technology companies.
Nearly every day, he sends various missives to the press and his supporters to back up his claims of game-changing fraud, for which he’s provided no credible evidence.
Trump’s assertions have been soundly rejected by dozens of courts — state and federal — and election oversight officials of both parties, who have warned of the existential dangers to the country if large numbers of voters lose faith in an election system that stands as the bedrock of its democracy. Still, almost six in 10 Republican voters say it’s “important” for the party to believe Trump won, according to a recent CNN poll.
The Trump arguments — and the following they’ve generated — are also having real-world effects at state houses, where a number of legislatures have taken steps to change the way elections will be held going forward. Trump is pressuring Repu-blicans across the country to not only look into last year’s election, but also make sure future elections are also handled differently.
Trump this week sought to impose more pressure on elected Republicans, warning that GOP voters won’t participate in the midterms if party leaders don’t do more to address the “stolen” election of last November.
“If we don’t solve the Presidential Election Fraud of 2020 (which we have thoroughly and conclusively documented), Republica-ns will not be voting in ‘22 or ‘24,” he said in a statem-ent issued through his deep-pocketed PAC. “It is the single most important thing for Republicans to do.”
The threats have raised alarms about their potential influence on election policy, and could also be problematic for GOP officials seeking to win the House and Senate majorities in 2022.
Trump’s claims about the 2020 election undermined GOP confidence in the system and depressed Republican turnout in two runoff races in Georgia, strategists said, costing the party two seats — and the Senate majority — with victories by Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock.
“We’ve seen how this movie ends. That’s why we have Senators Ossoff and Warnock,” said GOP strategist Matt Gorman, a former National Republican Cong-ressional Committee official. “We need every Repu-blican to turn out next year. The stakes are too high.”
Pressed last week on Trump’s warning, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), the chairman of the House GOP’s campaign arm, quickly downplayed the messaging significance.
“The former president, he’s a private citizen,” Emmer said on the call. “He, of course, is entitled to his own opinion.”
Trump is scheduled to headline the National Republican Congressional Committee’s fall dinner.
“He remains the biggest draw in our party and we are happy he is helping our efforts to fire Nancy Pelosi,” Emmer said.
Trump appears to have his eyes on a presidential rematch in 2024, and the number of people who think he will run for the White house again is growing. But for Republicans h-oping to win back the Ho-use, the focus on Trump is also a double-edged sword.
Trump has been banned from social media, but retains a heavy presence in GOP circles by issuing fiery statements from his home-base of Mara-Lago, while traveling the country frequently to headline rallies and offer much-sought endorsements for GOP candidates, incumbents and challengers alike.
Trump’s animating powers have heartened GOP leaders, who are bullish about their chances of winning the House in 2023 and thrilled to have Trump stirring up the base. But by replaying the 2020 election, the former president is also distracting from the Republicans’ preferred campaign focus, which centers squarely on Biden and the many challenges facing his administration, including the ongoing pandemic, skyrocketing inflation and a migrant crisis at the southern border.
It’s a distraction that Democrats are more than happy to highlight.
“The Republican Party has made it very clear that blind loyalty to Donald Trump’s ego is the only principle they hold fast to,” Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (N.Y.), head of the Democ-rats’ campaign arm, said of Trump’s midterm threat.
The Virginia governor’s race next month could serve as a roadmap for how battleground Republicans deal with Trump in 2022. Trump is both an asset and a curse for GOP gubernatorial nominee Glenn Youngkin: He needs Trump to get out the conservative base, but if he hugs Trump too enthusiastically, Youngkin will alienate independents and lose in a state that rejected Trump in both 2016 and 2020.
Last week, Trump called into a “Take Back Virginia Rally,” bashing Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe and praising Youngkin as a “great gentleman” and “re-ally successful.”
Yet one key person was missing from the rally: Youngkin himself.
It turned out to be a smart decision by Youngkin. The small crowd at the rally recited the Pledge of Allegiance to an American flag that reportedly was flown at Trump’s “Stop the Steal” rally that led to the violent insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6.
Despite his absence, Youngkin was still forced to address the issue, calling it “weird and wrong to pledge allegiance to a flag connected to Jan. 6.”
“As I have said many times before, the violence that occurred on Jan. 6 was sickening and wrong,” he said.Entris

My foot has much less pain but even with crutches I am not walking anything that approaches normally. In spite of all the hype this is clearly not going to get better over night and I resign myself to the fact that it will be a quite few weeks before I am properly walking.We've read you can purchase tickets to the Nippon Professional Baseball League at 7-11. The clerk doesn't understand a word we utter, but a younger Japanese woman behind us responds affirmatively with one word of broken English, "Yes," then leads us by the hand upstairs to the automated kiosk. But does she stop there? Noooooooooo, this is Japan, thus she navigates us through the hieroglyphics, translating as she punches the buttons for us, insuring we get our exact desires. About seven minutes later, we have tickets for tomorrow's Tokyo Giants game.
(Editor's note: "Noooooooooo" is almost always sarcastically negative, not this time)
Based on her blushful, embarrassed reaction to my thanks, I'm concerned If I tried to tip her she might suffer a heart attack. Not wanting to be arrested for murder, I decide to save some money.
The likelihood of a complete stranger overhearing you, and volunteering to spend 7 minutes of their lives performing the identical task in the city of Los Angeles- approaches zero (mathematically speaking.)
The Taxi
The taxi door automatically swings open, the immaculately dressed driver's pressed uniform includes white gloves. Deferential and accommodating, he respectfully bows his head and thanks you after receiving his exact fare. While Japanese find tipping confusing/uncomfortable, failure to tip an American cabbie will often result in him spitting swear words into your face.
Make it Seen
At a Kyoto Temple, I drop my wife's sweater to free my hands to take a photo. After several shooting angles we walk away, leaving it on the ground; ten minutes later she feels a chill. I race back up the trail, scanning the ground, huffing and puffing, doubting I'll find it. To my surprise it's in the most visible place imaginable, nearly eye level on the gate!
Someone picked it up, and intentionally put it in a location the poor sap who lost it would be most likely to see it. Talk about thoughtful. Time and time again, similar occurrences play out.
Sparkling Streets
The streets of Tokyo are as clean as Singapore's, but unlike the harsh penalties used by the SE Asian island nation to discourage litter, Japanese are taught early and often to pick-up after themselves; littering laws are unnecessary.
Omotenashi
Deeply embedded into Japanese culture is "omotenashi-" exquisite politeness with a desire to maintain harmony and avoid conflict.
The needs of an individual are subservient to those of the group/ society at large. No one will push you out the way or cut in front of you. Japanese never brag, especially about themselves. You'll rarely, if ever, witness a public disagreement. No one will rev their Harleys in the middle of the night (please commit hari-kari if you do;) as such behavior is simply at odds with the culture.
While other cultures are of the world are quickly becoming homogenized, Japan remains an island of propriety and self-sacrifice in an ever rising sea of selfish deuchebaggery. When it comes to politeness and hospitality, the land of the rising sun wins the gold, and it's not even close. Take a bow, Japan.

Japanese never brag? I'm guessing you don't speak much Japanese :)
true, only can count to ten and thank someone. But certainly as a foreigner, they seem like the most UN-braggadocio people ever. Very meek, mild mannered and helpful. I'm sure if you live there, they become "more human" ... more "American" as they get to know you. Maybe ego exists in all culture and is just pushed below the surface in some.
I just watched a show on Japan, and, it was like watching a different planet! Their kindness, and willingness to help others was so wonderful. I’m just SO impressed.

The school is currently in the development stages of the program but hopes to have it ready to offer to students for the upcoming Fall Semester.
Recreational marijuana is currently legal in several states and Governor Andrew Cuomo is calling for its legalization in New York.
Jennifer Gilbert Jenkins is an Assistant Professor of Agricultural Science at SUNY Morrisville.
,” she says.
As an Instructional Support Associate for the Horticultural Department at SUNY Morrisville Howard Rice is in charge of the organic farm and hydroponics and aquaponics growing at the College.
Rice tells NewsChannel 9, “They want students who went for horticulture or similar environmental majors because they understand plant growth, they’re not just hiring the guy who was growing in his basement for 10 years, they want the people who understand the science behind it.”
Morrisville is planning to use pieces of its diverse programs in agricultural engineering, science, and business and horticulture to develop a cannabis program.
For starters they aren’t expecting to plant any marijuana but instead use hemp plants, which are very similar to the marijuana plant, as stand-ins to help students to understand marijuana cultivation techniques.
“The main difference is the levels of THC, so the hemp doesn’t have those pyschoactive effects so we can use it as a model for growing marijuana,” Rice adds.
Jenkins says, “We need to be the institution that people think of when they want to learn about this industry.”
The school plans to use its expertise with the hemp plant and indoor farming, which they expect many marijuana growers to use, to help with the Cannabis Industry Minor.Having worked together and independently over several years, we finally merged our talents and our love for design and set up Bode Interiors together over 5 years ago.

Is an Appraisal Required
When you are purchasing a home using a traditional mortgage the lender requires an appraisal on the property to determine the value. The appraisal is used to ensure that the lender is not loaning more money on a property than it is worth.
FHA, VA, USDA, and conventional financing require an appraisal of the property showing the value to be at or above the contracted purchase price.
Independent appraisals also protect the interests of the buyer so that they can be assured that they are not paying an inflated price for the property.
Who Pays for the Appraisal
Traditionally, the buyer pays for the appraisal as part of the mortgage process. In some cases, if a second appraisal is required, payment can be negotiated with the seller.
If the appraised value of the property is determined to be at or above the contracted purchase price, the buyer is not required to share a copy of the appraisal with the seller. Nor are they required to share the appraised value. That information will remain private, between the buyer and the lender.
Appraisal Contingency
What happens when the appraisal is low?
Georgia’s real estate contracts allow for an “appraisal contingency”. This portion of the purchase contract stipulates a timeline for the completion of the appraisal and a course of action should the value be BELOW the contracted price.
Because the appraisal is part of the mortgage requirement, the lender orders the appraisal early in the process to allow for completion and additional negotiations, if needed.
Georgia Association of Realtors Appraisal Contingency
On the Georgia Association of Realtors contract forms the appraisal contingency on a conventional loan reads as follows:
*Appraisal Contingencies on FHA/VA/USDA loans vary slightly. Please refer to your individual contract for more information.
Conventional Loan Appraisal Contingency. In addition to Buyer’s other rights herein, this Agreement shall be subject to the following appraisal contingency. Buyer shall cause the Lender to: (a) select an appraiser to perform one or more appraisals of the Property and (b) provide Buyer with a copy of any appraisal that is for less than the purchase price of the Property. If any such appraisal is for less than the purchase price, Buyer shall within _____ days of the Binding Agreement Date have the right to request that Seller reduce the sales price of the Property to a price not less than the appraised price by submitting an Amendment to Sales Price (F713) (“ATSP”) to Seller along with a copy of the appraisal supporting the lower price. In the event that Buyer does not timely submit an ATSP to Seller, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived Buyer’s right to do so and this Agreement shall no longer be subject to an appraisal contingency.
Seller shall, within three (3) days of the date of an ATSP is delivered to Seller (but not later than two (2) days prior to Closing), accept or reject the ATSP or seek to negotiate with Buyer a lesser reduction in the sales price of the Property than what is reflected in the ATSP. If, within the above timeframe, an ATSP has not been signed and accepted by the Buyer and Seller and timely delivered to create a legally enforceable amendment, Buyer shall have an additional three (3) days (but not later than one (1) day prior to Closing) to terminate this Agreement without penalty. If Buyer does not terminate the Agreement within this timeframe, Buyer’s right to terminate due to the failure to agree to an ATSP shall be waived and Buyer shall close on the Property for the purchase price set forth in this Agreement. Nothing herein shall require Buyer to seek a reduction in the sales price of the Property.
What Happens When the Appraisal is Low
If the value assessed by the appraiser is LESS THAN the contracted price there are several options:
- Buyer can terminate the contract and retain their earnest money.
- A buyer can request that the seller reduce the contract price to an amount EQUAL to the appraised value.
- The buyer & seller can agree on a reduction of the price that is somewhere between the appraised value and the contract price. In this case, the buyer will be required to pay the difference in CASH at closing.
Should the buyer and seller be unable to negotiate and agree to a resolution, the buyer or seller may terminate the contract and the buyer retains their earnest money deposit. The seller is then free to put the property back on the market and solicit new offers.
How to Avoid a Low Appraisal
Sellers
What happens when the appraisal is low?
For sellers, the most common inclination is to list a property for sale at the highest possible price. However, pricing and value can be tricky for many. The best indicator of VALUE is to analyze the most recent sales in your neighborhood of homes that are most similar to yours.
Listing a home above market value can cost you time and money. Spending more time on & off the market with lost contracts because of low appraisals gives buyers the impression that something is wrong with the house or that you, the seller, are difficult to work with.
It’s better to list your home at or slightly below fair market value. This practice generates the most interest from buyers & minimizes your time on the market.
For special properties like farms, large acreages, or unique homes, a pre-listing appraisal is often very useful. You can find licensed appraisers here.
Buyers
What happens when the appraisal is low?
For buyers, it is important to consider that your loan is dependent on the appraised value. Although we are still in a seller’s market and multiple offers are normal, don’t get swept up in a bidding war.
Offering fair market value is always the best course of action if you want to buy a home. Above market offers can cost you money in lost home inspection fees & lost appraisal fees as well as costing you valuable time in a contract that won’t make it to the closing table.
Make sure that your buyer’s agent reviews comparable properties with you when you prepare your offer.
It’s so helpful to know that the appraisal doesn’t have to be shared from the buyer to the seller. My brother is thinking about moving this month so that he lives closer to work. He needs to get an appraisal for his home so that he knows what to list it for so that it sells quickly.L’Oreal Professionnel appoints Twinkle Khanna as their new brand ambassador for India

That’s code for: I am incredibly immature.
This is not to say that I don’t thoroughly enjoy caring for infants. I spent the better part of my teens and college years nannying. For now, however, I will enjoy making cookies and cakes for people about to have babies.
I made these for a baby shower. Probably a boy?
Cute and classic. These taste better than the real ones.
I think I might demand a color scheme of orange for my baby shower. Just to beÂ a jerk. Or olive green?
No seriously though, blue is my favorite color (hullo.. look at my entire blog, duh).
My friend Vanessa is pregnant as well. She is due in June, and has chronicled every moment of itÂ on her Facebook page and blogs. It is not often that I read something and feel the urge to burst into laughter, screamÂ with fear, and impulsivelyÂ google some freakishÂ medical issue I never knew was possible. On a side note, she has two Newfoundlands and writes one blog through their narration. It is brilliant, and her writing puts mine to shame. Well, most people’s writingÂ put my to shame, but still.Â She isÂ witty and poetic. Read it here:
Oh, and this is Vanessa’s otherÂ blog.Â This one is actuallyÂ narrated by Vanessa:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Anyhoo, I traveled to Jersey over the weekend for her baby shower. I was emailing back and forthÂ with aunt ColleenÂ about what to make for the shower. She suggested that I use the theme and go with eggs. I glanced over at the invitation:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Showers frighten me almost as much as having babies, because I am socially awkward and struggle to stay awake while watching someone open infinityÂ presents. So maybe I willÂ just have my shower at an amusement park or something. This shower, however, was awesome. They asked that everyone bring presents unwrapped so everyone could simply walk aroundÂ room andÂ simplyÂ admireÂ the gifts.Â Um…AMAZING.
Â Â Â Â Â Â This was also amazing:
Dear Santa (or Hanukkah bush),
Â Â Â Â All I want for Christmas (or Hanukkah) (okay, or Kwanzaa or whatever else) is a personal mascot. This mascot will be present for every special event in my life, and will transform into different characters accordingly. I hope that you and I can both agree that this will be a much better gift than last year’s coal. And pantyhose.
Sincerely,
Jazzy
Â Â Â Â Â The entireÂ party wasÂ filled with hatching eggs and birds.
Aunt Colleen made these.
I can barelyÂ glue two pieces ofÂ paper together.
I like birdies.
How creative is that?
So I decided to makeÂ cookies and pops (shocking).
I decorated the cookies to resemble the logo on the invitations:
Here they are on display.
Because I am anal, I even added glitter to the crack and the nests to perfectly match the invitation.
Yes, I am a nerd.
I wanted to try something a little different thanÂ the usual cake pops. So I added nests to them as well. Vanessa’s husband, Sandy, took a photo of them before the party using some very neat iPhone app. I have a phone that wasÂ put together by aÂ cavemen, so I wasÂ extremely envious of him.
Here they are on display, ready to be eaten.
UPDATE: I CREATED A TUTORIAL ON HOW TO MAKE THESE IF YOU LIKE.
P.S. I am a dork.
The treats weren’t a total success because I found out that although some women crave food during pregnancy, others lose their taste andÂ feel repulsedÂ byÂ the thought of eating.Â Poor Vanessa. After she has the baby I am going to make her stuffed strawberries.
Phew! I am all babied out.
Those are really cute pops and cookies. I love the egg hatching theme, I have never seen that before. Looks like a really fun sofisticated shower.
Seriously – you are brilliant! Love your Blog, Love your Humor and Love your Cookies… Oh wait – maybe that was a bad choice of words…. Love your Baking!
Those Pops and Cookies are gorgeous – now just if I could coax you to come to Canada to make mine for my Shower in August 🙂 Coming to Vancouver for some Shopping anytime soon?
I am going to attempt cookies or maybe pops {thanks to you} for my shower and hope to do a job as half as good as you!
XO
Tairalyn
I promise once my tastebuds are cooperating again I will do full justice to every cake pop to cross my threshold!
But everyone ELSE loved them, so they WERE a total success – don’t sell yourself short! Thank you thank you again for everything!
Hugs,
Vanessa
oh my….love the cookies and the nests. And the tree with the blue ribbons! Baby Showers are so much fun….but my friend, you are wise to wait. When the time is right, you’ll know it! 🙂
Those are the cutest cake pops I’ve seen out there in Cake Land! And I’ve seen a ton. Very unique. That’s what’s lacking out there. You do great work. By the way what was the iphone app used for the picture taking?
@J I am finding out the name of the app and will update this comment once I have the answer. I am glad you like my pops 🙂
UPDATE: the app is called tilt shift gen. I want an iphone just for that reason alone!
Thanks for getting that for me. It’s pretty interesting. And fun
what a perfect baby shower!You are truly a creative artist when it comes to making cookies and treats. This post really was an enjoyable read.
@kelly, Sure thing I will post on my fb fan page now.
woman! you’re insane. btw.. i made about 150 cake pops recently and i wanted to throw myself in front of a MAC truck!
@panda, Oh it does require the highest level of patience. Good for you for making 150 😉 Good for you for refraining from throwing yourself in front of a MAC truck.
I really enjoyed reading (and laughing) through this post. And what a beautiful baby shower 🙂 Those are gorgeous cookies & cake pops! You are obviously very, very talented! Great job. Great post! Congrats to your friend, Vanessa 🙂
Those cookies look so pretty, even if she couldn’t eat them I’m sure she at least appreciated the effort and artistic talent you put into them. Well done!
these are fantastic!
Thanks Fran 🙂
These turned out SO SO great Jasmin!! Can you throw my next baby shower please? Or at least just bring the dessert? =)
@Candace, I would love to throw your next shower 😉 I do ship cookies btw
Hey there! I’m one of Sandy’s cousins, and I was just reading Ness’s post about the shower (which, sadly, I missed, being stranded in Chicago as I am), and I am in love with those cookies. They’re so beautiful! And the cake pops look great, too, I wish I could have tried them, yum.

@ Harris, I am so sad that we did not get to meet! Thank you and hopefully you can try one of my yummy treats at the next event!
Those are so clever and fabulous!

Teacher In Me
Teacher In Me- As a teacher, I had so much patience, non like others. I was able to take on pretty much anything a child brought on to me, without yelling or being angry. I love doing crazy arts and crafts (even the messiest of them all). Engaging with each and every single child s my school in someways or another was my expertise. I made sure that I took time to engage with each child by recognizing one aspect of them through complaints or encouragements. I wanted to make sure that I was able to bring a smile out of that child. Being a teacher and director was a special job for me.

Mommy in me- I am one of the most strictest person (mom) that I know or at least I think I am. I expect a lot out of my kids, as far as education, listening, and more. I often see myself get easily frustrated at my kids. When they can’t achieve something that I know or I’ve seen them do on their own before, I get upset. After the first or second attempt at giving directions, my voice automatically jumps to 10 pitches higher than where it was. My patience level is no where near where it was when I was a teacher. Being a mom was tougher than I had ever imagined. Expectations of how to be a teacher mom was not going well.
In Between The Two
Sometimes I get disappointed as a mother. The fun loving teacher/director that I used to be seems to be hiding and the mean angry mom keeps coming out. I know that I’ve had to deal with so much in the past 6 years emotionally and physically during both pregnancies of my kids (near death experiences) but I didn’t think it would affect me this much. Don’t get me wrong, the fun educator comes out a lot as well but not as much as I used to or want it to be. I have so many ideas that I could implement but instead of the teacher mode (fun learning environment) the mommy mode of (messy and clean-up) comes out and holds me back from the extra fun activities.
Bringing The Two Together
The ultimate goal is to be a teaching mom, where I can bring both my mom and teacher qualities together and merge them to be the best teaching mom ever. It may take time as I begin to slowly implement the best traits from each but I am confident that I will be able to bring them together. My kids deserve the best and I would love to share my best with them.Channel your inner sports champion with our technical-focused winter sports products, made in collaboration with French skiwear brand ROSSIGNOL.

if these pores become blocked due to excessive sweating then there will be an increase in oil production by special glands located just underneath the surface of your skin, known as apocrine glands. this results in black heads or white heads that can leave unsightly “pimples” on the surface of your face!Best Blades for Cutting Concrete: Which Blade Should You Choose?

Aerocool's Dead Silence is designed to offer ample cooling performance in its small package, so we chose the components to test its mettle accordingly. Given a handful of fairly modern parts, this setup should tell us whether the chassis with two slow-spinning fans works, or if it needs some supplementary help.
We're generating a couple of measurements: first with the closed top cover and then with the open mesh panel. Installing two optional fans would facilitate even better cooling performance, but we were more curious about what the case can do stock. Consequently, we stuck with the two stock fans.
The HIS graphics card we're using is actually a best-case for Aerocool, since it exhausts waste heat out of its rear slot instead of circulating it through the case like so many other boards. Intel's SSD doesn't have a temperature sensor, leaving us with just the disk drive's sensor.
We load the system using a combination of Prime95 (Small FTTs) and MSI Kombustor (Fractal Flame), recording temperatures after 60 minutes.

Here is more about the members of Democracy Alliance. In 2012, Huffington Post said that DA dropped a number of prominent organizations, but has kept funding groups such as Center for American Progress (CAP) - a think tank which has "retained its status with Democracy Alliance as a favored organization."
In 2005, organizers of Democracy Alliance said that the goal of the group would be to "foster the growth of liberal or left-leaning institutions equipped to take on prominent think tanks on the right, including the Heritage Foundation, Hoover Institution, American Enterprise Institute (AEI), and the Cato Institute."
Think Tank Watch is working to verify this, but it has been said that besides CAP, Democracy Alliance supports at least two other think tanks: Economic Policy Institute (EPI) and Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBBP).Abstract
Dealing with hazardous materials and wastes has become a problem of major concern for countries throughout the world. This paper presents a model useful in making routing decision, for either material or waste shipments, and siting decisions for waste treatment facilities. Risk, cost, and risk equity are considered jointly in a multiobjective framework. Costs are treated as link attributes while risks, from both transport and treatment, are zonal attributes, pertaining to nonoverlapping geographic areas spread out over the plane. Risks accrue within these zones, due to shipments crossing nearby links or wastes being processed, stored or disposed of at nearby treatment facilities. Total risk is the sum of the zonal risks. Equity is measured as the maximum zonal risk per unit population. Shippers will find the model useful in optimizing their logistics plans. Government agencies will find it helpful in determining how regulations should be set to obtain publicly desirable routing and siting patterns. The model is described in detail and applied in simplified form to an illustrative problem.

Trader: Sell These 8 Stocks in 2021OPED: Invest in schools to bridge skills gap
“A rising tide lifts all boats” is the go-to saying about economic revitalization. We all believe that when the economy hums, everyone thrives — but do they?
By many measures, Pennsylvania’s economy is humming again. Our unemployment rate has fallen, but at nearly 5 percent, it remains almost 15 percent higher than the national average.
Even more perplexing, employers across Pennsylvania report vacancies in jobs offering family-sustaining wages. Why do we maintain a higher-than-average unemployment rate when good jobs are going unfilled? The answer is simple — our workforce skills gap.
Employers are not optimistic about the match of workers to available jobs, as they reported in a recent Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry survey. More than half — 52 percent — say they have great difficulty recruiting qualified job candidates, and 56 percent believe it will get harder by 2021. Only 21 percent — one in five — rate the readiness of our current labor force for their jobs as excellent or good.
More:Robot workforce: Automated jobs meet social consciousness.
About 15 percent of Pennsylvania’s high school freshmen fail to graduate within four years. Among economically disadvantaged students, it’s nearly one quarter.
Even in a “rising tide economy,” everyone needs a seaworthy boat in order to float. Education is that trusty vessel. Unfortunately, too many young Pennsylvanians attend schools that lack adequate resources to ensure a quality education.
More:OPED: York's pioneering spirit could once again strengthen our economy
Pennsylvania has the nation’s widest per-pupil spending gap between wealthy and poor school districts, and students feel the difference. Pennsylvania’s wealthiest districts spend 33.5 percent more than the poorest school districts. That gap is significantly higher than the national average of 15.6 percent. Among states, Pennsylvania is third-worst in the nation in the percentage of children attending severely financially distressed districts.
State contributions to education struggle to address these inequities. With our property tax-based system, wealthy school districts are self-reliant. Low-income communities struggle to earn revenue from low-value properties, no matter how high their tax rates. Again, Pennsylvania ranks near the bottom among states in the percentage of state funding devoted to local schools, contributing only 37 percent, compared to the national average of 47 percent.
We can close the skills gap by investing more long-term state funding through Pennsylvania’s fair education funding formula. Studies show that school finance reforms can significantly improve student achievement. Adequate and reliable funding, carefully allocated where it’s needed, means smaller classes, where teachers can focus on individual students. It also means essential equipment for STEM education, and expanded full-day kindergarten. Critically for the future of our workforce, it means diversified academic offerings and specialty programs that enthuse students about the wondrous career possibilities ahead.
One recent study found that a 10 percent increase in per-pupil spending each year for all public school K-12 years resulted in educational gains plus higher wages and a measurable reduction in poverty. Studies also show that such an investment yields a healthy rate of return of nearly 9 percent.
Any businessperson would call that return on investment a no-brainer. And yet, not every Pennsylvania school receives adequate funding that promises student success.
It’s time to address these inequities and close the skills gap. Pennsylvania’s business people are taking a stand because we are vested in the drive to prepare all students for college or career regardless of where they live. When every school is adequately resourced, students learn the skills needed to rebuild Pennsylvania’s workforce into a world-class, competitive power.

Overview (No Spoilers):
Much to my friend Amanda’s exasperation, whenever I work out I count down until I end a set of exercises in fractions. A good example is let’s say in Crossfit we are rowing for 1000 meters. I would call out to Amanda every 100 to 200 meters how far we had yet to do fractionally or how much we had accomplished. “One-tenth of the way done!… One-fifth!… Three-tenths!… Two-fifths! … One half of the way done!” So as you can imagine, what was mentally satisfying to me was unbearably annoying for my dear Amanda. As such it became a running joke throughout our workouts to find different ways to count down until we finally got through the WOD (workout of the day). So tying this short aside into my book review, in this long Wheel of Time series I was amused to find myself doing the same thing as I was finishing each book. As such, upon finishing The Shadow Rising, I mentally rejoiced at being 1/4th the way through this series, although I had to laugh as I finished The Fires of Heaven that I was 5/16ths completed with the series. Silly prime numbers making fractions messy. As with the previous four books in the series, I again flew through this novel, excited to see where Rand’s story was headed. It should be no surprise that I was disappointed when one of my favorite characters (Perrin) didn’t make an appearance, however as this series continues to get more expansive, similar in scope of GRRM, I was at least preconditioned that authors can utilize the skipping of story lines in these long epic tales. While my favorite wolf character was sorely missed, The Fires of Heaven worked speed Rand’s story along at a potentially breakneck pace, although it was arguable Mat and Egwene’s characters that experienced the most growth. Additionally, Nynaeve is taught some valuable lessons regarding humility, as such is developing into one of my favorite characters, as long as she continues down this trek of self-reflection. Overall, I was highly entertained throughout this novel, often finding myself smiling at Mat’s antics, rolling my eyes at Nynaeve’s stubbornness, or even moved to tears by a particularly heartbreaking letter. Though I realize I’m about to enter the stage in the series fellow readers have forewarned me is rather sluggish, I’m still excited to see how the rest of this adventure develops.
Additional Insight (Spoilers Abound):
- Due to me listening to this series on audiobook I’ve had to look up the spellings of names or quotes online. As such, I’m accidentally have spoiled so key plot points and deaths for me! It is the worst!
- Mat is probably my favorite character of this series! Especially as he fights his fate at every turn. Is he Manetheren’s King Reborn, like Rand being the Dragon Reborn? He was told that he would marry the Daughter of the Nine Moons, and we finally heard mentions of this person in the context of the Seanchan conversation in front of Rand and Aviendha. For that matter, what will the repercussion of the Seanchans seeing Rand in their own land? Will it somehow bring together Mat and his prophesied bride?
- What are the powers of Mat’s Spear?
- It is an interesting dynamic between Rand and Aviendha. Will he really get to ‘share’ all three the girls that are drawn to him?
- Will Siuan Sanche and Gareth Bryne fall in love? What did Min mean that she had to say by him to save hers and his lives? Will Leane and Siuan be able to be healed by Nynaeve?
- Will Logain be healed as well? Is that how he rises to glory again? Will he be an ally to Rand?
- Will Elaida really send Aes Sedai to Rand? How will he avoid them?
- Where is Morgase going? When will she be reunited with her children?
- Who killed Asmodean at the end? What harm will Rand wield with balefire?
- I enjoyed the chaffing that Nynaeve and Elayne experienced at returning to the Aes Sedai. Did the Aes Sedai reveal to the Wise Ones that Egwene was not a full Aes Sedai? I especially enjoyed the showdown between Nynaeve and Moghedien, and how she trapped the Forsaken! If Moghadien comes to camp with her will Dark Friends be revealed?
- I admit it. I cried when Moiraine died, despite not knowing where her loyalties were aligned, especially with her letter. Did she really die? Did she really kill Lanfear. I have a feeling that the powerful Forsaken can’t be killed that easily.
- Was the three story house being built in the Two Rivers for Perrin? He would hate that!
- Is Thom Elayne’s father?
I do the same with individual books, pressing what I have read to what I haven’t and thinking in fractions. But I’d have to agree with Amanda when it comes to doing that during workouts; I wouldn’t want to know that I was only 1/4 finished with rowing!

Are you going to read the prequel New Spring? And if so where in the series?
The reason I ask is because when I read the series, I went to see where the best place to read it was, besides after Knife of Dreams as per publication order, Fire of Heavens was number one followed by Lord of Chaos. Personally I read it after Fire of Heavens.

***Spoilers for those that haven’t read Fires of Heaven Yet***
Personally I thought reading it after Fires of Heaven was good because it dealt with how Moiraine and Lan became a team and how her search for the Dragon Reborn begin. Now that you’ve read that FoH, you can see why the suggestion was highest after publication order.
The one downside is that there is yet to be introduced major character that will be relevant for the rest of the series from Book 7 on, but you don’t know whose side she’s on for some time and this is the case in the prequel as well . That’s why some suggest reading it after Lord of Chaos (book 6) because in both the prequel and the regular series people think the character has been dead for years.
Longtime fans say that publication order should be done the first time you read the series and then in a reread put it where you feel it would do the best, but if you read New Spring after Knife of Dreams it won’t have the same impact with Moiraine and the major character will still be enigmatic.
So my personal suggestion right now after Fires of Heaven. Second would be after Lord of Chaos, and third A Crown of Swords if you want the major character introduced in the main series before reading the prequel.
Sorry for the long post.

Irata - Tuesday, March 30, 2021 - linkIs that the other side though ? If they are in a „better at everything“ position, why should they charge bargain basement prices? And anti-consumer ? That would be paying / pressuring OEM and stores to not carry alternative products and that‘s not happening.
And you actually have a choice - want the best ? There‘s Ryzen 5000 but it costs a bit more. Want budget ? There‘s Ryzen 3000 and 2000. They all fit the same motherboards with the exception of 2017 era 300 series boards.
What you shouldn‘t do is compare EOL close out prices to current products prices. I bought my 2700x new for €150 including Borderlands 3 and the stock HSF but it was so cheap because they were clearing out stock. The same thing is happening with Comet Lake but compared to Ryzen 2000 EOL prices you could even argue that they are still overpriced.
Either way, we‘ll see what RKL brings to the table, both as far as performance, features and price is concerned. Reply

Samus - Monday, March 29, 2021 - linkThis is a huge problem for AMD. The last few PC’s I’ve built during the pandemic have all been Intel because the platform cost is so much cheaper, and Intel had still competitive chips in the $150 range that you can actually get for MSRP. Meanwhile there are no AMD boards for under $100 unless you want an old platform, and their ~$120 chips are selling for $200.
Basically at the low end you can build an Intel system equivalent in performance to an AMD system for nearly $100 less. Obviously you are throwing future proofing out the window when it comes time to upgrade your CPU to something high end but I rarely see people replace CPU’s without replacing their motherboard anyway...which is kind of sad :( Reply
siggidarius - Tuesday, March 30, 2021 - linkFuture proofing and cpu upgradeability is fiction IMO, save for some edge cases. Usually CPU we buy is enough for some time, and after that it makes more sense to buy new mb+cpu+ram combo, especially now, when we are at the end of DDR4 era.
My current platform is based on x570 and Ryzen 3600, but I'm not planning on switching to ZEN3 or ZEN3+ if it ever comes out, and same is with Intel.
Also with current market integrated GPU is a nice thing to have for a fresh build, and here AMD just doesn't provide anything meaningful - it's all either old or expensive (and still a little worse then GPU-less CPUs due to less cache). Reply

It’s for my torrent PC/HTPC that was still sandy bridge and running a GT430 for video, new system will use around 1/3rd the power at load and 1/8th the power at idle. Total cost for board cpu and 8GB DDR4: $200. Reply

How Do People Respond to Being Touched by a Robot? Georgia Tech researchers are studying how people respond to being touched by a robot. The researchers say that people generally responded positively. “What we found was that how people perceived the intent of the robot was really important to how they responded,” says Georgia Tech professor Charlie Kemp. “So, even though the robot touched people in the same way, if people thought the robot was doing that to clean them, versus doing that to comfort them, it made a significant difference in the way they responded and whether they found that contact favorable or not.” The team used a robotic nurse to touch and wipe a person’s forearm, exactly in the same way, but note that the reaction was more positive when the subjects believed the robot intended to clean their arm rather than it tried to comfort them. The results were similar to studies involving nurses. The team also tested whether people prefer a verbal warning before touching, but the results were inconclusive because the subjects might have been startled when the robot started speaking.

Robot’s space debut ‘giant leap for tinmankind’ The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is sending a humanoid robot, called Robonaut 2 (R2), to the International Space Station for the first time. R2 is made of aluminum and nickel-based carbon fiber and has more than 350 electrical sensors throughout its body. R2 is humanoid from the waist up and measures three feet, four inches tall and weighs 330 pounds. It can carry out preprogrammed orders by itself, once the orders are given. The objective is to help astronauts, not replace them, NASA says. “While it might be just a single step for this robot, it’s really a giant leap forward for tinmankind,” says NASA’s Rob Ambrose. Once onboard the space station, R2 will undergo tests to see how it performs in weightlessness when attached to a fixed pedestal. NASA plans to send legs next year that will enable it to perform indoor chores, and future torso and computer enhancements will allow it to take space walks. R2 is expected to be onboard the space station until it stops operating sometime after 2020. [Source: Associated Press (11/02/10) Marcia Dunn ]
Robots are lords of the dance at South Korean festival Robots danced in competitions, played football, engaged in taekwondo matches, ran obstacle races, and participated in a parade at the recent Robot World in South Korea. The various tasks provided an opportunity to assess the sensory and movement skills of the robots. Billed as the world’s largest robot festival, Robot World has drawn about 120,000 visitors and 6,000 participants for demonstrations of the latest developments in robotics every year since its launch in 2006. This year, Robot World attracted at least 120 companies and 8,000 contestants. Hyun Yun-Duk, a teacher from Incheon mechanical technical high school, says the robots have improved from a year ago. “They are now much more like human beings,” Yun-Duk says. Researchers from countries such as the United States, India, Spain, and Japan participated in the various events. [Source: Agence France-Presse (11/01/10) ]

Robot, Object, Action! European researchers working on the PACO-PLUS project have developed robotic demonstrations to illustrate object-action complexes (OACs) as a new approach to robotic cognition. OACs represent a combination of perception of and action upon any given object. “The first thing a robot will do when it encounters an object for the first time is to lift it before its eyes and then rotate the object so the robot gets a look at it from all angles,” says PACO-PLUS project co-coordinator Tamim Asfour. The basic principle in the OAC concept is the idea that interaction with the environment leads to more sophisticated strategies over time, and ultimately gives rise to intelligence. PACO-PLUS researchers also have developed a method for teaching robots to learn from human observation and human coaching. [Source: ICT Results (10/29/10) ]
Robot Teachers Are the Latest E-Learning Tool [Access to full article may require payment] Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) researchers are building robots to provide English instruction to schoolchildren. The researchers, led by KIST’s Mun Sang Kim, are designing the robots with realistic facial features, arms that enable them to gesture, and sensors so they can keep their distance from students. The robots can teach either by leading students through preprogrammed exercises or by being operated remotely over the Internet. The researchers say the goal is to be able to build robots that are less expensive than hiring teachers from abroad to teach English. “The role of robots will go up steadily, and the role of human teachers will shrink,” Kim says. The brightly colored robots are about three feet tall, display facial expressions as they speak, and have built-in speech recognition technology. The researchers have developed 40 prototypes, which will be placed into service at 18 elementary schools for a three-month pilot test. [Source: Chronicle of Higher Education (10/31/10) Jeffery R.

Robot ‘Hands’ Write Without Fingers University of Chicago physicist Eric Brown has conducted detailed research on the use of grain sacks as a universal gripper for robots. Brown and colleagues use a thin rubber sack filled with coffee grains or small glass spheres, which contracts by 1 percent in volume when the hand comes in contact with an object. A small pipe sucks air from the sack, enabling the hand to mold to the shape of the object. The hand has some trouble grasping flat objects such as plastic discs, porous objects such as cotton balls, and anything bigger than half its size. However, researchers say the hand is very versatile and can pick up just about any shape, and unlike conventional robotic hands, does not require the manipulation of 20-odd joints with a computer. “This seems like a much better way to go,” says Yale University physicist Corey O’Hern, who believes that making the sack stickier could solve the porous-object problem, but notes that his idea might make it hard to let go of objects. The researchers believe the technology would benefit amputees, as it would be easier to operate than current prosthetic hands on the market. [Source: ScienceNOW (10/25/10) Kristen Minogue ]
The robot that reads your mind to train itself. University of Washington researchers are developing brain-computer interface (BCI) technology by teaching robots new skills using only brain signals. The researchers, led by Washington professor Rajesh Rao, began by programming a humanoid robot with simple behaviors that users could select with a wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) cap, which detects brain activity. The researchers are developing a hierarchical BCI for controlling the robot to emulate human thought and decision making. “The resulting system is both adaptive and hierarchical–adaptive because it learns from the user and hierarchical because new commands can be composed as sequences of previously learned commands,” Rao says. Other research groups also are developing thought-controlled robots. Honda researchers recently demonstrated a robot that can lift an arm or a leg through signals sent wirelessly from a system operated by a user wearing an EEG cap. University of Zaragoza scientists are working on creating robotic wheelchairs that can be manipulated by thought. “It does make good sense to teach the robot a growing set of higher-level tasks and then be able to call upon them without having to describe them in detail every time,” says Tufts University professor Robert Jacob.

Robot Arm Punches Human to Obey Asimov’s Rules University of Ljubljana researcher Borut Povse is conducting experiments in which a robot limb repeatedly hits human volunteers on the arm to evaluate human-robot pain thresholds in order to facilitate adherence to Isaac Asimov’s first law of robotics, which prohibits robots from injuring people. Povse says accidental collisions between robots and humans are unavoidable, and the experiments are “taking the first steps to defining the limits of the speed and acceleration of robots, and the ideal size and shape of the tools they use, so they can safely interact with humans.” The tests will continue using an artificial human arm for the purpose of modeling the physical impact of far more severe collisions. The objective is to limit the speed a robot should move at when it detects humans in close proximity to avoid harming them. Baylor College of Medicine biomechanics specialist Michael Liebschner questions the use of pain as a measure of outcome. “Pain is very subjective,” he notes. “Nobody cares if you have a stinging pain when a robot hits you–what you want to prevent is injury, because that’s when litigation starts.” [New Scientist (10/13/10) Paul Marks]
Robots ‘Think’ With Their Hands The European PACO-PLUS project is developing a new approach to robot cognition based on a theory called object-action complexes (OACs). Robotic cognition theorists believe that if perception and interaction can be developed, intelligence will emerge spontaneously. OACs are types of software and hardware that are designed to enable robots to think about objects in terms of the actions that can be performed on that object. The PACO-PLUS approach imitates the learning processes of young infants, using trial and error and watching other people to learn new information. A key part of the research involves working with humanoid robots. “Humanoid robots are artificial embodiments with complex and rich perceptual and motor capabilities, which make them … the most suitable experimental platform to study cognition and cognitive information-processing,” says Karlsruhe Institute of Technology researcher Tamim Asfour.

Robots could improve everyday life at home or work Cornell University scientists are developing robots that can perform household chores without human intervention. “Just like people buy a car, I envision that in five to 10 years, people will buy an assistive robot that will be cheaper or about the same cost as a car,” says Cornell professor Ashutosh Saxena. One of the biggest challenges is enabling robots to learn in uncertain environments. One of Cornell’s projects is a robotic arm with a gripper.

June 08, 2021Collective male sexual violence is part of a continuum of sexual coercion in South Africa. This paper is based no long-term ethnographic work in an urban township in the former Transkei region. Drawing on intensive participant observation and interviews with young men in particular, it attempts to make sense of emergent narratives relating tostreamlining, a local term for a not uncommon form of collective sexual coercion involving a group of male friends and one or more women. The paper begins with an overview of existing anthropological literature on collective male sexual violence, going onto elaborate the different scenarios associated with group sexual violence in the fieldsite. It seeks to provide a multi-layered contextualization of the phenomenon by considering prevailing gender discourses, sucultural issues pertaining to the urban tsotsi phenomenon, the rural practice of ukuthwala (bride capture), young working-class Africans' experiences of marginalization, and the complex links between political ecoomy and violence in this setting.For. If you’re looking to find a home builder in north St. Louis county, you definitely have options!
Buying used
Here are some of the times when buying an existing home might make sense for you and your family:
- You’re in a time crunch. You have a very short period of time to move to a new place, and simply do not have the time to build something from the ground up. You have to look at what’s available now, not in a few months. But, did you know that Consort has Move-In Ready homes? These homes are perfect for the time-crunch buyer – you get the best of both worlds!
- You are a DIY aficionado. You love the idea of taking something old and making it new again, and like getting your hands dirty taking on home renovation projects. While this might sound like fun, be cautious and make sure you’re investing in a property with a solid foundation – and not more problems than you bargained for.
- You’re moving to a place with limited real estate. Some areas of the country are difficult to build in, and you may have your heart absolutely set on a very specific neighborhood where building new would be difficult or costly, and could involve tearing down an existing home.
Building new
Building a home from the ground up is a great way for families to plan for now and into the future. Here are the reasons why building new might make sense for you:
- You know what you want. Getting exactly, 100 percent what you want in an existing home is tough, because that home wasn’t designed with you in mind. Building new means deciding on every detail, every step of the way, and creating something that reflects you — and only you.
- You care about energy efficiency and building best practices. The home building industry is like any other; it evolves, and best practices change. Building a new home ensures you are getting the latest in home efficiency and green building practices, and that your home is built to the highest current standards possible. Additionally, when you build new the price per square foot tends to be lower than resale homes.
- You don’t want to have to worry. Buying an existing home means inheriting that home’s problems. Building new means you know exactly what you are getting and are far less likely to face major repairs or replacements in the near (or even distant) future. Plus, your new home will be under warranty and at Consort we’ve have a team of people available to help you incase anything goes wrong! And,
- It’s designed just for you. Since your new home will come styled and designed to your tastes, there won’t be any need for upgrades or renovations right out the gate.
Building new or buying used is a personal decision that every family must decide for themselves. If you’re hoping to create something that’s uniquely yours, though, building from scratch is almost always the way to go!Givens, D.I. and Shingfield, K.J.

If you’ve never heard of it, Project Euler (pronounced “oiler” after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Paul Euler) is a set of increasingly difficult programming challenges. Participants can write their programs in any language and the only goal is to solve the problems and learn something. There are no prizes and you don’t have to show your work.
I had looked at this project years ago, and I swear I thought I had already solved some of them, but maybe I only thought about doing it. Anyway, I have two solutions to the first problem; one in Groovy and the other in Scala. Here, then, is how Project Euler describes the problem
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
So, the goal is to take a series of numbers from 0 to 1000, exclusive, find all the numbers divisible by 3 or 5 and add them together. Here’s the Groovy solution.
def subList = (0..<1000).findAll {it % 3 == 0 || it % 5 == 0} def sum = subList.inject(0) {i, sum -> sum + i} println "Sum = ${sum}"
This is a very simple program, and I could have written it as a one-line program. I broke it up into a few lines for clarity. As you can see, the first line creates an exclusive range from 0 to 1000. It then calls the findAll method on that range, passing in a closure that will return true if the passed-in digit from the range, called “it” here, is evenly divisible by 3 or 5. The result of findAll is another collection, containing only those values that passed the divisibility test. We then take that list, passing 0 into the inject method, which will neatly sum the values up and return that value. Easy peasy.
Now here’s the Scala version. You’ll notice it is very similar to the Groovy solution.
val subList = for { i <- List.range(0, 1000) if i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0 } yield i val sum = subList.foldLeft(0) {(i, j) => i + j} println("Sum = " + sum)
I used a sequence comprehension to generate the sublist here. The bit beginning with “for” generates an exclusive range from 0 to 1000, which is then iterated over, assigning each value to “i”. Then, if it is divisible by 3 or 5, it is yielded up by the comprehension. The result is a collection of just those numbers that we want, assigned to the val called subList. We then call foldLeft on that sublist, doing exactly what we did in the Groovy solution. Again, pretty simple.
Now, I could have solved this one in an almost identical fashion to the Groovy solution by using the filter method of lists, but I wanted to solve it first using a list comprehension. Here is the second solution
val subList = List.range(0, 1000) filter {i => i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0} val sum = subList.foldLeft(0) {(i, j) => i + j} println("Sum = " + sum)
I timed the solutions and all three finished in just over a second. The second Scala solution seemed ever-so-slightly faster than the other two.
As I get time, I will work on additional problems from the site and post the answers here. I don’t know that I’ll always do solutions in two languages, but I might.High 20 Online Sports Activities Betting Websites In Nigeria

“Aravalli hill is a forest area. How can you make it a dumping site? How could you allow the leachate to accumulate at Bandhwari sewage treatment plant? We had asked you to take action. Why don’t you do something? Let there be some constructive suggestion,” a bench headed by NGT chairperson, justice Swatanter Kumar said, while directing the official concerned from the municipal corporation to be present before it.
The observations came, after several residents from nearby villages appeared before the tribunal and alleged water contamination in their area. They told the NGT that continued dumping of waste at the Bandhwari landfill site, had led a stream of dirty black water or leachate into the Aravalli forest, polluting the aquifers around both Delhi and Gurgaon.

The villagers, who were accompanied by an NGO, submitted water samples to the green body. They alleged that reckless dumping of industrial waste and construction debris, was taking place in the green area and sought urgent directions from the bench in this regard.
The green panel’s order came on the plea filed by environmentalist Vivek Kamboj and Amit Chaudhery, who had alleged that the municipal corporations of Gurgaon and Faridabad, were disposing of industrial waste and construction debris in forest areas on.
Earlier, the NGT had said that any individual spotted throwing waste or muck in the Aravalli forest, would have to pay a penalty of Rs 5,000. There will be proper check points at the beginning of the roads entering towards the Aravalli hills, it had said. It had also directed the police commissioners of Gurgaon and Faridabad, to ensure that the directions issued by the NGT were fully complied with.
The tribunal had restrained the Haryana Urban Development Authority and the Gurgaon Municipal Corporation from dumping waste in the Aravalli forests and issued them a notice, asking why they should not be asked to pay environmental compensation.~ By Jade Chandler
So all of us have different styles of writing, and I am naturally a quicker writer, words flow, sometimes faster than my 60wpm fingers can type. Other times, not so much. So this year I added to my prep work before typing my first sentence. I hope you find something you can use among the tools I’ve found that help me best.
So I write romance, steamy to erotic usually, and I believe character rules in romance, not that I ignore plot. So first I get to know my characters. I use up to three tools, depending on how secretive my character is being –as you know—some won’t quit yammering in your head.
My go to character steps include the Character Target Tool and Character Pyramid Tool because they focus on traits that lead to emotions and emotions that reflect action. This way my characters do more than smile every time they are happy. I am sold on the whole Positive Trait, Negative Trait and Emotion Thesaurus series. They also have lots of other handy questions. I also use a character questionnaire for quiet characters, like this one, but there are thousands if you google it.
/>So now I know my characters. I then write their internal and external Goal Motivation Conflict. Simple stuff. Avery wants the town and bikers to get along because she secretly wants to be a biker’s old lady but her father is the main voice against the motor cycle club.
Once I get that down, I move to plot. Here I have to say thank you to Jamie Gold’s blog for these awesome Excel spreadsheets for plot. I like Story Engineer best but have used them all and now have created my own sheets that fit my plotting style. These excel sheets give you the key plot points for a book on an excel sheet. Based on awesome magic, not only does it give you descriptions of what those points should do, it gives you a corresponding word count where each one of these happen. I fill the skeleton of my plot into these worksheets, and make sure the ideas I have actually work, and that I have enough conflict. Pacing and good conflict were two of my early weaknesses.
Then I outline, you outline to the degree you want, I just use bullet points that encompass the chapter’s POV, a couple sentences about setting, word count for the chapter, and 5-7 plot points for the chapter… Generally my chapters are about 4,000 words long. As I outline, I match my word count in the spread sheet. For example, fun and games begins at about 20,000 words and is where the characters usually get to know each and fall in love. I make sure I outline lots of good sex and fun dates, along with some minor disasters in this section. This outlining method helps me make sure I have tension, highs and lows in each chapter and give each major plot point enough attention. Unless I’m working with a publisher who needs a synopsis before I write the book, this is where I start writing. Otherwise I complete the dreaded synopsis.
My last hint is how I sit my butt down to put words on paper. I like to write in 15 to 30 minute blocks with no interruptions. But sometimes, I don’t know a fact or remember a name, so I use this trick…. I type #restaurantname and move on to the next sentence. Now, I use *** to mark scene, POV, or time breaks in chapters, if you use ### then pick another symbol. The beauty of this is that you can search the symbol and go back later and fill in the blanks easily, without missing any. Writing is an art and a craft. I find that my best writing comes when I write every damn day. When I take breaks, days or weeks, I have to retrain my body and mind to write again. And that sucks.
So why do you care? This formula has given me about an extra 1,000 words a session as I have lots less time I need to stare into space deciding what should happen now. Instead I keep writing. Last year I completed four novel-length books, this year my goal is five. And to be fair, I give you this disclaimer, I work full-time, do kids, family and all the stuff that keeps everyone busy. Generally I have two hours a day to write, occasionally more, and on some days no time.
You can use these tools whether you are a panster or a plotter, and believe it or not, I’m primarily a panster, as my characters change the freakin’ plot all the time, and I don’t outline in depth. But this style keeps me from needing to cut pages of back story or too much sex, and gets my first draft done in 3 to 8 weeks, depending on my motivation and focus. Happy writing! And feel free to email me if you have questions!

It is from Aug.--Dec. but the word on the street is that the teacher will be out for the whole year. It's a reading resource room job so I'd be working with small pull out groups. I'd be with the reading consultant who would be my captain. I know her and like her a lot. I'm figuring that it would be great experience and stands out a bit from the usual LTS classroom job. Plus I would get a taste of the specialist life. That is if they hired me. I think they would prefer a reading cert but are having trouble finding one. Another year of subbing but...at least this would be a totally unique experience for me.Albany Banking Lawyer

Registered by George Ormond Lorch III
For PS 5.7 and MyRocks, extend the my_thread interface to expose a new function call my_thread_setname that would call pthread_setname_np.
Be cautious of who/where this is allowed to call as there is possible race condition if called from thread creator and not thread itself after creation and on first run.
my_thread deals with Windows thread management quite a bit as well to normalize the interface. I suggest for our purpose we simply leave Windows implementation empty and only worry about linux since we have no way to test or validate that any Windows implementation within PS actualy compiles and functions.

On April 27, BHC will be offering continuing medical education (CME) for clinicians on ME/CFS and Fibromyalgia, taught by Dr. Lucinda Bateman. Clinicians are required to do a certain amount of CME to retain their medical licenses, and this course will earn clinicians 4 CME credits.
Clinicians who attend will learn about the major presenting features of ME/CFS and Fibromyalgia, how exercise affects people with these conditions, and how to help patients identify their activity tolerance, among other topics. As a follow-up to the CME course, clinicians will also get information about the research that BHC participates in, and how they can refer patients to BHC for research projects.

Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum this week, the US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley targeted China as the No 1. security threat to the United States and narrowed the time frame for a potential war over Taiwan to two years.
Milley’s remarks clearly reflect the discussion taking place in the top military, intelligence and political echelons in Washington. Over the past decade, Obama, Trump and now Biden have successively raised the stakes in an increasingly reckless confrontation with China, aimed at preventing it from threatening American global hegemony.
Speaking of China, Milley complained: “They want to challenge the so-called liberal, rules-based order that went into effect in 1945 at the end of World War II. They want to revise it.” But the catchphrase—the international rules-based order—refers to the post-war international framework established by the US, in which it set the rules to suit its economic and strategic interests.
What concerns Milley is that China, by virtue of the sheer size of its economy and need for energy, raw material and parts, is coming into conflict with the world dominated by the US and its allies. Moreover, in order to compete economically, China is compelled to seek to advance hi-tech industries that both Trump and Biden have sought to block.
Milley focused attention on US tensions with China over Taiwan, which were intensified by Trump and have rapidly come to the fore under Biden. In March, the outgoing head of the US Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Phil Davidson, warned of the potential for war with China within six years.
Milley said he did not expect Chinese military action over Taiwan in the next two years, which only suggests that the US military is preparing for war within a short time frame. He added:
“Having said that, though, the Chinese are clearly and unambiguously building the capability to provide those options to the national leadership if they so choose at some point in the future.”
“We are witnessing one of the largest shifts in global geostrategic power that the world has witnessed,” Milley said. In a statement that foreshadows a vast acceleration of the US arms race with China, he declared: “If we, the United States military, don’t do a fundamental change ourselves in the coming 10 to 20 years, we’re going to be on the wrong side of a conflict.”
While Milley highlighted China’s test of a new nuclear-capable hypersonic missile, the latest annual Pentagon report on China suggested that it would have 1,000 nuclear warheads by the end of the decade and more advanced delivery systems. All this feeds the Pentagon’s argument for large increases to a defence budget that is already of record size, even though the US nuclear arsenal of 5,550 warheads dwarfs that of China—both now and in its projected future size.
The rapidity with which Taiwan has emerged as the most dangerous flashpoint for a US war with China underscores its strategic and economic importance. Militarily, it is a vital part of the first island chain, stretching through Japan to Taiwan and the Philippines, that US strategists regard as the means to hem in the Chinese navy, mount an economic blockade and serve as the frontline of any war. Economically, Taiwan is home to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company that produces virtually all the world’s most advanced computer chips, which have both economic and military applications.
While the US media and political establishment repeatedly speak of “Chinese aggression” toward Taiwan, Washington is undermining the precarious status quo across the Taiwan Strait. The Biden administration nominally adheres to the “One China” policy that is the basis of US-China diplomatic relations, established in 1979 when the US broke diplomatic ties with Taipei. Washington in effect recognised Beijing as the legitimate government of China, including Taiwan.
At the same time, the US Congress passed the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act that committed the United States to sell defensive arms to Taiwan and maintain limited informal relations with Taipei. Since then, US actions have been governed by what is known as “strategic ambiguity”—that is, Washington would not give an unambiguous commitment to Taiwan to support it in a military conflict with China. The aim was to deter Taipei from declaring formal independence from China, to which Beijing has repeatedly warned it would respond with force.
Also speaking at the Aspen event, leading Democrat Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, joined the growing clamour in ruling circles for “strategic ambiguity” to be dropped. The US and its allies needed “to make it abundantly clear to China what a significant cost it would pay were it to use force to try to invade and take over Taiwan,” he said.
In a thinly-disguised evasion, Schiff declared: “I think probably less ambiguity is better than more ambiguity.” But, he added, there was a “fine line,” as “we don’t want to make any pronouncement that will accelerate Chinese thinking or timetable in terms of using military force against Taiwan.”
In reality, “less ambiguity” upsets the delicate diplomatic balancing act that has underpinned US-China relations for four decades. It means no ambiguity, or “strategic clarity,” to use a current catchphrase. That is, an unconditional commitment to back Taiwan in a war against China. The US has already begun to transform Taiwan into a military platform by dispatching US Special Forces to the island to train Taiwanese troops for the first time since American forces were withdrawn in 1979.
The Biden administration has already taken a large step toward ditching the policy of “strategic ambiguity” in favour of providing “rock solid” backing for Taiwan. During a town hall meeting last month, asked if the US would come to Taiwan’s defence if China attacked, Biden declared: “Yes we have a commitment to do that.” While the White House sought to “clarify” that there had been no change in policy, the charade of “strategic ambiguity” is increasingly being dropped.
The US is also marshalling its military allies and strategic partners to support Taiwan. A delegation of European Union parliamentarians arrived in Taiwan on Wednesday for top-level discussions. Delegation leader Raphaël Glucksmann told Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen that they came with a simple message: “You are not alone. Europe is standing with you, by you, in the defence of freedom, rule of law.”
None of this is going unnoticed in Beijing. However, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has no progressive response to the rising danger of war. On the one hand, it seeks to end the confrontation by cutting a new deal with US imperialism, while, on the other, engaging in a futile arms race that can only end in disaster.
In an editorial last week, the hawkish Global Times absurdly suggested that Beijing was in the box seat because it was not in the interests of Taiwan and the US to “trigger a war across the Taiwan straits.” The editorial boasted: “The ultimate decision of whether to wage a cross-straits war, what the scale of the war will be, and how and when to fight is in our hands.”
On the contrary, by deliberately undermining the diplomatic protocols that have kept an uneasy peace in the Taiwan Strait, the Biden administration is goading China to make the first move. US imperialism is determined to subordinate China to its interests using all available means, including war.
The only means for halting the drive to war between the two nuclear-armed powers is the intervention of the international working class through the building of a unified anti-war movement directed at abolishing the capitalist system—the root cause of geo-strategic conflict.

Sharknadoes merge to form a sharkicane that affects the entire “feast coast.” The storm starts in Washington and reaches all the way down to Universal Orlando.
“We’re shooting in Universal Orlando as Universal Orlando,” director Anthony C. Ferrante explained in a Behind the Sharks promo. “But I don’t think there’s an instance of a monster movie where they actually use the theme park as the theme park.”
It promises to be a wild ride, literally! A shark gets blown onto the tracks of a roller coaster and attacks the car. The sharks will also get into other attractions like Twister…Ride it Out and the Jaws ride.
Syfy calls Sharknado a FOMO-nomenon. The Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) was evident when an encore showing outperformed the premiere of Sharknado following its trending on Twitter. Sharknado 2 garnered over one billion hits on Twitter. That’s more than Miley Cyrus during the MTV VMAs or Kim and Kanye’s wedding day.
“There’s such a huge fanbase,” touted Ian Ziering, who plays the shark slayer named Fin. “The demographics keep expanding, getting older and younger because everyone doesn’t want to miss out on the moment.”
Sharknado 3 premieres July 22, Wednesday 9PM on Syfy.

Asger Kjaerum- DownloadIt was my five-year wedding anniversary last week. Five years! It’s like we blinked, and here we are – five years, two stone and one bubba later – wondering when the DJ packed up for the night.
That’s bloody time for you eh?
As is wedding anniversary tradition, my husband and I got out the photo album to reminisce about our day, which mostly consists of my banging on about how brilliantly skinny my ankles were, while my husband tries to watch a BBC Four documentary about rivers/ still-life paintings/ railways (we’re endless fun aren’t we!?).
Aaaanyway, our wedding day was pretty much perfection: my dress, the colour scheme (BUTTERCUP YELLOW FTW!), our amazing photographers. There’s so much we got right but, of course, with hindsight (and a great deal more wedding industry knowledge) there are definitely certain things I would do differently if we were to get married all over again.
Most of those are inconsequential. Just a little tweak here and there. (Oh, go on, since we’re chatting about it… let me go off on a self-indulgent dream wedding tangent.)
- My hair would be in a super-cute bob (I grew my hair out because I was weirdly set on plaits, but I hate having long hair and kept self-sabotaging by going for sneaky haircuts in the lead up to the day. JUST CUT IT ALL OFF YOU MORON.).
- I would have even MORE bridesmaids (I left a couple of good friends out because I thought seven was too much but, come on, the more the merrier!)
- I’d treat myself to a pair of snazzy yellow Converse (I had THE MOST GORGEOUS yellow LK Bennett stilettos which I was convinced I’d be able to keep on my feet until at least the evening do. Being totally useless in heels, they obviously came off pretty much straight after the ceremony. In nearly all our photos, I’m wearing a pair of hideous plimsolls that I never thought would see the light of day. What an error!)
So… y’know. Not too many regrets, considering the epic wedding shiz I see on a daily basis in my work as a wedding celebrant! I suppose the BIG change I’d make, were we to have a second go at it, would be to the actual wedding ceremony (Here we go. She’s getting back to the point!).
Register Office Wedding Vs Humanist Wedding Ceremony
Similar to many couples getting married, my husband and I barely gave a thought to the wedding ceremony itself, which is mad because – like, DUH THE WEDDING CEREMONY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT BIT!!!! Without it, your day is just everyone you love (as well as some you definitely don’t) freeloading a wicked party off you! Back in 2013, I’d yet to hear of humanist weddings and, being non-religious, my husband and I just assumed (WRONGLY!) our only option was to suck it up with a tedious civil ceremony.
Get it over and done with, I thought, then on to the party!
Flicking through our wedding photos the other night, I remembered how unexpectedly freaked out I’d become on the morning of the wedding when I started thinking about the actual ‘marrying bit’ of the day ahead.
As I got my hair done (poor hair stylist yanking my too-short hair into the miserable plaits I’d insisted on!) it suddenly dawned on me that I had no idea who would be marrying us or what we’d be expected to do during the ceremony (sit/ stand/ hold hands/ kiss???). I wasn’t even clear on what my husband and I would be saying to each other as we’d spent about five minutes, six months prior to the day, picking our ‘vow options’… and hadn’t given it a second thought since.
Gaah! I got myself in a right old tizz and downed a whole bottle of Prosecco to ‘calm the nerves’. Fill her up, I kept ordering my nervous sister-in-law, brandishing my lipstick-stained Champagne flute under her nose (what a classy bride!). You can see from the photos at the register office just how drunk I am!
As my husband and I walked/ staggered down the aisle, I got an awful fit of the giggles. It was so bad that I thought the Registrar might actually refuse to marry us when we reached her! I just about kept it together until the end when, after the BIG KISS, and with everyone cheering, the Registrar hissed in my ear ‘You are changing your surname aren’t you?‘. There didn’t seem to be time, in that split second, with the clapping dying down, to explain that ‘No, I’m an independent woman with strongly-held feminist principals etc etc.’ before she was asking everyone to please stand for ‘Mr and Mrs Woosnam’.
BUT I’M KEEPING MY SURNAME, I harrumphed as we headed back down the aisle and the next wedding party promptly filed in behind us to fill our seats (Hey! Would you jump in my grave as quick!?). So, yeah, it kind of ended on a bit of a bum note…and started on one, to be honest. Drunk hysteric cackling is not how I imagined starting married life!
Super personalised Humanist Wedding Ceremony Experience
Looking back on our register office wedding, I obviously compare it with the experience I create in designing one-of-a-kind humanist wedding ceremonies for my couples. Here are the top five reasons I reckon a humanist wedding ceremony will always beat a civil ceremony.
1. You get to build a relationship with your Celebrant
When it comes to marrying my couples, I know them. I’ve spent a tonne of time digging into their relationship, exploring their values, finding out what makes them tick. I understand what they love about each other, how exactly they get on each other’s nerves (because c’mon, love ain’t always a Westlife album), why they WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF THEIR LIVES TOGETHER.
I know it all. I’m totally invested.
When you pick your wedding celebrant you’re making the (very sensible) choice to KNOW the person marrying you. There’s none of this coming down the aisle to a total random. You get to choose someone you could actually see yourself being friends with; whose face you’ll be absolutely delighted to see beaming back at you on the biggest day of your life, who’ll squeeze your hand and remind you to BREATHE.
As a bride, I would have found that hugely reassuring!
2. You consider what’s *actually* important to you about marriage
So much of the time we’re on life’s treadmill… work, eat, gym (maybe!), bed, wake up, shower, work again. We’re functioning on auto-pilot. Milestone moments, like a wedding day, offer us the chance to hit Pause and reflect on where we are, and where we’re heading.
In order to truly do your wedding day justice, I think it’s critical that couples spend a good amount of time in the lead up to their wedding actually considering *why* they want to get married so this can be discussed during their wedding ceremony. You’re promising, ultimately, to spend the rest of your life with this one person. Why is it important to you that you do that??? Have you just been culturally brainwashed to think marriage is where it’s at? Or is there more to it than that? (Hopefully there is, or else I’ll be out of a job pretty quickly!).
Religious couples are accustomed to this thought process as pre-marriage guidance is a condition for many religious services, but it’s usually something that goes amiss for those pursuing the civil route. Our civil ceremony was over all too fleetingly and the process of getting married gave my husband and I no opportunity to unpick why we wanted to do it (beyond getting some great pics of us and all our family and friends).
3. Totally personalised wedding ceremony (UNIQUE TO YOU!)
You know you want your wedding day to be one-of-a-kind, an authentic reflection of your relationship. That’s why you’ve spent 10,000 hours on Pinterest sourcing the perfect paper for your origami cranes. Seriously, couples spend so long on the brilliant bells and whistles without realising that the ceremony – THE MOST IMPORTANT BIT, yeah? In case you’d forgotten – can be just as unique and special to you (I know all this because I was *that* bride!).
Humanist weddings are concerned with telling the couple’s story, which means every single one you go to will be as different as the people getting married. The wedding ceremonies I write are all written from scratch to reflect that couple and their relationship. Not a yawnsome template or Pick ‘N’ Mix vows in sight!
That wouldn’t be fun would it!
4. Writing your own Vows
Unlike civil ceremonies, you can exchange promises that you have decided upon in a Humanist wedding. Because humanist ceremonies are still not legal (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland), you can say whatever you like to each other!
I can’t tell you how special wedding ceremonies are where the couple has written their own vows. Honestly, I’m sitting here typing this and bursting with LOVE. It’s THE BEST BIT of the humanist wedding ceremony. Just think about it. The whole wedding ceremony has been about you, your love story, why you want to get married. It’s all leading up to this. THIS MOMENT. This incredible moment. The vows couples write are always a billion times better than anything I could create for them, and the emotion behind them is such a power punch. EVERYONE CRIES.
5. Hold your ceremony where you like, when you like!
On a cliff top, in a forest, in your back garden – there are no restrictions on where you hold your humanist wedding, which is why they’re very popular with couples wanting an outdoor ceremony. I’ve thrown in ‘when you like’ because you’d be surprised at how limiting civil ceremonies are. It turns out that there’s a national shortage of registrars and, unless you book your registrar ten years in advance, you’re unlikely to get your preferred ceremony time slot (although, Shush, no one flag it up. This is how most couples, on looking into it further, discover the infinitely preferable option of a humanist ceremony!). When I book a wedding I leave the entire day for that couple. I arrive an hour early and can be flexible with timings if, for any reason, we need to push start times back.
Personalised Wedding Ceremony + Shit Hot Party = Freaking amazing Wedding Day
Everyone – and I mean EVERYONE – in the wedding industry bangs on about creating a wedding day that is unique and personal to you, but what does that actually mean? To me the perfect wedding day formula looks like the above i.e. your ceremony is 50% of the magic. Minimum. So it’s worth thinking about how you want to create a ceremony that feels truly MAGICAL to you and really does your unique relationship justice (with a humanist wedding would be my, very predictable, recommendation!).
Ending on a gratuitous wedding shot here. JUST LOOK AT DEM ANKLES!2020 had brought so much chaos and fear that most of us loose Hope to turn the page and leap in confident towards 2021. Are we going to be intimidated by chaos and pandemic 2020? It’s in the past, leave it behind be thankful that we came through-Praise God.
To be more productive we are to trust God, allow Him to work in and through us and we can see how it impacts us on an ongoing basis so that we can adjust in our lives to move forwards with Love, Peace, Joy and Hope in 2021. We can make a big change but make that change of Trusting God a top priority.
You ask how trusting God adjustment will make my life better? The answer is instead of trying to focus on self-sufficiency or fixing what’s wrong, practice focusing on mindfulness and awareness of God abiding Presence: He is our refuge and strength, and an ever-present Help in trouble.

Every year, American publishers lose out on around $300 million from people downloading illegal copies of books online, according to a 2017 study published by Digimarc and Nielsen. Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, said in 2019 the figure had likely grown.
Perlego, which charges users a monthly subscription to access academic, professional, and non-fiction e-books, monitored five years' worth of search traffic to the top online book piracy sites.
The firm used SEO analysis tool Ahrefs, which tracks how live websites "link to each other and what keywords they rank for in search results," and with Keywords Everywhere, a tool that allows users to more precisely monitor Google search traffic.
It detected recent surges in traffic to the most popular book piracy sites, which Insider is choosing not to name, that coincided with a two-part "core update" by Google to its search results through June and July.
Spikes in traffic to piracy sites coincided with Google's search updates
This graph, supplied by Perlego, shows traffic to piracy sites before and after Google's search algorithm changes in the summer.
Perlego
The above graph, supplied by Perlego, shows traffic between September 2020 and September 2021 to several book-piracy sites, represented by the colored lines. The orange dots represent Google's two-part algorithm update.
One piracy site, represented by the blue line, saw traffic soar 478% since the first part of the update in June, growing from around 31,000 unique visits per month to 183,000.
The site represented by the red line saw a 200% spike in traffic in the same period, up from 78,000 visits to 236,000. While traffic to the site in yellow tailed off slightly in September, it has still seen massive growth, up 258%, from 43,000 visits per month before the update, and 154,000 last month.
"After Google's June and July updates, we saw online piracy sites shooting up," said Tom Blackshire, director of SEO at Perlego, who told Insider publishers were "losing a ton of money" as a result. "Google wants to ensure people can find what they're looking for, and with the last two updates, they've focused in on that — but now the piracy sites appear to be being rewarded as a result.
"You have to respect that they're dealing with trillions of results, and it's not like someone at Google is like: 'Let's screw over the publishers,' but they are creating these algorithms and not necessarily paying full attention to what the output is."
Publishers have been warning about the cost of book piracy for years
One factor driving online piracy is the cost of some academic textbooks. One engineering book, "Rocket Propulsion Elements," can cost up to $125 to buy legitimately. Based on the number of times the book has been searched for across piracy sites, Perlego calculated that US publishing house Wiley stands to lose almost $900,000 a year on that book alone.
Commenting on Perlego's findings, Aref Matin, chief technology officer at Wiley, told Insider the piracy of academic materials was "a significant and ongoing challenge," that "blurs the line between high and low-quality information, and threatens the security of people and institutions across the globe."
It isn't just Google who should be tackling the issue, he said.
Matin said: "The reality is that this issue can only be solved through a multi-pronged approach that includes efforts from content creators, governments, search companies, and individuals.
Matin added that search engines were in "a unique position," suggesting they could not only remove pirated content found online, but also "do so more proactively, by implementing smarter technologies to prevent infringements from occurring at scale."
Stephen Lotinga, CEO of the UK's Publishers Association, told Insider the rise in online piracy was an "increasing problem."
He said: "Governments, platforms and other internet intermediaries all have a responsibility to tackle this problem. Accessing pirated material is illegal and jeopardizes the creation of academic texts in the future."
It's possible that the surge in traffic to piracy sites is temporary and may drop after another tweak by Google. The firm tweaks its algorithm in the hopes of improving users' experience of its search engine on almost daily basis, but isn't always transparent about how these changes will affect other websites' rankings.
Several times a year, Google — in its own words — makes a "significant, broad changes to our search algorithms and systems." These core updates can have a big impact on what appears in Google's results pages, depending on how informative, relevant, or credible the new algorithm deems websites in relation to a given search query.
According to Google's transparency reports, the firm has received requests for more than 5 billion different URLs to be de-listed from its search results under copyright law over the past 20 years. The company says that it "regularly receives requests to delist content," but adds that it cannot "act as a mediator," and advises complainants of their right to sue those breaching copyright law. Google declined to comment further.

Under the patronage of H.R.H. Prince Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, Crown Prince of Bahrain It will include everything that you can think, from digital entertainment to startup boot camps, and all the way to an innovation festival, just name it, and this week will probably have it!
Yes, March has huge things in store for you and what better way to kick off the week than a gaming conference. GCC Game Conference (GCCGC) is going to take place on March 3, 2018 and it will be Bahrain’s very first game development conference ever! The GCCGC will happen right after the GCC Game Jam (GCCGJ), which will be Bahrain’s 3rd game jam. It will last for 2 days starting from March 1st.
Both events are specifically targeted at game developers, as it revolves around everything that falls under the umbrella of game making, be it engineering, art or business.
In an interview with Ameen Altajer, Managing Director of INFINITEWARE, a company that does Artificial Intelligence (AI) and game development solutions to a number of customers, including Saudi Aramco, VIVA Bahrain and many more, he shares with us exclusive details on both events.
Ameen has been in the software business for more than 15 years, and when it comes to game development, he specializes in the low-level aspects of game development, including game engine design and architecture, performance and toolset development.
He is also the founder of Bahrain Game Developers (BGD), which is the first local game development community in Bahrain, established in 2012. “BGD provides a platform for local game developers to share ideas and showcase their work globally and I’m so happy that we have a sister community, Unreal Bahrain, kudus to my friend Yousef Buhazza for this.”
The GCCGJ is a signature game development event that Ameen has been doing for the past couple of years and is a 48 hours game development hackathon. The whole premise of the event is to develop a game using the theme that is specified at the beginning of the competition. “We reveal the theme on the day of the competition deliberately to make the competition fair, where everyone starts at the same point,” mentioned Ameen.
Game developers and contestants obviously need all the focus and attention in the hackathon, thus general public are not allowed. On the other hand however, you can still experience the thrill through the live-stream, and cheer for your favourite contestants online!
Ever since Ameen created the Kingdom’s first game development community, it’s been a dream of his to see Bahrain hosting its own game development conference similar to the Game Developers Conference, that takes place in San Francisco. GCCGC is the beginning of something great for the region and could fill that void, by bringing a lot of joy to the game developers living in Bahrain and the region.
So, what is the game conference about? “GCCGC is Bahrain’s first game development conference ever! It’s organized by INFINITEWARE with the help of Bahrain Polytechnic, and is completely free to the general public! It doesn’t get better than this!”
“The event is tailored to all the game developers in the GCC. It is literally an event by the game developers for the game developers and we want to keep it that way,” said Ameen.
Adding, “We’ll be hosting a variety of talks on topics like art, engineering, programming, design, ethics and the business of making games, this caters to a wide spectrum of audience. In addition to success stories in the GCC, and important panels, which will allow the audience to hear what the government and educational institutions have to offer in order to support the craft and the business of game development.”
Not only that, but the conference will also give a chance to the general public to see what the local game developers have to offer, through sharing some of their major and notable works. “We offered the game developers across the GCC the chance to showcase their best work in the conference, and I really mean it when I say “best of the best” work-kind. We cherry-picked the games ourselves prior to asking them to come here.”
The winners of the GCCGJ will be announced during GCCGC, and the first prize winner will receive BHD 1,500.
According to Ameen, game development is picking up faster than before, but this can be speeded up even further. Spaces like CH9 have been more than welcoming to the community, and the existence of Amazon Web Services (AWS) presents a fantastic opportunity for game developers and digital content creators in solving stability and latency problems.
StartUp Bahrain Week will be revolved around the startup ecosystem and Ameen does believe that game developers are the next startups to watch! Why and How? “Being in touch with the game developers is probably one of the best things you can put your money in, it’s pretty affordable and it is quick to set up an indie game development studio. You just a couple of great minds with artistic and programming skills, a few good machines and a lot of time to create content, that’s the bare minimum of course but you get the idea.”
Well, one thing for sure, we are super excited for StartUp Bahrain Week, and even more psyched on how it is going to start!
The GCC Game Conference can be found here, happening on March 3rd, no registration needed.
Big shout out to Ameen for his great initiative toward the game development community! You can reach him on social media at @ps3code, or visit his website.

The fairy well; to bring
To life’s worn, weary memory
The freshness of its spring.
But here the order is reversed,
And infancy, like age,
Knows of existence but its worst,
One dull and darkened page;—”
by Letitia Elizabeth Landon – The Vow of the Peacock and Other Poems (1835)
(A Christmas Carol and It's a Wonderful Life)
Introduction
The idea of a child-centred Christmas is taken for granted now but in Dickens’ time it was not so assured. A high child mortality rate, child labour, poverty and, a colder, more utilitarian attitude towards children prevailed. Dickens’ own childhood experiences were bad as he was set to work long hours in Warren’s Blacking Factory while his father and family languished in a debtors prison. Dickens wanted to write a pamphlet about children but decided a dramatic story would be more effective. His book, A Christmas Carol, while sales were slow initially, went on to become hugely successful and influential, and has never been out of print since.
The theme of redemption is important to both narratives and both stories turn on the idea of a change of heart for the better by the adults. This change affected the lives of the children in each story yet the children were not aware of the dangers they were in. Thus the concept of childhood as ‘the fairy well’ was well developed, and the ‘freshness of its spring’ being considered a jewel that only grows more beautiful with age.
In this essay I will look at some similarities between the two stories and at what has made for their enduring appeal.
A Christmas Carol
While many differing ideas seem have fortuitously come together for Dickens during the writing of A Christmas Carol the focus on children seems to have been the most important. Literary influences are given as The Sketch-Book of Geoffrey Crayon by Washington Irving and a Douglas Jerrold essay from an 1841 issue of Punch, ‘How Mr. Chokepear Keeps a Merry Christmas’.
In The Sketch-Book of Geoffrey Crayon Irving writes:
“It was the policy of the good old gentleman to make his children feel that home was the happiest place in the world; and I value this delicious home-feeling as one of the choicest gifts a parent could bestow.”
Dickens was very aware of the tragedy of child workers and legislation being introduce to improve their conditions at the time. The idea of social unity that Dickens utilises at the end of A Christmas Carol is expressed in another passage by Irving in The Sketch-Book, as we hear echoes of the medieval hall resounding to the sounds of the fun organised in the ancient midwinter tradition of the Lord of Misrule, with children once again to the fore:
man’s-buff. Master Simon, who was the leader of their revels, and seemed on all occasions to fulfill.”Once again the innocent fun of the children is emphasised. However, in Jerrold’s essay ‘How Mr. Chokepear Keeps a Merry Christmas’, a different kind of father is described, one for whom image is more important than feeling. Mr Chokepear is described as “he himself declares, he is ‘the best of fathers’ — the most indulgent of men”, yet he receives the wishes of a happy Christmas “from lips of ice.” He is the best citizen and best Christian but for one thing:
“We have said all CHOKEPEAR’S daughters dined with him. We forgot: one was absent. Some seven years ago she married a poorer husband, and poverty was his only, but certainly his sufficient fault; and her father vowed that she should never again cross his threshold. The Christian keeps his word. He has been to church to celebrate the event which preached to all men mutual love and mutual forgiveness, and he comes home, and with rancour in his heart—keeps a merry Christmas! […] Gentle reader, we wish you a merry Christmas; but to be truly, wisely merry, it must not be the Christmas of the CHOKEPEARS. That is the Christmas of the belly: keep you the Christmas of the heart. Give—give.”Dickens is concerned with genuine Christian ideas of Christmas in A Christmas Carol and not hypocritical ones for show only. Therefore, Scrooge is given the opportunity to redeem himself in a genuine way and this genuine transformation means he will be welcomed into the Cratchit’s house and the house of of his nephew for Christmas celebrations.
Thus Dickens was interested in the idea that the bosses should have a genuine change of heart and not a false annual display of good cheer for their friends. Dickens himself was interested in giving practical help to poor children as well.
Coal tub – “A succession of laws on child labour, the so-called Factory Acts, were passed in the UK in the 19th century. Children younger than nine were not allowed to work, those aged 9–16 could work 16 hours per day per the Cotton Mills Act. In 1856, the law permitted child labour past age 9, for 60 hours per week, night or day. In 1901, the permissible child labour age was raised to 12.”
In 1843 Charles Dickens became involved with with the London Ragged Schools Union and donated funds for their upkeep. They were established to provide free education, food, clothing, lodging and other home missionary services for poor children.
As Claire Tomalin writes:
“From his own deep self he drew the understanding that a grown man may pity the child he had been, and learn from that pity, as Scrooge does. It was also his response to the Ragged School he had visited, and the Report of the Children’s Employment Commission he had read a little earlier, which showed that children under seven were put to work, unprotected by any legal constraints, sometimes for ten to twelve hours a day, inspiring the scene in which the Spirit of Christmas Present shows Scrooge two stunted and wolfish children, calling them Ignorance and Want.” [1]Of course, while the children may be the focus of Dickens’ Christmas main story, they must not be aware that they are, thus retaining the sacred concept of childhood. Therefore in the narrative the children are affected only indirectly through the changed habits of the adults. This was Dickens’ strategy – to show that the cruelty of the world and the preciousness of childhood could exist side by side. Thus the adults could change their realm, positively affecting the children’s realm, without the two realms interacting with each other, as happened in Dickens’ own childhood. Dickens’ story also added to the growing belief in the importance of childhood not only for children but also for stable adults as Scrooge was shown to have had a lonely childhood himself.
Many film versions have been made of A Christmas Carol from Scrooge, or, Marley’s Ghost (1901) to A Christmas Carol (2018), a contemporary retelling of the story set in Scotland.
It’s a Wonderful Life
Another popular film with Christmas visions is Frank Capra’s 1946 film, It’s a Wonderful Life. Almost one hundred years after Dickens’ novel was published, Capra’s film shows a very different kind of vision of society. Rather than the atomised society of the poor in Dickens’ London, Capra shows a community being pulled and pushed in different directions by individuals with very different objectives. George Bailey faces off Henry F. Potter who is trying to take over the town with cheap, exploitative housing schemes and by buying up everything of value in the town.
As Bailey faces bankruptcy of the Bailey Brothers’ Building and Loan through the forgetfulness of his uncle (mislaying a lot of money), Potter seizes the opportunity to destroy Bailey’s bank and take over the town completely. When Bailey arrives home distraught he has angry words with all of his children. They become very upset and burst into tears as they have no idea what has come over their normally loving father.
As a result of this disaster, Bailey wishes he had never been born and is shown a vision of what the town would have become had Bailey’s community spirit and camaraderie with his clients not existed: a mean place, decadent and aggressive with no community feeling or community spirit (like Scrooge, mean, aggressive with no community feeling or community spirit). After the negative scenario he experiences, Bailey rushes home to his wife and apologises to each of his children in turn for his earlier outburst thus keeping the adult and child domains separated, while the adults sort out adult problems.
Unlike Scrooge, in It’s a Wonderful Life the individualist money-pincher Potter is not considered important enough to go through the process of redemption (while he is portrayed as a Scrooge type figure), because the poor are now portrayed as existing in a community which can ultimately defend itself from Potter’s attacks: by coming together and using collective action to help Bailey. They look to each other for help and not to the rich bankers.
Although both Scrooge and Bailey lend money, Scrooge gives out money to benefit himself while Bailey gives out money to benefit the community. In the earlier ideology of A Christmas Carol, the wealthy must look after or take pity on the helpless poor. However, while Scrooge must save himself, the community saves Bailey.
George Bailey (James Stewart), Mary Bailey (Donna Reed), and their youngest daughter Zuzu (Karolyn Grimes) in It’s a Wonderful Life.
In A Christmas Carol the poor are everywhere but have no real consciousness of their poverty and struggle against poverty despite the odds. In It’s a Wonderful Life the poor are depicted as belonging to a community but gradually grow more conscious of their weak position and unite to defend themselves.
They develop a growing consciousness of the power of the community to use collective action to fight back against those who would keep them poor. As a result, rather than being solely concerned with their own money and future as was shown earlier in the film, they see the importance of community for their own self-protection just in time, and turn up at Bailey’s house to lend, give, donate any money they have to save the bank and their own future. Thus in It’s a Wonderful Life, its the community that redeems itself.
Both Dickens’ book and Capra’s film carried radical messages for their time. Only two years after A Christmas Carol, German philosopher Friedrich Engels published The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1845, a book written during Engels’ 1842–44 stay in Manchester, important as the city at the heart of the Industrial Revolution. Engels believed that Carlyle was the only British writer who had taken account of the poor and so was not yet familiar with A Christmas Carol. Meanwhile Marx saw Dickens as one of a few ‘splendid’ fiction writers in England, “whose graphic and eloquent pages have issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together.”
While It’s a Wonderful Life depicts the benefits of a community uniting, it was declared suspect by an unnamed FBI agent who watched the film as part of a larger FBI program aimed at detecting and neutralizing Communist influences in Hollywood. The agent believed that ‘communists’ used two common tricks to ‘inject propaganda into the film’, as Kat Eschner writes:
“These two common “devices” or tricks, as applied by the Los Angeles branch of the Bureau, were smearing ‘values or institutions judged to be particularly American’ – in this case, the capitalist banker, Mr. Potter, is portrayed as a Scroogey misanthrope – and glorifying ‘values or institutions judged to be particularly anti-American or pro-Communist’ – in this case, depression and existential crisis, an issue that the FBI report characterized as a ‘subtle attempt to magnify the problems of the so-called ‘common man’ in society.'”The organization handed over these incredibly vague results of its investigation to HUAC (House of UnAmerican Activities) which could have led to McCarthyist Hollywood witch hunts. However, the HUAC decided not to follow up on the smears.
Conclusion
In both A Christmas Carol and It’s a Wonderful life, a common theme is the idea that people can change for the better and have a happier life by questioning their own selfish values and motives and by realising that there are greater forces at work which must be reckoned with for survival. Scrooge’s isolation from friends, family and employees led him to fear a lonely death and Marley’s fate. Bailey’s customers also realise that looking after number one might allow them to get by on the level of their own petty concerns, but when something seriously threatening to their homes and families appears on the horizon they are able to club together to prevent the worst. Ultimately it is the children who benefit as the adults unite and solve problems rather than sharing the burden with their children, and in the long term that also makes for a more stable community.
The idea of sheltering children from the cruel world, rather than throwing them head first into it, is still an important issue in the world’s poorest countries today where around one in four children are believed to be engaged in child labour.
On an individual level and on a community level these two stories have everlasting appeal because they are still relevant today. The continuing political, financial, and climate crises of the 21st century mean that the need for individual self-questioning and/or community action will never cease to be important, and maybe even be life-saving as the new century wears on..

The Community Board that presides over Astor Place has denied a local Wiccan group’s application to celebrate the summer solstice.
The Wiccan Family Temple had planned a day of music and mystics, complete with a magical wishing well and booths manned by psychics, tarot readers, vendors of crystal balls and tabletop cauldrons, and book-signing authors, including a self-styled supermarket sorceress.

Notion #1 – Pot Odds
Long-term profits in holdem come from making bets with a favorable expectation. You only possess a positive expectation when your payoff is greater than your risk. Casinos produce money from unfavorable expectation games like roulette. The single range wager in roulette pays off at thirty-five to 1, except the odds of winning the wager are 37 to one. The difference between the thirty seven and the 35 could be the casino’s profit margin.
You have to have a basic understanding of how to calculate pot odds even though playing as a way to figure out when to play. You must only bet on a side once you possess a good expectation, otherwise you ought to fold. Basically you compare the number of chips in the container with your odds of succeeding the container if you determine regardless of whether or not to play a hand.
Suppose there’s $150 in a very container, and you’re to the flop with 4 to a flush. An easy way to approximate the odds of hitting the flush would be to take the quantity of cards that will produce your palm and multiply that by the quantity of cards which are still heading to be dealt, and multiply that by two. There are 13 cards in a very go well with and you have 4 of them. So you can find 9 cards left. 9 instances a couple of more cards times two % equals thirty-six percent, or about 1 in 3. You will win an average of once every single 3 instances and lose the other two times. So the pot wants to provide you at least two to one for you to call a bet. If someone bets $50, you stand to win two hundred dollars on a $50 bet, which gives you suitable pot odds to call.
This basic idea is important to holdem success. Other concepts to start thinking about are the odds of your opponent folding in case you raise. This will change the container odds. A rule of thumb is usually that the fewer opponents, the far more likely you’ll be able to take down an uncontested pot. Another rule of thumb is the fact that should you have a drawing side, a major pot, and a smaller bet to call, then you should call. If the pot’s tiny, and the bet’s major, you then need to fold.
Principle #2 – Starting up Hand Selection … Placement
Placement is critical when deciding what sort of fists to in fact wager on prior to the flop. The rule of thumb is that you bet on much tighter (have higher beginning side requirements) in early location and play looser in late position. Your advantage in late place is that you simply can see what the other gamblers do prior to you come to a decision what to do.
This is often a simplification, plus a lot of people today aren’t going to like the way I do it, except I divide setting up hands into just 3 groups. You will find certainly sub-divisions and subteleties involving these groupsbut starting out, you’re basically looking at just three different groups: strong arms, drawing arms, and unplayable hands.
Sturdy hands are pairs of 10 or larger, plus AK suited. AA’s and KK’s pretty much always warrant raising preflop, except you’re in early location and you’re hoping for someone to raise behind you. AK suited, QQ’s, JJ’s, and 10’s are worth raising with if no one else has elevate, they’re from time to time worth raising with if someone else has raised, and they’re pretty much always value calling with.
Drawing fists are fingers that will need to improve around the flop to win. Pairs of 99’s or lower and suited connectors are usually drawing palms, and so are big-little suited. (Huge little suited is an ace and one smaller card of the identical go well with, and it’s a playable hand occasionally because of its flush potential.) Suited connectors are adjacent in rank and of the exact same suit, so they have the likely to produce a flush or a straight or possibly even a straight flush. And the smaller pairs go down in value as they get lower in rank. They are typically really worth calling if no one’s raised unless you happen to be in early location, if you ought to usually fold them. At times pairs of 77’s, 88’s, and 99’s are great starting hands to play strongly with too, specifically if your opponents are really tight and also you could win the container correct there without a showdown.
Idea #3 – What to perform about the Flop
"Fit or fold" will be the typical wisdom on this subject. You really should be in a beneficial place to come to a decision what to try and do on the flop. I’ve constantly played overpairs and top pairs a minor as well strongly, and that works well at a weak table with calling stations, except you have to be a lot more cautious with much better players. The "average" winning palm in Holdem at a showdown is 2 pairs or better.
If your beginning cards were a drawing hand, you should hit your palm in order to bet on it. Should you had pocket 66’s, you truly will need to hit 3 of a kind to continue playing the hand, otherwise you should fold. 4 to an open-ended straight is playable except there is a probable flush draw about the board. four to a flush is usually a excellent palm to play. But if you happen to be playing a smaller pair and there are overcards to the board, you’re going to be almost certainly going to have to get away from the hand. Hold’em is really a game of high cards.
This is a incredibly basic introduction to the things you ought to think of in Hold’em strategy. There are tremendous subtleties and complexities beyond this introduction, and entire books are written on strategies for limit, pot limit, and no restrict Holdem. You’re going to be encouraged to commence reading them and take into consideration them even though you play.Purchased an IdeaPad5 online with 11th Generation Intel® Core™ i7-1165G7 Processor and : Integrated Intel® Iris® Xe Graphics.
It is terrible! Within only a few minutes of exposure I get eye strain, headaches and nausea and felt a migraine coming along. I almost feel like I'm going to vomit! I tried ditherig which doesn't seem to impact the display; I see no banding.
ditherig
My family member also felt nauseous -- but less so and it took hours for that to set in. We may need to return it.
Luckily my daily drivers are still holding up, but I know I'm just an OS Update or broken hardware or new job away from a world of misery. It's so depressing and I'm so sick of this condition (which seems to run in families).
Wonder if anyone has ideas? It seems the Intel Iris graphics is much worse than Intel UHD.
I really wish these companies would do something. Intel has dismissed our concerns. I'd gladly pay for research given our livelihoods are at stake.
I found yet another thread with others suffering, this time from Window/Lenovo.

ryans I really wish these companies would do something. Intel has dismissed our concerns
Ah. I didn't see this before. (forget how to embed posts, but read linked post
I wonder if some of those users that replied are from here. I guess the more we return products complaining of faulty display causing eye strain the better. Can you still return the Lenovo?
I'm stuck on my daily workable systems too. Sometimes I buy a second hand laptop or monitor off Facebook marketplace to test. If it ain't good I just sell it back on FB. Less stressfull when its a small amount of money.
Same, better or worse if you look with one eye?
The primary listed LCD panel part listed for this laptop is the Infovision R156NWF7 R2, but there are 2 substitutions possible as well.
Infovision panels sometimes, but not always, use PWM on recent year Lenovos. I could not find PWM information on this particular panel.
The closest panel I could find, the IVO M156NWF7 R3, was reported to not use PWM by the Russian website Andiriney.
I have not had lasting success with any new hardware or software in some time. I think “New” has become a dead end for now.
The “bad” aspect of the display output is very consistently enforced now.
I used to say when I found a good device that they forget to install the eyestrain. I was right. They don’t forget anymore.
Thanks all. No obvious PWM from a smartphone camera. I used it for ~ 10 minutes with a few breaks and feel a little dizzy and spaced out.
I noticed two very interesting things:
Does anyone know what polarization actually does? Can it impact binocular vision?
Start training with covering one eye. I think it’s like 10+ users on this forum that get milder to almost non problems with one eye.
In terms of your different perception of brightness of your eyes, it could be the case that you have a fixation issue so that you doesn't look with the part of the retina which should be used so different light receptors are used.
I think as Mike outlined before, that many of us have in general trouble with our binocular vision which is in different forms triggered by different displays. If you have trouble focusing you probably more inclined to use parts of your peripheral vision to compensate.
However bright and sharp displays with strong contrast ratios make it more difficult to do so, since they stimulate fusion which is more taxing on your eye muscles if you have trouble with your binocular vision. So it is not really the displays fault here but an unfortunate consequence of better displays, antialiasing or other software improvements.
If you have some success with one eye in the beginning, it is not unlikely that you are nearly symptom free in 3-6 months during the time when you have one eye covered. As Mike said for most people it is better to cover their non dominant eye, but just try it for yourself. You should feel a preference after some testing. I would also suggest to only cover your eye in situations in which is necessary to do so to keep you binocular vision alive, but most people do that anyways.
However, in most cases covering one eye should not help you with your binocular vision, but it can.
mike I'll give it a try. I didn't realize it was 10+ people, that's amazing. When I do my accommodative rock with lenses as part of vision therapy, we start with one eye first, and then move to two eyes later. Maybe it's a similar concept.
What's the best technique you've found? Switching eyes every couple hours? How long did you do this training?
Did you get eyestrain/dizziness/almost anxiety too?
ryans What's the best technique you've found? Switching eyes every couple hours? How long did you do this training?
For the most I covered my right non-dominant lazy eye.
Start cover-training with one eye, and if that doesn’t improve, try your other eye.
Three weeks, about an hour a day with a bad screen was a game changer for me. What works for you I don’t know, we are all different.
ryans Did you get eyestrain/dizziness/almost anxiety too?
Yes, very bad. Tension headache, red burning eyes, dizziness and so on. Back in 2015 I could work an hour a day, it was depressing. But thanks to @martin i started to train with one eye and after a few weeks I got good progress with my binocular vision.
So looking at the screen reflected off of someone's glasses for only 30 seconds gives me anxiety and slight dizziness. I really don't think temporal dithering can cause this.
Any ideas? PWM?
I see someone on Reddit describes the symptoms very accurately:
I feel like a strange electrical interference in the middle of my head most prominently, a neurological fuzzy feeling, a mild forehead pressure/headache, along with a building sense of disorientation/dizziness/withdrawing sensation with feeling woozy/unease/nausea/fatigue/and defocusing of eyes
ryans Temporal dithering pain can come on quickly and be severe. I experienced it with a modern Nvidia graphics adapter recently (which incidentally, a couple of members found usable).
PWM is possible, but try and see if that happens at 100% brightness (not guaranteed to remove PWM in all cases, but worth a try).
Another possible culprit is LCD inversion flicker. I’m not so knowledgeable on this but it seems to be a hidden cause of why some screens are intolerable. It’s also typically worse on laptops.
One thing I see mentioned on the forum is that the internal LCD connector is treated differently than any external connector. Who knows what output modulation is occurring there. Lenovo likes to use multiple panel models and they need to maintain a consistent experience across all of them.
Ryans
These are exactly my symptoms too.
I’ve tried about 10 laptops the past year. I now don’t know what to do. Nothing works and it’s extremely depressing- I can’t function without a usable laptop.
At the moment I just tried ASUS Rog 300hz, no PWM (confirmed with iPhone camera test). I found the higher hz even more nauseating. I don’t think PWM is the cause.
I also have at home which I might return- asus zenbook Oled. This is the most usable one (advertised as flicker free- but there is serious flicker at every brightness below 100. For me is is usable only at lower brightness even though that’s where most PWM is- but it hurts my eyes.
So likely returning both.
Any ideas what we try next? Ive pretty much ruled out PWM as the issue, it’s unlikely blue light, and refresh rate makes no difference for me it’s definately a brightness thing that triggers the symptoms.
Out of interest do you get motion sickness as well?
Hi,the culprit i think is IPS panel type,try to connect an VA monitor to see if eye strain persist.
Also keep in mind that if you are using Windows 10 Version 1909 or Anniversary addition it can be also a cause.
Be stick with Windows 10 Version 2004/1511/1507.
shivamjha
Good point, unfortunately, it is impossible to get Intel graphics drivers for the old versions of W10 for 11th Gen. Intel aggressively cuts off iGPU support for older versions of Windows (including older W10 builds) when they release a new processor generation.
I would not classify build 2004 among the classic W10 builds (1507/1511).
I agree that OS strain is another hidden cause of eyestrain. It is being forgotten due to age (Anniversary edition was released over 5 years ago) and lack of good solutions.
Could the laptop panel itself be doing dithering? And thus ditherig doesn't impact it?
I know on this forum, we typically say, dithering is only done on monitors, and never laptop panels.
All the LVDS panels I've seen are "dumb" framebuffers (as in a GPU or other external device needs to "feed" it an input signal) so i wouldn't call it likely, but other things being possible? Maybe.
I'm going to return it. Is there any way I can figure out the panel from within Windows to report in here?
I think this is the worst device I've used...they are getting worse, not better!
ryans I think in Device Manager there should be the internal display listed, and under one of the details tabs is a list of items, of which one of them is "Hardware IDs" (paraphrasing).
Capture all that info (sorry about how bad it is) and I might be able to match it to a known LCD model.

Unfortunately all I was able to see is "Generic PnP Monitor". It's using a Microsoft driver from 2006 and has the driver version 10.0.19041.1151.
WinVer is Windows 10 20H2, OS Build 19042.1288.
The refresh rate is 60Hz, RGB Color Format, with Color Space of Standard dynamic range (SDR).
It uses Intel(R) Iris(R) Xe Graphics driver from 5/20/2021 using the driver version 27.20.100.9565.
5/20/2021
27.20.100.9565
I tried ditherig20 but it has no noticeable affect. Unfortunately this device seems to be impacting me neurologically, even with one-eye closed. It does seem more tolerable when disabling the Intel driver and falling back to Microsoft Basic Display Driver.
ditherig20I’ve done it again. It’s 11:38 PM on Thursday, October 29 as I type this. My hometown Green Bay Packers have just won a Thursday Night Football thriller. Two hours ago I didn’t know who Rasul Douglas was. Now he’s my favorite player. My friends are texting me saying they’re buying his jersey. My sister-in-law and her husband are here from Germany and it’s the first time we’ve seen them in a few years. It’s been a fun night. I have work tomorrow, but here I am burning the midnight oil to bring you Friday’s song “Greatdayndamornin’/Booty” from the 2000 album Voodoo.
Let’s get this out of the way first: “Greatdayndamornin'”is a fully formed 5:37 song. “Booty” is a 1:56 jam session added on at the end. They’re treated as one track on the album so I’ll do the same here. I could spend time on both of them because they deserve it, but we’ll keep them together on the D’aily for the sake of continuity.
“Greatdayndamornin'” was written by D’Angelo, Angie Stone, Charlie Hunter, and Questlove. Produced by D’Angelo. All vocals arranged and performed by D’Angelo. Music arranged by D’Angelo and Hunter. Bass and guitar by Hunter. Drums by Questlove. All other instruments by D’Angelo. It’s a dope track. D’Angelo singing about perseverance and pushing through. I love playing this song in the morning while getting ready for work. It’s not particularly uptempo or energetic, yet it gets me off on the right foot. I’m not trying to dismiss it by any stretch but I don’t have anything terribly insightful to contribute. I’m more interested in the funky ass two minute outro to this song titled “Booty.”
I have no idea how “Booty” got its name, but I love it nevertheless. It was written by D’Angelo and Questlove with nearly essentially the exact same roster of performers as its predecessors. “Booty” interrupts “Greatdayndamornin'” and Questlove and Hunter find the pocked immediately. The persistent groove slaps you across the face immediately. It’s not even two minutes long but I wish it was 15. I could listen to that groove all day. I’ve mentioned in this space as recently as earlier this week that I had the pleasure of seeing D’Angelo and Questlove performing together during their brief run of “Brothers in Arms” shows back in 2013. My wife, Chelsee, and I saw them at First Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Sunday, June 23 of that year.
Here’s something about Chelsee and I: Chelsee is late for everything. I do not like to be late. When we’re going to something important – like a D’Angelo and Questlove concert – I sometimes have to lie to her and trick her to get her ready on time. I remember eating dinner outdoors at a downtown Minneapolis restaurant with a view of the First Avenue front door. As soon as I could see a line forming I got antsy. She could see it and did the whole eyeroll “are you fucking serious right now” routine. Was I really going to break up this lovely date we were having so we could stand in line? Hell yes I was. There are no seats at First Ave. It’s all standing room. I wanted to make sure we got a good spot to see D’Angelo. It does not bother me one bit to suffer through a long wait if there’s payoff at the end. I once stood outside in weather below freezing for over three hours to watch then-Senator Barack Obama speak. After the wait I got to stand right in front for his speech, then shake the soon-to-be President’s hand and say hello to him. Actually, I said, “Thank you, Senator,” and he replied, “No, thank you!” I’d say it was worth it.
As it turns out, Chelsee did not put up much of a fight over leaving dinner early because she knew what seeing D’Angelo and Questlove meant to me. Having the patience to wait in line paid off again that night just like it did with Obama. We were one of the first in the door and got an amazing spot right in front. It was a “pinch me” moment. I figured someone would come up and say, “Hey, idiot. This is the VIP section. You’re way in the back.” Nope. We got to see D’Angelo and Questlove from a spot within inches of touching the stage. We could’ve stayed at dinner a little longer, then watched the concert from much further back. Instead this was a dream come true. On top of it, we’re talking about Minneapolis in 2013. First Avenue of all places. If ever there was a night that Prince could appear out of nowhere, it was that one. If he did, I’d not only see three of my musical heroes, but I’d literally be feet from them. We were clearly not the only people there anticipating a Prince appearance. The whole place was buzzing.
Spoiler alert: Prince never showed up. It didn’t matter. It was only D’Angelo and Questlove for most of the show, but you would’ve thought it was an entire band. I kept thinking, “How does D’Angelo sound like an entire band by himself?” I still don’t know. My favorite moment of the night: When they played a cover of Slum Village’s “Fantastic 3” and transitioned into “Booty.” You could feel the energy of the crowd change when they realized what it was and it turned into a call-and-response. Here’s the fun part: I found a video of it on YouTube taken from someone’s cell phone. I took a few of my own, but they were brief and ultimately useless. I wanted to live in the moment and be the only person there not holding up a cell phone. I watched this video from YouTube and thought, “This person must’ve been standing right next to me.” There are parts of the video where you can see a bald head in the corner of the screen and I wonder if it’s actually me. I know you can’t hear me because I promised I’m not as tone deaf as the motherfuckers you can hear in this video. Even if the bald guy in the corner isn’t me, you get a brief idea what it was like being there. Whenever I hear “Booty” it takes me back to that amazing night eight years ago in one of my favorite cities, Minneapolis, with my favorite person, Chelsee, watching two of my favorite musicians up close, D’Angelo and Questlove. I almost forgot the link. Check it out!
As much as I’d love to continue bragging about my amazing night in 2013, it’s officially Friday morning now and I have meetings later this morning. Time to crawl into bed and fall asleep to Packer highlights. Can you believe we’re done with six weeks of D’Angelo songs? 30 down, only 19 to go?!? More shocking than that, I’m on pace to end exactly on Thanksgiving Day?!!?! It’s only 19 business days until Thanksgiving. Where has autumn gone? The good news is, even though there are only 19 songs left, that means with D’Angelo they’re 19 good ones. Several of my favorite D songs are still left in the song randomizer. In fact, we’ve got a sleeper favorite of mine coming up on Monday. It might not show up on many people’s lists of the best D’Angelo songs, but damn it’s a good one. For me it announced a new era for D. When he went from a 21-year-old kid playing to “neo-soul” to a grown man creating his own genre and claiming the throne previously occupied by the likes of Prince and Stevie. More on that Monday. Have a great weekend and a Happy Halloween if you’re into that kind of thing.

Declining renewable energy costs mean it could be feasible to power the U.S. on 90% clean electricity by 2035, according to a study by UC Berkeley and GridLab. Rapid adoption of non-carbon fuel sources is a trend that seems likely to continue for the foreseeable future.
At the same time, the world is becoming less secure. Cybersecurity threats to operational technology and inverters, that are increasingly Internet-connected to help run the electric grid, are escalating. Atlas VPN reports that cybercrime totals $1.5 trillion in revenue annually — that’s three times the annual revenue of Walmart. In short, cyber crime is a lucrative career for hackers.
SMA’s ShadeFix optimization produces more energy than traditional optimizers. ShadeFix also provides greater reliability and less service risk than alternatives. Watch the video to see for yourself!
When it comes to utility-scale solar plants, Internet-enabled smart inverters are especially at risk because they communicate with the grid to perform management functions. There’s potential for hackers to tap into these inverter communications, throwing the grid voltage out of control, which could lead to brownouts or blackouts. The potential for damage is especially alarming when compounded with the increasing frequency of natural disasters.
Research labs and inverter manufacturers are taking steps to ramp-up cybersecurity within the inverter itself. However, the flow of information on the grid is really complex. There are market and load management systems that communicate with balancing authorities connected to utilities. These systems tap into project supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and, finally, the power plant controller (PPC). This leaves a lot of links within the chain vulnerable to cybersecurity risk.
Is there a solution to mitigate risk effectively? One approach is to introduce cybersecurity protection at the renewables power plant control level. Alleviating breach risk within solar plant communications helps protect the inverter and, therefore, the solar plant and grid as a whole.
Protecting the inverter through solar plant controls
First, it helps to understand some basic solar plant operations and architecture. Power plant controls consist of software and hardware, including a PPC and SCADA system. Site operators use a PPC to control plant behavior like production levels, revenue, compliance and grid stability. The PPC communicates with the plant’s SCADA system and field devices like inverters over a power plant network using industry-standard communication protocols like Modbus, TCP or DNP3. The SCADA system serves as a security gateway that allows or restricts the flow of information between the plant and inverter networks.
The hardware and software associated with the plant control and SCADA systems are housed within an enclosure in a substation outside of the solar plant. They connect to the inverter and other field devices through a network of fiber-optic cables.
Attacks can occur anywhere along the plant architecture. Hackers can embed malicious malware onto the inverter’s communication board, plug into the port of the enclosure that hosts the fiber-optic cables or infiltrate the plant control network. Such events can jeopardize the plant’s reliability by tripping a circuit breaker at the point of interconnection or curtailing inverters to disrupt power generation, rapidly affecting the project’s power output. Even more damage could be done by controlling the inverter’s reactive power injection or absorption, leading to grid voltage spikes or drops.

So what’s to be done?
As inverter manufacturers work to strengthen security directly within the inverter’s communication board, added protection along the power plant control system creates further safeguards. For example, an intrusion alarm can signal operators through the SCADA system if the door to the fiber optic network enclosure has been opened. Operators can also include a list of authorized users to restrict access to plant controls according to IP addresses. It’s even possible to define what type of device is allowed to exchange information in a network port and instruct the system to block anything else.
As an added measure of protection, Merit Controls also recommends security methods more specific to inverters, such as separating each device’s IP network so that one inverter can’t ‘talk’ directly to another. All communication must occur through the secure SCADA system, which filters traffic. A plant control system also continuously monitors inverter configurations — manufacturer programs for how to regulate frequency, voltage ride-through and more on a specific site. Hackers could potentially change these values and jeopardize the plant’s reliability, but the right renewables plant control systems will alert operators immediately if a change is detected.
Another recommendation we suggest is to use ring communication protocols for fault redundancy. Ring protocols dictate how field devices like inverters are connected to communicate — in this case, in a ring rather than in a linear configuration. This means if one inverter is down for maintenance, the rest of the network will still be able to talk, hence avoiding the whole system disconnecting due to a single point of failure.
We recommend using standard naming conventions and communication protocols (media redundancy protocol (MRP) for ring topology; OPC UA, Modbus or DNP3 protocols for the SCADA system filtering, IEC 61131-3 for vendor-independent programming language, etc.) because proprietary or third-party protocols can introduce more risk. Standards widely accepted by the industry make it easier to audit the plant and troubleshoot issues to ensure long-term project success.
Future-proofing against attacks
As cybersecurity threats only continue to proliferate, security officials are adjusting existing cybersecurity programs. For example, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) recently partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy on two pilot projects within the organization’s Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Program (CRISP) to capture data from SCADA and industrial control systems. NERC plans to use this data to help monitor for hacking and strengthen grid security. Also, NERC’s Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (E-ISAC) is working to guard against malicious activity on utilities’ business networks.
The pilots help advance how CRISP collects and shares information, and should help identify threats to utilities’ industrial control systems by capturing “raw and/or refined operational technology data” and comparing it with data that utilities send to them.
On behalf of our clients, Merit Controls monitors daily ICS-CERT alerts from the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency to stay updated on new vulnerabilities and attacks. We recommend project stakeholders do the same. Making sure the SCADA and PPC firmware is always up to date is important too.
It’s hard to say what the next cyberattack on power generation systems will look like, or where it will come from. What we do know is that taking security measures now will ensure the best possible protection for inverters and other important solar plant components. At Merit Controls, safeguarding the components that power our grid is not only our ethos, it is also our responsibility as a vendor in this industry. A smart cybersecurity framework will protect solar and other distributed energy resources, ensuring the security of our critical infrastructure and enabling the advancement of a cleaner, secure and more resilient grid.
Tom Kuster is the CEO of Merit Controls. Merit has teamed up with Sungrow to provide turnkey technology solutions to address cybersecurity concerns.

Nurses, respiratory therapists, physicians and asthma educators need to partner with patients in order to minimize the impact of asthma on their lives, according to Cary Sennett, MD, PhD, president and CEO of the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA), and Fellow of the American College of Physicians.
The primary focus of asthma control is to reduce impairment and risk by working with patients to understand the severity of their asthma, identify ways to control the disease and measure how responsive they are to their asthma plan, said Robert Jones, RRT, RPFT, AE-C, certified asthma educator, Memorial Medical Center in Ashland, Wisc.
Have Asthma Rates Decreased?
The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2013 revealed, after years of steady increase, a significant decrease in “self-reported prevalence” of asthma. As reported by the CDC, the percentage of persons of all ages who experienced an asthma episode in 2013 was 3.8% (95% confidence interval = 3.53%-4.02%), significantly lower than the 2012 estimate of 4.4%.
While happy that reports like this get people thinking and talking about asthma, Sennett finds the results surprising and instructs others to interpret with some caution.
Even if the prevalence of asthma has come down, Sennett reminds us there are still 25 million Americans suffering from asthma. “We can’t become complacent about asthma but rather need to continue to minimize environmental risks for those individuals, provide access to care, and educate about the disease,” he said.
The CDC conducted household interviews to collect data from a sample of the civilian non-institutionalized population. Information on an episode of asthma or asthma attack during 2013 was self-reported by adults aged 18 and over. For children under age 18, the information was collected from an adult family member knowledgeable about the child’s health.
Sennett believes there are methodological issues that might affect the results. Noting that the survey was primarily conducted via telephone, he explained asthma prevalence rates are “highest among urban poor who are the least likely to have landlines so they might have been more difficult to reach. This could skew the results.”
NHIS results are widely distributed and could be misinterpreted by consumers and policymakers at the local, state and national levels. “We need to take a step back and make sure we really understand what these prevalence results mean, before reacting to the report,” Sennett said. “The CDC reported data for 2013. We should be cautious about what a single year’s results mean: one data point does not make a trend.”
Asthma statistics suggest prevalence in urban, disadvantaged populations is higher than in other populations, Sennett told ADVANCE. “Asthma affects all Americans, but a disproportionate share of the burden of illness falls to those in urban settings-regrettably, many of whom are children.”
According to Jones, the statistics in Wisconsin show the number of local asthma cases have stabilized or increased slightly. “We don’t have the triggers that other places have,” he said. “We have pollen and tree pollen but we don’t have smog or other allergens that are a problem in big cities.”
Educate the Masses
Air quality, a significant trigger for asthma, is poorer in urban than in suburban settings. Additional triggers include dust, mites, rodents, cockroaches and other environmental allergens that are harder to clear or dispose of in urban settings, and in particular, in homes where individuals may not have the financial means to deal with infestation and other triggers.
“The presence of mites, dust, air pollution and other allergenic triggers accounts for the higher rate of asthma in urban areas,” Sennett said.
AAFA provides a certification program that allows individuals to recognize products in the marketplace that can help reduce allergens and pollutants. “After rigorous testing, we put a seal on products or services that help reduce allergen exposure,” Sennett said. “Our organization has evaluated and certified vacuums, air conditioners and other household products.”
According to Sennett, the air quality issue needs to be solved but will require vigilance over many years. “Locally, we need to educate people who work with patients who have asthma; patients with asthma; and parents of children with asthma about what they can do to mitigate risks at home and in the workplace and schools,” he said.
People need to be educated about what triggers asthma, but also how to use medications to prevent and control episodes when they occur. “We need to make sure that people have access to medications but also know how to use them and understand the importance of compliance with controller medications,” Sennett said.
Jones agrees that educating patients about asthma, including the types of things that can trigger asthma and what they can do to improve their quality of life, is the cornerstone of asthma care. He encourages patients to take allergy tests to discover their specific allergies. Common irritants and triggers include hayfever, cats, dust, mold, perfume and secondhand smoke.
“We can usually pinpoint a change in lifestyle, such as adding a pet to the household, that is triggering asthma,” Jones said. “We can treat with medication so patients can continue to live the lifestyle they are looking for and not have to live without their pets, for example.”
Diagnosis & Treatment
Jones spends about 50% of his time working in the cardiopulmonary department where he conducts tests such as the methacholine challenge test, a definitive test for asthma for those older than 5 years old.
Jones spends up to one and a half hours interviewing patients during an assessment. He has the patients fill out an asthma control test (ACT test), which asks a series of relevant questions to collect information including number of nighttime awakenings, a profile of activity level and effects of asthma on activity level.
Once Jones has conducted a pulmonary function test, he then identifies a step-by-step plan to manage the patient’s asthma. “I administer tests for asthma and make recommendations to physicians on how to treat and manage patients with asthma,” Jones said.
Jones helps patients establish goals about their activity level and determine what they want to change to achieve those goals. “Then we can monitor their activity limitations, pulmonary function testing, frequency of symptoms, and manage their asthma to achieve those goals by possibly increasing or decreasing medications as needed,” he explained.
Role of Allied Health
Nurse practitioners and physicians should apply the knowledge and resources collected by asthma educators to help manage their patients with asthma. “We use a step-wise approach that can help the care of asthma patients,” Jones said. “We put all of the elements together during the visit to make an asthma care plan.”
Jones became interested in the asthma educator role when credentialing opened up to nurses, doctors, RTs, social workers and pharmacists. “With the certification, I feel more confident and prepared making recommendations to physicians regarding treatment of this patient population,” he stated. “Further, there are resources available to reinforce my suggestions.”
AAFA educates allied health professionals, asthma educators and nurses who can help patients who are at risk for or who have asthma. The organization offers an online education program for providers and offers free continuing education credits, all targeted at non-physician providers.
The organization educates patients as well by providing tools on its website,, that can be used to assess triggers in their home and environment and to identify ways to reduce the severity of their (or their child’s) illness. “We focus on helping patients, caregivers and policymakers to understand and address the issues of asthma,” Sennett said.
Asthma is truly a life threatening disease, Sennett added. He would like organizations to focus on addressing the issues that limit the lives of those suffering from asthma. “We are nowhere near eliminating the disease,” he said. “But, there are many things we can do better to reduce the impact that asthma has on the lives of those with the disease.”

Oklahoma City Thunder forward Kevin Durant missed his fourth straight game on Thursday due to what the reigning MVP is calling a “bad ankle sprain.” Durant sustained the injury prior to halftime of OKC’s 109-114 loss to the Golden State Warriors on December 18th, and he has been labeled day-to-day ever since. Durant spoke to Darnell Mayberry of NewsOK.com regarding the ailment, and told him that “I can’t walk.”
Q: What’s going on with the ankle?
A: I can’t play basketball. I can’t run. I can’t cut. I can’t jump. I’m not just sitting out just because. If I could play I would play. But I can’t play.
Q: On a scale of one to 10, how bad would you say it is?
A: I don’t really know. I just know that I can’t really do what I want to do. I can’t cut. I can’t move. I can’t run. So if I would just go out there and force it I would be terrible. I wouldn’t be able to help my team out. It hurts.
When asked if we could expect a return anytime soon, Durant responded with “I don’t know. It’s day-by-day man.” Unfortunately for Durant, the ankle injury is to the same foot he underwent surgery on prior to the season. Durant suffered a Jones fracture in his right foot on October 12th, and was forced to miss the Thunder’s first 17 games of the season.
Q: It’s been announced as a mild ankle sprain, but now with you missing your fourth game people are getting a little concerned that maybe it’s something more than a mild sprain. Do you feel like it’s more than a mild sprain? You’ve suffered sprains in the past. How is this different than what you’ve felt in the past?
A:.
Durant has appeared in nine games for the Thunder this year, and has averaged 22.4 points, 5 rebounds and 3.6 assists in those contests. Oklahoma City will host the Charlotte Hornets on Friday before traveling to Dallas on Sunday to take on the Mavericks

One thought on “FRIENDS blanket CAL pt 2”The City of Medford plans to begin construction this summer on the Oregon 62-Owen/Coker Butte project in northeast Medford. The highway project is designed to improve traffic flow, safety, and reduce congestion on both Crater Lake Highway and Crater Lake Avenue.
“This project will improve safety and congestion on both city streets in north Medford and Crater Lake Highway,” said Medford City Engineer Larry Beskow.
According to Beskow, the overall cost of the$11.2 million, two-year project makes the following improvements:
• Moves the Cardinal Avenue traffic signal south to the improved Owen Drive, which will become a four-way intersection;
• Limits right turns only at the intersection of Cardinal Avenue and Oregon 62;
• Closes the existing Webfood and Coker Butte Road intersections east of Oregon 62; and
• Improves Crater Lake Avenue by moving it farther back from the highway at both Owen Drive and the new four-way Coker Butte intersection. This will improve the safety of the intersections by removing the frequent conflicts that arise because the intersections are too close to one another.
“These changes will also improve north-south connectivity in east Medford by connecting Springbrook Road to Owen Drive, north of Delta Waters Road,” Beskow said.
Apart from this project, the City of Medford is also in negotiations with WalMart to allow access from Owen Drive to Lear Way between the Costco and WalMart stores. According to Beskow, this will also help improve connectivity in the area.

Infants are exposed to mercury from several sources, such as their mother’s mercury fillings, flu shots containing mercury, ingesting fish, and from inhaling coal power plant emissions. Approximately 630,000 infants are born every year with high levels of mercury in their blood. Numerous studies show that mercury has detrimental effects on child development.
Kaiser Permanente has a conflict of interest on this matter because they promote a policy that exposes pregnant women to mercury (thimerosal) our petition requesting that Kaiser Permanente release this data to the researchers at Mercury Free Baby.

A Proclamation on National Family Week, 2021
My father lived by a motto: that family members was the beginning, the middle, and
My father lived by a motto: that family members was the beginning, the middle, and the conclusion. In the course of National Family members Week, we rejoice American people, realize the importance of expending time with relatives, and reaffirm our commitment to investing in our Nation’s households.
From the commencing of my marketing campaign for President, I said that my aim was to construct our financial state from the bottom up and the middle out and give America’s hard-working family members some considerably essential respiration area. This work is specially important, provided the simple fact that the COVID-19 pandemic has presented so numerous troubles for families. Many family members struggled with dropped jobs or food items insecurity. Before schools reopened, mothers and fathers and caregivers had to get on more tasks this sort of as helping their little ones with on the net learning, numerous whilst working from home. So several of us went months without the need of hugging a parent, grandparent, or grandchild. Far too many families said goodbye to a liked one — leaving an vacant chair at the desk and a gap in their hearts.
When I took place of work, I took immediate motion to guide people by means of my Administration’s American Rescue Plan. The American Rescue Program has supplied income help to thousands and thousands of working households, supported faculties in securely providing in-man or woman instruction, and shipped an expanded Kid Tax Credit rating, which is lifting hundreds of thousands of youngsters and people out of poverty. It also authorized us to put into action our COVID-19 vaccination method — a person of the fastest vaccination courses at any time, just one that is now open to all People in america ages five and up, and just one that is preserving hundreds of thousands of people.
Now even bigger progress for America’s family members is in sight. My Administration’s Construct Again Superior Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Expenditure and Positions Act will further strengthen and assistance our Nation’s people. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Expense and Employment Act will enable us to substitute guide pipes and company traces that are poisoning our children and families whilst the other investments in the monthly bill will bolster communities and produce hundreds of thousands of superior jobs. My Administration’s Create Again Better Act will deliver totally free and universal preschool, the premier financial investment in child treatment in our Nation’s background, an enlargement of the Cost-effective Treatment Act, and a tax lower for hundreds of thousands of people with children. In addition, I will keep on to force for developing a paid out spouse and children and health care depart system so that no American need to make the tough selection involving perform and caring for by themselves or a family member.
Throughout National Relatives 7 days, we reaffirm that our Nation is stronger mainly because of the really like, compassion, and care that our households share. In this time of thanksgiving, let us continue on to lift up our tough-doing the job people and unite in support of our long run generations.
NOW, Hence, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of The united states, by advantage of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the legislation of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 21 via November 27, 2021, as National Loved ones Week. I invite States, communities, and men and women to be part of together in observing this week with ideal ceremonies and pursuits to honor our Nation’s family members.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of November, in the 12 months of our Lord two thousand twenty-just one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.

“A Writer’s Playground” –A place to find wordplay, writing, and monthly calendar activities for kids and those young at heart.
Jump on the November Writing Bandwagon.
What is a bandwagon?
Why would I say that there is a November writing bandwagon? Because it’s true. Read this article from 2012 for ideas shared about this writing movement. When I did a Google search, this article was first on the list. I follow this particular group’s blog; so I chose it for a link. Go Paper Wait group!
Those of you in the USA, what do you think of when you hear “November?” My guess is that Thanksgiving would be the number one response. If you’re a writer and you’d like to write a novel in a month (50,000 words), you probably think of National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) when someone says “November.” Join others here:
If you prefer to write shorter works, but would still like to be part of a group, consider joining Tara Lazar’s program for Picture book writers called Picture Book Idea Month (PiBoIdMo). The goal: to record one picture book idea per day for the month of November.
Here’s the badge I proudly display to show I am registered for PiBoIdMo. Learn more below.
Julie Hedlund has posted a video as a promo for PiBoIdMo. She describes this as “the most wonderful time of the year.”
Julie designed her own program to encourage writers to turn 12 picture book ideas into 12 manuscripts. She suggests beginning with PiBoIdMo. See here:
I have decided to comb the following November activities for picture book manuscript ideas. Maybe you’d like to join me. If not, consider celebrating one or more of the events mentioned here to add “spice to your life.” For the meaning of this expression, check here: By the way, many people add spices to holiday cooking, and it’s fast becoming that time of year!

Eaten by a Lion
This weekend, I had to say goodbye to some very old friends who have been my best buddies for many years. It wasn’t my fault, really. It’s just that, for me, Lion went GM.
I’ve been Mac OS X Lioned-up since around about March or maybe earlier, but having slashed open an artery to sign in blood I wasn’t able to say anything about Lion. I had to mention Mac OS 10.7 in only the vaguest terms in case the Infinity Loop Patrol noticed, clicker-click their sawn-offs ready to blast me to smithereens in a dark alleyway.
When my Mac rebooted in the trusty, old Mac OS Snow Leopard 10.6 partition, to convert it to the new OS, I ran back to Lion with relief. I hated Lion at first, then I bought a trackpad, found alternatives to applications, and now think it’s the best OS since…err…the change between Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X. Yes, it’s that good.
However, we have lost a load of friends in this last switch. With a bit of brilliant forward thinking, I have a sparse disk image of my entire Snow Leopard disk start-up, complete with Applications and Users folders. Belt and braces just in case, eh?
I managed to get an Iomega external 2 TB hard drive, which had been designed to sit under a Mac mini server until Apple redesigned the Mini’s case. As a hint, it means there are some superb FireWire 800/400/USB 2 drives waiting for someone to find them on the Web. I love the way the drive spins up with an ooh-wup sound, and it sits neatly on top of a Mac Pro, matching aluminium casing and looking exactly unlike any other desktop drive I have ever seen. “Mac-top” would be a better description.
The loss of old friends is a heavy burden. Gone are FreeHand, Adobe Suites CS 2 and 3, Switch, VisualHub, Turbo.264, can Call of Duty UO MP (ooh). In fact, there are so many that I can’t bear the loss without shedding a tear or two. We have many workarounds, such as using Apple’s free Image Capture to get scans into Photoshop. And Pages or Sun Office has replaced Word, and Handbrake steps up for VisualHub or Turbo.264.
It could be time to investigate virtual OSes to run the old PowerPC applications, but how far back does one go? After all, Steam does exactly the same with its Mac OS games. We miss Vette and good old StarTrek, AfterDark, Streamline, and Talking Moose, but those are things the kids nowadays think are films on DVD rather than CRT or LCD.
One thing’s for sure: my partner (still PowerPC-based) and I are heartily sick of the interface Adobe slaps on its applications. We have been using them for more than 20 years and still think they are the dog’s vomit. If Mac OS X Lion forces us to find new vector graphic and pixel editors, it’s not a bad thing. As my partner said, “Adobe’s interfaces rival the worst Microsoft has designed,” which means the absolutely daft Ribbon of its latest Office. Why break a paradigm without offering something better?
Which was my first thought about Lion—until I let it get its teeth into me.Index of Gardiner's History of England

Once in a while I will start a book, and I cannot put it down. For me Girl boss is one of those books.
I had heard about this book floating around for some time, however I just never wound up getting it. That was until I decided to browse a favourite book store, and there it was, sitting on a pile of recommendations. I am so happy I decided to get this book, because it has been one of the best things I’ve bought in a long time! I am so excited each time I get to open up the next chapter, to get to know more about Sophia Amoruso, her life, her work ethic and just the interesting and hilarious stories from her youth. This is not only enjoyable to read, but a great insight into this fabulous and inspiring woman, it is the perfect book for me right now.
2016 is extremely exciting for me, I’m motivated to push myself into finding the best career for me and become a girl boss in my own right. I also want to make sure that I do not go back to the stressed out person I was when I started this blog. I love this book so much, I felt compelled to write this post before I have even finished reading it!
If you do one thing today, this week or this month…buy this book!
Thanks for reading everyone 🙂

Disclaimer: This post is sponsored by USA Rice and The Feedfeed. As always, all opinions are my own. Thank you for supporting brands that help run this site!
Teriyaki pork meatballs are basically the perfect meal prep recipe. I typically dont do a ton of meal prepping since I make a handful of new blog recipes every week, but I must admit that having meatballs on hand is absolutely a good idea.
These pork meatballs are made with ground pork (duh!) and coated in the most delicious teriyaki sauce. Its sticky and sweet and gives these meatballs tons of flavor.
But you cant just eat meatballs on their own. I mean, you totally can, but these meatballs are even better when paired with U.S.-grown jasmine rice. The quality of U.S.-grown rice is impeccable and youll be happy knowing that the rice was harvested with care. Did you know 95% of rice grown in the U.S. is grown on family-owned farms?
WHY THESE PORK MEATBALLS ARE SO GOOD
- Theyre seared over the stove then baked, meaning theyre the perfect texture
- The teriyaki sauce is out-of-this-world delicious, but also made with ingredients you already have on hand
- The meatballs are great on their own, but taken up a notch when paired with U.S.-grown jasmine rice
TERIYAKI MEATBALL INGREDIENTS
Pork: The recipe calls for ground pork, but you can absolutely substitute it for your favorite ground meat, like beef, turkey or chicken.
Soy sauce: Soy sauce is a good starting ingredients for many Asian-based sauce recipes. If you want to sub it for something else, try tamari, which is basically just a gluten free soy sauce. You could also try using coconut aminos, though that will change the flavor (itll still be good, just a little bit sweeter tasting).
Breadcrumbs: The breadcrumbs help to hold the meatballs together, plus they add a little extra flavor. I like using plain panko breadcrumbs, and I actually tested these with gluten free panko breadcrumbs and they worked out great! If you cant find panko/want a sub, any sort of breadcrumbs will work, just make sure theyre plain vs. Italian flavored.
Maple syrup: The maple syrup adds a hint of sweetness to the sauce, and it pairs perfectly with soy sauce, but you could also use honey. Basically, you just want some sort of sugar to help create the correct flavor.
Cornstarch: Cornstarch is *key* if you want the sauce to thicken (which you do!). Once the cornstarch is mixed with the other sauce ingredients then heated, itll thicken the sauce so that its no longer water-y (is there anything worse than water-y sauce?!). If youre looking for a substitution, give arrowroot a try.
U.S.-grown Jasmine rice: Ive been working with USA Rice and The Feedfeed to create delicious recipes using U.S.-grown rice, and high-quality U.S.-grown jasmine rice is simply the best. Its sticky (in a good way!) and is a great base for this meatball recipe.
TIPS FOR MAKING THE BEST PORK MEATBALLS
Dont over-mix the meat: What does this mean? If you over-work the meat, the end result will be dry, tough meatballs, which we dont want. The same thing applies when actually forming the meat into meatballs. Form them gently, and resist the urge to pack the meatballs too tightly.
Do a taste test before cooking the meatballs: Yes, Im serious, but I dont mean that you should eat raw meat. Instead, form a mini meatball and fry it up in a skillet, then taste it and adjust the seasonings as needed. With that said, remember that with this recipe, at least half or more of the flavor comes from the sauce, so the end result WILL be flavorful.
Teriyaki Pork Meatballs
Ingredients
for the meatballs:
- 1 lb. ground pork*
- 1/4 cup yellow onion diced
- 2 scallions sliced
- 3 garlic cloves minced
- 1 egg
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1/2 cup plain panko breadcrumbs
for the sauce:
- 3 garlic cloves minced
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tbsp maple syrup
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1/2 tsp grated ginger
- 2 tbsp cornstarch or arrowroot
for serving:
- 2 cups U.S.-grown jasmine rice
- 1 head broccoli roasted
- scallions for garnish
Instructions
- Start by cooking the rice: Add rice to a saucepan over the stove and cook it according to the package instructions. At this time, you should also preheat the oven to 400.
- Add all meatball ingredients to a large bowl and use a spoon or your hands to mix everything together. You want everything to be combined, but you don't want to over-mix it. Then, use your hands to form the mixture into approximately 18 meatballs, placing them directly into an oven-safe skillet.
- Pan fry the meatballs for 3-5 minutes, or until they're golden on all sides. Then, place the entire skillet into the oven and bake the meatballs for 15-20 minutes, or until they're cooked through.
- While the meatballs are baking, make the sauce: whisk soy sauce, syrup, vinegar, ginger, and cornstarch together and set aside.
- Once the meatballs are cooked, remove them from the oven and place the skillet on the stove over medium-low heat. Add the minced garlic to the skillet and stir for 1-2 minutes, then pour the sauce into the skillet and use a spoon to stir until the meatballs are coated with sauce. The sauce should thicken and that's a good thing! If it seems too thick, add 1 tbsp water.
- Serve the meatballs over U.S.-grown jasmine rice with a side of broccoli (or your favorite vegetable) and enjoy!

The Palace Gardens
The masonry consolidation and the archaeological
campaing carried out in this unique garden, have
revealed interesting data so as to imagine what this
space could have been like. Amongst these findings
are the discovery of several fountains, their hydraulic system and the colorful nymphaeum attached to the southern wall.
The palace's gardens of the Dukes of Frias, built during the 16th and 17th centuries, admired by former kings and courtiers, are still to be found in their original layout covering the steep slope of the monumental walled enceinte. The Gardens, structured in six stepped terraces allowed impressive views into the surrounding countryside.
On the slope's uper area two terraces can be perceibed. In the historic map they are named "Lonja"(walking corridor) and "Banco para verduras"(Terrace for vegetables). In the lower four gardens can be found arranged in an "L" shape; they are called "Jardín más alto" (Highest garden), "Jardín alto" (Upper garden); "Jardín en ondo" (Lower walled garden) or the so-called Winter Garden; and a second "Jardín en alto" (Upper garden). The last ones have a strong ornamental character due to the presence in each of them of central fountains, some of which have been found during the archaeological campaign carried out. In order to provide water for the fountains, a former waterwheel brought water from outside the wall to the interior enceinte. It was located between the Jardín "en ondo" (Lower walled garden) and the "Jardín alto" (Upper garden). This waterwheel carried the water along water runnels located on the wall supplying by gravity the existing fountains.
The Winter Garden is located on the slope, in a sunken space as regards the other gardens and thus making it singularly different from them. It was therefore an ideal place to enjoy the morning sun, sheltered from the cold wins in wintertime and enjoying great privacy so as to be intimate garden of the Dukes of Frias. Current research and restoration interventions are taking place in thisgarden as regards masonry consolidation and an archaeological campaing that has revealed interesting data about this unique space.
Within these findings stand out the nymphaeum and its fountain basin, which has been sheltered; the remains of
a circular fountain, diferent hidraulic conductions and the
balaustrade that topped the perimeter garden wall. Likewise, during the archaeological campaing work undertaken in the upper garden a fountain basin has been unearthed. This fountain was the central piece of a covered loggia from where the surrounding landscape could be admired.

Robinson has been found guilty of killing three women in Kansas, stuffing the bodies of two of them in barrels on land Robinson owned in Kansas. Robinson is also accused in the deaths of two women and a teen-age girl whose bodies were found in a storage locker Robinson had rented in Raymore in Cass County. Cass County prosecutors say they will use much of the evidence disclosed during the trial in Johnson County, Kansas against Robinson when his trial begins in Missouri which is expected to be sometime in the spring. The jury in Olathe, Kansas deliberated for more than 11 hours over two days before finding Robinson guilty of killing Suzette Trouten, Izabela Lewicka, and Lisa Stasi. The penalty phase of the case is underway. Robinson was arrested June 2, 2000 at his Olathe trailer home. The next day, authorities found the bodies in Kansas. Two days later, they discovered the bodies in Raymore.Investigations happen all the time, and many people are either declared to remain innocent or proven guilty. This president should be grateful to the process that it was exhaustive and thorough.
This president should quit acting as though he is the only person who ever was investigated for something that he was close enough to, that it warranted a look. Remember that across America many investigations are not as thorough, and many innocent people litter our jail cells and prisons.
President Trump constantly talks about “witch hunts,” but does he remember where that term comes from? Remember all the innocent people actually hanged for being “witches”?

Card CommentsI traveled to Caroline’s hometown of Fayetteville, NC for her bridal session and could not have been more excited about it. I’ve said it a million times, but I’ll say it again: I love seeing the places that are important to people and how it’s made them who they are today. It makes me feel like I get to know them on a fast track, and this session was no different. Caroline decided that there were three things that were important for her to include in her session: her sweet dog, her grandmother’s backyard and the quaint downtown of Fayetteville where her family’s business has been for 100 years. If you ask me, I’d say we nailed those three things perfectly.
I’m convinced that Caroline’s dress was made for her. It’s simple and elegant, yet unique with the brocade subtle pattern, just like her. Add her momma’s lace veil and her piercing blue eyes, and you’ve got a showstopper. It’s hard to believe, but she looked even more beautiful on her wedding day this past weekend because there was a glow about her that was different than this day as she joined hands with Ian and committed her life to him. I can’t wait to show you the pictures from their incredible wedding day!

People living in areas with higher levels of green vegetation have been found to have lower levels of depression, increased social engagement and higher levels of physical activity.
Being in or near nature helps to alleviate mental fatigue and restore the mind, which can improve job and school performance and help to reduce mental stress and illness. One study from the Harvard School of Public Health of 100,000 women nationwide determined that women living in the highest levels of greenness had a 12% lower rate of death compared to women who lived in the least green areas.Dan the Geek has been working with beautifully crisp ePaper displays of late. He’s taken the concept of a “magic calendar” updated via Google calendar (video below) and realized the design with a 4.2″ ePaper display and an Adafruit Feather HUZZAH 32 microcontroller.
I used the following items to create my version of the “Magic Calendar”:
- Adafruit HUZZAH 32 Feather (Arduino compatible microcontroller, stacking headers version)
- Waveshare 4.2 e-Paper module
- A custom Featherwing to connect the e-Paper module to the HUZZAH 32
- The IoT Calendar service to parse iCalendar feeds for IoT devices (iotcalendar.org)
- Custom code for displaying the calendar, events, temperature and moon phase.
I have tested this with both the Adafruit HUZZAH 8266 and Adafruit HUZZAH 32. The HUZZAH 32 version actually works much better for larger e-Paper displays like the 4.2 inch display used here due to the increased memory usage needed to hold the display buffer. This could work on the HUZZAH 8266 if using a smaller e-Paper display. Waveshare makes e-Paper devices in several different sizes.
Dan writes:
I made a custom Featherwing to make it easier to connect the Waveshare module to the HUZZAH device. In addition to making it easy to connect the 8 wires from the display, the custom Featherwing also includes a reset button and two additional buttons for software use. I use the additional buttons to put the device into a web based setup mode. I will be releasing this custom Featherwing on Tindie for those interested in it. Although Waveshare provides a graphics library for drawing on the e-paper display, I instead used the Adafruit GFX library, which was very easy to use with the display.Iron and Steel Converting byproducts to feedstock Steele.Get Price
When I was growing up in the early 1960s in Washington, DC, it was nearly impossible to find a Mother’s Day card for my working mother.
The cards all talked about moms who did not work outside the home; but my mother didn’t have a choice whether to work or not. At 43, she became a widow with five children, ranging in age from 12 to 4.
And as my sister said in her eulogy, our mother was no saint. Like far too many in this world then and now, she self-medicated her depression with alcohol.
But now we live in a world with antidepressants and 12-step programs of recovery for any addiction, from anorexia to spending. AA was just 18 years old and no women in it when my father died suddenly from a heart attack in 1957, sending my mother into a lifelong depression that was never treated. The Social Security death benefit is what kept us afloat.
As my oldest brother put it, “No matter how bad things are, I just think about how our mother woke up the day after he died, with five kids, no savings and a Grade 4 government job; life will never be that hard for any of us.”
Since this brain injury gradually sent me from healthy to wheelchair-bound within five months, I realized that my mother had modeled a kind of strength that I had never really appreciated until now.
So once I beat the odds and survived, I was determined to get my life back to as “normal” as I could. And I have never worked so hard in my life.
I have set and achieved many small goals from being able to stand, then walk, to being able to safely be home alone. But the changes are so gradual, it often takes the reaction of a person who hasn’t seen me for months to make me realize how far I’ve come.

We’d like to personally thank you for adding the AVENSI glassware to your new coffee ritual. AVENSI is a completely new way to appreciate coffee and we can’t express how much it means to us to have you join us in this movement to elevate the way people drink and experience coffee.
ICOSA Brewhouse is a small team with a big vision to change coffee. Founded by 3 coffee loving friends, our mission is to change the way people perceive coffee: from quick consumption to an immersive experience.
With the AVENSI glassware line, the idea that you can interact with your coffee in a way that actually impacts the flavor is what we hope will encourage more and more coffee drinkers to enjoy and appreciate coffee in a way never before possible.
AVENSI to us means an ‘adventure of the senses’. Coffee is an everyday adventure–being able to slow down and appreciate the moment by exploring the diverse flavors of our coffee.
Like you, we believe coffee is not just a drink that should be quickly consumed. It’s an experience that should be fully enjoyed & appreciated. Welcome to the movement, and enjoy your AVENSI glasses.
Cheers,

The complexes which showed a d-d band near 750 nm in DMF are efficient binders to calf thymus DNA (K-b: 3.2 x 10(5)-2.9 x 10(6) M-1). The complexes showed significant pUC19 DNA cleavage in near-IR light of 785 nm forming center dot OH radicals and photocytotoxicity in HeLa cells in visible light with the benzo-i] dipyrido3,2-a:2',3'-c]phenazine complex 5 showing a remarkably low IC50 value of 0.036 mu M. Flow-cytometric analysis shows a high sub-G1 phase cell cycle arrest in HeLa cells by the complexes on photo-irradiation. The photocytotoxicity correlates well with the hydrophobicity, photosensitizing ability and DNA binding propensity of the complexes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Click for more info. To recognize the actual value of wellness, it is needed to understand first how it is related to good health. Click for more info. The word ‘health’ is stemmed from the Latin word ‘welp’. When translated essentially, wellness means ‘to prosper’. Attaining wellness may be achieved in varying dimensions. At one of the most fundamental degree, health involves maintaining a positive balance between mind, body and also spirit, with a focus on physical activities like breathing and movement. Some people likewise think about mental well being to be identified with spirituality, though some disagree. Click for more info. Regardless, of which measurement an individual considers themselves to be in, wellness has to do with equilibrium, and also hence can be considered as a general state of being having a positive impact on the quality of your life. (more about this page here) What after that is it that comprises health? There are lots of aspects that contribute to the interpretation and meaning of health. Among them include the 5 dimensions of health: Physical, psychological, social, emotional and also spiritual. When we mention an equilibrium in these dimensions, we are speaking about maintaining a specific quantity of stress off of several of the measurements, while guaranteeing the others are maintained ideal degrees. (more about this page here) This can take different kinds consisting of eating right, exercising, resting and also watching one’s weight and also total wellness. Along with this, lots of people also think that wellness implies having a spiritual awakening or connection to something larger than oneself. There are various explanations as to the presence as well as elements of wellness. According to many religious and also spiritual believers, wellness is necessary to achieve God’s objective for production as well as life. (more about this page here) They believe that health issues results from separation from God, while death confirms that people have left their spiritual and emotional link as well as passed away from their spiritual objective. Click for more info. According to clinical reasoning, health is determined by a combination of physical, psychological, and emotional aspects. As physical health and health issues are a result of the body’s response to tension and emotional trauma, one can additionally claim that mental as well as psychological wellness is a necessary part of health. While those explanation is one possible description of health, several scientists discount it out of hand, mentioning that there are way too many variables affecting the presence and meaning of the dimension. Researchers believe that there are 7 measurements of health and wellness. The first measurement is where we get our physical health, such as our ability to hear, see, taste, odor, and stroll. Click for more info. The second measurement is connected with our bodily habits and the beliefs we have relating to those practices (which can end up being self-sustaining). The third dimension relate to environmental variables, such as our direct exposure to physical or mental stress, our ideas about those conditions, our sense of power and control, and our connection to the media. The 4th dimension is associated with our sense of objective or meaning. Click for more info. This dimension relates to our capability to produce as well as maintain meaningful partnerships with others as well as to determine and also seek possibilities when faced with difficulty. Click for more info. Thus, the fifth dimension is concentrated on our social links or social partnerships, such as our capability to develop as well as preserve significant partnerships with our close friends and colleagues. The sixth measurement considers our professional tasks and also just how these tasks influence our productivity and also our wellness. Click for more info. The seventh measurement describes the structure of our work and our relationships with our colleagues. Hence, well being has wonderful relevance for society as entire as well as for each person within it. Click for more info.

[Good Read: Can You Wash Leather?]
Table of Contents
Surface Cleaning
The safest way to clean your leather backpack is to do it manually by hand, of course. This will help you control the areas and the pressure in which you use to clean the backpack. It will also allow you to avoid clasps and other fastenings to prevent any scratches or damage to the surface of leather. You will need to follow a simple 5-step guide to get the best out of it.
1. Prepare the backpack
Make sure you empty the backpack and remove any loose fastenings. Unclip the straps if possible so you can easily clean the backpack. It seems silly to even mention such a step, but there are people who throw their backpacks directly into the washing machine…with their belongings inside. Therefore, we would rather be safe and say more than necessary.
2. Prepare the cleaning solution
We have covered 5 best leather cleaners here. The article has “for purses” in the title, but these cleaning solutions are perfectly suitable for any leather backpack, briefcase, wallet or other leather product.
So, prepare one of the solutions (you should start with #1 and work your way down if unsuccessful), or if you prefer, there are leather cleaners that can be used to clean your leather backpack, which will help to enhance the life of your leather.
3. Clean your leather backpack
In small, circular motions, start to clean your leather backpack using a soft rag. Do not use too much water as you only want to clean the surface and not soak the leather through. It is also important that you use a soft cloth to prevent any scratches to the surface of leather.
If you are using dish soap, you can gently clean the clasps of the backpack.
4. Air dry your backpack
As much as you want your bag to dry quickly, it is important to let it air dry and do not place it in the dryer as the heat from the dryer could cause it to warp or otherwise damage the backpack. If you wonder how long does it take for a leather backpack to dry, this article here will answer that question.
5. Treat the backpack
After it is completely dry, use a leather conditioner or balsam on your backpack. This will stop the back from feeling too stiff and prevent any cracks in the bag. As an added bonus, it will also make it more resistant to stains, helping your backpack look fresh and clean longer.
Washing Machine
Now, you are probably wondering if instead of following all those steps above you could simply throw it into a washing machine and see the magic happen with no effort. There is no direct answer to that, as there are many factors involved in whether or not your leather backpack would survive the watery spin.
However, in general, if the backpack is of very high-quality, meaning it was made of full grain or top grain leathers, then yes, they would survive. You would need to apply a lot of leather balsam afterwards to return the shininess and beauty to the backpack, but it’s possible. If, however, you bought a cheap “leather” backpack, then it was probably made of cheap bonded leather, and such a product would certainly not survive such a wash.
[Good Read: Differences Between Top Grain and Bonded Leather]
If you do choose to go this way, which is not recommended, but let’s say you still want to go there, please use the most natural cleaning solutions as possible. Ordinary washing capsules contain a lot of chemicals that can destroy the integrity of leather and therefore destroy it entirely. Even if it did survive, it would never look or feel the same.
Therefore, put in some basic soap, wash it on a very “small load” function, and let it dry naturally afterwards.
Summary
There you have it. If you did not read the article above and just dropped down to the summary to see a yes or no answer to the question “Can you wash a leather backpack?”, then the answer is yes. You can, but preferably by hand with the solutions provided in the link. However, in some cases, you could risk throwing your leather backpack into a washing machine and get it back in good shape.

The Three Lions have one foot in Russia ahead of their double-header of qualifiers against Slovenia and Lithuania.
They could qualify in the first of those appointments at Wembley on Thursday.
“It’s not over, we are very much of a positive mindset. The work isn’t finished and we will try to get the six points,” Bertrand said.
“All games internationally are tough. Slovenia will need the points but we need points as well.”
Bertrand wants to get the job done at Wembley rather than waiting to go to Lithuania.
“For me personally, with a fan’s head on, it would be nice to qualify in front of our fans, but we still have work to do.”
The behaviour of international sportsmen and women has been brought into the spotlight lately after England cricketer Ben Stokes was arrested.
Asked of the pressures of playing and living in the limelight, Bertrand added: “It comes with the game. Once you make that pledge to commit, you have to live by it. We are aware of our responsibilities 24/7.
“It is a way of life. You are not just representing yourself but your club and country and there’s great pressure.”
England will be boosted by the form of Harry Kane, who has scored 11 goals in his last six games for Tottenham.
Bertrand knows his team-mates will benefit from having such a form player in their side and has backed Kane to get the armband.
“He is in great form,” Bertrand added. “Him coming to the England camp in such fine form is a massive boost for the whole squad.
“(The captaincy) is completely down to the manager. ‘H’ gets my vote, what we are blessed with is we have a lot of leaders in the camp now and whoever is tasked with that duty on the night is deserving of that.”Vietnamese Chicken Curry with Carrots and Potatoes
This Vietnamese chicken curry is another yellow curry that is packed with loads of flavour; thanks to the clever use of my two best selling curry powder blends. Although extra patience and care is called for, it is nonetheless an easy recipe with simple ingredients. And I think it is worth the effort, as the end results will show.
As for the chicken cut, any pieces will do for this recipe. However, cuts with skin on and bone in will easily add an additional punch of fat and therefore flavour too – so use wings, thigh cutlets, drumsticks or even whole or half chicken diced up. Make sure they are all uniformly sized to cook evenly.
This curry goes well with French style baguettes, which marks the historical influence of French cuisine in Vietnam. It’s the perfect bread to mop up all the juice, and you can easily find these baguettes at your local Vietnamese bakery.
Ingredients − Serves 10
- 2 kg chicken, any cut chopped into large chunky pieces

The British Alpaca Society wrote a letter of complaint to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Environment Secretary George Eustice and various Government officials over the way the animal was removed from his owner’s farm.
Police officers and staff from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) arrived at Helen Macdonald’s farm near Wickwar in South Gloucestershire on August 31.
Geronimo, who had twice tested positive for bovine tuberculosis, was tied with white rope before being scanned for a microchip and then pulled through a field to a waiting trailer.
Less than 90 minutes after leaving the property, Defra confirmed the animal had been euthanised by staff from the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha)..”
Ms Loach said: “Apha clearly don’t seem to have witnessed the same events that I did.
“Apha claim to have carefully planned a removal operation with consideration for Geronimo’s welfare and yet they failed to correctly put a halter on him, and then tied him up in a dangerous manner in the trailer.
“Alpacas sit when travelling and the lead rope length would not allow that to happen.”
Ms Loach said the veterinary surgeons travelling in a vehicle behind the trailer “were in no position to help during travel so could have no impact on welfare”.
She added: “How can they claim there was protection of welfare? Apha should be in doubt the British Alpaca Society will not let this appalling unprofessionalism go unchallenged and further action will be taken.”
Ms Macdonald was campaigning for the destruction to be halted after insisting the bovine tuberculosis tests previously carried out had returned false positives.
She had wanted Geronimo to be tested for a third time or allowed to live to aid research into the disease.
The veterinary nurse argued that the Enferplex test was fundamentally flawed and said the alpaca tested positive because he had repeatedly been primed with tuberculin – a purified protein derivative of bovine TB bacteria.
“I want the vets concerned in Tuesday’s avoidable cruelty disciplined according to the evidence from the British Alpaca Society statement,” Ms Macdonald said.
“They could have brought a head collar or used his own, which was in the barn. Alpacas should never be tied up and they should know that.
“They should have sent competent, caring vets who understand and are confident in handling alpacas.
“Truly heartbroken that members of my own profession could let us down in the most cruel way possible.”
A protest outside Defra HQ in central London is planned for Wednesday.
More than 27,000 cattle were slaughtered last year to curb the spread of the infectious disease, Defra added.
Chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss said: “This is a terribly sad situation and our sympathies remain with all those affected by this devastating disease.”

Guest blog post submitted by LISC's Jessica Hanmer, Economic Development Lending Manager, and Alyssa Alfonso, Assistant Program Officer
Last year, just before the pandemic became a reality, LISC was in the process of convening stakeholders to develop economic inclusion agendas in South Los Angeles and the Far Eastside in Indianapolis. Each group, which comprised over a dozen community stakeholders and advisors, identified economic challenges and priorities facing their communities. Informed by interviews, surveys, and research, each group developed strategies to address residents’ and small businesses’ structural barriers to accessing opportunity, such as limited access to capital, lack of adequate services, and discriminatory hiring practices. The Wells Fargo Diverse Community Capital Activator grant is providing resources to help bring locally determined plans to fruition.
Los Angeles
In South LA, stakeholders identified the prevalence of predatory lending practices, lack of accessible and trusted banking institutions, difficulty securing procurement opportunities, and scarcity of ongoing technical assistance for businesses. From this information, the South LA Economic Inclusion Implementation Plan placed a high priority on increasing small business growth opportunities, as well as expanding outreach efforts to provide tailored technical assistance to help local businesses better compete in bidding processes.
To move the needle in the direction of these long-term goals, LISC LA deployed $3.25 million in capital, supported by the Wells Fargo Activator grant, to two LA-based small business CDFIs that serve the South LA community, one of which was Inclusive Action for the City.
LISC LA invested in Inclusive Action's Semi'a Loan fund (Seed Fund), a microloan program that provides low-interest loans (between 2-3%) to entrepreneurs. Inspired by Inclusive Action's advocacy work alongside street vendors, the Semi’a Fund loan supports business owners who cannot secure capital from traditional lenders yet require support growing or formalizing their businesses.
Through the fund, 11 businesses in South LA have received loans for working capital, equipment purchases, inventory, and past-due business expenses due to COVID-19 hardship. Loans range between $1,000-$15,000 with a repayment term of 12-60 months and a six-month payment deferral, with no application fee or FICO requirements.
Deploying capital to locally-informed CDFIs is an important strategy for supporting small businesses. CDFIs are well positioned to know, understand, and advocate for their borrowers, through more flexible credit boxes and personalized support through the lending process — helping small businesses build credit and assets to sustain and grow their work.
Indianapolis
With the Wells Fargo Activator grant, LISC Indianapolis is putting the Economic Inclusion Agenda for the Far Eastside into action alongside stakeholders. Residents and community participants voiced a need for increased community investment by businesses, more resources for small business, greater collaboration, and translation services. Respondents also shared that English as a Second Language classes, job and business training, and community support services would help them overcome challenges and meet their personal goals — ranging from starting small businesses to home ownership and higher education for their families.
LISC Indianapolis is working with Far Eastside organizations to explore the creation of a community-based Business Association that will establish a centralized location for collaboration among area businesses, align workforce development and training partnerships with the Far Eastside Employer Engagement Task Force, and help generate buy-in among anchor employers to hire locally.
The economic inclusion plan also led to the creation of a 10-month Spanish-language small business workshop for Latinx community members to build business acumen and start businesses in the Far Eastside community. Monthly sessions focus on topics from the legal aspects of starting a business to getting XBE certified. Alongside this workshop comes a new Microenterprise Resource Navigator, providing deeper technical assistance to Latinx entrepreneurs for marketing, legal, and accounting needs.
By providing flexible resources, the Wells Fargo Diverse Community Capital Activator grant is supporting two communities to identify and implement locally identified solutions to enhance economic opportunity for residents and small businesses.

This is especially true when considering the effects of the Delta variant, which is said to be far more contagious and dangerous than the original coronavirus that came to America over 18 months ago. Thankfully for you, there are a whole host of techniques that you can use to minimize the spread of coronavirus in your office. If you are interested in learning more, then you are in the right place. Read on now to learn all about it.
Invest in Personal Protective Equipment
If you want people in your office to feel safe when they return to the office, then it is absolutely essential that they have all the right protective equipment, such as masks, face shields and hand sanitizers. Nonetheless, with reports that many companies simply don’t provide the right stuff, it is very important to make sure that you buy your personal equipment with a broker you can trust. For a great recommendation, Keylogo offers great personalised PPE.
Allow Remote Work for Immunocompromised People
Despite the success of the vaccine and the protection it gives against serious hospitalization, some people still remain more vulnerable to the virus than others. This is especially true to people who are immunocompromised. This is why it might be worthwhile to make sure that they can still do their job remotely, a mode of work many people actually engaged in over the past 18 months without that much of a knock-on effect.
Deep Clean the Office
With the fear that the virus can linger on surfaces, it’s worth making sure that your office is as clean as ever. That’s why it might be necessary to replace your cleaning team with one that has been specially trained in wiping the coronavirus from surfaces. By making sure that your office is deep cleaned at least once a week, you can be sure that your workers will be far more likely to want to come to the office.
Install Ventilation
Clean air is essential to make sure that the virus does not spread through your office. You should make sure that all windows are open and that you have as much ventilation spreading through your office as possible. If you believe that the ventilation system that you have in your office is not up to scratch, then there is no shame in replacing it with a new one instead.
Enforce Distancing
One of the best tools that we have to fight against the spread of coronavirus is through social distancing. This means that no employee in your office should be within six feet of another. This way you can be sure that, in addition to masking, the spread is as minimized as possible. It’s worth reminding your employees with clear and instructive signs that point out the importance of distancing.Floatygurl and Droneboy

Bilingual training for a global world
We offer you a bilingual English and Spanish education, enabling you to work in English or Spanish in Spain and across the world.).
If you want to work in the Spanish healthcare system, you will be interested to know that we can prepare you for Spain's MIR exam (passing this exam enables you to obtain a place as a Médico Interno Residente, i.e. a resident, providing an opportunity to specialise in a branch of medicine). With the support of the CTO group, you will receive training to prepare you for the MIR exam from the very first year of your degree. Therefore, when the time comes, you will have a much better chance of being able to choose what you specialise in and the place you prefer. And CTO provide by far the best MIR training in Spain.Results that speak for themselves >
In your sixth year, we offer you the opportunity to undertake, free of charge, the Expert Certificate in Integrated Medicine. This course aims to provide you with a comprehensive perspective of the different medical specialisations. It has been designed with an eminently practical approach in mind: through the study of clinical cases, an explanation of each process is made from different points of view, focusing on diagnosis and therapy.
The practical training our Medicine students receive has been enhanced by the recent creation of two Advanced Simulation Centres for Medicine on our campuses. These facilities boast the latest hospital simulation technology, enabling our students to work on all kinds of clinical situations. They seek to recreate real settings within hospitals, from patient rooms to operating theatres, and students can work with robots simulating patients in different situations. The hours spent working and learning at the Advanced Simulation Centres enable our aspiring medical doctors to improve their clinical and team-working skills.
The Spanish association of deans of medicine faculties (the Conferencia Nacional de Decanos de las Facultades de Medicina Españolas) has approved the ECOE (the Structured Objective Clinical Assessment) test that Medicine students must undertake at the CEU Cardenal Herrera University. This means that the assessment our students undertake at the Faculty, regarding their real clinical skills, meets the most stringent standards of the Spanish higher education system. It is further evidence of the high-quality training provided as part of the Medicine degree at the University and the great emphasis we place on ensuring that our students have the right practical and clinical skills. See the corresponding certificate here.
In your day-to-day life at the CEU UCH you will be surrounded by students from more than 70 countries and, in the globalized world we live in, that is a big advantage for you.

Add CommentSummer goes right along side with camping!! It is one of our favorite families things to be able to go and do. As with any kind of cooking you always need to be aware of food safety, and it isn’t all that much different for campsite cooking as other ways of cooking. (I have included links to some great products that I have bought on my own to make my journey easier. You can buy them too through my online sales links.)
We have a ton of plans every year to go out and camping with friends and family! However, it is important to note that the warmer weather doesn’t make the best situation for some foods. To prevent foodborne bacteria, here are some food safety tips for campsite cooking.
Food Saftey Tips for Campsite Cooking:
Use a food thermometer handy. If you are cooking any type of meat or poultry on a campfire, you will need to know when it is done. To determine when the food is safe to eat, always have a food thermometer handy. Digital thermometers work the best since they are designed to register the temperature of the food in the probe tip. Beef should be cooked until it reads 160 degree, chicken breasts until it reads 170 degrees, chicken legs, and thighs until it reads 180 degrees, pork until it reads 160 degrees and hot dogs until it reads 165 degrees. Now one of my favorite treats is this thermometer -> here. The outside cover has a cheat sheet on it with these degrees and types of meat on it!
EatSmart Precision Pro Digital Thermometer – Instant Read w/ Splashproof Design and Backlit Screen (Black)
There are some high-risk foods that are more susceptible to food poisoning bacteria than others. These foods include meat and poultry (raw and cooked), dairy products, eggs, seafood, rice and pasta that is cooked, fruit salads that are already made, other ready-made salads like pasta salads and coleslaw and foods that ready to eat like sandwiches and pizza.
It is important that you keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. You also want to keep uncooked meat separate from other foods and in an insulated cooler with ice packs. Never put hot foods inside a cooler but instead ensure they are completely cooled first. If you have access to a refrigerator, then you can bring along perishable foods. However, if not, then you don’t want to bring along any foods that are perishable. Instead, bring along canned and dry foods.

Does your family have any campsite cooking traditions they do?
donald says
nice nice usually i do a day time bbq out and we get everything at the store a mile away from site and cook it up as quick as possible

Beverly says
Great tips! This are all good to know for those times when a storm knocks out the power at home, too.
Kristina and Millie says
great tips! We went for a long weekend camp out last year and luckily all went well but I was so worried about food poisoning!
Laurie says
Great tips to remember! Looking forward to some serious family camping fun this summer! Thanks for sharing!
Sherry says
Great tips! I haven’t camped in years, but we always cooked over an open fire. Sure do miss it!
Wendy says
I love camping and cooking over the fire, though we haven’t done it in years. I know this is a “food safety” post, but you’ve made me want to go dig out the tent! 🙂
Olga says
Thanks for the tips, I love campsite cooking. Recently I ate rice cooked in a forest, it’s taste and smell was marvellous. I’ll remember what you recommend the next time 🙂
Lisa @ A Bride On A Budget says
My tip: Leave the cooking up to your dad. Haha. That’s what we did when we camped every year anyway.We offer clear and impartial information to young people with special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND).

Wizard Cab
Master Thesis
The Wizard Cab is a fake autonomous vehicle. It uses deception to convince study participants that they are driven autonomously. One researcher drives the vehicle and another researcher operates the output. It was used to test a light bar that communicates driving decisions of the "autonomous cab" to the passengers.
The light bar is a non pesky possibility to show what driving decisions are taken during the ride. Multiple light signals were created such as "brake hard", "swerve" or "turn left". The research objective is to find out how important they are to the passengers and whether or not they calm them. © Robert Nosch NA 2018

In the wake of the death of Minneapolis’ George Floyd on Memorial Day at the hands of a since-terminated police officer, experts across the country have spoken up about the greater implications of the tragedy and the subsequent protests around the nation.
Mental Health America president and CEO Paul Gionfriddo added his name to that list Friday when he made the following statement:
.
(Editor’s note: Former police officer Derek Chauvin was indeed charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter shortly following Gionfriddo’s remarks.)
.
“Perhaps that is why people who identify as African American are increasingly likely to want to take action to protect their mental health and the mental health of their loved ones. And why people who identify as Asian Americans experienced the sharpest increases in anxiety during the first weeks of the pandemic. And why people with very low income in a recent U.S. Census Bureau Pulse Survey also reported worrying so much that they can’t control it on more than half the days of the week.
“It is because – when events like George Floyd being choked to death are broadcast to the country – they are facing trauma on top of their past trauma. After calling the death “egregious,” the President pivoted to calling protesters “thugs” and suggested in a tweet that they would be shot. When they see this, they know that what they are experiencing is fundamentally different from what he and others see through a lens of privilege, power, and wealth.
“They are imploring others to understand this and to do something meaningful about it.
“Past trauma is prominently mentioned as the reason that people experience serious mental health conditions today – and nearly half of those taking a mental health screening with MHA who received a moderate to severe result since the middle of April cited trauma as the reason. But those more overt forms of racism and bigotry – the more overt traumas – are just the tip of the iceberg.
“Every day, people of color experience far more subtle traumas than that:
- People who avoid them and their neighborhoods out of ignorance and fear;
- Banks and credit companies who won’t lend them money or do so only at higher rates;
- Mass incarceration of their peers with no violent offenses;
- School curricula that ignore or minimize their contributions to our shared history;
- Covert racial profiling
“This is more than we should ask people to shoulder. We all mourn the death of George Floyd and feel rage against the circumstances that led to it. But it is a mistake to think that we all experience the reality of his death in the same way. And for too many of our brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers, and sons and daughters, that mistake has proven to be a fatal one. It is no surprise that people are reacting as they are to this event. And we should not have to say that when we condone and normalize racism and bigotry, we do violence to our mental health.
“MHA and our affiliates are dedicated and committed to addressing the trauma and lived experience of marginalized communities. It is imperative that we do not turn a blind eye to this any longer. We urge you to join us as we continue to fight in the open for the needs of ALL people.”Bank Name: First Bank Lumberton

Moderated by Chief Curator, O’Neil Lawrence, this conversation featured three of the seven artists in the exhibition, Monique Gilpin, Leasho Johnson, and Cosmo Whyte, alongside guest panelist, Carla Moore, lecturer in Gender and Development Studies at the University of the West Indies’ Western Campus. The discussion explored the ways in which the themes of postcolonial identities, gender, sexuality and Dancehall culture are explored in their work and how these themes relate to the Western Jamaican realities.

THANKS TO tasty beers to choose from it’s not hard to have a few too many too soon and miss out on some of LIBF’s best kept secrets. Here are some tips to help you squeeze the most out of this year’s festival.
Low ABVs are on the up
In the past, the choice of low abv (low alcohol) beers was limited to warm, dusty bottles of Becks Blue, usually accompanied by words of contempt and looks of disgust from your drinking buddies. Well, the modern world of craft beer is changing that, with a surge of breweries trying their hand at making some beers that are low on ABV but BIG on flavour. 2019 has seen the comeback of Victorian Table Beers (ooh err), Radlers (tasty beer and fruit juice mixes) and the introduction of session/small pales and IPAs. Often weighing in at below 3.6%, this mix of low ABV beers can provide a refreshing break between the stronger stuff, keeping you on top form throughout the session.
Here’s a few of the low ABV beers on offer this year:
- Bone Machine Brew Co. – Ægisdrekka Session IPA – 3.5%
- Buxton – Low Tor: Peak District Bitter – 3.8%
- Cloudwater – A Monument at Emmanuel Head: Small Pale 3.5%
- Cromarty Brewing Co – Udder Madness: Vanilla Milk Sour – 1.6%
- Northern Monk – Patrons Project 20.01 // Mark Newton: West Coast Routes: Lemon Radler, 2.8%
Share the experience
The best thing about beer festivals? The huge range of ‘out there’ beers to choose from, including some that you’ll never find at your local pub or bottle shop. They’re often high strength special brews, barrel-aged for big bold flavours, with a hefty ABV to match. If you spot a beer with the words BA, Imperial, DIPA, TIPA, Barley Wine be prepared for anything from 8% to 16% ABV.
One of these is essentially the same as a pint of strong wine, so share the love and share a third with friends. Get a couple of different ones and swap after a few sips. This way you can experience more without breaking the bank.
Food!
Street food is to beer festivals as Mo Salah is to Sadio Mane, both brilliant in their own right, but damn, they’re good when they’re together. When it comes to street food, LIBF doesn’t disappoint – from Indian delights brought to you by Leeds legends Bundobust, to Korean bao buns from Little Bao Boy and not to be missed Cadillac Jack’s classic burger and fries combo.
If you’re partial to a mixed-meat kebab, give Döner Summer’s delicious Berlin döner a try – a vegan upgrade to the end-of-the-night favourite. If it’s cheesy chips you’re after, head to Blue Caribou Canteen for their authentic French-Canadian poutine.
There’s a beer for everyone, and a dish to go with it. Getting your fill will mean you don’t peak too early so you can enjoy the festival right ‘til the end.
Go exploring
Once you’ve swapped your tokens for that first cold beer, it’s time to check out all that LIBF has to offer. Check out the live music on offer and, head to the tipi on Friday and Saturday night, keep your ears open for a performance from Leeds DIY legends COWTOWN.
For pub quizzes, descend to the crypt below the town hall, and for an experience to remember, the old school jail cells will be unlocked throughout the festival, offering probably the strangest setting to enjoy a pint in Leeds.
All beer-ed out? Head to Cardiff brewers Tiny Rebel’s arcade room and get your fill of free-to-play arcade games. Be sure to pay the glass washroom a visit – it might not sound like the go-to destination for beer-related fun, but the glass washroom offers loads of seating and unlimited tap water. Switch the odd beer for a pint of water and finish this year’s festival with no regrets.Crest Flags

Ingredients
- 1 – 2 heads of baby bok choy
- 1 1/2 in. ginger root, finely chopped
- 8 oz. thai rice noodles
- 1 tbsp. peanut oil
- 1 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
- 1 lb. lean ground pork
- 1/4 cup, 1 1/2 tbsp. gluten free soy sauce
- 2 tbsp. rice wine vinegar
- 1/4 cup chopped scallions (green part only)
- 3 cloves garlic (to be removed before eating)
- 2 Shishito peppers, seeded and finely chopped
- 3 – 4 basil leaves, chopped or torn for serving
- Salt for seasoning
Directions
Chop off the very bottom of the bok choy and begin separating the dark green tops from the white stems. Thinly slice the stems, leaving the top green sections whole.
Boil water for the rice noodles and cook according to package, making sure to drain and run under cool water.
In a large skillet, heat the peanut oil over medium-high heat. Add pork and cook until no pink remains, about 10 minutes. Add a few shakes of salt, 1 1/2 tbsp. gluten free soy sauce and 1/2 tbsp. of rice wine vinegar. Transfer the pork to a separate bowl, using a slotted spoon to allow the sauce to remain in the skillet.
Add olive oil to the skillet along with scallions, garlic, ginger and peppers. Cook until you begin to smell the ingredients mixing. Add the bok choy stems and a dash of salt. Cook the bok choy stems several minutes until tender. Remove garlic from the skillet and discard. Add the bok choy leaves and pork to the skillet.
Mix in the remaining 1/4 cup gluten free soy sauce and 1 1/2 tbsp. rice wine vinegar until combined well. Add the noddles and cook until warmed through.
Toss with chopped basil to serve.
The month of October brings excitement to West, as the cold weather sweeps in, and the most talked-about event of the fall semester, Homecoming, begins to be discussed. In a typical normal school year, the annual homecoming dance would be taking place, but because of COVID-19 concerns, the dance has been canceled.
“It was an overall decision with our school-improvement team. First and foremost-COVID. You know, getting a lot of students together on the dance floor is probably not what we need to happen right now.” sponsor April Bryson said.
Thanks to English teacher Jason Livingston, Student Government Association (SGA) members found a solution: a bonfire.
“He (Livingston) had mentioned it a couple years back, and the pandemic hit, and there wasn’t anything we could do. And then when we talked about replacing the homecoming dance with something, that idea came back up.” Bryson said. “We’ve been wanting to try a bonfire for a while, and it makes a great replacement. It’s outside, students can take their mask off, sit around and enjoy the fire right after the football game. It’s just such a good fix.”
“I think the bonfire is really creative. I never would’ve come up with that for a substitute. But I think it’s probably going to be better since it’s outside.” junior Annalise Eidt said. “I know that it’s hard to get kids to follow the rules anyways, so expecting them to wear a mask while at this huge party is probably not the smartest thing to do. I definitely understand where the decision came from.”
The first bonfire event will take place Oct. 15 right after the Falcons take on the Owen Warhorses, and will be located on the practice soccer field. Tickets will be sold for $5 at school next week. Concessions will be available for sale.

Meaning of Flood & Flood Definition[Jenial Thanks to Janine Mendes-Franco, of Global Voices Online, for selecting two posts, about Our rising emigration and the changes in Our inner voice.]
What kind of voter movement would make the biggest difference in Our deteriorating PanoRama?
First, what would a voter movement be and is one needed? Taking the last question first: crime up, murders way up, education dropping even more than its Third World rating would predict, corruption up, jobs down, economy tanking, government bond debt limit reached, government credit rating dropping, stupid political leaders playing kissie-assie with each other, emigration rising... If anyone thinks the current sewage dump of """leaders""" is going to change their thieving, me-first bullshit, then they are retarded and should not vote.
As for why a voter movement and not some other "peaceful" process: short of a violent overthrow and non-existent recall solutions, the simplest and most direct path to change Our (non)government is through the elections. Since every electoral office is up for grabs every 4 years, the only real chance We have to make minimal or wholesale changes is at the ballot box.
Moving on. The voter movement I envision would obviously have to cross party lines, galvanize abut 350,000 - 425,000 votes and focus on taking out entrenched Fools.
Why?
1) Cross party lines: The average voter wants to feel that his or her vote "wins" in some way. Appealing to only one party or ideology group will cause the average voter (species name: Voticus ignoramus) to fear that their vote will "be wasted." Of course, they don't see that voting for anyone already elected is "wasting" their vote because those already in power are parasites living off Our indifference.
2) Galvanize 350,000-425,000 voters: The average election in Puerto Rico has about an 85% turnout and that means about 1.8 million votes cast. Twenty percent of that number is 360,000, a substantial number that will cause all Fools to take the voter movement extremely seriously. Especially when the movement focuses on point 3...
3) Taking out entrenched Fools: There are folks in Our government that have the morals of an opium fiend with the willies, the ethical standards of a child-molesting priest and the intellectual development of week-old gumbo. Yet these scumbuckets are making decisions about Our economy (crashing), Our education (crashed), Our taxes (crushing) and thus Our future (crushed.) For that privilege, We are paying many of them salary and benefit packages that are simply ridiculous when compared to Our averages: mayors making over $100,000 a year, legislators making over $110,000, Cabinet officials over $190,000 and even support staff is making over $80,000. And what about consultants making over $125,000 on each of two or three "legitimate" contracts?
By attacking the incumbents, the voter movement automatically becomes one "of change, for change." Rather than attack all the incumbents, a series of targets are selected, primarily from the legislature. (Folks, I don't capitalize words for institutions I don't have at least a modicum of respect.) To make the biggest change, targets from each major party are selected and the criteria are simple: Those holding key legislative positions (president, vicepresident, speaker of each chamber, etc.) and those with the longest incumbencies (long-term parasites.)
A quick scan means that media tumors and crap merchants like Jenniffer "Gluttonny" González and Tomás "Mad Dog" Rivera would be targeted alongside commonwealth party tapeworms like Antonio "You Haven't Caught Me" Fas and José "I Look Up to Tapeworms" Varela. As the statehood party currently controls the legislature, there will be more names from that party than from the other, but that's how these changes work: by targeting those who have the most to lose.
In that sense, all legislators elected "by accumulation," i.e., not tied to any senatorial or representational district, are the best targets, for they are often """party leaders""" who use their ""widespread mandate""" to fuck Us. (Notice the absolute lack of quotation marks around fuck Us. Twice.)
Also amongst the targets are certain mayors, who have become entrenched to the point of idiocy. Two examples are Carlos "I'm A Businessman Like the Mafia Is a Brotherhood" Méndez, of Aguadilla and José "City Hall Is My Closet" Rodríguez, of Mayagüez. Why them? because they've been in that chair for over 12 years; their time is past, if it ever was.
The voter movement would focus on kicking out incumbents, targeting them with direct questions, deep analysis of their shortcomings and raising awareness of how utterly useless these high-profile, long-squatting pisspots are. Rather than trying to change the entire political system, the voter movement would narrow its focus to a true leverage position: shaking the foundation of the most ambitious and entrenched.
Nothing strikes more fear into the heart of a Fool--more so than an F.B.I. badge--than a voter group that the Fool cannot buy. A voter movement aimed at knocking off incumbents, that crosses party lines in order to make changes happen, is a powerful force: when that force is applied well, it makes change inevitable.
And once the voter movement proves its worth, it need only target other high-profile, long-squatting smegmacups to make them pay attention to Us. Because that's the whole point of this voter movement: to make the Fools understand that they work for Us and that We hold the power, not them.
A name? Okay, how about Junta Electoral Nacional Independiente Organizada: JENIO.
Yeah, I know that's "Jenius" in Spanish, but it does have a certain ring to it, dissonant yet affecting.
However, for populist appeal, We could go with Movimiento Pa' Fuera, the Get Out Movement.
I know, Brethren: the trilling rhythms of "¡Pa' fuera, pa' la calle!" are already ringing in your ears...
The Jenius Has Spoken.

Unlike previous opportunities to provide comment, CMS did not offer draft language for revisions to the MMG; instead, CMS only flagged a few issues that it is proposing to change, and solicited a broader call for comments. CMS asked for comments on ideas rather than comments an actual draft MMG. The mechanism for commenting was also restrictive: CMS provided a short web form, with limited space for responses, which only contemplated comments from plan sponsors.
Pursuant to recently-issued final regulations and the Final 2019 Call Letter, there will be significant new changes to Medicare Advantage (MA) benefits in 2019. These include elimination of meaningful difference requirements, benefit uniformity flexibility and expansion of supplemental benefits. All of these changes will make choosing MA plans significantly more complex for enrollees (note the Center for Medicare Advocacy will issue a paper discussing these changes in more depth). Among other things, rather than having uniform benefits available to all enrollees in a given plan, MA plan sponsors will have the option of targeting certain extra benefits and/or reduced cost-sharing for certain services to enrollees with certain health conditions. In our comments, the Center highlighted that it is critical to ensure that information about these changes, and resulting plan-specific benefits, are presented in a manner that is not unduly confusing and does not deter enrollment by individuals based upon their health conditions or other factors. This consumer protection requires firm oversight from CMS, not a relaxation of standards and restrictions.
In the final rule describing these MA changes, CMS states that “supplemental benefits do not include items or services solely to induce enrollment.” The agency must provide adequate marketing guidelines and oversight to ensure this does not occur. In the comments to the MMG, drafted in collaboration with several other advocacy organizations, the Center for Medicare Advocacy, among other things, urged CMS to:
- Develop a standardized template for describing additional benefits based on health condition (to be used across the board by plans in evidence of coverage (EOC) documents, marketing materials, and in Medicare Plan Finder descriptions).
- Prohibit those marketing plans from engaging/soliciting information about an individual’s health condition(s).

Our Division has recently been successful in a bid for funding to provide a range of activities to strengthen the capacity of Black and Asian (including Islamic faith) specialist voluntary sector organisations. The funding is targeted at supporting organisations that are led by Black and Minority ethnic boards or managers, those organisations that have clear priority around working with ethnic minorities and who are specialist in this field. We are particularly interested in working with organisations that we may not already engage with due to their size.
This is a unique, excellent and exciting opportunity to gain experience in identifying and developing partnerships with local charities and organisations whom can provide support to our Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic service users and staff.
The role
The Engagement Officer role is intended to develop and expand the provision of BAME services:
Secure tailored and earlier interventions for individuals in protected groups, to improve their criminal justice outcomes.
Engage community groups in co-design and delivery of solutions to address patterns of offending involving protected groups in local areas.
Enable specialist voluntary sector faith capacity to operate in and access revenue from a wider range of CJS and related purchasers.
The types of organisations to be targeted for support would be those who are small (turnover under £500k), originating from or linked to a Black, Asian or other minority ethnic communities.

I don’t smoke, I don’t booze, and movies are my only poison. I am quite callous in my selection for a film. I don’t watch a film twice even if I like it to the core. I believe a good film must have the ability to leave that mark in my mind; otherwise it’s a waste of time. And while judging, I believe a film should have either a unique storyline or a powerful narrative or a moderate direction, or a mix bag of all.
Though my list of must-watch movies is endless, here are some of the finest ones:
#1 Kolya (Czech)
This won academy awards in 1996 for best foreign film. The film is about a small kid named Kolya and his innocence transforming an aimless old man. The kid is forced to live with the protagonist, and ironically they don’t speak the same language. One speaks Czech and the other Russian. The storyline, the fabric of the film is very simple but the way it’s been portrayed is awesome. It’s sensitive and very languid, but heart-wrenching in the end. I saw ti in ’97, but it seems really fresh in my mind. Directed by Jan Sverak, loved by all.
#2 13 Tzameti (French)
You wouldn’t like a phone call or a person disturbing you while watching this dramatic crime thriller written and directed by Gela Babluani. It gripped me well and left with a hangover. The story is about a naÃ¯ve man who finds an invitation meant for somebody else. His quest and curiosity makes him an unfortunate 13th player in a game of death. The best part is that it is based on true events of a survivor of the actual game. If you are not watching it on a pirated DVD, you can treat yourself with the bonus feature real interview of the survivor of this notorious underground game from Europe.
It’s a 2006 film but intentionally treated in black and white. It is stark, honest, bold, very real and enigmatic.
#3 Love Me If You Dare (French)
‘Unthinkable’ is the word to describe this mad roller coaster rom com, written and directed by Yann Samuell. The storyline is simply unique. Our protagonist couple are childhood friends and all they do is play an odd game to challenge each other for daring and outrageous stunts. And they continue to do this even when they become adults. Very intriguingly, the fact gets unfolded that their game is nothing but a device to hide the truth that they are truly meant for each another. It is the maddest film I have ever seen, I can say.
It bends all the rules of a romantic film, it boasts more energy and wicked humour than mushy moments. It’s worth watching even if you don’t like romantic movies.
#4 Swindled (Spanish)
It’s a con drama written and directed by Miguel Bardem, a fantastically woven plot to swindle a hefty sum by a group of conmen. The narrative is engagingly beautiful, and the plot is flawless. Unlike regular Hollywood con dramas, protagonist here has a very calm and down-to-earth approach to his schemes and execution. That makes him a lovable and believable character in the film. The fabrication is of the real, ‘I know these guys’ type. Most of the ideas leave even the audience outguessed, and that’s the real beauty.
#5 Scoop (English)
It’s a hilarious comedy with elements of fantasy and mystery, written and directed by master craftsman Woody Allen. Scarlett Johansson as a journalist student looking out for a scoop about an aristocrat who is a suspected serial killer. She gets the signal about his moves from a dead journalist (played by Woody himself). If you are a Woody Allen fan, you will get everything from him in this movie. The surrealism, the wisecracks, his monologues, the dark comedy and real insights. A film like this can be enjoyed more with friends. Worth giving a shot!

India (Hindi: ???? or Bharat), the largest country in South Asia, architectural masterpieces that were built millennia ago and remain intact today. As the nation opens up to a globalised world, India still has a depth of history and intensity of culture that awe and fascinate the many who visit there.
India is administratively divided into 28 states and 8 union territories. The states are broadly demarcated on linguistic lines. They vary in size; the larger ones are bigger and more diverse than some countries of Europe. The union territories are usually much smaller than the states—sometimes they are just one city—and they have much less autonomy. India has two island chains off the mainland – the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal and the Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea.
The:
One thing that foreign travellers need to know is that India is, in many ways, heterogeneous. If they experience one set of behaviours from the locals in one part of the country, it does not mean that the same behaviour is common in another area. To give a very simple example, a taxi driver in Mumbai will without saying a word drop. very advanced for its time. At its peak (2600-1900 BCE) it covered most of what is now Pakistan, plus some of northern India and eastern Afghanistan. The two biggest archaeological sites, both in Pakistan, are Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.
Some time after 2000 BCE, the Aryans, herdsmen from somewhere to the northwest, migrated into the region. At about the same time, related groups invaded Greece (Hellenic Greeks displacing Minoans), Anatolia or Turkey (the Hittites), Persia and other areas. It is believed that all these tribes spoke related languages and many modern languages, including most of those spoken in northern India, Europe and some in Central Asia, are descended from them. Linguists classify them all in the Indo-European language family.
The Vedic Period is dated to roughly 1500-500 BCE. This was the period when the Vedas, the oldest and holiest books of Hinduism, were compiled. They were in an Indo-Aryan language, Vedic Sanskrit. Although few details and archaeological findings are available for this period, many rituals of Hinduism took shape during that period.
The Vedic civilisation influences India to this day through the dharmic religions. Present-day Hinduism traces its roots to the Vedas, but is also heavily influenced by literature that came afterwards, ranging from the Upanishads and Puranas, to the great epics — Ramayana and Mahabharata. By tradition, these texts are claimed to only expand and distill the knowledge that is already present in the Vedas.
A section of the Mahabhar.
In the 1st millennium BCE, various schools of philosophical thought developed, enriching Hinduism greatly. Most of them claimed to derive from the Vedas. However, some of these schools, two of which were Buddhism and Jainism, questioned the authority of the Vedas, and they are now recognised as separate religions.
Many great empires arose between 500 BCE and 590 CE. Notable among them were the Mauryas and the Guptas, both with their capital in the city of Pataliputra, now called Patna. The Gupta Empire (3rd century CE to 590 CE) is often called the Golden Age of India. Further west, the Gandharan civilisation (an independent kingdom, later part of the Maurya Empire) ruled much of what are now Pakistan and Afghanistan. Their city Taxila was a great center of Buddhist and other learning.
Over time there was minority who are ambivalent about whether they consider themselves Hindus or not. Hinduism itself went through major changes. Vedic deities such as Indra and Agni became less important while Puranic deities such as Vishnu, Shiva, their various Avatars and family members gained prominence.
Islamic incursions started in the 8th century. Gradually the raiders started staying as rulers, and soon much of North India was ruled by Muslims. The most important Muslim rulers were the Mughal Empire that at its peak covered almost the entire subcontinent (save the southern and northeastern was Maha Rana Pratap, the ruler of Chittorgarh, who spent years in exile fighting Akbar, the third of the Mughals. Eventually, however, the Rajputs were subdued. Some Mughal armies had a high proportion of Rajput officers, although some Rajput rebellions still occurred during the reign of Jahangir, Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb. This period of North India produced the monumental gems of Rajasthan and the Taj Mahal. Hindi and Urdu also took root in medieval North India. During the Islamic period, there were Hindus that converted to Islam, often forcibly, or to avoid the Jizya tax, as told by Muslim chroniclers. Today, around 15% of India's population follow Islam.
Sikhism, another major religion, was established in Punjab during the Mughal period. Relations between Sikhism and the Mughals varied over time. The Golden Temple at Amritsar was built and recognised all over the world as Sikhism's major pilgrimage centre. By the time of its tenth Guru however, Guru Gobind Singh, relations were hostile, primarily due to the antagonism of Aurangzeb, the most intolerant, brutal and bigoted of the Mughals. Conflict between the Sikhs and the Mughals was one of the causes for the eventual decline of the Mughal Empire. Another reason was the rise of the Maratha Empire and was dominated by great South Indian kingdoms. The most prominent empires included the Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas and Vijayanagara who ruled from present day Karnataka and the Pallavas, Cheras, Pandyas and Cholas who ruled from present day Tamil Nadu and.
Northeast India was also fairly isolated from the rest of the country until the colonial period. The largest and longest kingdom to rule over the Northeast were the Ahoms who, from the 13th to 19th centuries, successfully defended Assam and neighbouring regions from Mughal expansion.
European traders started visiting India beginning in the late 16th century. Prominent among these were the British, Dutch, French and the Portuguese. The British East India Company made Calcutta their headquarters in 1772. They also established subsidiary cities like Bombay and Madras. Calcutta later went on to become 'the second city of the empire after London'. By the 19th century, the British had, one way or the other assumed political control of virtually all of India, though the Portuguese, the Dutch and the French too had their enclaves along the coast. The British would send Indian labourers, policemen and soldiers all over the Empire, resulting in the establishment of Indian diaspora communities, the most notable ones in Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Fiji, South Africa, Mauritius, Kenya, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and the United Kingdom itself.
There was an uprising by Indian rulers in 1857 which was suppressed, but which prompted the British government to take over from the Company and make India a part of the empire. This period of rule by the crown, 1858-1947, was called the British Raj. It was a period in which some Indians converted to Christianity, though forcible conversions ended in British India after 1859, and Queen Victoria's proclamation promised to respect the religious faiths of Indians.
Non-violent resistance to British colonialism led by steady pace ever since, fueling strong growth. The IT, Business Process Outsourcing and other Himalayan border dispute. Current relations are largely peaceful but tense. There are no land crossings time as an independent country.
Current concerns in India include corruption, poverty, overpopulation, pollution and forms of environmental degradation, ongoing border disputes with Pakistan and China, cross-border terrorism, and ethnic, political and religious strife which occurs from time to time. India's current obsession, at least among the educated elite, is over whether India will be able to overtake China in economic growth and be an economic and military superpower.
India is a parliamentary republic and democracy modelled on the British Westminster system. The president, indirectly elected, is the head of state, but this position, while not entirely ceremonial, has limited powers. The prime minister runs the government with a cabinet of ministers, and in practice wields the most authority in government., and the prime minister, by convention, is always a member of the Lok Sabha. India has a vast number of political parties. The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) forms the government, and the centre-left Indian National Congress (known as "Congress") is the main opposition party. India has a strong and independent judiciary and a free press.
India is also a federation, divided into states and union territories. Each of these has its own legislature, with a government run by a chief minister and a cabinet.
Street demonstrations, protests and agitations occur, as they do in any democracy. There are also occasional low levels of political violence, but a visitor has an extremely small chance of getting caught in that.
Indian Standard Time (IST) is 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC where it is known by different names. experiences an Autumn, but the ancients had certainly identified such a season among the six seasons (or ritus - Vasanta - Spring, Greeshma - Summer, Varsha - Rainy, Sharat - Autumn, Hemanta - "Mild Winter"/"late autumn", Sheet - is also a community known as the Siddis, who are believed to be descended from East African slaves brought to India by the Arab Slave Trade, and mainly found in remote rural villages. Although they speak Indian instead of African languages these days, they still retain many African customs including African dance and music. Although they are Indian citizens, due to a lack of awareness from the general Indian population of their existence, they continue to face much discrimination, and are often presumed to be illegal immigrants from Africa. The British colonisation also gave rise to a mixed raced population known as the Anglo-Indians, and while most of them migrated to Western countries following independence, pockets of these communities remain in India's major cities.
There are three national holidays: Republic Day (26 January), Independence Day (15 August), and Gandhi's Birthday, generally called Gandhi Jayanti (2 October) which follow the Western calendar and occur on the same day every year. Hindu religious festivals, because they follow the lunisolar calendar, occur on different days every year, but around the same time of the year every time. The major religious festivals of Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism and Zoroastrianism are also celebrated. Central government offices are closed for holidays around 17 days a year for these festivals and observances. The significance of these festivals differs across different regions of India. State government offices will have a different holiday schedule based on which festivals are important in that state. Generally, the day on which the state was formed will also be a holiday in that state.
Some of the major Indian festivals. This mentality may affect any true appreciation of the country. Dealing with touts is very simple: assume anyone offering surprising information (such as "your hotel is shut down") is a tout. Never be afraid to get a second or third answer to a question. To get rid of touts: many tourist attractions, such as museums and historical sites. The difference in pricing is because the Indian government subsidises entry fees for local people, to make these attractions more affordable for taxpayers. While this may seem discriminatory, it is practised in most developing countries in Asia and Africa and helps make these attractions more accessible to local people. more. You can get an Indian friend to book in rupees and in most cases, no one will question you at the time of check in.
At the federal level, the official languages of India are Hindi and English.
Other languages that are official to some degree (often at state level) are Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Dogri, Gujarati,.
Hindi, spoken by the vast majority of the population, serves as the lingua franca of North India and Central India. Many others have it as their second, or even third language. Although it is one of the main languages of the Union Goverment, very little Hindi is spoken in Southern and Northeastern India, and people in those areas are more likely to respond in English or their local language.
English is spoken in urban areas, and is the main language in education, media, government, and business. It serves as the "de facto lingua franca" of the country. Although this sounds reassuring, Indian English is remarkably different compared to other dialects. Perhaps the most common jibe about the dialect is its use of universally improper grammar, which may give some the impression that India isn't an English-speaking country. Prejudices aside, this is perhaps the dialect's most fascinating quality. The sounds of Indian English are flavoured by many of the country's languages, which means that non-native English speakers may have difficulty understanding the way Indians speak.
Here are some features of Indian English:
English-language TV shows and movies are common, and the number of English TV channels outnumber the number of Indian-language TV channels. Some shows may be dubbed in another language depending on where you are.
Sanskrit is the language in which much of ancient Indian literature and religious texts are written. Today Sanskrit survives primarily as a liturgical language; few if any people speak Sanskrit as a native language, but quite a few scholars or lay-persons know it or are learning. Nevertheless, due to the influence of Hinduism, they too contain many loan words from Sanskrit.
However, (often given a portmanteau of the native language and English; for instance, mixing Malayalam and English is called as Manglish, and the same for Hindi is called as Hinglish).
Non-verbal communication is also important. Much has been made of the confusing Indian head nod for yes and no, but the only important thing to understand is that Indians have different nods for yes, ok and no.
Rules and validity of visas will differ based on citizenship. Check the website of the Indian embassy, consulate or high commission in your country, found on this list.
Holders of an Overseas Citizenship of India (OIC) document are permitted to live in India indefinitely, however they must apply for permits to visit certain areas in India.
Citizens of Nepal and Bhutan may enter and live in India indefinitely without a visa.
Citizens of Pakistan, including dual citizens, are not normally granted visas of any kind. Pakistani citizens over the age of 65 can apply for a visa on arrival, but they are ineligible for the scheme if they've been denied an Indian visa in the past.
Depending on the purpose of the visit, with most passports you can get a tourist visa (multiple entry for six months or one year depending on nationality), a business visa (6 months, one year or more, multiple entries) or a student visa (up to 5 years). A special 10-year visa. (This is not true for e-Visas, which are valid 60 days "from the date of arrival in India."—see the "Instructions for Applicant" section of the e-Visa page.)
India has an e-Tourist Visa (eTV) facility. Electronic visas can be applied for between 4 and 120 days in advance of arrival and are valid for a double entry and a stay of up to 60 days. Travellers cannot receive more than two eTVs in a calendar year. Entry with an eTV must be at 1 of 25 designated - check the web link for a current list). The eTV is available to citizens of over 100 countries (again, check the web link for the latest list; some EU countries, along with most of Africa and the Middle East, are excluded). Persons of Pakistani origin, regardless of nationality, are not eligible. The fee for the eTV is dependent on nationality. Since 2019 e-Visas are issued for 30 days, 1 year or 5 years. The 1 and 5 year visas allow stays for up to 60 days at a time (except for nationals of the US, UK, Canada and Japan, who are allowed to stay for 90 days). Also prices are expected to go down, and there will be no limit on the number of e-visas you can request in a calendar year. The exact implementation date is still not known.. The eTV.: ?4,000 worth of articles for "gifts". If you are an Indian citizen or are of Indian origin, you are entitled to ?25,000 worth of articles (provided of course you aren't entering through Nepal, Bhutan or Pakistan). The other rules are on the web site. If you are bringing any new packaged items, it is a good idea to carry is in most cases limited to ?25000. Details can be found in the official statement of the Reserve Bank of India.
The major points of entry are Bangalore (BLR IATA), Mumbai (BOM IATA), Delhi (DEL IATA), Kolkata (CCU IATA), Hyderabad (HYD IATA) and Chennai (MAA IATA). The airports at these cities are either new or undergoing development. The Hyderabad airport is rated as one of the top five airports in the 10-15 million passenger category. There are many nonstop, direct and connecting choices to these cities from Europe, North America, Middle East, Africa and Australia.
Secondary points of entry include Goa and the Malabar coast. There are many connections from the Middle East to Malabar coast cities such as Kochi, Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram. Most of the major Middle Eastern carriers offer one-stop connections to the coast from their Gulf hubs. Goa is a favourite European tourist destination and thus is connected by many European charter operators like Condor, Edelweiss and Thomson Airways.
India's national airline is Air India. Other Indian airlines that operate international flights include IndiGo and SpiceJet. These airlines offer daily flights to major hubs around the world. You must carry a printed air ticket in order to take many domestic flights.
From the United States, United Airlines offers non-stop daily service from Newark to Delhi and Mumbai; Air India offers daily non-stop service to Delhi from New York–JFK, Newark, Washington–Dulles, San Francisco and Chicago O'Hare and to Mumbai from Newark (and soon JFK). Various European airlines offer connecting service through their European hubs from most major U.S. cities and various Asian airlines offer connecting service from West Coast cities through their Asian hubs.
Entries from Europe and North, Emirates via Dubai or Qatar Airways via Doha. These airlines are also the easiest way to come from the Gulf countries, along with Indian carriers, Air India, Air India Express, Indigo and SpiceJet.
From East Asia and Australia, Singapore (which is served by Air India, its low-cost subsidiary Air India Express, Singapore Airlines, its subsidiary Silk Air and low-cost subsidiary Scoot) has excellent connections with flights to all the major cities and many smaller ones. As for the cheap way Thailand, Air India Express flies from Chennai and Kolkata to Bangkok.ain Nepal buses cross the border daily, usually with connections to New Delhi, Lucknow, Patna and Varanasi. However, it's cheaper and more reliable to take one bus to the border crossing and another from there on. The border crossings are (India/Nepal side) Sunauli/Bhairawa from Varanasi, Raxaul/Birganj from Patna, Kolkata, Kakarbhitta from Darjeeling, and Mahendrenagar-Banbassa from Delhi.

There are 5 trains offering 12 signature journeys between major tourist destinations in India. They offer a wonderful way to experience the sights in India without having to worry about the hassles of travel and accommodation. Journeys on board these trains are all inclusive of accommodation, dining, sightseeing, transportation and porter charges. Each of these luxury trains is equipped with amenities such as live television, individual climate control, restaurant, bar, lounges and cabins with electronic safe and attached bathrooms.
India has seven classes of train travel to choose 4 months in advance. School summer vacation time — mid-April to mid-June — is peak season for the railways, which means that you may need to book well in advance. Other festival days, long weekends or holidays may see a similar rush.
Booking tickets from the railway website has vastly improved over the years. A lot of work has gone into the usability and responsiveness of the web site. Try not to book normal tickets during 9AM to noon, has most. You can purchase bottled waters, colas, packaged snacks or biscuits from the pantry staff who circulate from one coach to another.
At most stations hawkers selling tea, peanuts, and snack food and even complete meals will go up and down the train. Most stations will have vendors selling all kinds of edible stuff. You can also get down on the station platform to look for food, but make sure you know the stoppage timing of the train at that station. online companies offering taxi services. The two largest players are Ola and Uber, both of which operate in all major Indian cities and have ranks at major airports. Both pickup and dropoff points can be entered in English, minimizing hassle.
Fares are affordable by Western standards, with most city rides under ?200, although surge pricing can be expensive. However, the very cheapest categories (UberX and Ola Micro/Mini respectively) often have tiny, run-down cars, so paying the small premium for the next class up (Uber Comfort and Ola Prime) may be worth it.
If ride-hailing isn't an option, central locations of big cities like airports or stations have pre-paid taxi services managed by local traffic police officials. received their payment by submitting or producing this other part to the pre-paid taxi counter.).
Regular metered taxis are also common and can usually be hailed on the street. While they're supposed to use the meter, tales of "broken" meters and hapless fleeced tourists are common, so try to have an idea of the fare before you set off. ?100.
In addition to ordinary public buses, there are luxury or express buses available, and most have air-conditioning these days. Some state transport corporations have even introduced Volvo buses on some routes and these. The bus industry is extremely fragmented and there are few operators who offer services in more than 2 or 3 neighbouring states. Travel agents usually only offer seats on private buses.
However, long distance bus operators such as Raj National Express and KPN Travels are rolling out their operations across the country modelled on the lines of the Greyhound service in the United, you can opt for a driver while renting a car. Rates are quoted in rupees per kilometer and you will have to pay for both ways even if you are going only one way. The driver's salary is so low (typically around ?100-150 per day) that it adds little to the cost of renting the car. The driver will find their own accommodation and food wherever you are travelling, although it is customary to give him some money to buy some food when you stop somewhere to eat. Rates vary by size and quality of the car. Many vehicles come equipped with a roof carrier, so one may opt for a smaller vehicle for 2-3 passengers even with excess luggage.  behaviour make sure you keep your bags with you.
Your driver may in some cases act as a tout, offering to take you to businesses from which he gets baksheesh (a sort of commission). This isn't necessarily a bad thing - the driver may help you find just what you're looking for, and add to his income at the same time. On the other hand, always evaluate for yourself whether you are being sold on a higher-cost or poorer quality product than you want. Avoid touts on the road posing as guides that your driver may stop for because he gets a commission from them; supporting them only promotes this unpleasant practice. The driver might ask for a tip at the end of the trip. Pay him some amount (?100/day is generally sufficient) and don't let him guilt-trip you into paying too much.
Memorise your driver's face and write down his licence plate number and phone number. Touts at tourist areas will may try to mislead you into getting into the wrong car when you leave; if you fall for this you will certainly be ripped off, your car may be stolen and you may be sexually assaulted.
Be wary of reckless driving when renting a car with a driver. Do not be afraid to tell the driver that you have time to see around and that you are not in a hurry. Make sure also that your driver gets enough rest time and time to eat. In general as you visit restaurants, the driver may eat at the same time (either separately at the same restaurant or at some other nearby place). They may be willing to work nonstop for you as you are the "boss", but your life depends on their ability to concentrate, so ensure that your driving demands are reasonable; for example, if you decide to carry your own food with you on the road, be sure to offer your driver time to get a lunch himself.
Avoid travelling at night. Indian roads are dimly lit if at all, and there are even more hazards on the road after dark — even highway bandits if you get far enough off the beaten track.
If you feel confident enough to drive by yourself, you can now hire a self-drive car in many major cities. These cars are available for long-distance as well as intra-city travel. The choices you get may be different from what are available in your home country, and these service providers may not accept international licences. Do your research well before opting for this choice. Some of the options are: ?100 ?15,000-25,000 depending on the year of make and condition of vehicle. The bigger ones can be brought from ?30,000 onwards.
Hitch hiking in India is very easy due to the enormous number of cargo trucks on every highway and road. Most drivers do not speak English or any other international language; however, most have a very keen sense of where the cities and villages are along the road. It is rare for any of them to expect payment. practised;.

Indians commonly use lakh and crore for 100,000 and 10,000,000 respectively.

You may also find non-standard, although standard in India,.

In South India, a "hotel" is local restaurant serving south Indian food, usually a thali or plate meal—a full plate of food that usually includes a kind of bread and/or rice. Mumbai tends to be the most expensive, due to local taxes, which can be three-times as much as Meghalaya.
Indian wines, long a bit of a joke, have improved remarkably and there's a booming wine industry in the hills of Maharashtra. The good stuff is not particularly cheap (expect to pay around ?500.
As of April 2017 it is illegal to sell alcohol within 500 m of a highway. This is controversial as it has hit restaurants, bars and hotels hard so check latest rulings before booking your hotel for any chang to combat malaria is to choose lodgings with air conditioning and sealed windows. An insect-repellent spray containing DEET will also help, or consider Permethrin-treated fabrics.
Overcharging of foreigners is widespread and you will have to bargain hard. Many hotels listed on western booking websites (booking.com etc.) are also set at the "tourist price"; try local booking sites like Goibibo, redBus or OYO rooms, as these have much better coverage of local hotels and in rural areas.
Choices vary widely depending on budget and location. Good budget hotels in India are easy to find. Cheap travellers' hotels are numerous in big cities where rooms are available for less than ?450. Rooms at guest-houses with a double bed (and often a bathroom) can be found in many touristic venues for ?150-200. accommodation in clean dormitories for as little as ?50 is also available. Bed and breakfast service providers are coming up offering standard services that can be expected from B&Bs outside India. The basics include: air-conditioner or air cooler, free food, and free wi-fi internet.
Most Indian train stations have rooms or dormitories, just ask. They are cheap, relatively well maintained (the beds, sheets, not the showers), in demand and secure. There are also the added bonus of not being accosted by the rickshaw mafia, getting the bags off quickly and, for the adventurous, high likelihood to jump on a cheap public bus back to the train station. Treebo, Country Inns, Ginger and Neemrana, and prices vary from ?1,000-4,000 per night. Local, unbranded hotels can be found in any city, but quality varies widely.
If the wallet allows it, you can try staying like royalty in a maharaja's palace in places like Udaipur or modern five-star hotels which are now found pretty much all over the country. The top-end of Indian luxury rests with hotel chains like Oberoi, Taj, The Leela and ITC Welcomgroup, in other countries be a distinctly ordinary business hotel going for a third of the price. Also beware that some jurisdictions including Delhi and Bangalore charge stiff luxury taxes on the rack rate of the room, which can lead to nasty surprises at check-out time.
One way of meeting interesting Indian travellers is by staying at an Dak bungalow. Also, called travellers' bungalows or inspection bungalows, they were built by the British to accommodate travelling officials and are now used by the Central and state governments for the same purpose. They exist in many towns and some rural locations. Most will take tourists at a moderate fee if they have room. They are clean, comfortable and usually in good locations, but plain with ceiling fans rather than air conditioning, shower but no bath. Typically the staff includes a pensioned-off soldier as night watchman and perhaps another as gardener; often the gardens are lovely. Sometimes there may be a cook; his or her services will be free but you should buy ingredients.
Reliable electricity supply is present mainly in upmarket hotels. Brownouts are frequent, and many buildings have unsafe wiring. If you like having a beer at the bar or expect alcohol in the room fridge then make sure the hotel is more than 500 m (1,600 ft) from a highway. also offer degrees to foreign students..
Citizens of Nepal and Bhutan can live and work freely in India, and do not require work permits. and common sense are observed (i.e. women travellers should be cautious travelling alone at night). You can check with your embassy or ask for local advice before heading to Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh in northern-most India, and to Northeast India, i.e. (Assam, Nagaland, Tripura, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh). These areas have had serious law and order problems for a long time, though the situation has improved a lot. The same applies while travelling to what used to be a thickly forested area in East-Central India, which covers the states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, the eastern edge of Maharashtra and the northern tip of Telangana. Though the problem is only in the remote areas of these states and normal areas to visit in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra or Telangana are often magnets. Begging is criminalized in cities such as Mumbai and Delhi. It is however common in many cities, and in pilgrim cities there are sadhus who live an ascetic life style of the seeker that requires them to adopt bhiksha-charya (begging vows) only for sustaining the body.
While hospitality is important in India, it is not common to see people offering to share food or cookies while they eat. Some such offers are genuine and some not. In case you are travelling in train, you are offered food from a big and rich family type group, you can take a bite. But if you are offered something by men or even a couple eating a part of it, try avoiding it, as the other part may have sedatives (this may be so that they may loot your belongings when you become unconscious). You can reply with politeness and say no with a smile; they won't mind or take it personal..
Same-sex intercourse was decriminalised by a court ruling in 2018. There is a vibrant gay nightlife in metropolitan areas and some (but very few) openly gay celebrities. On the other hand, the law was used as a tool by policemen to harass gays cruising on the streets. You will often see Indian men walking hand-in-hand in the streets, but this is a sign of friendship, reaction stems from the fact that more often than not, foreign-born drug peddlers in India are of Nigerian nationality. Indians find it hard to differentiate between Nigerians and other Africans, Afro-Americans or even their own Siddi (Indians of sub-Saharan African descent) community, and this behaviour is towards the whole race and not just to any specific country. That said, this behaviour is still considered publicly unacceptable when Indians are confronted by Indians themselves. It is hence wise to keep passports handy at all times, avoid going to areas notorious for illegal activities and maintain contact with respective embassies and, if possible, with other support groups that can vouch for you.
The cow is considered to be a holy animal in Hinduism, and in many Indian states, it is illegal to consume or possess beef. Non-Hindus suspected of slaughtering a cow or eating beef are also known to have been lynched by fundamentalist Hindu mobs.
As a former British colony, India drives on the left side of the road.
Driving in India can be dangerous. Irresponsible driving habits, insufficient highway infrastructure development, wandering livestock and other hazards make travelling on the country's roads a sometimes nerve-wracking undertaking.
More than 149,000 people died on Indian roads in 2015, the highest figure in the entire world, and that's despite having only 22 cars per 1000 people (vs. 980 in socially conservative country, and although some Western habits can be perceived as dishonourable for a woman in much of the country, India is coming out of its conservative image rather quickly, especially in big cities.
The India-Pakistan conflict, simmering for decades, has manifested in terrorist attacks on India's main cities: since 2007, there have been bombings in. There is little you can do, however, to avoid such random attacks, but do keep an eye on the national news and on any travel advisories from your embassy.
Going to India, you have to adapt to a new climate and new food. However, with precautions the chance and severity of any illness can be minimised. Don't stress yourself too much at the beginning of your journey to allow your body to acclimatise, Health Plus are popular and safe brands. But if the seal has been tampered, or if the bottle seems crushed, it could be tap water being illegally sold. So always make sure that seal is intact before buying. In Indian Railway stations, a low-priced mineral water brand of Indian Railways is generally available, known as "Rail Neer".
Fruits that can be peeled such as apples and bananas, as well as packaged snacks are always a safe option. Wash any fruit with uncontaminated water before eating it..
Diarrhoea and Kashmir and Sikkim; however, the risk of infection is considered low in Delhi and the Plains. may encounter venomous snakes. If bitten, try to note the markings of the snake so that the snake can be identified and the correct antidote given. In any event, immediately seek medical care.
Medical care in India is generally of good quality. Virtually all Indian doctors speak English fluently and are highly qualified at their jobs.
Public hospitals tend to be unsanitary, overcrowded, understaffed and underequipped..
One may also consider availing the services of a private clinic. Private medical practices are common throughout the country, and are readily more accessible than hospitals..
The country code for India is 91.
In acronym-happy India, area codes are called STD codes (Subscriber Trunk Dialing - national long distance) and international dialing is called ISD (International Subscriber Dialing - international long distance).
Local phone numbers can be anywhere from 5-8 digits long. But when the STD code is included, all landline phone numbers in India are 10 digits long. Cellphone numbers are always 10 digits long and usually start with '9', '8', '7' or  ?7.20 per minute. Calls to other countries, particularly to the Middle East, can be more expensive.
Payphones, called public call offices or PCOs are now increasingly rare with the ubiqitous availability of mobile phones. Where they exist, they are usually staffed, and you dial yourself but pay to the attendant after the call is over. Metering is done per pulse and a service charge of ?2 is added to the bill. Larger cities also have Western-style unmanned public phones, which are usually red in colour and accept one rupee coins.
Airtel, Vodafone Idea, Reliance JIO and BSNL-MTNL are mobile service provider in India. Airtel, Vodafone, and JIO provide services the whole of India. There is no extra cost for roaming across India. You can use call, data and SMS services everywhere. India to India maximum call rate is ?1 per minute. You can buy 1GB (2G, 3G or 4G) data for less than ?20. You can use 4G and 4G VoLTE service everywhere. The Jio and Airtel 4G (LTE and VoLTE) networks cover 95% of the population of India. You can buy a keypad mobile for ?500. Touch mobiles retail from ?4,000.
You need a validity recharge to use your data, calls and SMS. If you don't have any validity (or unlimited) plan, you cannot use data, text, or make calls. Airtel and Vodafone Idea (VI) gives one month validity for ?49.
Calling overseas can cost quite a bit and will depend on the location you're calling to. In contrast, the other way round (calling to India from elsewhere) is cheap.
All operators provide unlimited calls in all India. With an unlimited pack, you can talk unlimited anywhere in India. Unlimited plans start at ?129 for 28 days. All operators have almost the same plans for all users.
Wi-Fi hotspots in India are, for most part, limited. The major airports and stations do offer paid Wi-Fi at around ?60 refuse to sell Simcards to foreigners (or anyone without local ID) which was not always the case: you may find an Indian resident or hotel employee willing to buy one under their name if suitably motivated. This might be the best option.
Mobile internet is very cheap to obtain, especially with the proliferation of low-cost operator Reliance Jio, which has forced the mainstream operators such as Airtel and Vodafone Idea to follow suit. It is not hard to find reaonable deals (like 1 GB per day for a month) for ?200 ($3) or so. 4G connectivity is available most places, with 3G in some remote locations. If you use the train, you may occasionally find pocket regions where the internet drops to 2G or goes away completely.
Internet kiosks are common and they charge as little as ?10-20 per hour (the cost being a compromise for speed).Many will ask for your passport or ID. Beware of using your credit cards online as there have been many cases of credit cards thefts using keyloggers. More reliable chains include Reliance World (formerly Reliance Web World) and Sify iWay..
National elections are expected to be held in the Spring of 2014. Political rallies and possible demonstrations could affect transportation. Explosions occurred in Patna in October 2013, where a large crowd had gathered for an upcoming political campaign rally. Further attacks could occur in the lead-up to the elections. Avoid all political events, demonstrations and large gatherings, monitor local developments, and follow the advice of local authorities. in western and southwestern India extends from June to September. Severe rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides, which can cut off affected areas.

Posted on October 29 2020,
There’s nothing more gorgeous than a bouquet of fresh flowers but we have to admit, it breaks our hearts a little when it’s time to throw them out.
The good news is that with some patience and a little creativity, you can give a second life to your favourite blooms meaning they’ll continue brightening up your space a little longer.
So many flowers lend themselves to drying out beautifully giving them a whole new lease of life. Whether you choose to display them in bunches as they are or spray paint them for a cool effect, the options are as endless as your mind will allow you to stretch.Cheap heroin flowing across American borders and wars between cartels are behind the rise in homicides in many large American cities, a think tank found in a report Monday.
An Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) report in May found that a spike in the murder rate of more than 20 cities. “I don’t know what the answer is, but holy cow, do we have a problem,” FBI Director Jim Comey said at the time.
At the current pace Chicago will finish the year with 550 homicides. Chicago is also home to two rival cartels the Sinaloa Cartel and the Beltran-Levya cartel. This is the premise of the American Enterprise Institute’s (AEI) study, that cities with more than one cartel are those with the highest murder rate.
The AEI report found that in the 21 of 25 cities they analyzed the pattern of more cartels equaling more crime held true. Las Vegas, one of the cities which has experienced a large spike in murders, is home to three cartels.
Mexican cartels are currently embroiled in violence, especially after Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman’s capture which has led to fractures in the Sinaloa Cartel. At the same time, cheap heroin has been entering the United States and heroin usage is at a 20 year high. The recent UN report found that heroin related deaths have increased five-fold since 2000.
Mexican cartels has wrestled control of the United States heroin market from Colombia and now controls it. This was through a change in recipe.
“To take control of the US East Coast market, it changed its product to satisfy local consumers who never used coffee-colored or black heroin, which is what is traditionally produced in Mexico,” Douglas W. Coleman, head of the Arizona division of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), said to Proceso magazine in May.
At the same time Mexico has taken control of the market their organizations have become more fractured. InSight Crime co-director Steven Dudley testified in a May 26 Senate Foreign Relations committee hearing that Mexican cartels “are not nearly as strong or monolithic as they once were.”Actions

Misty, I've known you for such a short time...
doyouknowyoudothatoutloud...
Notes:
I stopped watching AHS a while ago, I saw this thing on tumblr and also I just want to write something cute.. So here goes nothing.
Work Text:
Cordelia and Misty have been together now for over a year. It took them a whole year after Misty had finished school and decided to come back to be a teacher before they even admitted to themselves that they had feelings for each other.
The whole coven however knew of their feelings already. It was kind of obvious. And while Myrtle loved Cordelia like a daughter and wanted Delia and Misty to figure out their relationship in their own time, the last few weeks had begun to be torturous even for her to witness.
Cordelia had been practicing a proposal speech at every moment she thought she was alone, but yet for weeks she had not been able to say it to Misty. It had even become a bet amongst the coven as to how long it would take Cordelia to pop the question and whether Misty would jump up and down or faint from joy. Madison had bet on the latter. Myrtle's personal opinion was that Misty would throw herself on Cordelia and kiss her senseless.
Tonight was the forth time she had heard Cordelia start the same speech to Misty as she had tried to say the last four dates. This time the rest of the coven was on a trip, they had the entire house to themselves, well Myrtle had only come back because she had forgotten her favorite pair of glasses. And maybe to see that Delia actually went through with it this time.
"Misty, I've known you for such a short time..."
"Yep, but it's getting longer for every second'' Misty said as she leaned closer to Cordelia.
They were sitting on a couch with hundreds of lit candles around them.
"Yes...and so...I just know that I would miss you forever if something were to happen to you." Cordelia says as she plays with Misty's hair.
"Oh nothing's going to happen to me Miss Cordelia. Not as long as I have you. You are the most awesome supreme ever." Misty hugs Cordelia and kisses her cheek.
Myrtle tries to be quiet as she searches through the kitchen for her glasses. Strange she could have sworn she left them at the table. But there was just the small ring box there, not her glasses.
"Well I don't know about that. But I do know that I wouldn't be nearly as...awesome of a supreme without you. So would you please..." Cordelia stopped and started frantically lifting all the pillows on the couch.
"What's going on?" Misty asked bewildered.
"Oh for Satan's sake, she's looking for the ring" Myrtle whispered to herself as she grabbed a hold of the box and stopped trying to be quiet.
"Not again! I can't seem to do this..." Cordelia sounded exhausted as she quietly chuckled to herself.
"Do what?" Misty asked somehow still confused as to what was going on. Sometimes she could be so clueless Myrtle thought to herself but she decided to take mercy on Delia.
She stomped into the room to make her presence known. They both turned around.
"I thought you..."Cordelia began but Myrtle held up a hand to silence her.
Instead she held out the box to Misty and said "Misty, would you do me the honor of becoming my daughter-in-law?" Misty teared up as she saw that the box actually had a ring in it.
"Did you just propose to Misty for me?" Cordelia asked.
"Well my dear, someone had to do it!"
As Misty threw herself onto Cordelia Myrtle saw her glasses on this room’s table. She quickly grabbed them, put the box down and heard how Misty proceeded to kiss all and any of Cordelia's face as she walked out the front door.
Myrtle was not proud of it but as most of her was happy for them a small part of her could not help but take glee from the fact that Madison had just lost the bet.

The governor has signed nearly 745 bills, most aimed at yet more micromanagement of every aspect of our lives from Sacramento or at satisfying the interests of the organizations that funded his election. The Los Angeles Times said, “When the dust settled on Gov. Brown’s first legislative session in nearly three decades, no group had won more than organized labor.”
There you have it, the product of Brown’s first year in office: signing off on campaign payoff obligations, more Sacramento micromanagement, vetoing of bipartisan common sense reforms to increase government efficiency and effectiveness, procrastinating on regulatory reforms to help job creation, and signing a gut-and-amend bill that will ensure even more partisan gridlock – this from the man who ran on breaking the “morass of poisonous partisanship.”

4 Mins Go through
There’s a growing assortment of plant-based mostly dairy items on the industry now, from coconut yoghurts to oat milk and cashew cheese. But a single startup thinks that there is an untapped opportunity when it will come to the very little-recognised Kenari nut, a nutrient powerhouse identified in the Indonesian rainforest, grown on trees that aid to sequester carbon and secure villages from normal disasters.
The concept to start FairFlavor Foodstuff, who just lately joined Brinc’s most recent foods tech accelerator cohort, came when Italian food scientist Gabriele Castagnetti visited villages nestled in Indonesia’s Sulawesi island and stumbled throughout the Kenari nut. Castagnetti quickly fell in enjoy with the Kenari nut and informed childhood friend and fellow food stuff scientist Marcello Giannuzzi all about it above a cellphone phone.
“Gabriele and I are the two food researchers, we had been born in the Emilia Romagna area, also identified as the Italian Food Valley, and graduated together in Italy again in 2002,” Giannuzzi advised Inexperienced Queen Media.
Just after mastering additional about Kenari nuts, which are grown on Canarium indicum trees in the Japanese Indonesian location, furnishing communities with shelter versus typhoons and natural disasters although absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, the two stated that launching a venture that utilised the tremendous crop – packed with protein and important amino acids, loaded with fibre, nutritional vitamins and minerals – was a no-brainer.
Our proprietary engineering boosts texturisation and creates that bouquet of flavors that you can only accomplish by fermentation.
Marcello Giannuzzi, Co-Founder, FairFlavor Foods
“We quick ahead a several years and listed here we are, bringing vegan, delectable non-dairy cheeses, gelato and desserts at net benefit to nature,” said Giannuzzi.
Since its inception in November previous year, the startup has speedily absent to operate to start off building dairy-cost-free prototypes. Working with microbial and enzymatic fermentation – a technologies a bit diverse to Perfect Day’s precision technological know-how, but still sitting in the “third pillar” of fermentation choice proteins – FairFlavor Food items is capable to eliminate all the off-flavours from the nut and build dairy alternatives that are “same but better”.
“Our firm is however extremely youthful, but we have been equipped to create our initial practical product cheese and gelato paste prototypes,” Giannuzzi described. “Our proprietary know-how improves texturisation and generates that bouquet of flavours that you can only reach via fermentation.”
Describing their fermentation approach as “revolutionary”, the co-founder additional that the close products is able to produce the “unique creamy flavor and texture” that people wish when it comes to dairy goods – often the most tricky group to quit for individuals striving toward a plant-centered eating plan.
Our objective is to finish the merchandise progress and market place screening cycle of our original cheese goods right before the stop of 2021.
Marcello Giannuzzi, Co-Founder, FairFlavor Meals
With ongoing R&D, FairFlavor Food items claims it hopes to be in a position to launch a entire range of Kenari nut-based mostly cheeses – like spreadable, stretchable, challenging and semi-really hard cheese choices. Vegan cheese is a rapidly-increasing classification, predicted to double from its existing US$2.7 billion industry benefit to US$4.5 billion by as soon as 2025.
FairFlavor Food items has also set its sights on producing dairy-cost-free gelatos and desserts working with Kenari nuts. Giannuzzi suggests that the organization programs on capturing each B2B and B2C opportunities.
“Our target is to finish the item development and current market tests cycle of our first cheese products and solutions prior to the stop of 2021,” he told Environmentally friendly Queen Media. “We strategy to launch our gelato in the subsequent months following reside market place screening which we are now conducting.”
Whilst the food tech has so considerably been bootstrapped, they will before long be gaining obtain to funding by the Brinc application, as perfectly as the MassChallenge accelerator that it has joined, in purchase to gas its enhancement and scale up options.
“We can accessibility pre-seed funding, and we will quickly engage with buyers that share our eyesight and values for the next round,” explained Giannuzzi.

How to skull mount We’re still worn out from a 4-day bender in Vegas…meaning walking the 630,000 sq ft SHOT Show, the firearms and hunting trade show. This week’s top 5 is a rundown of some of the coolest new stuff we thought you’ll want for the woods next fall. So here we go! >> If you’re getting the Deer Blaster for the first time it’s because a deer-crazed buddy signed you up! Today’s Top 5 Winchester builds another legend? From guns. >The .350 Legend will be available solely on the XPR line of bolt action rifles, but we expect more news soon. Here’s a quick video on it: We were told that part of Winchester’s thought process was to build a straight-walled cartridge that’ll work in an AR-style platform, so look for gunmakers to offer .350 Legend black guns before long! Steyr rocks the Monobloc. Good writeup at the thefirearmblog.com: > The most significant feature of this rifle is that the barrel and receiver are a one-piece part…the receiver and barrel of Steyr Monobloc are hammer-forged out of the same bar stock of steel, and represent a single part. [Fewer parts = typically better accuracy.] > The Monobloc rifle also has an ergonomic stock with a modern or maybe a bit futuristic appearance. The stock features an aluminum bedding block and leather inlays. [Gotta admit, those leather inlays were really cushy, and the whole thing had a very ergonomic feel….] > …first available chambered in .308 Winchester or .30-06 Springfield. Later the following caliber options will be added: 270 Win., 7×64, 8x57IS. Only huge red flag is the rifle’s $5,300 price tag. [Huge eyes emoji] But then Steyr has never been a budget brand.

Here’s the down-low, from deergeartv.com: > The DeathGrip lets the hunter be hands-free to glass or call on the hunt with ease…the non-marring over-molded rubber prevents damage to weapons. > Available in carbon fiber and aluminum tripod…leg angle adjustment for 3 preset angles…20° – Standing Position…45° – Sitting Position…85° – Prone Position. If you’ve ever used shooting sticks, you know they’re never where you need them…when the booner shows up! I’m told that with these, you can move ’em wherever you want and they’re always gonna be at the same level wherever you place ’em. Is it a gun? Is it a crossbow?

If you get in a bad bind, the silicone will break before pulling your finger off. > Being made of silicone ensures that nothing will stick to it. No matter what you stick your hand in, it won’t stick…. > The deer have no idea you are climbing into the stand until you clang your ring against the ladder…. Being flashy and showing off some bling has its place, but when being stealthy in the woods it is a terrible idea.

The stalk was close to 300 yards, and the wind had changed which allowed Dennis to follow the fenceline along the top of the hill and get within 37 yards… The shot was on a steep angle, and the arrow hit a bit high. The deer dropped in its tracks and rolled down the hill about 50 yards. Great stalk and great job Dennis, wow! 2. LA: Super blood wolf moon >> super double-drop buck. > Mon, Jan. 21 a rare phenomenon took place…a Super Blood Wolf Moon…. Shannon Harper probably wasn’t thinking about wolves when he marked his calendar to be on his deer stand 2 days prior…. > “Trailcam photos had been showing this buck coming out right after dark, but I knew that as the full moon approached, his visit to my food plot would be earlier each evening. This is why my calendar had the few days prior to Monday circled…felt my best chance at him would be just before the full moon. > “When he turned broadside to me, I put the scope on my .35 Whelen on his shoulder, hit the trigger and he dropped. > The deer was a mainframe 10-point with 2 drop tines and 2 small kickers. The inside spread was 18″…scored as a 14-point measuring 161 1/8″. 3. LA: BASS pro Caleb Sumrall sticks a nice buck.

I had to get his attention one more time. It came flying right to me. I shot him at about 45 yards” with the Carbon Express Maxima arrow released from his BowTech Sanity bow…. > The 31-year-old outdoorsman’s deer hunting season was compressed into a few short months because of his other passion, bass fishing, a sport that he has made his career. 4. WY: Possible regs for shed hunting? > Two bills are currently moving through the legislature that would give the WY Game and Fish Department more flexibility to manage the collecting of antlers…. > “We get people on both sides. On easier winters, some people want us to open the season earlier and then on harder winters, sometimes it would be nice to keep the antler season closed a little longer into May to prevent further stress on those big game animals.” > Antler collecting has become more popular in WY since neighboring states began regulating the practice more strictly…people can also sell the brown elk antlers for as much as $13 a lb. 5. OK: Deer-blasters bagged 100K whitetails this season. > For the second year in a row, OK deer hunters hit 6 digits with their harvest…. OK’s deer herd is in great shape and history says it’s ready to produce for seasons to come. > Deer hunting in OK has flown under the national radar. The crazy number of really big bucks harvested last season brought overdue notoriety to the state, but local hunters have been very aware of how good the hunting has been for the last 20 years. > We have had several years of good habitat conditions. Deer have had plenty to eat and plenty of places to hide. It would be easy to think if drought occurred and habitat conditions offered hunters an advantage, we could see a harvest that exceeded 120,000 in the next few years. 6. MO: Nearly 300K deer taken!! > …more deer than were taken in the 2017-2018 season (284,477 whitetails) but below the record 313,254 deer killed in 2012-2013. > Of this season’s tally, 136,776 deer were antlered bucks, 30,116 were button bucks and 123,447 were does. > Preliminary data from MDC showed that hunters checked 54,447 deer during the archery season. Tip of the Week Ever do your own skull mount? We all know good taxidermy ain’t cheap. Ever thought about doing your own European skull mount? I have but never have…for some reason.

Chief Michael McNamee said the district was able to purchase 80 particulate blocking firefighting hoods. These hoods are a huge improvement over previous single layer hoods that acted generally as heat protection only. The new NFPA certified hoods are a special three-layer hood with the center layer specifically designed to filter out microscopic particulates that would normally make way onto the firefighters most vulnerable body area, the neck and head. The purchase of 80 allows the WFD to issue a hood to each of its 38 interior certified members, and retain a ready cache to be exchanged immediately after a fire.
Secondly, the WFD was able to purchase an additional 13 sets of structural firefighting turnout gear above the normal replacement budget. This has allowed them to schedule complete turnout gear replacement for all of interior certified members in 5 years. This new specification of turnout gear is similar to the hoods in that it is designed with features to prevent smoke exposure. Special skirts with elastic like bands prevent smoke from entering traditionally vulnerable areas like under the jacket and up pant legs.
Projecting forward, the WFD will now be able to plan to remove turnout gear from front line use before its mandated retirement age of 10 years, allowing them to readily fit newer interior members with approximately fitting equipment. After 10 years, they are regulated to using turnout gear only for exterior and support firefighters.

In total, petro producers there have spent $6.8 billion in order to acquire the necessary facilities, according the UAE’s government website.
The UAE is the world’s largest producer of petrodollars and the petro company Petrochem SA (PES) has been building petro plants in the Gulf.
However, the UAE is not alone in this process.
Petrochem SA has invested heavily in petro power plants, particularly those in Bahrain, where it has built the largest coal power plant in history.
But in addition to petro facilities, Qatar is also seeking to develop petro plant in other countries, with Saudi Arabia and the UAE already constructing petro factories.
Petrochemical power plants have been built in countries including Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, the United States, Mexico, Peru, Colombia, and Chile.
Some countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia, are also seeking additional petro energy sources, including liquefied natural gas (LNG) and gas.
A growing number of countries in Europe are also looking to diversify their petro supplies.
For example, the European Union has announced that it is exploring the possibility of developing the petropower sector in order for it to compete in the petrotrotropics market.
In May 2018, the EU said it was considering the possibility to establish petropowers in Europe, a move that would help the EU maintain its position as the petroleaking market leader.
Europe is currently the largest petro exporter in the entire world, accounting for nearly half of the world production of petropoys.
At the end of 2017, the German state-owned oil giant Daimler AG (DAIG) announced it was developing petrofuels for the German market.
Daimlers subsidiary, Daimle, is the largest producer in the Petropoys Group of Germany.
Although the petrocide market is still young, the petrol industry is growing rapidly.
The global market for petro oil and gas is expected to reach $17 trillion by 2025, according a report by the International Energy Agency.
With petro fuel in hand, petros have also developed new ways of using petroleum products to power plants.
Many petro companies have started using petro fuels to power solar and wind turbines.
But the growing popularity of petrol in the solar power sector has led to the introduction of petrotropies in the global power market.
For example, in 2017, two petroporos of Saudi Arabia built a plant for producing petro liquids called MOMM, which produces hydrocarbons and ethanol.
Another company, the Petrolia Solar Company, began making use of the petrotechnology that it developed to power photovoltaic modules.
Pets, the Future of PetroEnergy source: Gulf News article The growth of petrotechnics in the power industry and the development of petriculture has been one of the major drivers of petrocides in the past decade.
It has led, in some cases, to the loss of thousands of jobs in the oil and petropro industries, as well as the loss and damage of livelihoods for millions of people.
The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2017 stated that the economic impact of petrolechnology-related diseases was estimated to be worth $2 trillion worldwide.
If the global petro industry continues to grow and petrol is able to provide cheap energy for the entire population of the planet, there is a chance that we will see more and more petro compounds being used to power our future.Five hard-hit Anne Arundel County businesses receive grants to recover from the tropical storm and tornado that struck the region on Wednesday, September 1.
As previously reported on Conduit Street, Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman and the Anne Arundel Economic Development Corporation (AAEDC) last month launched the Disaster Recovery Micro Grant Program (DRMGP) to help businesses recover from the tropical storm and tornado that struck the region on Wednesday, September 1.
Funded with $25,000 from the TD Charitable Foundation, the charitable giving arm of TD Bank, the program is providing five of the hardest hit businesses with $5,000 grants for physical property repairs, replacement of business equipment, replacement of inventory, lease/rental support, vendor bill support, moving costs, and more.
According to an AAEDC press release:
The following four businesses and one nonprofit each received $5,000 – the maximum grant amount they were eligible to receive:
- Annapolis International Market, a multicultural grocery store that had only opened in January 2021.
- Chris’s Charcoal Pit, a Greek restaurant that’s been in business for over 30 years.
- Cricket Wireless
- Panther Auto Body, owned and operated by a graduate of Annapolis High School.
- Cecil Memorial United Methodist Church, where Annapolis residents have worshipped for nearly 100 years.
The grants, which will not need to be paid back, can be used for any legitimate business expense including physical property repairs, replacement of business equipment, replacement of inventory, lease/rental support, vendor bill support, or moving expenses support.
“We are so thankful for this grant,” said Mary Sellers, who owns Panther Auto Body with her husband, Pete. “Every little bit helps. We have spent so much fixing up our business, and we just want to say thank you so much.”

Mostly it’s because insurers are nervous about whether they’re going to lose the CSR subsidies that are part of Obamacare. President Trump has deliberately chosen to keep this dangling, so insurers have to raise their rate requests in case he decides to stop paying it. Insurers are also nervous about the individual mandate, which helps bring young, healthy customers into the insurance pool. Republicans have been talking about officially forbidding the IRS from enforcing it, and if that happens rates will have to go up too.
Charles Gaba has gone through the rate requests of 20 states, and he figures that these two things account for about 71 percent of the size of the rate hikes that have been requested so far. In other words, if insurers in your state are asking for a 20 percent increase, 6 percent of that is from normal causes and 14 percent is from deliberate Republican efforts to destabilize the individual market.
California’s exchanges are well run, and the state is fully committed to Obamacare. The state insurance commissioner has asked insurers to submit two rate requests for 2018—one with and one without uncertainty over CSR and the mandate—and these rate requests are set to be unveiled on Monday. It’s going to be an important bellwether.

APPLETON - Most people on the brink of retirement don't go looking for more work. But most aren't like Chris Linn.
Just as he was set to retire as vice president of marketing and business development at Bassett Mechanical Contractors and Engineers in Kaukauna, Linn heard concerns from a colleague that she was having trouble connecting and communicating with local school districts.
Because of that, she wasn't sure how they'd continue recruiting students for its co-op program, which for years had provided local high school students with opportunities to learn about careers in the trades.
That gave Linn an idea. Newly retired with four decades of work in the business world and a decade's experience in education before that, he could become a sort of "go between" Fox Valley businesses like Bassett and the Appleton Area School District.
"I realized how much teachers and students did not have an understanding of what was going on out there in the world of work — what careers were out there and how wonderful those opportunities were," Linn recalled. "That was my passion, and I thought the best way to spread the word was to bring people together."

RELATED:These Wisconsin programs stuff kids' backpacks with food so they can come to school focused on learning
Now, after eight years of tireless volunteering for the district, the Appleton Education Foundation has awarded Linn the Thomas G. Scullen Leadership Award. Named after the late Appleton schools Superintendent Thomas Scullen, a co-founder of AEF, the award honors a Fox Cities resident who is considered an education leader.
Greg Hartjes, the Appleton school district's chief financial officer, said he nominated Linn for the honor because of his continued support for many career-based learning initiatives across the district, as well as his "instrumental" work in launching Appleton Technical Academy (A-Tech), a charter school focused on manufacturing that's housed at Appleton West.
"He's really a champion of these initiatives," Hartjes said. "We're really happy any time we can recognize someone who has for many, many years been supporting our district through the Education Foundation, and Chris has certainly done that."
'A win-win for business and education'
Not long after approaching the school district with his idea, Linn got started organizing student tours, job shadows, internships and apprenticeships at Fox Valley businesses.
Rita O'Brien, the district's coordinator of career-based learning and career and technical education, said Linn came at a great time, as the state had recently begun requiring all school districts to have a plan in place for providing academic and career planning to students.
Around that time, the Appleton school board also declared a district priority to better integrate the world of work and career planning in the day-to-day classroom.
Linn helped O'Brien build a district-wide classroom for career programming to streamline business engagement and make teachers — not just students — aware of the many opportunities students may have in business and the trades in the Fox Valley.
Linn also played a role in creating the district's Career Launch Studios, which serve as venues for students, teachers and parents to connect with business professionals and promote career awareness and exploration. Each of the high schools either currently has, or will have, its own studio.
"To be able to have Chris, who has these expertise — that really helped me to be able to bring this program to fruition," O'Brien said. "His collaborative nature is really a win-win for business and education."
Meeting the manufacturing demand
Talk of starting a new charter school focused on manufacturing came with the rising demand for advanced manufacturing talent. According to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, about 23% of employment in northeastern Wisconsin is in manufacturing.
Linn was the first guy Hartjes, who was at the time principal of Appleton West, turned to for help in developing the school.
"The thing I've always really appreciated about Chris is that he didn't just come with an issue, he wanted to be part of the solution," Hartjes said. "We understood education, but we didn't know enough about manufacturing and the business community here in the Valley."
RELATED: Appleton high school students learn by doing manufacturing jobs
RELATED: Appleton charter school focuses on skilled trades
With Linn's help, the district launched the school with about 50 students in 2013. That, Hartjes said, was in large part due to Linn's work with marketing and promoting the school, soliciting donations of equipment and supplies, and securing thousands of dollars in monetary donations.
In its sixth year, A-Tech has grown to serve nearly 90 students grades nine through 12.
Linn has remained involved, serving as an at-large member of the A-Tech governing board.
Hartjes said volunteers like Linn are very rare.
"He's just someone who wants to give back to the community," Hartjes said.

Heroic Statistics About Us
Auto Repair Technical Statistics You Must KnowAbstract
A bacterium which grows in a medium containing D-serine as a sole nitrogen source has been isolated from soil and identified as Aeromonas caviae. The bacterium had a high enzyme activity catalyzing racemization of various amino acids. The enzyme, purified to homogeneity by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation, has a molecular weight of about 76,000, and is composed of two subunits identical in molecular weight (40,000). The results of enantiomeric analysis of the reaction product and kinetic examination of the reaction indicate that the enzyme catalyzes the complete racemization of substrates. The enzyme has absorption maxima at 280 and 420 nm, and contains 2 mol of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate per mol of enzyme. The holoenzyme is resolved to the apoenzyme by treatment with hydroxylamine, and reconstituted by the addition of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate. The very broad substrate specificity of the A. caviae amino acid racemase is comparable to that of the Pseudomonas striata enzyme. However, they share no common antigenic determinants.

Awarded the Medal of Honor. As quartermaster on board the “U.S.S. Ironclad Steamer Monitor”, at Hampton Roads, at the mouth of the James River, on 9 Mar 1862, he was at the helm. During the engagement between the “U.S.S. Monitor” and the “C.S.S. Merrimack”, the “Merrimack” was trying to attack the warship “Minnesota”, which was grounded on a sand bar and awaiting the next high tide. The “Monitor” went forth to protect the “Minnesota”. Williams “gallantly served throughout the engagement, piloting the Monitor throughout the battle which ended when the Merrimack, after being damaged, retired from the scene of the battle”. When a shell from the Merimack slammed into the pilot house and blinded Captain John Worden, Williams never left his post. A US Navyman named Peter Williams died on 31 May 1863 and is buried in Plot 12 in Mt. Moriah Cemetery, Philadelphia. Sources: (“America’s Medal of Honor Recipients”.

Forty students and six faculty members participated in the Society for Advancement of Management (SAM) Business Cases, Workplace Communication, and Leadership Professional Development Workshop May 1 & 2. Dr. Beth Polin, Assistant Professor of Management and SAM Advisor, provided the vision and leadership for the two-day event.
Workshop leader, Marc Ankerman, related well to all of the attendees with very relevant messaging. Ankerman has been in human resource training and education for over 29 years. He is currently a Senior Lecturer at The Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business delivering a variety of professional development courses to MBA students. He is a former Director of Training at Williams-Sonoma, Express, Michigan National Bank and Galileo International. Ankerman specializes in the multi-unit, multi-divisional retail world.
The two-day event was an interactive workshop on professionalism, team design and function, problem solving, persuasive presentations, and managing realistic workplace situations.
Polin commented, "This workshop allowed students to consider the theories, models, and examples they encounter in the classroom and apply them to real-world business situations. They had to pull knowledge from a variety of business areas and think critically to solve challenging business cases." She continued, "The students approached this professional development opportunity with a great deal of talent and enthusiasm."
According to department chair, Dr. Lana Carnes, "Without question, students gained valuable insight into communicating effectively and persuasively in the workplace. The case competition was fun, as well as a valuable learning experience for all." She continued, "Students took the competition seriously and presented themselves professionally for the event."
SAM promotes interaction with professionals in all disciplines and increases awareness and knowledge of career opportunities. It encourages cross-functional participation in activities that will benefit students' choice of career and future success. For more information, contact Dr. Beth Polin at beth.polin@eku.edu.

Creating a Healthy Lifestyle by Breaking the Cycle of Abuse
— One person’s story
When I think of how First Step has helped me, I think back to when I first heard about the agency. It was directly after a domestic incident in a previous marriage. I don’t remember the name of the nurse in the ER and I am not even sure I was looking at her because I had felt so ashamed as to why I was in there in the first place. I think at that time in my life, looking at the floor or the ground had become common practice for me because I felt I didn’t see anyone else and maybe they wouldn’t notice me either. I did not like to draw attention to myself anymore than I already had.
I do vividly remember a brochure being handed to me, almost as if it were in slow motion. Nothing too fancy about it, but the words First Step kind of caught my attention. I am sure that I was agreeing to everything that was being said to me by the nurses and doctors and nodding my head in agreement because I was in an extreme hurry to get out of there as quickly as I could. I made sure that I kept the brochure with me because if there was anything I needed at the time it was a first step away from the life I had lived for so many years. If someone would have told me then how my life would be now I think it would have been a blur like everything else that was being said to me that day. There is one thing for sure, that brochure saved my life.
The connection I made with First Step was the best thing that I could have done for myself in a long time. Though it was a process of steps, a process of decisions, and a process of relearning a healthy way of living and not continuing a cycle of abuse in which I had been raised with and also followed me into adulthood. First Step empowered me with the information I needed to make my life better.
I can remember being abused as far back as the age of three. Abuse is a learned behavior and for the first 28 years of my life that’s how I learned to be loved by people abusing me. When that is all you know it is a normal way to live, that is until you learn the healthy choices you can make and what seems so simple to me now was very foreign not so long ago.
I choose to be healthy, raise my children with the same healthy decisions; I choose to be proud, responsible, trustworthy, honest, dependable and considerate. I describe myself with these words because I believe them to be true and I choose not to let my abusive past define me and imprison me. There are some people in my abusive past that I have no choice but to come in contact with on occasion and there are always going to be people who do not have the same healthy way of living and will try to make things difficult for me and others.
First Step has given me the education and information I need to be able to handle myself in a safe and dignified manner when those situations occur. First Step not only helped me, but can help you to. By helping me, they have helped a lot of people I come in contact with, my children, because I am now a better parent, my employer, because I am now a better employee, and our community, because I have become a better citizen and in turn that helps you too.
I have had contact with First Step for 15 years, and though I’m not in “crisis” anymore, I don’t think I will ever stop learning from what First Step has to offer. Though I have come a long way in the right direction, knowing that First Step’s doors are always open should that road ever get bumpy again is a feeling of safety that words cannot describe.
Coshocton-area Girl Scout Cadettes in Troop #60468, under the leadership of Lois Michael, recently logged more than 100 community service hours on their quest to complete two Girl Scout Silver Award projects.
Kaitlyn Krebs, Taylor Holderbaum and Brook Huskey, 8th-grade students at Coshocton Junior High School, focused their efforts on establishing Chemo Cap Day. They researched different crochet and knitting patterns in order to make caps for local cancer patients. The girls spent hours learning different stitching techniques and settled on a cap design. The girls even visited cancer patients at Coshocton Memorial Hospital where they distributed the chemotherapy caps.
The troop’s second project, Cases for Kids, focused on a suitcase and duffel bag drive for foster children. The project was conducted by Katie Stiteler, Emily Fender, Betsy Fender and Anna Havranek, middle school students at Coshocton Junior High School. The girls chose this project because they wanted children entering foster care to be able to prepare properly and pack their necessities when an emergency situation occurred and they needed to move from one home to another. Unfortunately, many abused and neglected children find themselves in this predicament because a suitcase or garment bag is not available.
The girls, with support from the community and the employees at the local Wal-Mart, were able to collect a large number of new and gently-used suitcases and duffel bags, which they donated to the local Job and Family Services. Special thanks go out to Grace United Methodist Church for serving as the drop-off site.
George had a really good paying job with a construction company until he was injured on the job. Unfortunately the company did not cover benefits of health insurance or worker’s compensation and George needed surgery. Every penny he had was going to living expenses and so he reluctantly went to the Salvation Army for help. They were able to secure food, clothing, rent and utility assistance for George while he recovered from his surgery and physical therapy. George was able to get another job at a competitor construction company that did provide benefits and now George is living self-sufficiently on his own due to the temporary assistance he was able to receive from the Salvation Army.
Watch Them Thrive: The Case for Developmental Screening
A new initiative Birth to 5: Watch Me Thrive!, was launched recently by the U.S. Departments of Health & Human Services and Education to promote healthy child development and universal developmental screening for children. You might be thinking to yourself, “Haven’t we heard this before? Hasn’t the use of developmental screenings been encouraged for years?” - and you would be correct. In 2006, the AAP made a strong stand advocating the use of developmental screening to identify infants and young children with developmental delays. Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) benefits under state Medicaid programs also strongly support early identification. So we have heard this before, but there are three new reasons that I am excited about the Watch Me Thrive! initiative.
One, for the first time, there is an open source developmental screening tool available. In prior years, you had to pay for a screening tool, but now the Survey of Well-being of Young Children (SWYC) provides an easy-to-read, 10-item screening tool that can be found online and printed for use at no charge. The easy and free access to this tool will allow primary care providers who increasingly rely on the use of electronic medical records to more easily integrate developmental screening into their practices. There is no more excuse not to screen because of the hassle of costs and paper. In fact, already families have completed over 17,000 SWYC screenings using our electronic medical record across CHOP’s 31 primary care practices. Also, the SWYC has already been thoughtfully translated into Spanish, Nepali and Burmese. It is a great help having developmental screening tools in the primary language of some of the United States’ growing immigrant and refugee populations!
A second significant part of Watch Me Thrive! is it shows us that developmental screening and surveillance can have a frame that is positive. Developmental screening is not just for children who are at risk, but for all children. It opens the door for celebrating a child’s new skills and the important role of parents and caregivers. Developmental screening also opens the door to talking about next steps, not just for the child who might have delays, but also for the child who is progressing as expected.
And the third reason I’m excited about Watch Me Thrive! is it provides an opportunity at well child visits for pediatricians to discuss preschool and high quality early learning programs with parents. Doesn’t it make sense to use the 30-month visit at a pediatrician’s office not just to rule out delays using a developmental screening tool, but also to suggest to a family that enrollment in preschool or high quality childcare is a good idea? Children who attend high quality preschools start kindergarten ready. Hearing this from a pediatrician may be a big encouragement for a family!David Yassky was officially overruled.

TRANSCRIPT:
For several decades now, the corporate model has inserted itself into the university. The phenomenon gained momentum in the 1980s under the influence of political conservatism and the consequences are with us still. It seemed to the Ronald Reagans and Margaret Thatchers of the world that liberalism had run amok through the 60s and 70s, and not only on university campuses. All disciplines of the arts and humanities came under a cloud of suspicion while STEM subjects, being less political and having clearer vocational utility, were pushed. More recently, the medical model has also gained a certain prominence in the university of our time. Many students now think of themselves, and are treated by the institution as well, as some combination of consumers and medical patients, with professors being cast in the role of service providers and often enough a certain kind of social worker as well. A large dose of identity politics and political correctness has contributed to a situation where today we seem to have forgotten—if we ever really knew—what a university is and what its reason for being is. The symptoms are many, from a bloated and politically orthodox administration to students with precisely one question on their minds—how are you going to get a job with that?—and an institution that in many ways resembles a corporation, in others a hospital, and in others a church or political echo-chamber.
Critics of the corporate model and of the new managerialism are many, and philosophers of education have been trying for a while now to construct a new understanding of what a university is. In theory, a university is an institution with a well-defined mission: to create new knowledge and to impart knowledge to students. That’s the short story. The longer one is more complicated, but the long and short of it is that a university is a place where knowledge is pursued by professors and our students, and not only knowledge that can lead to a profitable career but knowledge in general, in all fields of inquiry. A student, again in theory, can pursue their interests in any subject and pursue it freely, in association with others or more independently if they wish.
In my view, the main sources of the widespread confusion regarding the very idea of a university are the corporate model, the medical model, and the political orthodoxy that currently pervade so many institutions of higher learning. The great anathema of the university is (or should be) orthodoxy, and orthodoxy comes in many forms. It’s the nature of orthodoxy to stop thinking in its tracks. Its basic claim is that we already know what is essential; all that remains is to iron out some details and to spread the news. There’s no need to pursue knowledge because we already have it—or some do, and the rest just need to get in line. To get them in line, we need to surround every member of the university—professors, administrators, and students—with precisely one system of belief, and whether the system itself is religious, political, technological, or anything else doesn’t really matter. What matters is that all sing from the same hymnbook, and it’s the death of thinking and of the university. This is easily mistaken for idealism, and it’s normally well intentioned as well, but good intentions don’t matter much. When you go to a church, you know what to expect; they’re going to promote one particular set of beliefs. They’re going to ask you to accept a particular worldview, and they’re quite overt about it. You know what you’re getting, and if you don’t buy it, you’re free to go elsewhere. This isn’t quite the case at a university. Most people now believe that after graduating from high school you must then spend a good few years in a university, the best one you can get into, and for reasons that are not always clear. You simply must. If you want to have social respectability, if you want to be taken seriously, if you want to enter or remain in the middle class, you need to have a degree and ideally more than one. The university is the gateway to all of this—to full membership in modern society, in the economy, and in some kind of cultural elite as well. There’s a certain snob factor that’s at work here, but my worry is something else, and it has to do with our ability to understand what a university is and what it’s for. It’s not for producing converts to a creed, but pretty nearly the opposite.
We hear a lot of talk about difference on university campuses today. By difference what’s generally meant is differences of identity, not differences of thought. For a few decades now it’s been one of the watchwords of the left, where differences are all well and good so long as we’re speaking of differences of race, gender, sexual orientation, or culture. What about differences of thought, for example, of political opinion? They’re not quite so valued. On the subject of politics, what’s valued is positive acceptance of a particular stance, departures from which are usually deemed offensive. To anyone who has spent time in a university it should be obvious that ideas are not refuted by being declared offensive. It’s not anyone’s feelings that make an idea true or false, plausible or implausible, but reasons, arguments, and evidence. Feelings are not an argument. Any first-year student should know this, and today many professors don’t. If someone is emotionally wounded by a political or any other intellectual statement, this may be due either to the statement itself or to the emotional sensitivities of the person hearing it. Quite often the problem doesn’t lie with the statement. If a student or anyone else at a university is narrow-minded, doctrinaire, or intolerant, what they need is precisely to be offended, unsettled, and disillusioned. They need to have the rug pulled out, and it’s their professors’ job to pry open minds by exposing them to ideas that are challenging and different.
The first principle of all education is academic freedom—the freedom to think what you will, to inquire into any field of knowledge, to read and write whatever you want without fear, so long as you back it up with some intelligent argumentation or evidence. Freedom of the mind and free expression, like all rights, have limits, but in any university that’s worth attending or working in, those limits are very minimal indeed and do not extend to any kind of mandatory or expected belief system. No university administrator or professor is going to tell you directly that you must accept this or that system of belief. They are far more sophisticated than this, and any orthodoxy that they push has likely been pushed on them as well. It’s a ubiquitous phenomenon, and it works by slandering any alternative without a hearing, surrounding the mind on all sides, and offering some utility—usually some social approval or acceptance—in exchange for your belief.
The university as I think of it is an unusual kind of place. It’s an institution that values controversy and disagreement, and values them highly. The differences that it values are differences of thought far more than identity. The university is a natural home for radicals and visionaries, most of whose ideas will probably never gain much currency, but they might. It’s a free marketplace of ideas, where all ideas—no matter who expresses them—are nothing more than hypotheses that must be investigated and questioned, and no opinion of any kind is to be accepted on faith. The university is a place where students have the luxury of not knowing what they believe and are free to keep an open mind, wander in the wilderness for a few years, and follow their interests, whatever these happen to be. Pursuing what you’re interested in may or may not lead to a profitable career, but what it will lead to is an examined life, a competent citizen, and a human being who is awake to their own existence and to what’s happening in the world. Hans-Georg Gadamer thought the student’s task is to live with ideas and to find what he called their free space, to think for yourself and to inquire into whatever interests you. The institution is supposed to make this optimally possible, but I am not convinced it is currently very effective in doing this. Whether you’re a student or a professor, finding a free space should be a very easy thing to do—given that academic freedom is fundamental to any university’s mission—and in my experience it is the opposite of easy. It is difficult and getting ever more difficult.Username

The developers of the Salvadoran crypto wallet Chivo have disabled the display of the price of bitcoin when buying or selling it in the application. According to the announcement of the project team, users used the freezing of the value of the first cryptocurrency for one minute, which occurs when making an exchange, in order to make money on the difference in exchange rates using arbitration. In a minute, users had time to compare the price of bitcoin on crypto exchanges.
If the value of bitcoin on exchanges increases, users buy an asset in Chivo, taking advantage of the fact that it is blocked. When the price of an asset on the exchanges decreases, the user is sold it at the value fixed by the application.
Also, the developers of Chivo will refuse to freeze the value of bitcoin and change the algorithm for converting funds. In the near future, the application will return the display of the bitcoin price when making a transaction. After that, the funds will be converted in real time, taking into account the current exchange rate.
On October 16, the President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, reported that residents of the country contribute much more US dollars to the Chivo wallet than they withdraw.
Chivo is a cryptocurrency wallet that was developed by the government of El Salvador after bitcoin became the official means of payment in the country along with the US dollar.
On September 7, a law on granting the first cryptocurrency the status of legal tender came into force in El Salvador. On the same day, the country’s authorities bought 550 bitcoins. Later, the President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, announced the purchase of another 150 bitcoins.IntroBig Sean

Finally Famous in this, gettin'

[Verse] all fam
And came back to the city that made us all men
Except we kings now, reflecting, trying to take it all in
I put the city on my back
So that way if I fall I'm crowd surfing the map
I turn mistakes into lessons, dead ends to exits
On the journey of my life, so I'm inviting y'all to get in

About
The intro to Big Sean’s debut album Finally Famous revisits the KeY Wane-produced instrumental of “Memories,” the ultimate track off of the final installment of the Finally Famous mixtape trilogy. To achieve full cohesion with the ending of the mixtape series, which served as the build-up to his long-awaited debut album, Big Sean opens by playing on the first line of “Memories,” and so the album continues where the mixtapes left off..

Our last overnight stop before flying back to Tokyo was Nagoya, the country’s fourth largest city and a major maritime port.
We caught a mid-morning train from Takayama, a three-hour ride away. Mariko-san bought us these adorable sarubobo (baby monkey) -shaped lunchboxes for lunch. Every meal in Japan that we’ve had so far was meticulously presented – bentos bought from any regular convenience store were no exception.
I had the stir-fried beef with shredded egg and fried fish cakes on a bed of fluffy white rice, served with half a boiled egg, some pickles, boiled prawn and some kombu (kelp).
View as our train cut through the countryside. We saw swathes of green paddy fields and vegetable farms, quaint villages and in some parts of the journey, beautiful river gorges running through valleys and hills.
Arrived in Nagoya in the afternoon.
Compared to the small towns and rural cities on our itinerary, Nagoya was massive and very modern. We stayed in the city centre, which was surrounded by tall buildings, malls and offices.
Had a quick rest and then it was off again to Nagoya Castle! Built in the 16th century, it was the ruling centre of the Owari clan, one of the three branches of the powerful Tokugawa Shogunate, and therefore ranked among the grandest castles in Japan during the Edo era. Unfortunately the original structure was bombed to bits during World War II, so the building we see today is a reconstruction made from concrete, built in 1959.
We were lucky that we got to visit in the summer,because the Japanese government decided to close it in November this year for a major undertaking – to restore the main keep to its original wooden state. As such, the keep will be closed until 2020.
Fret not though – the castle’s palace (Honmaru Goten), which is in front of the main keep, will be completed in Spring 2018 , and will be open to the public for viewing. The palace, which was also destroyed during World War II, was rebuilt using traditional construction materials and techniques.
Mythical golden tiger-headed carps called Kinshachi are a symbol of the castle and two of them, one male and one female, top either end of the castle roof. They were believed to be talismans to prevent fires… ironic, seeing that the originals were destroyed in a fire (can’t win against the evil of man) and their gold colouring, a symbol of the wealth and prestige of the Tokugawa empire. The carps we see today are reconstructed models, each weighing over a tonne with 40+kg of gold plating.
Although we knew it was a reconstruction, we couldn’t help feeling awed at how majestic the castle looked! It must have been even more impressive during its heyday. Sitting atop a high stone wall and surrounded by a moat, it would have made mounting an assault on the keep exceedingly difficult. The main keep towers five storeys-high, with curving green roofs and white walls.
Interesting tidbit: Building of the castle was not done by the Tokugawa family alone. Instead, they portioned it out to daimyos (lords) under them, each in charge of one section of the castle. The lords would leave carvings of their crests so there would be no dispute over who built what. Pretty ingenious.
Since it’s a popular tourist attraction, visitors will find costumed-actors roaming around the courtyard, like ninjas…
And historical figures.
The inside of the castle has been converted into a museum, where you will find exhibits like the above, which details how the giant slabs of rock were hauled to the site by labourers.
We climbed to the top which has a small observation deck with 360 degree views of the city! Surrounding the castle are the imperial gardens, a huge green lung in the midst of all the developments.
GETTING THERE
From Nagoya Station, hop on the Higashiyama Subway Line to Sakae Station. Then, change to the Meijo Subway Line to Shiyakusho Station. The total journey time takes 10 minutes. From the exit, it is a three minute walk to the castle.
By bus, the castle’s main gate is accessible by the Meguru tourist loop bus (25 minutes).

You can create your own family tree in PowerPoint by using one of Microsoft’s many hierarchy style SmartArt graphics. Here’s how.
To get started, open PowerPoint and navigate to the “Insert” tab.
In the “Illustrations” group, click “SmartArt.”
The “Choose a SmartArt Graphic” window will appear. In the left-hand pane, click the “Hierarchy” tab.
You’ll now see a small collection of hierarchy SmartArt graphics. For standard family trees, the “Organizational Chart” option is ideal. However, you can choose whichever SmartArt graphic works best for you.
Select the chart you would like to use by clicking it.
Once selected, a preview and a description of the chart will appear in the right-hand pane. Click “OK” to insert the chart.
With the chart added to your presentation, you can start entering the names of the family members in each respective box. Do this by clicking the box and typing their name. The text will resize itself to fit the boxes automatically.
You can delete boxes you don’t need by clicking the box to select it and then pressing the “Delete” key on your keyboard.
You can also add additional boxes below or above certain positions. To do this, highlight the box by clicking it.
Next, click the “Design” tab in the “SmartArt Tools” group.
In the “Create Graphic” group, click the arrow next to the “Add Shape” option.
A drop-down menu will appear. The option you select from the menu will depend on where you want to place the box with respect to the currently selected box. Here’s what each option does:
- Add Shape After: Adds a box to the right, and on the same level, of the selected box.
- Add Shape Before: Adds a box to the left, and on the same level, of the selected box.
- Add Shape Above: Adds a box above the selected box.
- Add Shape Below: Adds a box below the selected box.
- Add Assistant: Adds a box between the level of the selected box and the level below.
In this example, assuming our fictional character Bryon had a child, we’d use the “Add Shape Below” option.
A box will now appear below our selected box.
Once the box is placed, enter the name of the respective family member. Repeat these steps until your family tree is complete.
You can also tweak the design or change the color of the chart. Click the chart to select it and then click the “Design” tab. In the “SmartArt Styles” group, you’ll see a range of different styles to choose from, as well as the option to change colors.
Click the “Change Colors” option to show a drop-down menu, then select the color scheme you like best.
Next, choose a style you like from the lineup in the “SmartArt Styles” group. We’ll use the “Inset” option.
Your chart will take on the selected color and style.
Play around with the styles and colors until you find one the works best for you.
Creating a family tree is an exciting thing, but it’s always a collaborative effort. You can ask family members to collaborate on the presentation with you to ensure that no family members are left out. And remember to share the presentation with your family once the family tree is complete!.Everybody knows that Robert De Niro is a great Oscar-winning actor and he doesn’t like DT, BUT did you know that his great-grandparents emigrated to the United States from the town of Ferrazzano in the region of Molise? Yes, Molise, same region that my grandfather was from, and where I visited twice this past May.
As you approach Mirrabello in Molise, you can’t help but notice an imposing village in the distance high up on a mountain. That would be Ferrazzano.
So when Joel and I went to Molise, we also went to see this pretty town. We didn’t realize it would be so windy up there, boy did it howl! Tina Di Giglio, a friend we made in Molise last year, led us up there. We were to follow her, lol, who knew it was going to be a motocross race! Tina, like every other Italian driver races to wherever they are going at breakneck speed. We stopped in some parking area with a great view, but not before she led us through a street (I use that term loosely because it was an alley), so narrow,I pulled the side mirror in!
The almost 360 degree panorama was breathtaking. My photos don’t do justice. Joel walked down to another level, but the cobble stones and the stairs were too much for me and my boot.
From our perch, we could look out and see Campobasso which I believe is like the county seat of that province of Molise.
i saw this gate and doorway, thought it was interesting, so…
If you ever thought recycling in the United States was a pain, you just haven’t experienced Guardia Sanframondi’s system. It is so complex and confusing that every month you can pick up a calendar at the Municipal and every night you take the garbage out and hang it on a hook that is attached somewhere on your building or a wall in your driveway.
And the garbage bags have faces 🤓😳🤢!!
Jumping back to Florence for a moment, while on the hunt for the perfect birthday gift for myself on the Ponte Vecchio (naturally), we came across a very Italian street entertainment; A Punch and Judy puppet show!
It was such a treat to see the little kids sitting down and watching in awe as the hustle and bustle of the Ponte Vecchio area surrounded them.
As much as I loved being in Guardia and Italy in general, there were two disturbing national and cultural issues; Way too many people in Italy smoke! Really, I was shocked by the prevalence of smokers everywhere.
AND the diesel automobiles 🚗 🚙 hold your nose! Sometimes in traffic we would be caught in the midst of a bunch of diesel powered vehicles.
,VINO and OIL, well that’s what the sign said… I’ve already told you about this place The Forresta Cooperative where both the olive oil and the wine are local and in great supply! Remember I said the wine was in huge silver tanks, there for your own pumping so to speak. Seeing is believing…
And the olive oils

Ciao for now!

Peso weakens on faster inflation
THE PESO weakened against the greenback on Tuesday as inflation picked up in December.
The local unit closed at P48.065 a dollar yesterday, depreciating by 4.5 centavos from its P48.02 finish on Monday, data from the Bankers Association of the Philippines showed.
The peso opened Tuesday’s session weaker at P48.04 per dollar. Its worst showing was at P48.07 while its intraday best was seen at P48.025 against the greenback.
Dollars traded dropped to $586 million on Tuesday from the $873.75 million seen on Monday.
The faster December inflation print caused the peso to weaken, a trader said in an email.
Headline inflation rose 3.5% in December, quicker than the 3.3% in November and the 2.5% print a year earlier, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Tuesday.
Data showing a continued decline in the country’s manufacturing output also contributed to the peso’s weakness on Tuesday, said Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort.
Factory output gauged through the volume of production index shrank by 10.9% in November, a steeper decline than the -9.3% in October as well as the 7.6% slump a year ago, PSA data released separately on Tuesday showed. This is also the worst drop in four months or since the 13.6% contraction logged in July.
For today, the trader expects the peso to move within the P48 to P48.10 band while Mr. Ricafort gave a slimmer forecast range of P48.03 to P48.09 per dollar. — LWTNLEDStrain Forum

Are projectors a good alternative as extended monitor to avoid sleep deprivation?
If so, can you recommend brands and models that do not generate too much heat to project on 32 inches with 2K resolution for writing and typing on a computer? I can put up with noise if that is the issue by using noise protection ear muffs.

The Ecosystem Services Market Research Consortium (ESMRC) Working Groups are focused on the research, development, demonstration and deployment of cost-effective, scalable technologies and approaches to launch an ecosystem services market. The Asset Quantification component of this work is led by Working Groups 1 and 2 who have been tasked with developing accurate, cost-effective and scalable quantification of agricultural management system impacts on soil C, net GHG (carbon, methane and nitrous oxide), water quality and water quantity. Working Group 1 (Carbon and GHG Assets) and Working Group 2 (Water Assets) have released the following RFPs.
Current RFPs
Request for Proposals: Soil Sampling and Analysis Contract
PROJECT SUMMARY: ESMC/ESMRC is seeking proposals from organizations that provide soil sampling services or soil analytical services or both to be carried out as a sub-contract on behalf of ESMC as ESMC moves into 2022 full market program launch.
As background, ESMC has launched projects within specific regions and production systems where program buildout has been completed. ESMC’s map continues to expand as ESMC adds more regions and production systems. As part of the credit quantification process, soil from a producer’s field must be analyzed for soil organic carbon, bulk density, pH, and, in some cases, phosphorus. ESMC/ESMRC has developed a Soil Sampling Protocol to establish and standardize the process of collecting and analyzing soil samples for use in quantifying outcomes from producer management practice changes at the field-scale. ESMC will host a virtual Q & A session for potential applicants on November 30, 2021 @ 11.00 am EST. To register, contact Neville Millar at nmillar@ecosystemservicesmarket.org. All proposals are due on or by December 21, 2021. View the full RFP here.
Past RFPs
Request for Proposals: Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) Platform Development
PROJECT SUMMARY: ESMC/ESMRC is seeking proposals to build out our market ready MRV platform, MRV (v3), to continue with 2021 and 2022 pilot enrollment and processing and to prepare for the late 2022 Market Program Launch. ESMC envisions this work merging into existing work as possible, and the MRV v3 build as a collaborative transition using the work to date as a basis for the platform design and requirements. We seek proposals for this collaborative effort and have developed key Program milestones as a guide for platform development phases and timelines, including a timeline to shift current producer accounts into to the new platform. View the full RFP here.
Request for Proposals: Policy Paper on Ecosystem Service Asset Generation through Livestock Grazing on Public Lands
PROJECT SUMMARY: ESMC seeks development of a white paper on policies relevant to private, voluntary ecosystem services markets, to include carbon/GHG, water quality, and water quantity credits. The white paper should assess the policy landscape to further inform the refinement of ESMC’s protocols, business plan, pilot projects – including projects launched, soon to launch, and in planning stages, across the continental US – and ultimately the full market. For this assessment, grazing on public lands encompasses the management of livestock on range, pasture, and silvopasture owned by state or federal government under a valid permit or lease with the appropriate agency. Since soil health is one important component of ecosystem services from agricultural working lands, we include the USDA NRCS definition of soil health as “the continued capacity of soil to function as a vital living ecosystem that sustains plants, animals, and humans.” The geographic scope of the assessment is limited to the agricultural working lands of the lower 48 states. View the full RFP here.
Working Group 1, Project 3 – N2O Quantification Through Surrogate Measurements
PROJECT SUMMARY: The purpose of this RFP is to find surrogate measurements for N2O to generate credits based on these measurements. The group would also like to quantify the tradeoffs and correlations between ecosystem services – e.g. correlations among GHG fluxes and correlations between GHG fluxes and water quality/quantity measurements. Much as a single GHG flux may be estimated from another measurement, there is a strong potential that improvements in one ecosystem service will tend to improve another. Whether this is generalizable or whether there are risks that market-driven solutions for GHG or water will not have unintended consequences is not fully understood. View full RFP here.
Working Group 1, Project 4 – Pilot Project Soil Sampling Protocol Evaluation
PROJECT SUMMARY: The purpose of this RFP is to design and implement comparative research studies in the context of ESMC pilot projects – pre-soil sampling stratification across selected ESMC pilot projects, evaluate soil sampling SOPs, associated uncertainties, and sampling costs; compare options for an ESMC Scope 3 Soil Sampling SOP against the full Scope 1 soil sampling SOP for model calibration/validation and uncertainty in asset generation; test sampling intensity for optimal and accurate determination of baseline SOC stocks for prediction of Scope 3 SOC accretion using DNDC. The results of this are to determine a soil sampling SOP that will satisfy asset certification requirements equal to or better than current accepted protocols. View full RFP here.
The proposal submission period is now closed.
Working Group 1 Project 2: Soil Stratification App
PROJECT SUMMARY: This RFP seeks to engage one or multiple partners to build a web and/or mobile platform that generates a set of points for soil sampling based on publicly available input data that produces high accuracy estimates of soil carbon stock changes due to management at a reasonable cost. View full RFP here.
Proposals must be submitted as a PDF document by email to Caroline Wade, ESMRC Program Director, at cwade@ecosystemservicesmarket.org by July 3rd, 8pm ET. Final decisions will be made by July 17th and all vendors will be notified by July 20th. If you have questions regarding this RFP, please contact Stephen Wood at stephen.wood@tnc.org.
Working Group 1 Project 1: Advanced Quantification Technology Assessment
PROJECT SUMMARY: This RFP seeks to engage one or multiple partners to identify, assess, test, and map the development of advanced tools and technologies that can more efficiently and cost effectively measure and quantify soil C changes and net GHG reductions to help ESMC generate carbon and GHG assets. The work will include in-field testing of promising innovative tools and technologies on ESMC pilot project sites. View full RFP here.
UPDATE: Awards for this RFP have made. A team led by Repliculture, LLC with support from Regen Network Development, Inc. was awarded a contract for Phase 1 work. They will work collaboratively with the Phase 3 awardee, a team led by the Conservation Technology Information Center (CTIC) with support from Alliance of Crop, Soil, and Environmental Science Societies (ACSESS). Phase 2 work has been postponed and the RFP may be reissued later this summer, so stay tuned!
Working Group 2 Project 1: Evaluation, improvement and scaling of water quality quantification approaches for water asset generation in ESMC’s Integrated Protocol
PROJECT SUMMARY: This RFP seeks to engage one or multiple partners to design and implement testing and evaluation of the APEX water quality model and WQIAg tool approaches as part of ESMC’s Integrated Protocol for water quality credit generation on pilot project sites. The work will cover ESMC’s 2020 pilot regions to demonstrate viable water asset generation, discover needed modeling improvements or adaptations, recommend Protocol refinements, while identifying opportunities to support model calibration, validation, expansion and automation. View full RFP here.
UPDATE: Awards for this RFP have made. A team led by Tetra Tech with support from Texas A&M Agrilife and Stone Environmental was awarded a contract for Modules 1 and 2. Module 3 work has been postponed and the RFP may be reissued at a later time, so stay tuned!Dubai Cultiv8 Invests in the last mile delivery startup FODEL
Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Dubai Cultiv8 Investments Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Mohammed Bin Rashid Fund for SMEs, has allocated part of its US$100 million technology fund for an investment in FODEL, the last mile delivery tech startup in the UAE to provide a better alternative to home delivery for online shoppers.
FODEL gives online shoppers the option to collect their parcels any time they want, from any of its 1,000 pick up and drop off (PUDO) locations which are part of its UAE-wide parcel collection network. They include gas stations, groceries, pharmacies and stores from other retail categories that are open until midnight or 24/7 for maximum convenience.
Arif Al Alawi, CEO of Dubai Cultiv8, said: “Middle East-based delivery and transport startups rank third by number of investment deals they attracted during 2019, which is a clear indication of the sector’s strong growth potential. In fact, they accounted for 19% of total funding directed into startups last year and through our partnership with FODEL, we contribute to the continuous development of the logistics and ecommerce sectors in the UAE.”
Thanks to FODEL’s solution, e-commerce and logistics companies can massively expand their delivery capacity providing significant operational advantages especially during peak seasons.
The company is launching in Saudi Arabia where it has also developed a network of 1,000 PUDO points strategically spread across all main high-density regions but also in remote areas.
Soumia Benturquia, Founder & CEO of FODEL, said: “Cultiv8 is a strategic partner of great importance for FODEL as we continue to invest in our expansion and strengthening our PUDO network in the GCC.”
FODEL’s last mile delivery solution is unique in the GCC region but a well tried and tested business model with many successes around the world, including Kiala in the UK with over 7,000 locations, or Cainiao in China with over 40,000 locations./cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/46446430/usa-today-8302189.0.jpg)

Welcome back to the OFD recruiting Big Board for Fighting Irish football.
Another quarterback came off the board recently as (MD) Dwayne Haskins .964 stayed home and committed to the Maryland Terrapins. The Maryland SB Nation blog would like to let you know that Haskins is not the highest rated quarterback to verbal to their school, by mere minuscule percentage points thank you very much.
Is Dwayne Haskins the best Maryland QB recruit of the modern era? Just *barely* not: pic.twitter.com/zGRCxEqafm— Testudo Times (@testudotimes) May 31, 2015
Haskins was the top target on Notre Dame's uncommitted board but never really felt like there was a ton of traction there after the Irish chased Malik Henry, Jacob Eason, Shea Patterson, and others in the early stages of this cycle.
Notre Dame never offered but (TN) Tylin Oden .876 committed to Louisville earlier last week. Several recruitniks have said in the past that he would have committed to the Irish if offered. We'll see if things change in the coming months.
Woody Barrett has a countdown clock as he'll be announcing his school tomorrow. Auburn is believed to have a very big lead and is expected to gain his commitment at 1:30 PM ET on Wednesday.
So where does Notre Dame turn now?
Well, QB coach Mike Sanford was recently down to see (TX) Sam Glaesmann .810 out of Midway H.S. in Waco. As of a couple weeks ago Glaesmann was planning on visiting and camping at Notre Dame this summer. However, late last week he did commit to Rice so we'll see if that changes his plans.
Notre Dame is not giving up on Arizona commit (CA) Khalil Tate .871 even though he's been a verbal to the Wildcats for nearly 3 months. There were Irish coaches on hand to watch him practice last week. It's kind of hard to believe a player from Junipero Serra would flip to Notre Dame stranger things have happened.
ND is coming after Arizona QB commit Kahlil Tate, who talks Irish interest with @GregBiggins pic.twitter.com/FsbhaMynZC— Irish Illustrated (@PeteSampson_) May 22, 2015
Lastly, Notre Dame was back to visit with 2017 prospect (IN) Hunter Johnson .996 to close out the spring evaluation period. Johnson was at the Columbus workout for The Opening over the weekend and really impressed everyone that was in attendance.
The big news for Notre Dame was the scholarship offer handed out to Damian Alloway out of Summit H.S. in Fontana, California in San Bernardino County. There was some talk before this but now Alloway has made it known that he really, really likes Notre Dame.
#NotreDame Alloway lands big offer - Four-star wide receiver Damian Alloway had been hoping Notre Dame woul...— Notre Dame on Scout (@NDonScout) May 28, 2015
Alloway immediately put Notre Dame in his top group with UCLA, California, and Wisconsin and has said he will not commit anywhere until he visits South Bend. Irish coaches are trying to set up a visit this summer and for an official visit to the USC game. He's being recruited as a multi-dimensional slot receiver. If you're not adverse to watching a lot of touchdowns you should check out Alloway's highlights.
Notre Dame also recently offered Devwah Whaley out of Central Senior H.S. a little over an hour to the northeast of Houston, Texas. He recently named a Top 10 right before the Irish offer and it did not include Notre Dame.
Things are slipping for Elijah Holyfield. He was recently down at Alabama visiting and camping for the Crimson Tide coaching staff.
Notre Dame could be gaining something with Deon McIntosh who was visited by Autry Denson during the spring evaluation period. McIntosh said the Irish will make his top 10 when he comes out with one this summer.
Keep an eye on (NC) Rico Dowdle N/R out of A C Reynolds, former high school of Ben Councell. He ran for Denson recently and is setting up a summer visit to Notre Dame.
2016 NC RB Rico Dowdle shows off speed for #NotreDame and sets summer visit. (Premium) pic.twitter.com/9YBMJ5fH29— Irish Sports Daily (@ISDUpdate) May 21, 2015
Another back the Irish were checking on during the spring evaluation period was (FL) Travis Homer .881 and he just committed to Miami on Sunday.
(IN) Chris Evans .894 out of Ben Davis H.S. in Indianapolis still has not been offered by Notre Dame. He visited Michigan this past weekend, was offered, and is now announcing a decision this upcoming weekend. He's expected to pick the Wolverines.Which adjustable desk is best?
Standing desks may be all the rage these days, but most people will find an adjustable desk to be a better option. This is because they allow you to alternate between sitting and standing throughout the day, which can benefit both your health and your productivity.
You should consider the size, style, materials and storage of any desk before purchasing, but adjustable desks have another feature you should keep in mind — how they are adjusted. Some models, like the Vari Electric Standing Desk, are equipped with a motor that does the raising and lowering for you at the touch of a button. Others require you to manually lift and lower the desk yourself.
What to know before you buy an adjustable desk
Use
Adjustable desks help you avoid staying in a seated position all day long, and potentially the many negative health consequences that come along with it. Studies from the National Library of Medicine link sitting for excessive amounts of time every day with obesity, back pain, postural issues, high blood pressure, poor mood and more. Therefore, an adjustable desk that allows you to alternate your position throughout the work day can allow you to not compromise your health for your productivity.
Standing vs. adjustable
While a standing desk is a good option for your office space, if it is the only desk you own, then it will completely eliminate the option to sit down at all. The National Library of Medicine reports that standing all day, especially in a stationary position, can lead to negative health consequences as well, such as inflammation in the veins in the lower legs or knees, back pain and potential mobility issues later in life. An adjustable desk, on the other hand, will allow you to alternate between sitting and standing throughout the day, making it a great option.
Adjustability
Since you will likely be adjusting the height of your desk multiple times per day, you should consider how easy it is to adjust the desk model before purchasing it. Overall, motorized desks are the easiest models to adjust. You simply flip a switch or press a button to raise or lower the desk automatically. If these are out of your price range, or you simply don’t want to have to worry about the function of any electronic components, the next best options are adjustable desks that feature a well-placed hand crank or pneumatic lift. The last and least convenient (but often the most affordable) option is a model that requires you to remove and replace bolts to adjust the height.
Features to look for in a quality adjustable desk
Size
Just like traditional desks, adjustable desks come in a wide variety of sizes. There are small models that only offer enough space to accommodate a laptop and a mouse pad, and even large L-shaped options with plenty of space for multiple monitors, a printer and any other office supply or peripheral device you may need. Consider how much working space you will need to ensure that you purchase a desk that will be suitable for you.
Storage
Just because most adjustable desks don’t have drawers doesn’t mean they are completely without storage. Some storage options to consider are small hooks or pegs to hang headphones or a backpack, a secondary shelf to raise a monitor up a bit higher and small compartments.
Casters
If you want the ability to easily move your desk around, choose a model that features caster wheels on the bottom. These should have brakes that can lock into place, so you don’t have to worry about the desk sliding around while you are working.
Ports
Often, necessary outlets can be hard to access in an office when they are located on the wall underneath the desk. Models with USB ports or traditional outlets integrated into the desk make plugging in (and unplugging) various devices much more convenient.
Cable pass-throughs
If you do not want unsightly cables haphazardly hanging off the end of your desk, consider purchasing a desk with cable pass-throughs. These allow you to pass a cord through a hole in the desk for easy access to the wall outlets below.
Style
If design is important to you, then you should prioritize the style of your office furniture just as much as the furniture throughout other areas of your home. From rustic to modern, adjustable desks come in a variety of designs, materials and color schemes.
How much can you expect to spend on an adjustable desk
Most adjustable desks cost between $100-$700.
Adjustable desk FAQ
Standing while working is causing pain in my heel. Is there anything I can do to mitigate this?
A. The two most common reasons why people experience heel pain while using a standing desk are wearing improper footwear or standing on a very hard surface. To mitigate this, consider changing your footwear to something more comfortable or purchasing an anti-fatigue mat to stand on when at your desk.
How do I know how high to raise my adjustable desk?
A. Ideally, a standing desk should be set at a height that allows you to stand up straight without slouching while working. Most will find this to be right about at the height of their elbows. You may find your most comfortable position is an inch or two below or above this, though, so adjust the height as needed.

Ron DeSantis and the Seminole Tribe of Florida a sizable defeat by overturning the state’s gambling compact. The ruling late Monday by Judge Dabney L. Friedrich struck down the state’s $2.5 billion deal with the tribe and brought an end to online sports betting in Florida.
Judge Friedrich ruled the gambling compact violated federal Indian gaming law and invalidated the entire agreement.READ MORE: Travel Restricted From Southern Africa, Dow Drops 905 Points Over New COVID Variant Concerns
The tribe’s online sports betting quietly launched on Nov. 1, under a so-called hub and spoke design, which means the Tribe could take bets from any phone or laptop anywhere under the theory it was legal because the servers are located on tribal lands.
However, the judge decided it violated terms of the Indian Gambling Regulatory Act, which requires all state-sanctioned gambling to take place on tribal land.
Asked about the decision Tuesday morning during an appearance in Broward County, Governor Ron DeSantis said he thought the decision would be appealed.
“We also knew when you do hub and spoke, it was unsettled legal issue. We structured the compact, so the compact was preserved for the casinos and other stuff. So, we’re going to be getting revenue. Obviously, we’ll be getting less revenue from sports betting if we are not able to do hub and spoke. But I would imagine that’s going to be appealed.”
But an appeal is problematic. The tribe was not a party to the suit, nor is the state. Only the Department of Interior can appeal. And because he wasn’t briefed beforehand, the state may not get any revenue since the compact signed in 2010 is now in effect.
The Governor’s office says his legal team is trying to figure out its options.READ MORE: Man Shot While Driving On I-75; FHP: At Least One Vehicle Shot At On S. Fla. Highways Every Week
Meantime, the ruling is a big win for Magic City Casino in Miami and Bonita Springs Poker Room in Southwest Florida, whose owners challenged the deal after it was approved by the state legislature earlier this year.
A statement from Magic City Casino reads, “Last night’s ruling was a victory for family-owned businesses like ours who pay their fair share in taxes and believe the free market should guide the business operations of gaming venues. We would like to thank our legal team at Boies Schiller for their outstanding efforts. The judge clearly understood the blatant violation of IGRA as her ruling demonstrates. We look forward to working with the Governor, Legislature, and the citizens of Florida to pave a path forward that ensures a fair gaming marketplace exists in Florida.”
The judge’s decision also blocks the tribe’s Hard Rock casinos in Broward and Hillsborough counties from becoming full Las Vegas-style casinos because the struck deal down also allowed the tribe to add roulette and craps to its casino operations.
Friedrich’s ruling injects uncertainty into the Seminoles’ future sports-betting activities.
However, the tribe’s Hard Rock app was still accepting wagers Tuesday morning, and a spokesman did not say whether the Seminoles plan to shut it down.
“The Seminole Tribe is reviewing the judge’s opinion and carefully considering its next steps,” Gary Bitner, a spokesman for the tribe, said in an email.
“Judge Friedrick got a few things right but a lot of things wrong,” said
Gaming Law expert Prof. Bob Jarvis from Nova Southeastern University. He says a federal judge got it wrong when she threw out the gaming compact between the Seminole Tribe of Florida and the state. “I think that either the dc circuit will correct her or the US SUpreme court will correct her or congress will correct her,” he said..Famous building

Art Nouveau
Gauswald Cottage, built on Kamenny Island in 1898, is considered the first Art Nouveau building in St. Petersburg and even in Russia. This is one of the rarest examples of Art Nouveau in wooden architecture. The dacha was named after the names of its first owners - it was built for the wife of the bakery master Eugenia Karlovna Gauswald.
The architecture of the house embodied many of the characteristic features of the style: underlined asymmetry, broken lines of the portal and the roof. The prototype was the architecture of English cottages. It is no accident that in the beginning of the 1980s the film “The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson” was shot here (the house of Irene Adler).
The two-story wooden central part of the building is adjoined by a one-story part with a circular portal. The round tower with semicircular windows is located in the north. On the south side there are two terraces decorated with four stone pillars.
In 1918, the 3rd children's colony named after A.V. Lunacharsky, existed here until 1923. Then the building was occupied for many years by the sanatorium of the Leningrad Metal Plant.
At the beginning of the XXI century, the cottage came into disrepair, in 2017-2019 it was restored, restoring most of the original wooden structures.kg/cm3 to t/m3

Write a ReviewWildfire season is officially over for Santa Rosa, the city fire department announced this week.
After receiving 11 inches of rain in October, the Santa Rosa Fire Department said the chances of severe wildfires in the city are slim. The wildfire season, which started unusually early on May 17, began as a result of severe drought conditions and dry brush.
During wildfire season, owners of homes in the Wildland Urban Interface, vacant lots or property with more than a half-acre of undeveloped land were required to keep weeds and grasses shorter than four inches. Effective Nov. 2, the fire department ended weed abatement inspections for property owners.
Fire officials will also allow pile burning in late November, depending on local conditions. Property owners are encouraged to burn debris in piles to cut back on wildfire fuel, so long as weather conditions are appropriate and they have filed a permit with the city fire department.
Fire officials also urge Santa Rosa residents to keep up with wildfire preparedness measures during the off-season, especially for those in Santa Rosa’s Wildland Urban Interface area.
Santa Rosa Fire Chief Scott Westrope said city fire officials responded to multiple vegetation fires this year that went up to 50 acres in size, driven by dry fuels and drought conditions.
“We planned and prepared for a busy season and thank our community for maintaining defensible space and keeping seasonal grasses cut and in compliance with our Weed Abatement Ordinance,” Westrope said in a statement. “Those measures prevented significant property damage during several of our fires this past season.”
The department offers more information on wildfire preparedness on its website.Yondemasu yo, azazel-san z Hentai

The contrast between an MBA and an MPA is usually framed as that between profit-driven, private sector employment (MBA) and mission-driven, public sector employment (MPA). However, this doesn’t tell the whole story. Many MBA holders work in the government, in nonprofits or in non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and, likewise, many MPA holders find themselves in key positions at major corporations.4
The difference between the two degrees is more fundamental than which job markets will find your skillset attractive after graduation. Instead, it comes down to how you’ll approach your career as a manager and leader. The degree you choose will influence the success benchmarks you’ll find most important, the ways you’ll approach funding your business and your personal attitudes toward the significance of social service in your chosen career.5
Profitability versus social good
For a private corporation, it’s pretty simple to measure success: Look at the profits. From the smallest mom-and-pop retail shop to a multinational conglomerate, the success or failure of a business is dependent on its profitability. By contrast, for organizations such as nonprofits or government entities, success can be far more difficult to measure. Because these organizations aren’t expected to generate profits, success is best measured as “doing the most good for the greatest number of people.”
If an MBA prepares you to work within markets, an MPA prepares you to work in the gaps between the markets, where individual and social problems remain unaddressed. Practically, this requires a different set of skills. While an MBA will emphasize ways in which leaders can maximize profits, an MPA prioritizes skills like working with disparate groups to reach compromises and make decisions in uncertain environments.6
Relying on publicly available funds
Another key component of organizational leadership is securing and managing funding for your enterprise. In the private sector, funding is just one among many terms that can affect the bottom line. But as an MPA holder, your allocation of funds must always be conducted with a focus on the public and the public good. This difference may seem insignificant at first, but upon further inspection, the management of public funds requires a noticeably different approach. In an MPA program, you will develop the skills necessary for fundraising, soliciting donations and applying for grants.
Working hard for the common good
At the end of the day, the choice between an MBA and an MPA must take into account your personal approach to your career path. Each of us is motivated by a variety of different factors, and the degree you pursue and your subsequent career choice should reflect not only your goals, but also your interests, passions and values.
If both an MBA and an MPA can provide a comfortable standard of living and will help you develop important skills for management, it comes down to a personal choice: Would you rather spend your time working for the improvement of your company or for the betterment of society?
A bright future for the "fourth sector"
Regardless of which degree you choose, recent trends suggest an overall movement toward a business environment that places a greater emphasis on the public good, no matter where you work. Indeed, some have taken to describing the emerging crossover between private-sector, governmental and nonprofit missions as “the fourth sector,” a new hybrid market to which an MPA is perfectly suited.7 Not only that, but general trends indicate that millennials, soon to be the most represented generation in the workforce, place community service ahead of a high salary when they rank what motivates them at work.8
With an MPA, you’ll be prepared to meet the challenges of the future head on, with an adaptability that your employer will appreciate. If you have a head for business and a heart for community service, you may be destined to follow an unconventional path toward an online MPA.

Premium rates, experience modifiers, claim reserves…this is not workers’ compensation. This is just a way to finance it.
Workers’ compensation was designed to ensure that injured employees have access to medical care and salary indemnification for work-related injuries. This system was established at a time when some employers maintained hazardous workplaces and abdicated their responsibilities to the injured worker.
Times have changed and our workplaces are much safer. But, many employers still neglect their duty to the injured worker when they do no more than purchase a workers’ compensation policy. Statute requires a system, not a policy.
So what goes into a workers’ compensation system?
1) A commitment by employers/managers to keep employees safe, health and engaged:
Employers must be committed to employee health and not outsource this responsibility to the medico-legal system. If a management team cannot make this commitment, efforts to reduce healthcare or insurance costs will be futile.
2) A system for engaging, reassuring and repairing an injured employee:
Employees need reassurance when coping with an injury and/or confronting the workers’ compensation system. Professionally managed Health and Wellness Rooms are part of successful workers’ compensation systems. Engaging employees early in the process means better outcomes for the employee and the employer. Actively managing the injury, recovery, and employee concerns will reduce costs and increase productivity.
3) A system for finance (insurance policy, self-insured, captive, etc.):
Finally, if an employer has made the commitment and developed a system to support the injured employee, financing becomes simple. Costs will trend lower, as will the experience modifier. Insurance costs will drop by focusing on the on the cost drivers, not the finer points of an insurance proposal.
Insurance companies offer a valuable service in financing the costs of workplace injuries, and they, as well as with third-party administrators, also offer value in combating fraud. However, the real value is to be found in caring for the injured workers, minimizing time away from work and preserving trust.
If you need help developing your workers’ compensation system, contact Proof:Positive. Your insurance policy will thank you.Description

After the war, he returned home to his family to continue to farm with his wife and seven children. Their neighbors called the area where they farmed Kohl-a-daal. If you drive up there today, you will find Kohl Road named in honor of Mr. Kohl.
Heinrich died March 2, 1827, and Christina died Sept. 24, 1832. Both are buried in the Zion Stone Church cemetery outside of Kreidersville.
In later years, the Kohl family name slowly changed to Cole. Many Coles were members of the historic house of worship.
The church started in the small village of Howersville, relocating to its present site in 1771. The Kirche membership served German and Lutheran denominations. Most worshippers were local farmers and their families.
The cemetery is the final resting place for many Revolutionary War veterans. Each Memorial Day, a program is held at the church and cemetery to honor all veterans.
Kohl’s children followed their father and became farmers. Their fifth child, Adam Sr., was a farmer. His son, Adam Jr., would purchase a farm in Allen Township in 1900 that remains in the family today. The farm is on Stagecoach Road just north of Kreidersville.
A very interesting road, a regular schedule of stage coaches passed and stopped at the farm on their daily run. The coach with four sturdy horses started the trip in Easton, following King’s Highway, a rough dirt, gravel road with many ruts.
The coach would stop at the farm. Adam’s son Alfred, as a youngster, recalled how the coach would stop so the horses could get a drink of water at the farm. The company paid $1 a month for the water.
The riders would get out and relax, say a few words to the family and continue their journey. The Cole children looked forward to the coach’s arrival.
For our readers, Stagecoach Road met Cherryville Road near the seminary. An old tree line still stands along the old road. Stagecoach Road is now closed, a dead end. The stage coach passed into history more than 100 years ago, another memory of our past.
Ella, Alfred Cole’s daughter, would marry Tilghman Vogel of Danielsville in Elkton, Md., in 1919, right after World War I. Tilghman served in the U.S. Navy in World War I on a minesweeper and submarine.
He would purchase the farm from his father-in-law and work on the farm and also at the Phoenix Forge in Catasauqua. Phoenix continues to operate today.
Its present owner was Bryden Horse Shoe Works. The Front Street company was one of the largest horseshoe plants in the world, producing between 40 and 50 tons daily. They supplied horseshoes to the British cavalry during the Boer War in South Africa.
Mr. Vogel was employed there when they manufactured many commercial forgings and flanges. Twenty-one hammers operated around the clock during World War II.Education Jobs

The Road To Du Hsiao Yueh
Du Hsiao Yueh, founded in 1895 by Hung Yu Tou, the Hung clan’s ancestor, refers to the enduring journey through the low seasons experienced by locals.
Every year, from the Qingming Commemoration to the Mid-Autumn Festival, rough seas made fishing extremely dangerous, a perilous journey for any who dared to venture out. These “low seasons" were known to fishermen as the “small months".
To raise the family, Hung came up with a new style of noodles and began to sell them in order to continue on “throughout” the “low seasons”.
He peddled his noodles on the street, his shoulder pole balancing his wares as he distributed the weight on his yoke and moved around. Placing a lantern in front of the stall, Hung wrote three Chinese characters on it to announce his brand’s arrival – “Du Hsiao Yueh".
Today, Du Hsiao Yueh Da-a Mi has been successfully passed down to the fourth generation. For over 100 years, with its distinct taste, the well-established brand has been enjoyed far and wide by many. The tradition continues. The taste endures.

National Environmental Policy (NEPA) Compliance
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was established, in part, …” [42 USC § 4321].
How Does NEPA Affect Your Project?
Laws and Regulations
The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) mandates all federal agencies to review the effects of their actions, and alternatives to those actions, on the quality of the human environment. Federal actions include such things as the issuing of permits, promulgating new regulations, and financing of projects.
To perform an environmental review of a proposed action, the proposed project is superimposed upon both the existing (i.e., baseline) biophysical and socioeconomic parameters to assess the resulting beneficial and adverse impacts on the quality of the human environment. These environmental parameters are commonly referred to as “NEPA topics” and are addressed in varying degrees at the discretion of the federal agency, given its perception of the severity of negative impacts associated with the proposed action upon various site- and regional-specific parameters of the human environment. The environmental review often includes input from other coordinating agencies (as well as the general public) and can take several forms that may be progressive and/or approached in an iterative manner by the agency. For example, the federal agency’s environmental review could begin and end with the submittal of a permit application, progress to the agency’s (or permit applicant’s) preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA) or, depending on the outcome of the initial EA, could progress to the agency’s (or the permit applicant consultant) preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to address all agency and public concerns related to the proposed federal action.
What Is Involved In A NEPA Environmental Review?
The scope of work to satisfy a specific permitting and/or action agency at either the state or federal level begins with reviewing the proposed project with the agency to identify what environmental issues they perceive need to be specifically addressed in either an informal or formal manner. An informal environmental review may be limited to specific data requested by the agency to review and include in their permitting process. More formal environmental reviews for larger, more complex projects can range from an Environmental Assessment (EA) to provide a basis for a potential Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), to the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The timeframe for completing environmental reviews can range from a few weeks to a few years, depending on the complexity of the project, the agency’s perception of significant negative impacts, and potential public and private interest group involvement.
Horizon has assisted both public and private clients with NEPA compliance on projects ranging from major pipeline construction, oil and gas exploration, electrical transmission, wind energy development, transportation, flood control, and land and water development projects. We have successfully prepared scores of categorical exclusions, Environmental Assessments, and Environmental Impact Statements. If you are unsure whether your project is subject to review under NEPA, please contact one of Horizon’s NEPA Specialists for more information, and we will be happy to assist you in understanding what may or may not be required. Because of the potentially lengthy NEPA Process, anytime that NEPA is involved as one of the permitting parameters for your project, early planning is critical to your project’s success.

It appears to take place before Naru & Keitaro’s wedding, which was announced 5 years ago on creator Ken Akamatsu’s blog, unless Keitaro is still trying to graduate which wouldn’t surprise me. While soaking in the onsen, Kitsune asks Shinobu how far she’s gone with a boy on a scale of A – D, A being a kiss. D isn’t defined but I imagine it’s something along the lines of “this and that.” Naturally, Keitaro misunderstands. He thinks they’re talking about grades and tells Shinobu he just got C. Hilarity ensues.
The one-shot was released in the 40th issue of Weekly Shonen Magazine to celebrate the 300th chapter of Akamatsu’s other harem manga, Negima! Magister Negi Magi. No scanlation yet but here’s the untranslated manga:Measuring behind

P-EBT is a coronavirus-specific California government aid program where families can receive up to $365 per child in each eligible household to spend on strictly consumable items. A majority of families that were eligible automatically received it by the end of May. Families who have not received aid but still qualify can apply online by no later than July 15!
FFAC focuses on education and social justice issues and as such recognizes that its commitment to community is most needed in times such as these where families are going hungry in the midst of a pandemic.
These low-income families need all the resources and support they can get from their community, and FFAC is helping to streamline this in the Oakland community.
The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the closure of most public spaces in order to stop and reduce the transmission of the virus, including public schools. Public schools are often a safe haven for the children of low income or broken families who experience food insecurity and rely heavily on what is offered at school. With the onset of coronavirus restrictions, public schools closed, the meals stopped, and many families suddenly became qualified for free or reduced lunch due to the loss of their jobs. To supplement the meals lost, measures have been taken by numerous public schools in California to still provide free meals to families during this time where parents can pick up free food packages for their children at selective school sites. However, even with these “grab-n-go” meals being offered, low-income families still face the challenge of picking them up due to health and safety concerns, shelter-in-place restrictions, transportation issues, parents having to work during the pickup times, and other barriers faced by low income families. These low-income families need all the resources and support they can get from their community, and FFAC is helping to streamline this in the Oakland community.
Other community oriented organizations can follow this model of outreach and start connecting to the backbone of what keeps communities together: educators.
I have been actively committed to delivering this information and resources to these families, specifically Spanish-speaking households, to ensure that regardless of language barriers these families are aware of the resources available to them. Even though my Spanish was rusty, I contacted these families individually by phone and provided the information to them however they preferred based on their technological needs, establishing clear communication in the process. I answered any questions they had and I encouraged them to look into applying! This work is crucial because some families did not become aware of P-EBT until I had informed them. I also discussed with them the discount that Mandela Grocery Cooperative offers which is 50% off California grown fruits and vegetables from Mandela Grocery Cooperative if they purchase with their P-EBT card. For what they spend on groceries at Mandela Grocery Cooperative, they can get twice the value of their nutritious groceries!
Doing this work for the FFAC is an exemplary display of what organizations can accomplish when they are community focused: reaching out to families and maintaining communication helps to maintain healthy households. Other community oriented organizations can follow this model of outreach and start connecting to the backbone of what keeps communities together: educators.

However, a new documentary by the Dubai-based, Lebanese filmmaker Mahmoud Kaabour tries to shed a different light on labourers’ lives in the country.
Given the sensitivity of this topic in the UAE – which is repeatedly criticised by rights groups for its treatment of foreign workers – Kaabour, who’s also the managing director of UAE-based Veritas Films, had difficulties obtaining permission to film in some of the UAE labour camps.
“After two years of negotiations, I got the necessary permission to film in 12 labour camps in Dubai and Abu Dhabi,” says the 33-year-old filmmaker. Asked if he faced any restrictions while filming inside the camps, some of which lack basic services, Kaabour stressed that there was none. He further explains that he only shot in the camps that played host to the singing competitions – considered to be amongst the best labour camps in the country. “Of course, don’t expect five star camps; you still have eight people per room,” he adds.
With the competitions taking place during the hottest months of the year – June to October, when temperatures often reach above 48°C (120°F) – Kaabour and his team came very close to what life in the camp actually looks and feels like.
“As you would imagine, spending four months in the labour camps, you start to see life differently. Life has changed forever for me, it’s been a transformational experience,” he says.
For Kaabour, shooting long hours in high temperatures – some of his crew members passed out – “is a small price to pay to shatter some stereotypes of these labour camps.”
“For example, not everyone who lives in the camps is a construction worker. We filmed welders, carpenters, and AC repairmen,” explains Kaabour. “And those who live in the labour camps are not necessarily poor. While many would think that the only way they can help them is by donating money, I’d say that by giving them a chance to sing, to talk about music, you might actually make their day.”
As they sing their hearts out, Kaabour goes deeper into the lives of UAE labourers, who are described in his film trailer as “unsung heroes.” He soon realises that for many, the greatest toll on them is the “emotional toll, rather than the physical one.”
“Most of the songs they choose to sing are about families, love, weddings, in addition to ultra-cheesy Bollywood songs,” Kaabour says noting that the film offers an array of sub-continental languages and they allow contestants to express their feelings in their own language.
“I really think that a couple of guys are going to become stars. I promise you, they’re mad, and they have great stories,” he says passionately. For him, “Champ of the Camp” is a story told entirely by the labourers themselves, and that’s why he chose not to have a voice over. “We don’t put words in anyone’s mouth,” he stresses.
The Lebanese filmmaker is best known for his most celebrated documentary “Teta, Alf Marra” (Grandma, A Thousand Times). The film scooped six major audience awards and a best film award on the world festival circuit, as well as reaching the Oscars selection panel. His first documentary “Being Osama,” which explored the lives of six Canadian-Arabs, named Osama in the post 9/11 events, also won several international prizes.
Determined to take his film to the next level, Kaabour used two camera units and 5.1 surround sound audio systems – a rather expensive technique for independent documentary films – to capture the true image and sound of the camps. He also decided to go for the first class British editor and BAFTA-winner Alan Mackay to edit and shape up his film.
“With these techniques we’ll be able to take the viewer deep inside the camp through both the image and the sound. The only thing missing is probably the smell of the place, but really, we’ll get you that close,” he assures.
As for funding, Kaabour, who says he spent his entire life savings on making this film, notes that he has recently got two grants from Doha Film Institute and Screen Institute in Beirut. He also signed a co-production deal with Al Jazeera channel to show the film on TV a year after its theatrical releases.
While Kaabour hopes his film will be seen as a message of the triumph of the will, others might find it hard not to disagree, given labourers’ harsh realities in the UAE. Just last month, thousands of workers at UAE construction Arabtec (which built Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest tower) went on a four-day strike demanding a wage hike of about $50 per month – most of which earn $102-$325 per month. As strikes are banned in the UAE and trade unions don’t exist, the Emirate’s police chief responded by announcing that 200 of the striking workers would be repatriated.
“No one can claim that ‘Champ of the Camp’ is a pro or anti UAE film. It’s a truly objective piece, with a truly international theme,” insists Kaabour. “We showed reality as we came across it while filming for four months in the labour camps and it’s up for the audience to make their own conclusions.”
“’Champ of the Camp’ offers a much needed window into the lives of the UAE labourers who live so close to us,” he concludes. “They’re building what we live in, they’re the ones who make our life possible, and we at Veritas Films have always believed that such a tribute to them is way overdue.”
Mahmoud Kaabour’s “Champ of the Camp” will be released this fall, don’t miss it.

Photo caption: Artesia senior running back Vincent Brown picks up yardage before being knocked out of bounds by Bellflower’s Austin Jones in last Friday’s game. Bellflower defeated the Pioneers 30-16 as Brown picked up 123 all-purpose yards.
By Loren Kopff
BELLFLOWER-Artesia’s football team had mostly been a first half squad throughout most of the 2014 season, having led or being tied at the break in five of its first eight games. In fact, the Pioneers had a lead going into the fourth quarter in another contest and could have easily had five or even six wins entering its tilt against Bellflower last Friday night.
But 16 points in the second half wasn’t enough to recover from a shaky first half and the Pioneers dropped a 30-16 decision to the Buccaneers at Ron Yary Stadium, thus ending Artesia head coach Joe Veach’s dreams of finishing the season with a .500 record. Bellflower returned an interception for a touchdown and a fumble that led to a field goal in the first half as it led 17-0 at the break.
“I thought we came out flat,” Veach said. “We didn’t play with any energy. We made mistakes across the board on offense and that’s what killed us. Defensively, I thought we played a good first half. We gave them 21 points; they only took 17. They should have scored 21 on us in the first half. Offensively, we just had nothing going.”
The Pioneers (3-6 overall, 1-4 in the Suburban League) had driven to the Bellflower 24-yard line on their opening possession of the game. But an ill-advised pass thrown from senior quarterback Jimmy Rodriguez found the hands of Devon Cooley, who went 80 yards the opposite direction for a touchdown.
Then two plays into the second quarter, a fumble at the Bellflower 44-yard line was scooped up by Jonathan Castillo, who returned it to the Artesia 19-yard line. Almost two and a half minutes later, Roman Delgado booted a 28-yard field goal to give the hosts a 10-0 lead.
“We just didn’t execute,” Veach said of the interception. “We called the play and we didn’t run the play. We didn’t have 11 guys running the play. When that happens, bad things happen. Looking back, obviously Jimmy should have tucked it in and taken a sack. But he was trying to make a play; we just didn’t execute.”
Following a three and out, the Buccaneers engineered a 10-play, 5:46 drive that ended when Austin Jones went in from a yard out. Artesia was held to 52 yards passing and 28 yards on the ground in the first half and ran 18 plays. But the tide would quickly shift in the first five minutes of the second half.
Two straight first downs eventually led to Rodriguez throwing a 30-yard touchdown pass to senior wide receiver Jaydon Logan on the first drive of the second half. Then senior Alejandro Guerrero recovered the ensuing onside kick and after driving to the Bellflower 28-yard line, senior Ezekial Diaz connected on a 44-yard field goal to bring the Pioneers back in the game.
“At halftime, we told them that we were going to keep playing and we were going to simplify what we were doing,” Veach said. “We were just going to play hard and see what kind of people we are in the second half. The second half has killed us all year and now I think you can officially say it’s not second halves. It’s just the fact that we don’t play 48 minutes.”
With the score now 23-10, senior defensive tackle Enoka Sautia picked off Demetrius Reed at the Artesia 45-yard line and returned it 10 yards. On the very next play, Logan caught a 36-yard pass from senior Cristian Rodriguez and four plays later, Jimmy Rodriguez scored from a yard out to bring Artesia to seven points again. But Wheeler ended any chance of a complete rally when he iced the game with a five-yard scoring run midway through the fourth quarter.
“The interception was a great play by Enoka,” Veach said. “It’s good to see plays like that from guys like that because he’s been in the program with us for awhile now. It’s something that we coach when we see screens-to stop, don’t chase the quarterback, get back, get depth and try to make a play. It’s something that he hasn’t always done. And so it’s great to see something like happen for a kid who gets it and is now doing what he’s coached to do.”
Artesia would try to answer by getting to the Bellflower 22-yard line but was thrown for a one-yard loss on fourth and two and Bellflower ran out the final 2:39 of the game. Jimmy Rodriguez was 20 of 29 for 180 yards and at one point, completed eight straight passes totaling 106 yards. Cristian Rodriguez caught 10 of those passes for 83 yards while Logan caught another seven passes for 89 yards. On defense, junior outside linebacker Christian Payton had 11 and a half tackles while Cristian Rodriguez added seven and a half tackles and senior linebacker Devon King another four and a half.
Artesia will end the season tonight at home against John Glenn. Not only will it be senior night, it is Artesia’s homecoming game and the school will be celebrating its 60th anniversary. The Pioneers have won nine of their past 11 meetings with the Eagles, who will be seeking their first league win on the field since 2011.
“I’m over this game,” Veach said. “We wanted to win; we beat Bellflower the last two years and I know they wanted to beat us. I told the kids we’re going to see what kind of people we are in this last week. We have one last game and how we’re going to send out our seniors, how are we going to finish our season, what are we going to go into the offseason thinking about and remembering? Are we going to remember that we showed up the last game and played great? Or are we going to remember that we turned it all in a little bit early and we laid an egg.
“Glenn is a team that’s battling for a league win which they haven’t had in awhile,” he continued. “They’re going to come out and fight and they’re going to play hard. We have to be ready for them. We don’t want anything to happen that doesn’t happen well for us.”Five years ago I participated in the 2996 9-11 Tribute, where bloggers wrote posts in honor or remembrance of the people who lost their lives as a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11th 2001. Judith Jones was the person that was assigned to me. I was only blogging for a year at that time, I was very nervous and I wanted to do a good job remembering Judith Jones. I took the project very seriously. After it was all said and done I received a nice email from Judith's daughter thanking me and telling me I had done well.
Two weeks ago, 5 years after the original post, I received an email from Judith's daughter telling me that when people ask her about her mother she points them to my post. Words cannot describe how honored I feel about that.

The law of war crimes consists of the criminalization of the violations of the law of armed conflict (LOAC), also known as international humanitarian law (IHL), leading to individual criminal liability. Accordingly, the understanding of the law requires a discussion of a) the underlying regime of the LOAC, its general principles, and their application in specific rules; b) the relation between LOAC/IHL and the international criminal law (ICL) of war crimes; and c) the process of criminalization and enforcement, often through judicial institutions. All three steps are necessary for a doctrinal as well as a critical historical understanding of the legal regime and an appreciation of the role that the concept of war crimes plays in the regulation of war. The literature is rich with references to these questions, and to the tensions inherent in the relations between legal regimes or the process of criminalization and enforcement. This is evident whether the sources address ICL as a whole, the relationship between ICL and IHL, the role of courts and tribunals, or specific (categories of) war crimes. An interpretation of the underlying principles of IHL, its relation to ICL, and the process of criminalization and enforcement will also determine the stance of an author when they intervene in the development of the law of war crimes, for example by commenting on recent jurisprudence. Over the 20th century, the literature has encompassed arguments for the expansion of applicable law as well as more skeptical or conservative interpretations. Alongside and through formalist doctrinal arguments, different positions in the literature are informed by different understandings of the proper balance in the regulation of war and in the development of international law.
Primary Sources
There has been a proliferation, and increasing sophistication, of online sources containing a wealth of primary material, partly in response to the (at least initially) limited functionality of court websites. ICC Legal Tools is an important project providing access to materials across international criminal law (ICL) and international humanitarian law (IHL). The latter is the focus of the seminal ICRC Customary IHL Database law study. Cryer 2019 is a very useful single-volume physical compilation.
Cryer, Robert. International Criminal Law Documents. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2019.
Containing key and basic primary sources, including war crimes–related IHL treaty provisions, and the statutes of the major international criminal tribunals, this is a good starting point for the identification and study of the relevant treaty sources.
This database is limited to the International Criminal Court and contains a wealth of documents (statutes, judgments, preparatory works, etc.) related to a variety of ICL institutions, as well as other relevant institutional practice and scholarship.
ICRC Customary IHL Database.
An important and continuously updated study, compiling relevant state practice structured over 161 rules of IHL. Some of these refer explicitly to war crimes, while the material provided for the support of IHL rules also often includes ICL material. While it is important not to treat the study itself as a primary source, it is both extremely useful and considered authoritative by many, if not all, commentators.Jurgen Klopp on Cristiano Ronaldo incident.
Jurgen Klopp has said that he didn’t want Cristiano Ronaldo to be sent off for a foul on Curtis Jones on Sunday afternoon.
The Liverpool manager watched his side tear Manchester United apart as the visitors came away from Old Trafford with a 5-0 victory over their arch-rivals.
Towards the end of the first half, with Liverpool leading 3-0, Man United players were already showing signs of frustration and none more so than their star man Ronaldo.
In a duel with youngster Curtis Jones, the Liverpool man ended up on the ground before Ronaldo began kicking the ball into his midriff, leading to anger from several of Jones’ teammates.
/>
Jurgen Klopp: I was told it was fine.
Referee Anthony Taylor decided that the incident was only worth a yellow card for Ronaldo and after the situation was eased, Liverpool went up to the other end of the pitch to score a fourth first-half goal.
Asked about the foul afterwards, Klopp was magnanimous towards the five-time Ballon d’Or winner, who rejoined United over the summer.
““I saw it of course,” the German coach told reporters after the match.
“For me it looked like it a red card but in the end I got told it wasn’t because he made contact with the ball. I don’t want Cristiano getting a red card. I got convinced, or told at least it was fine.”
/>
Liverpool humiliate Man United.
While Ronaldo was spared a long walk down the Old Trafford tunnel, teammate Paul Pogba wasn’t so lucky. The Frenchman received his marching orders just 15 minutes after coming on as a half-time substitute for a horror challenge on Naby Keita, which led to the Guinea international being stretchered off.
Remarkably, Man United managed to play with 10 men for 30 minutes without conceding a goal but the damage had already been done thanks to those four first half strikes and a Mohamed Salah goal early in the second half which sealed his hat-trick.
/>
Jurgen Klopp has Reds purring.
Much of the post-match focus has been on the miserable situation at Man United but Premier League rivals should take note of the form of Liverpool.
The Reds have won their last two Premier League matches 5-0 and have yet to taste defeat in the competition this season. After a below-par 2020/21 campaign, it seems that Jurgen Klopp’s men are reaching the heights of their 2019/2020 pomp.
Next up for Liverpool, a Carabao Cup trip to Preston North End on Wednesday before returning to league action at home to Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday.

Here are three of the biggest IT growth areas I’m seeing from my work with clients, and suggestions for practical messaging that will lift you out of the “me-too” scrum this year.
Cloud Migration
With security fears easing and cloud providers upping their game, it’s no longer news when a customer moves to the cloud – or that you helped them move to the cloud. Here are some not-so-obvious angles to differentiate your cloud platform and/or cloud migration consulting services.
- How you help automatically identify which of a customer’s apps are best for the cloud from a business This might take into account management costs, software licensing, security/regulatory requirements, application performance and demands for local hosting in area such as the European Union.
- How you automatically identify which apps are best for the cloud from a technical This might include dependencies on aging hardware platforms that would make such migration difficult or impossible and how you help link internal access control, security, management or chargeback platforms to cloud environments.
- How you help customers manage their cloud migration so they don’t wind up with islands of expensive, insecure cloud apps.
Raising Digital Twins
Expect more talk in 2019 about “digital twins” (software-based simulations of physical objects or processes that continually become more accurate by analyzing real-time data from the Internet of Things. This ongoing realistic modeling of real-world objects and processes promises to slash time to market, prevent breakdowns through proactive maintenance and improve the efficiency and quality of products and services.
Ways to make your messaging stand out:
- Explain what a digital twin is with examples specific to your industry. For pharmaceuticals, that might be a digital drug trial using wearable sensors; for an electric car manufacturer, a map showing range and charging stations for a customer based on their driving habits.
- Explain how your digital twin technology or architecture handles obstacles such as intermittent or slow network connections with IoT devices.
- Explain how you handle the all-important ingestion, cleansing and normalization of data needed to create an accurate digital twin.
- Explain how each component in your digital twin architecture (from field devices through data gateways and cloud-based analytics) is designed to work most efficiently and securely.
Software Defined What?
Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen once famously predicted that software will eat the world. Software may not consume everything in the IT world, but it is increasingly defining it. By that I mean using software to automatically configure, provision and manage compute, network and storage hardware far more quickly and less expensively than manually clicking through a user interface or changing wires on a patch panel.
Between software defined wide-area networks, software defined storage, software defined data centers, infrastructure as code and (yes) software defined everything, how do you stand out?
- Explain where you fit in all these conflicting market spaces and create a simple, elevator pitch to explain it to customers. For example: “We deliver on the promise of `software defined everything’ by automating the provisioning, management, updating and troubleshooting of all components of your infrastructure from a single pane of glass.’”
- With everyone moving to public or public/private hybrid clouds be ready to explain how your management spans the private, hybrid and public cloud worlds. Be precise about which cloud platforms you support, and how robustly.
- The same goes in spades for your support for popular scripting and management tools such as Puppet and Chef. Explain how to what extent you support them and (if you’re providing services) the scale and depth of your expertise with each.
Hey, What About Blockchain?
I left out the blockchain distributed-ledger technology as the hype seems to be fading due to security and performance problems, and the lack of high-profile success stories. But there’s still a lot of enthusiasm among the faithful. If you’re among them, check out my 15 ideas to jump start a blockchain blog and tips on driving thought leadership in blockchain. I also didn’t covert “digital transformation” as you need to decide what type of “transformation” you’re selling before you develop content for it. (Tips for doing so here.)
Whatever you’re marketing, economic and political uncertainty plus new technology means a lot of confused, frantic, “me-too” messaging. Stand out in 2019 by digging beneath the buzzwords to explain the practical, real-world challenges our customers face and how we help meet them.

The elections will take place next year during the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020.
Nominated by their respective National Olympic Committees (NOCs) together with their NOC Athletes’ Commissions, the 30 candidates contending for the four available positions within the IOC AC are from 30 NOCs and 19 summer sports.
The full list of candidates and their biographies can be downloaded here.
Commenting on the announcement, Kirsty Coventry, the current Chair of the IOC AC, said: “It is great to see such a fantastic response from the athlete community with the interest we have received from athletes around the world in this election. I am impressed by the diverse representation of sports and countries, and this demonstrates how much athletes care, and want to share their voice and play a central role in the Olympic Movement. It is exciting to have such a high calibre of candidates, and I wish them all the very best of luck,” Coventry added.
The athletes elected by their peers during the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 will replace the following members, whose term of office will expire at the end of these Games: IOC AC Chair Kirsty Coventry (Zimbabwe), Vice-Chair Danka Bartekova (Slovakia), Tony Estanguet (France) and James Tomkins (Australia). In addition, an appointed member of the Commission, Stefan Holm (Sweden), will also end his term next year.
All athletes competing at Tokyo 2020 will be able to vote for their representatives at the Athlete365 Space positioned at the entrance to the dining hall in the Olympic Village, and also at other sites such as the football cities and the sailing venue. The poll will be open from 14 July (the day the Olympic Village opens) to 4 August 2020.
The vote will be supervised and certified by an Election Committee, appointed by IOC President Thomas Bach, whose members are: Nicole Hoevertsz (Chair), as a representative of the IOC Legal Affairs Commission; Pâquerette Girard Zappelli, as the IOC Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer; and Kikkan Randall, as a representative of the IOC Athletes’ Commission.
The IOC AC is composed of a maximum of 23 members (12 members directly elected by their peers and a maximum of 11 appointed), who serve a term of eight years. The vote is held at every Olympic Games, with four members elected at each Summer Games, and two at each Winter Games. Furthermore, the IOC President, in consultation with the IOC AC Chair, can appoint further Commission members, to ensure a good balance between regions, genders and sports. The Chair and Vice-Chair of the Commission are elected by the Commission members, and must also be elected members of the AC.
Up to 15 members of the IOC AC are IOC members, providing athlete representatives with the same representation within the IOC membership as the International Federations and NOCs. Furthermore, the IOC AC Chair is a member of the IOC Executive Board, to ensure that athletes are part of the decision-making process within the Olympic Movement, which is one of the main responsibilities of the AC, together with supporting athletes’ development in their sporting and non-sporting careers, and serving as a link between the athletes and the IOC.

These clubs include: Real Madrid, Manchester United, FC Barcelona, AC Milan, Liverpool, Juventus, Inter Milan, Chelsea, Arsenal, Atletico Madrid, Manchester City and Tottenham.
In essence, this league would replace the UEFA Champions League, and it would guarantee these 12 clubs’ participation in the Super League every year. For example, even if these clubs performed poorly in one season, they would still be guaranteed a spot in the league for the next season, as clubs would no longer have to earn their way to a European spot.
To no one’s surprise, football Twitter was irate at the announcement by each of these 12 clubs. Many were surprised to find out that Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich did not accept an invitation from this treasonous organization. Users praised both clubs for their resistance, and commended them for their efforts to “save football.”
If we look toward PSG, it is a club hated by most football fans based on the mere fact that it has bought its way to success. Nevertheless, these negative opinions were thrown out the window on Sunday, and Paris was seen as the antihero.
This is utter nonsense. Let me tell you why.
PSG was taken over by Qatar Sports Investment (QSI) in 2011. QSI is a state-owned shareholding organization founded in 2005. The group’s takeover of the club made PSG one of only two state-owned clubs in the world (with the other being Manchester City). Since 2011, QSI has pumped over €1 billion into the club, which has led to the acquisitions of world-class players such as Neymar Jr. and Kylian Mbappe.
PSG President Nasser Al-Khelaifi serves as chairman of the organization, while the Emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, serves as the owner of the club through QSI. al-Thani has the final say on any and all decisions in relation to the club.
Now, why is all of this important? Well, Qatar would never double-cross FIFA, as former FIFA president Sepp Blatter gifted them the right to host the 2022 World Cup. In 2019, British newspaper The Sunday Times reported that Al Jazeera — an international Arabic news channel based in Doha — secretly offered FIFA $400 million for broadcasting rights, just 21 days before FIFA announced that Qatar would hold the 2022 World Cup.
This TV deal between FIFA and Al Jazeera also stated that €100 million would be designated to a FIFA account once Qatar won the World Cup bid in 2010.
As a result, Qatar cannot risk losing their chance to hold the World Cup. Although the ways in which they won the rights to host the tournament are as sketchy as could be, they will still host the tournament in a year’s time.
Make no mistake, if Qatar had no prior agreements made with FIFA, they most certainly would have taken the massive payout and joined the resistance. For now, they’ll have to stay put, but all bets are off after the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
FIFA is not the only organization they have to remain loyal to. UEFA has protected PSG from sanctions that would have been raised against them for their violation of Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. FFP was established to prevent clubs from spending more than they earned in pursuit of their success.
France24, a French state-owned network, reported in 2018 that UEFA knowingly helped PSG cover up their own irregularities for political reasons, under the leadership of Michel Platini and Gianni Infantino.
Moreover, PSG correspondent Jonathan Johnson of ESPN reported in 2018 that UEFA was satisfied with the club’s break-even result from 2015-17; UEFA closed the investigation, and no sanctions were given out. However, this simply did not add up. Tariq Panja of The New York Times reported in 2019 that the acquisitions of Neymar and Mbappe in the summer of 2017 cost the club more than $400 million.
Such an enormous amount of money spent in one summer could not be done in a manner that would allow clubs to balance their spending and revenue, unless they lied about the money they earned from certain sponsorships.
PSG stated that Qatar Tourism Authority, one of their sponsors, brought in more than €100 million. However, when UEFA financial investigator Yves Leterme hired sports marketing company Octagon Worldwide to analyze this evaluation made by the club, they only valued Qatar Tourism Authority at €5 million. Since Paris was cleared of all wrongdoing, one cannot say that they lied about their evaluation. However, the massive difference in evaluations between PSG and Octagon Worldwide definitely raises an eyebrow or two.
Overall, this is meant to show how erroneous it is to claim that PSG isn’t joining the Super League for the good of football. They aren’t joining the Super League because it does not benefit them — they are just waiting. When it does benefit them, they will take their heaps of money and join the dissidents.

Each year, lots of companies arrives to Barcelona with the aim of placing big news in the most important newspapers and magazines in Spain and worldwide. But, how to gain presence in the publications that cover the event? There are lot of journalists and also lot of news. The quantity of news announced by the brands increase exponentially yearly and getting noticed and published is a difficult task.
Being highlighted is complicated, but not impossible. Here you can see some tips after our wide experience with brands who are present at the event, or organize parallel events:
- Establishing an objective and a messaging: companies most of the time arrive at the MWC with no specific news to unveil. Being at the event is not news. You are not the only company at the show. What do you want to communicate? Do you have a big product launch? If not, could you establish a messaging related to mobility that can be interesting for journalists? Analyzing if you have something to communicate and the best ways to do it is something essential that should to be done together with a PR expert.
- Think timings: your timings and the journalists’ timings. Probably the first day of the event, all companies plan to launch their press releases and announcements. Do you think it is the best time to stand out? Definitely, it isn’t. It is better to use another strategy. Depending on the goal, launching our communications some days before the event can be the best option. and it is useful to reach journalists and gain visits at the MWC’s booth and schedule one-tone interviews. Even, in some cases, communicating after the event can be a good approach if we would like to show some results. The company goals will define the best timing.
- Having a strong and good relationship with the journalists that usually cover the MWC. If you already have a good relationship with them, something that you look after every day during the whole day, it is probably that they won’t miss your news and announcements.
In short, standing out from the crowd depends on several factors. Each brand and company have to decide which can be their best approach and strategy. There isn’t a fix rule to be successful. Timing and type of messaging is key, without any doubt. Having an established relation with media, previously gained, is very important. It is a complete process that takes time and work but needed to prepare one of the most important trade fairs of the year.
Estela Cayón@mentions after import
Dear Buddypress,
I hope you can help me with this…
I have just transferred 1000s of comments to articles – of my buddypress wordpress site.
Those comments, have @mentions in them and users, didn’t receive the notifications about @mentions – which is great! It would be too much (some of them are old ect).
However, is there any way we can populate those mentions, without any notifications, so they show in their profiles – under mentions? So, they can look back when someone mentioned them?
Thank you very much 🙂

SeasonsCheck your credit score
Free access to your credit report and score when you sign up with CreditSav.
JustMoney CreditSav
In order to take out a loan, or any other form of credit, you will need a decent credit score. Therefore, it’s important to regularly check your credit report and to take active steps, if needed, to improve your score.
By registering with JustMoney CreditSav, you will gain access to your free credit report and credit dashboard. Your credit score will be shown within a range of bad to average to good, numbering from 1 to 1000.
Your score takes into account your outstanding debt, both long-term and short-term, and the number of accounts you have open.
Your credit dashboard will indicate whether there are any judgements against you, and any debt counselling you may be receiving. Other features include your debt-to-income ratio, and how you measure up on a scale of 0 to 100 percent, compared with other South Africans. A selection of financial products will also be visible, along with your eligibility to apply for them.
How is your credit score determined?
Every time you take out credit, you give the credit bureaus an indication of your creditworthiness. If you consistently default on your payments – in other words, your payments are late, or you don’t pay in full – this will be recorded and considered by future creditors.
There are five main credit bureaus in South Africa, these being TransUnion, Compuscan, Experian, Vericred, and Xpert Decision Systems (XDS). These bureaus gather information on individuals’ creditworthiness.
Do you have a good credit score?
When analysing your credit report, you’ll notice that you’re graded according to a certain score. This is a reflection of your creditworthiness and it will determine whether future creditors trust you.
The following brackets apply to your CreditSav credit score:
- 901 - 1000: Excellent
- 851 - 900: Good
- 801 - 850: Okay
- 601 - 800: Needs work
- 3 - 600: Not good
- 1 - 2: Not enough information to score
The higher your score, the more willing creditors will be to offer you credit, and the lower your interest rate will be - and vice versa.
What will impact your credit score?
Several factors will influence your credit score. Besides ensuring you pay your instalments in full and on time, the following factors will also have an impact:
- Several hard enquiries: Every time an institution or person checks your credit score, a note will be made on your credit report. These notes are classified as hard or soft enquiries. The former is when a creditor, such as a bank, requests your credit score. The latter is when you check your own credit score. If you have too many hard enquiries, your credit score will drop.
- Newly opened accounts: If you decide to open ten new credit-bearing accounts in a month, this will count as a red flag on your credit report. This is because it’s often a signal that you’re desperate for cash, and it may be difficult to suddenly balance a range of new accounts.
- Having too much debt: Your debt-to-income (DTO) ratio should never be over 40%. This means that you should never pay more than 40% of your income towards your debt. If you do, creditors will question whether you will be able to settle all of your instalments at the end of each month, and your credit score will drop.
- Creditors have taken legal action: If one of your creditors has taken legal action against you, this will have an extremely negative impact on your credit score. For example, if you have a judgement against your name, your credit score will reflect this.
Building a good credit score takes time. If you avoid the items on the above list, and you ensure your accounts are settled on time, your credit score will slowly improve.
While this happens, you should keep track of its progress so that you can adjust your behaviour if necessary. The better your credit score, the better the deals you’ll be eligible for.BIKE. substitute Uncategorized March 4, 2008 1 Minute Felt Café 24 From the very nice guy at Sand Canyon Cyclery, courtesy the ride and the recommendation of realitylost.

You need to put up a picture of YOUR bike. …’cause remember, yours is special because it was the first one ever produced!
…and because it belongs to you, and you’re awsome!
AND HOW
Where will you bike?
Re: AND HOW
Pretty much everywhere that I don’t need to carry something heavy or be there quickly. This is ideal bicycling territory, and I’m an idiot not to take advantage of it, especially when I work from home and I can take a 45 minute bike break if I want and pedal through a freaking nature sanctuary full of twittering birds and vicious coyotes.
Why are you going to ride on a bike.
The rhino is sick.
riding a bike feels good,
i wish you many rides!
that’s a good looking bike!
Gosh, that is a pretty bike.
It must be the season, but the world is telling me that it’s time to get a damn bike already. I was planning on a $50 craigslist beater, but yours has “Wonder Wheels II” written all over it.
That’s a fine-looking machine, sir.
Yay bike! awesome. If you need advice on ramping up your biking habits, I’d be happy to help.
A recommendation, if you’re looking at bike luggage: Ortlieb panniers and boxes are spendy, but bulletproof. Totally worth the money.
for training:
If I remember correctly, there’s a velodrome @ CS Dominguez Hills.
Very pretty!
Remember to clothes pin a playing card in the spoke.
Trinnit reminded me…
That’s what we forgot! YOUR BELL!!!
I’ll be sure to pick that up for you.
Lets do a ride in the back bay soon- me on my skates, you on your bike!
Eventually I’ll get the shifters switched out and actually be able to ride mine.
Hurrah for bikes!
Ching ching!Omega just announced five new special watches. More interesting though was the announcement that “very soon the entire range of Omega Watches will be Master Chronometer certified” said Raynald Aeschlimann, President and CEO of Omega. “This important moment will mark the “complete changeover a new generation of precision and reliability never seen in the industry before.”
What we think people will like most? The new Seamaster 300
The new Seamaster 300 is quite a surprise. It has a very nice vintage-looking aesthetic, and it also has a sandwich dial! The dial is clean and precise, and makes good use of the sandwich design thanks to the sharpness of the hands and indices. There is no mention of the movement on the dial, it is only on the back, with the OMEGA Co-Axial Master Chronometer Calibre 8912 on display through the sapphire crystal caseback. Domed sapphire crystal on the front completes the look along with a wider window thanks to a thinner inner frame. The watch has four references and comes in dials of blue or black and two types of bracelet/strap.
The main event of the new Seamaster 300 is in Bronze Gold, and it is stunning. An excellent combination of colors provides a very nice vintage look and a real reason to go to precious metal. This unique alloy, hallmarked at 9k, uses palladium silver and gold to create its unique color. It is meant to look back upon an alloy known as Corinthian gold but with all the modern sciences come to bear. It meets no coating and is able to have direct contact to the skin with no issues.
#004 - Alternative Financing Before, During, & After a Global Pandemic - Naren Nayak and Sachin Goel
Naren Nayak is a 20-year veteran of Capital Markets and Securitization and current treasurer at Credibly, a leading small business fintech lender. In this episode of Views from the Crow's Nest, we sat down with him and senior FischerJordan manager Sachin Goel for a dialogue about the evolution of the alternative lending space in the time preceding, during, and eventually following the COVID-19 pandemic.
Some of what we covered:
- The difference between alternative and traditional lenders
- What makes an alternative lender more attractive to small businesses for securing financing
- How the COVID pandemic impacted the alternative commercial lending space and how things might look going forward
- How investor attitudes toward alt-lenders may have shifted post-COVID
- Potential impacts of cryptocurrency on the alt lending space in the future
Welcome to the crow's nest!Born in Helena in 1906, Elge attended that city’s public schools and went on to graduate from law school at the University of Montana in 1930. Reflecting on her time at UM and her subsequent career as an attorney, Elge recalled, “I was a novelty when I went through law school. The men helped me along because they didn’t see me as competition. Men today know better.”
After law school she returned to Helena, where Wellington Rankin—a prominent Helena attorney and public official and brother of Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin—allowed her to use his library and office and gave her ten cases to start a private practice. She continued in private practice until 1932, when she was elected to the position of public administrator in Lewis and Clark County. Two years later the voters elected her county attorney, the second woman elected in Montana to that office.
After a single term, Elge left to work on Jeannette Rankin’s second campaign for Congress and acted as the congresswoman’s administrative assistant in Washington, D.C. During World War II she worked for the War Shipping Administration and Maritime Commission. In 1954 she became an Indian probate judge for the Department of Interior, one of the only women in that position, and served until her retirement in 1977.
Elge’s political activism was as noteworthy as her legal career. One of her early victories was to successfully lobby for jury service for women. Even though Montana women had attained the vote in 1914, they did not have the right to sit on juries. Supporters of women’s jury service framed the argument in terms of equality. In a 1923 issue of the Helena Independent, one advocate wrote, “This obstacle should be removed for [women have] now . . . attained equal rights in all activities, the law, medicine, business, and the various professions . . . we even have lady bootleggers.”
Elge became interested in the issue after serving as county attorney and encountering all-male juries. Along with friend and fellow activist Belle Fligelman Winestine, Elge took up the cause through the League of Women Voters and Business and Professional Women’s Clubs. Winestine and Elge also created a coalition of support among organized labor and the Montana Farmers Union. Persuaded by their lobbying efforts, Montana passed the Women’s Jury Service Act in 1939.
Elge continued to champion women’s rights in Montana well past her retirement. She was “an omnipresent force” during the debate over Montana’s ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment in the early 1970s and again when anti-ERA forces mobilized to rescind ratification. A charter member of the Montana Council for the Equal Rights Amendment, she actively lobbied against nullification at the 1975, 1977, and 1979 legislative sessions.
Elge adopted a deliberately feminine style of politics that might have seemed old-fashioned in the second half of the twentieth century, but it was an approach that nonetheless served her well in her career and activism. Rather than acting and behaving “like a man” to succeed in the worlds of the law and politics, Elge remained, in her own words, “positive and aggressive without being abrasive.” “I always played the game,” she told a reporter in 1974. “I dressed in a feminine manner and I put up with the prejudice. Quietly but surely, I made my way up through the ranks.”
Elge passed away in 1991 at the age of eighty-four. After her death, the Montana Supreme Court issued a resolution in her honor, crediting her with “a legacy of spirited advocacy on behalf of women, and ultimately on behalf of all humankind.” AH

India may keep ignoring Nepal’s legitimate claim on Kalapani but it will leave Nepal with the reason to feel hurt, betrayed, angry and aggrieved. It will breed resentment all around.
These were the good times in Nepal-India relations. Kathmandu and New Delhi were burying hatchets. In Kathmandu, Ambassador Manjeev Singh Puri had avoided actions that could potentially damage the friendly relation. His approach to Nepal was markedly different from his immediate predecessor’s.
Completion of Motihari-Amlekhganj petroleum pipeline—the first-ever cross-border petroleum pipeline in South Asia—in September this year was an inspiring event in Nepal-India development cooperation. When Nepali Prime Minister and his Indian counterpart jointly inaugurated the project, it sent the impactful message to Nepal. Nepal and India were emerging from the dark shadows of the blockade, it seemed.
Then came up Kalapani (I use Kalapani as a metaphor here to include all encroachment issues including Susta, Lipulekh, Limpiyadhura and others).
That India is occupying Kalapani area is not an old story in Nepal but when, on November 2, the new map released by government of India to show union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh also included Kalapani area, Kathmandu reacted: India, are you kidding? Protests erupted across the country. The government had to do something.
Foreign ministry issued a statement objecting to India’s map. India responded by saying Nepal’s claim is invalid.
Stories of loss
Since November 2, Kalapani is the most discussed issue in Nepal’s social media, news media and public spheres. People are trying to figure out how Kalapani went under Indian occupation.
Though its history goes 200 years back, larger Nepali community came to know about Kalapani in the 1990s after the end of Panchayat system. The situation of the country at the time was such that not only Kalapani, most of Far-west was isolated from Kathmandu. To reach Mahendranagar or Dhangadhi from Kathmandu, you would have to go through India. Only after completion of Mahendra Highway in 2000, the Far-west and Kathmandu interfaced. It was no wonder, therefore, that very few knew about Kalapani until the 1990s.
We do not actually know when exactly Indian forces entered and set up the camps in Kalapani. There are only some bit of speculations, oral accounts and inadequate researches.
One such source has been Buddhi Narayan Shrestha whose Border Management of Nepal is among the most cited book. Shrestha, however, has not provided definite answer, other than speculation, regarding how Kalapani went under Indian control. One standard speculation goes like this: During the 1962 war with China, Indian troops were being pushed downward by Chinese troops. The Indian forces retreated and finally arrived at Kalapani. They saw that it was a strategic location and set up military base just in case the Chinese resumed fight.
Could this be true? Could India at the time have thought the land belonged to India? We don’t know. Could India have communicated about this to King Mahendra? Could King Mahendra have conceded that piece of land to India? We don’t know for sure.
Nepal-India ties were souring before India-China war. Jawaharlal Nehru was sore with Mahendra for signing the agreement with China to build the Araniko Highway. Following this, India had briefly imposed sanctions on Nepal too. Mahendra had been trying to calm down the Indians by saying communism does not come by taxi. Geopolitically, the late 50s and the early 60s were very unsettling times for Nepal. Could Mahendra have allowed India to use Nepali land for the purpose of using it against China? We don’t know that either.
Another story has it that King Mahendra also did not know about Indian occupation of Kalapani for long. He came to know about it in the late 1960s, when he had taken a bold move of removing Indian military mission from Kathmandu and sending back the Indian troops stationed in various border points in the north. Shrestha has recorded some controversial statements attributed to people who knew and worked with King Mahendra. Rishikesh Shah is mentioned as saying “I was the minister when the (Indian) military was deployed at Kalapani. King Mahendra unwillingly overlooked the issue then.” Shah mentions King Mahendra as saying “I have already angered India too much, India has become like a raging fire—now let it take the seat in Kalapani.”
There is a sharp rebuttal to this claim as “nonsense” by Shailendra Kumar Upadhyay who argues that “nationalist like King Mahendra, who had made the courageous decision to drive away Indian check posts” could never have given consent to India “to deploy its troops at Kalapani.”
Mahendra haters in Nepal, as is their wont, have always demonized him and portrayed him as the cause of every single problem facing the country today. Kalapani debate has provided them an excuse to demonize him further and ridicule the nationalists yet again. This deceitful distraction, however, is not something we need to worry about much.
What we need to worry about is we do not have adequate literature on Kalapani, and we are losing all those who knew Kalapani issue better and who worked with King Mahendra: Kirti Nidhi Bista, Surya Bahadur Thapa, Rishi Kesh Shah, Shailendra Kumar Upadhyay to name a few.
In India too we had leaders who indirectly admitted to Kalapani belonging to Nepal. Buddhi Narayan Shrestha has documented this story too. Indian Prime Minister I K Gujaral is mentioned as saying in 1997 that “technicians from both sides are engaged in the demarcation of border” and that “if their reports conclude that the [Kalapani] area belongs to Nepal, we will immediately withdraw from there.” Likewise, Jaswant Singh, who was India’s Foreign Minister, is attributed as saying in 1999: “Nepal-India joint technical level boundary committee has been properly instructed to expedite the work of demarcation by investigating into the facts about all the territory in the western sector including Kalapani region.” There were lawmakers like Anand Pathak who said: “Indian troops should be withdrawn from Kalapani. If Nepal has been subjected to injustice in Kalapani, then India must immediately withdraw.”
None of these three men are with us today.
We are soon going to reach a point when we will have nobody to ask about Kalapani. This is why it is critical to record, document and archive the experiences and accounts of people like Buddhi Narayan Shrestha, Bhairab Risal, Ratan Bhandari and Dwarika Nath Dhungel, who have been to the field, studied historical documents and done researches on Nepal’s borders.
But take a pause here. We have one more person who can tell us the truth about this: Gyanendra Shah, the former king. When Indo-China war broke out he was 15. Thus he may have had some memories. When Indian troops were removed from northern border points in 1969, he was 22, and when his father passed away he was 25. Early twenties is the age when one develops awareness about history and politics. Former king must know something about it.
Nepal unites
It is uncommon in Nepal for all parties to come together for a national cause. But this time around, every single party has the same voice about Kalapani. Even Madhesi parties, which have traditionally maintained silence on India’s highhandedness, attended the all-party meeting called by the prime minister on November 9 and came out with one voice: Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura are Nepali territories and Nepal should convince India to forgo its claims on them through diplomatic and political channels.
Political parties seem to be competing to prove themselves more concerned about Kalapani than others. They are questioning the ‘nationalist credentials’ of ruling Nepal Communist Party and its prime minister K P Sharma. Perhaps to address them too, the government, on November 22, sent formal diplomatic note to India over Kalapani issue.
Nepali political parties have united for Kalapani for two main reasons. One, they have realized now that when they fail to unite even during the worst times, they can be completely rejected by the people. Besides, its by-election times in Nepal. Pledge of loyalty to the nation helps win people’s hearts, if not anything. Leaders tend to project others as less nationalist. Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba has alleged that PM Oli gave consent to India to include Kalapani in its map. He may have thought saying so would help win some votes. But it has backfired—he has been heavily criticized for making such unsubstantiated and irresponsible remark.
In India, however, different narrative seems to be emerging. India, apparently, thinks protests in Nepal are provoked by anti-India elements. Indian media is giving off the tone of shock and bewilderment. “How come Nepal, India’s friend, become naraaj with India all of a sudden?” They point to Pakistan and China. One story recently published in The Hindustan Times writes about Chinese encroachment of Nepali territory and people protesting in Tarai plains, even burning the effigies of President Xi Jinping. Given that this particular newspaper had presented false stories of Nepal during the blockade too, I was not surprised. But diversion does not help solve the issue.
Yes, there are reports of encroachment from the Chinese side. Nepal should talk to China, hopefully it will. But encroachment from the north and Kalapani are apples and oranges.
Meanwhile, in Nepal, the game of lambasting nationalism and nationalists is going on. They have built the narrative that Kalapani is the test of K P Oli’s nationalism, that he is going to fail this test and that his nationalist credentials are going to be exposed. Strangely, they are among those who justified the blockade in 2015.
Whenever Nepal-India relations reach a souring point, mainly two kinds of narratives are created in Nepal. Extremists say retaliate, even go to the war. Others have always stressed on diplomacy, political conversation at the highest level and trust building.
At the third front, you have those who scorn nationalism and nationalists but at the same time also chide leaders for not being nationalist enough. These Janus-faced people need to be read with extreme skepticism.
Message to India
Call it a small country syndrome or a sense of insecurity, but Nepal has always wanted every issue with India to be sorted out amicably, through dialogue and diplomacy. Provocateurs have always defined Nepali nationalism as anti-Indianism and Nepali sentiment as anti-India sentiment. But this does not characterize Nepal-India relation. History and geography have yoked us together in such way that we cannot afford hostility.
Nepal and India, in principle, have already agreed to resolve border related issues. The Eminent Persons Group (EPG) was formed for the same purpose and it has finalized its report, possibly with all the evidence and facts. This is the instrument Nepal and India should use to resolve the pending issues.
If Kalapani is a strategic location for India, it is so for Nepal too. Geopolitics is an unpredictable game. Besides, for a large nation like India—22nd times larger than Nepal—a small strip here and there, some square meters and kilometers here and there might not matter much. For Nepal, every inch of land is priceless.
India has easy choices. Listen to Nepal. Come up with your evidence and ask Nepal for Nepal’s. If King Mahendra had conceded that territory to India, India must have some evidence to that effect too. India cannot be a country without institutional memory. So come with your evidence, sit and talk, compare and assess each other’s claims and counterclaims and evidence and counter-evidence. This is the path of resolution. Second choice is also easy: Keep ignoring Nepal’s legitimate claim on Kalapani. This will leave Nepal with the reason to feel hurt, betrayed, angry and aggrieved. This will breed resentment all around.
India demonstrated a great diplomatic finesse when it resolved all border-related disputes with Bangladesh in 2016. With Nepal, it must be even easier because we are not in border dispute with India in a true sense. Some of our lands have been encroached upon and occupied by India and Nepal wants that India stop doing so, in a truly neighborly manner.
But for this both India and Nepal should agree to this principle: I do not take an inch of your land, I don’t leave an inch of mine either. I respect your territorial integrity. You respect mine too.
Perhaps, American bard Robert Frost was sending a profound message to the nation-states when in 1914 he declared: “Good fences make good neighbors.”

My Review
I chose to read this book after receiving a free e-copy. All opinions in this review are my own and completely unbiased.
The characters in this coming of age story are ones that most people are familiar with but this is about Guinevere before she marries Arthur and after Arthur became king.
In Guinevere: On the Eve of Legend, it is obvious that she is stubborn and doesn’t listen to authority. Everyone knows this and it’s mostly tolerated but her father and Merlyn keep warning her that she’s going to have to grow up because she will be queen one day. On her thirteenth birthday, she finds out that she’ll be queen sooner rather than later because her father has promised her hand to King Arthur. I can understand why she is upset when they tell her this, but it was the custom back then so she shouldn’t have been too surprised.
Book one is mostly a fun read, and Guinevere even gets to meet a unicorn! I liked the relationship that Guinevere has with Cedwyn. It’s a close relationship that continues throughout the books.
After the first book is a short story titled Guardian of a Princess about Seren Brenin, Arthur’s warhorse who became Guinevere’s horse and guardian after he was injured in a battle. The injury is described in enough detail that I cringed and cried, and I wonder about younger middle grade readers reading it.
In Guinevere: At the Dawn of Legend, she is 15 but not married because they are at war. She and Cedwyn continue to make questionable decisions and end up putting several children in danger and possibly causing the deaths of some monks. This book has a lot of action and although Guinevere and Cedwyn want things to stay the same, they are realizing that war has changed their lives forever.
The last book, Guinevere: The Legend, is as much about Cedwyn as it is about Guinevere. He’s such a brave young man and takes watching over the children very seriously. It’s full of action, children living in horrible conditions, and has a touch of magic. The trilogy has a good ending but, of course, it’s just the beginning of Arthur and Guinevere’s story.
At the end of the second and third books is more about places and things that were mentioned in the books. It’s obvious that the author did a lot of research and some of that is shared. I learned quite a bit and young readers will enjoy the information as much as I did, I’m sure. There is also a helpful glossary at the end of each book.
At the end of the trilogy, King Arthur’s legend is shared. This I knew but it goes well with the trilogy and it’s worth sharing with those who may not be as familiar with King Arthur. This is definitely a trilogy worth reading for young adults or even old adults like me.

Reader’s Favorite 5-Star: A Gripping Tale.
Guinevere: The Legend is the concluding entry in the Guinevere trilogy by Cheryl Carpinello, a compelling Arthurian tale with strong characters and a story that explores the themes of friendship and loyalty against the backdrop of a society rocked by a crisis. The little children have been kidnapped, and Cedwyn is with them. Guinevere has made a vow to rescue Cedwyn and she leaves home without telling her father, an act that fills her with guilt. But she doesn’t know her bravery might put Cedwyn in harm’s way. She is just fifteen. And eleven-year-old Cedwyn trusts her absolutely, considering her as his queen. He is certain that she’s coming for him and the children. Can she save them from the renegades who hold the children captive? Traveling across the dark waters to the land beyond, Gaul, is perilous. In spite of the grim tales she’s heard from the old wizard Merlyn, will she continue?
This is a beautifully written story with fascinating characters, set in medieval England, and featuring characters of legend like the legendary King Arthur and Merlyn. In this novel, the author deftly develops a tale of adventure that revolves around Guinevere as a young girl and her loyalty to those she loves. The reader encounters her at the very start of the story, poised and on the go, determined to save her friend. Cedwyn is a richly developed young character as well and I enjoyed the way the author develops his friendship and devotion to the protagonist. The writing is filled with strong imagery, including elements of the setting like the rugged landscapes. The author’s unique ability to unveil the strong emotions of the characters and to keep the story realistic is a great addition to the strengths of the novel. The medieval era is reflected in the unique style of conversation and in the beliefs of the characters. Guinevere: The Legend is a gripping tale that keeps the reader turning the pages until the very last one…Reviewed by Christian Sia for Readers’ Favorite
Excerpt
Guinevere: On the Eve of Legend
Chapter 1
Hunting
Guinevere stared into the shadows along the edge of the forest. She could hear Cedwyn shifting from foot to foot beside her, unable to stand still. She sighed, the bow nine-year-old was short.
“Guin’ver?”
“Hush!”
“But …”
“Hush!”
She stamped her foot on the ground, annoyed at being interrupted. “Cedwyn,” she snapped. “What is so important that you can’t be quiet?”
“I’m hungry, and the bottoms of my trousers are damp. Can’t we go back to the castle?” His voice betrayed his hurt at her tone.
Guinevere knew her anger wasn’t with Cedwyn. It wasn’t his fault. The bottom of her green ankle-length tunic, also damp with the morning dew, was starting to make her ankles itch. Her stomach chose that moment to begin grumbling. It started as a low vibration but grew louder as if it hadn’t been fed in days.
Cedwyn heard it and started giggling. He tried to smother the sound by covering his mouth, but he was too late.
Trying to keep from laughing also, Guinevere shook her head. “How are we ever going to shoot a rabbit with all this noise?” She tousled his blond hair to let him know that she was not serious. “Let’s try for just ten minutes longer. Then if we find nothing, we’ll go back. Is that all right?”
Cedwyn nodded, not wanting to make any further noise.
Her eyes wandered mother was sure to be upset that they had been gone so long.
“Come on,” he whispered. “The only creatures we’ve seen moving have been badgers and Cornish hens. We could of had five bloody hens by now.”
“You better not let your mother hear you use that word. Anyway, I told you, it’s good luck to bag a rabbit on the eve of your thirteenth Birth Day,” Guinevere between. “But I thought that the eve was the night before. Your Birth Day isn’t until the day after tomorrow.”
“That’s true, but the eve of something can also be anytime close to the day.”
“You sure?”
“Of course I am! Otherwise, what would happen if the day before I didn’t get a rabbit? This way there are more chances to get one. Now, let’s go. I’m sure I saw the grass moving up ahead, and I don’t think it was the wind.” She didn’t mention to him that she needed lots of luck.
Cedwyn obediently followed her, mumbling to himself. “We’re still running out of time.”
They hadn’t gone far when he thought of something else. “Guin’ver?”
She turned, her long brown braid whipping around. “Shh! You will scare the rabbits away!”
“But you also promised to teach me how to hunt with a bow and arrow once you are thirteen.”
“Yes, but if you don’t stop your chatter, I won’t. Do you understand?”
Cedwyn nodded. A slight upturning of his mouth betrayed his satisfaction at her promise.
“Then let’s go.”
He followed, a smile highlighting his chubby cheeks. He then smacked into Guinevere who had abruptly stopped.
“Wha…”
A hand clamped down over his mouth followed by an angry “Shh!”
Cedwyn moved quietly up to her side, his nine-year-old frame coming up to her shoulders. When she looked him, her brown eyes sparkled with excitement in the midmorning light. Her lips formed the word “Look.” His blue eyes followed her out-stretched arm.
There, just beneath the pine trees where the wild grasses grew– movement. He stared at the spot. Then the tall green stalks bent again, betraying the presence of something beneath.
“How can you tell if it’s really a rabbit?” he whispered.
“See how the stalks move forward a bit and then part?”
Cedwyn nodded.
“Well, the forward movement of the stalks is the rabbit testing out the goodness of the food. And then where the grasses part—that is—when the rabbit stops and starts feeding,” Guinevere said, her pride in her knowledge showing. “Hand me an arrow.” She held out her hand as Cedwyn pulled an arrow from the small leather quiver on his back.
Very carefully, her heart pounding, Guinevere nocked the arrow and steadily drew the bowstring. They crouched on the ground and covered their ears as the shrill cry continued to make their ears ring.
“Wh…what is that?” Cedwyn whispered.
Guinevere shook her head in reply.
And then, a different sound—of something crashing through the grasses and scrub thickets. They inched their way up to peek above the grass. There—crashing and charging around the thickets—the biggest wild boar they’d ever seen.
Cedwyn looked at Guinevere. “Ain’t that your arrow sticking in its side?”
She nodded slowly, in shock that she’d hit anything. For a few moments, they watched as the boar ran first in one direction and then another in what appeared to be a crazed pattern. But Guinevere recognized the pattern: the wounded boar was searching for its hunters .
“Come on,” she said, grabbing his hand. “We have to get out of here now!”
“Why?” Then he had his answer. The boar roared in anger. The ground trembled under their feet as the boar spotted them and barreled straight for them. It had found the culprits responsible for the arrow in its side.
“Run!” Guinevere said, no longer quiet.
Cedwyn needed no further urging. He took off with Guinevere close behind him. The thunderous crashing of the boar through the grasses and scrub brush vibrated through every part of their bodies.
Guinevere chanced a look behind her and realized that the boar was gaining on them. She glanced around. Off to the right was a smaller pine tree that Cedwyn could climb to get up out of danger. He was the slowest, but they were running faster than ever. Guinevere reached for Cedwyn’s shoulder, heard a thud, and her hand found only air. He cried out as he hit the ground. The exposed tree root had claimed its first victim of the day.
She reached down to help him up, but his foot was stuck solid. Seeing the boar grow in size as it got closer, Guinevere’s brain frantically looked for a way to save Cedwyn and herself. If she made enough noise, she could get the boar to follow her into the forest. That would give Cedwyn time to get loose and up the tree.
“I’ll lead the boar away. Get yourself free and then head for that tree.”
Cedwyn looked in the direction Guinevere pointed.
“Get up in it as far as you can go and hang on until I let you know it’s safe to come down. All right?”
Cedwyn nodded, his eyes wide with fear.
“Stay down and be still ‘til you hear from me. Then be quick!”
He nodded again, searching behind them for sight of the boar.
Guinevere jumped and shouted, “Halloo boar! Here I am. Come and get me!” She waved her arms, diverting the boar’s attention to her. Once spotted, she ran. The pounding of its hooves told her the boar was following and, if possible, coming even faster. “Cedwyn! Now!” Guinevere shouted as she dashed for the safety of the trees.
Behind her, the boar charged, pain fueling its rage. Thundering through the grasses and scrub brush, it focused only on reaching the creature responsible for its pain. Behind them, Cedwyn frantically dug and pulled on the root to free his foot.
“Guin’ver! I can’t get loose!”
“You have to! Try harder! Pull harder!”
Cedwyn dug and kicked his foot until he felt it start to loosen. Finally pulling free, he stood up. He could see the boar charging after Guinevere. He ran for the pine tree. Grabbing branches, he pulled himself up until he was too high for the boar to reach.
“I’m in the tree!” he yelled.
Not turning around, Guinevere raised a hand and continued running.
Once in the forest, she slowed to let her eyes adjust to the darkness, and as she waited, the sounds of the boar grew louder. Finally, she could just make out a faint trail. She ran down the path, trying to find some place to hide so that the boar would run past her.
Up ahead was a pine tree with low hanging branches. Using her last bit of speed, she reached the tree and jumped. Her hands grasped a branch; pine needles pricked her skin. She pulled herself up, struggling to breathe, her arms aching from the effort.
Before she could get a good hold, the whole tree shook. Pine needles fell, sticking in her hair and on her clothes. Screaming, she fought to hold on, ignoring the bark cutting into her skin. At least if the boar gets me, I won’t have my thirteenth Birth Day. She didn’t know which would be worse: the boar or turning thirteen.
The boar charged the tree again. Her grip loosened. She screamed louder, suddenly sure that turning thirteen wouldn’t be as bad as facing the angry boar.
“Guin’ver! I’m coming!” Cedwyn’s only answer was another scream from the forest. He loosened his arms and slid down the tree, unmindful of the scratches from the bark.
Guinevere’s right arm flailed above her, blindly searching for a higher branch. Her fingertips brushed the bottom of one sliding through the sap. She stretched up, grasping the branch firmly with one hand. Trying not to think of what would happen if she fell, she let go with her other hand. For just a moment she felt herself slipping down, but her fingers found the branch, and she held on. The boar hit the tree again. It shook hard enough to nearly topple over, and Guinevere screamed once more.
Then she heard another more horrible scream. Its piercing sound traveled up the trunk into her body. Thinking it was Cedwyn, she looked down and saw a rock hit the boar’s side with the arrow. Its angry cry filled the air one last time before the wounded animal ran off deep into the forest.
Guinevere leaned against the rough pine trying to breathe.
“Is it gone? Can you see it?” Cedwyn asked, peeking out from behind a bush.
Guinevere searched the path that the boar had taken. There was no sign of it, and she couldn’t hear it anymore either.
“It’s gone. We’re safe. C’mon out.”
As Cedwyn made his way to her, she climbed down the tree and collasped on the ground, her legs too wobbly to hold her. Both of them were a mess. Guinevere proceeded to brush some of the dirt, pine needles, and small twigs off her clothing. Strands of hair had escaped from her braid, and she tried to tuck them back as she pulled out the pine needles.
Cedwyn plopped beside her, brushing twigs and pine needles off his clothes. Guinevere reached over and rubbed dirt off his cheek. They looked at each other and burst out laughing from relief at still being alive.
“I..thought..we..were…dead!” Cedwyn said between laughs.
“You should have felt that tree shake! I was sure I was the boar’s next meal!” Guinevere paused before adding, “Thank you for coming to my rescue.”
“You saved me too. That’s what friends are for.”
“Yes. I’m only glad that we’re still alive to be friends,” she said, squeezing his hand. “Let’s go. We’re really late now, and we don’t even have a rabbit as a peace offering.”
He nodded. “We’re gonna be in trouble.” Then, as if someone had heard them, upon the wind came a faint but clear voice.
“Lady Guinevere! Cedwyn!”
Grabbing hands, the two ran, fearful of what awaited them at the castle.
Suddenly Cedwyn stopped and pulled Guinevere backwards, almost knocking her down. Grinning, he pointed under a bush at the side of the path. Laughter spilled out from her as she saw their trap in the thicket where they had set it earlier that morning. It was no longer empty. Inside crouched their peace offering: a rabbit! They stuffed the rabbit inside the small leather satchel Guinevere carried; their good humor restored until the wind carried that voice again, this time louder and angrier.
“Lady Guinevere! Cedwyn!
Thank you for reading and sharing.

Older adults have to take into consideration their physical health stage and another persistent points that could be exacerbated by physical activity. While many variables can play a component in your walking pace, making strolling a half of your fitness program is certain to result in positive changes.
- Keeping a document of what quantity of steps you are taking, the distance you stroll and the way long it takes can help you see the place you began from and serve as a source of inspiration.
- Overall, 16.4% of respondents reported a minimum of one valid walking trip per day, and 3.7% of respondents had three or more valid walking trips per day.
- If you are relying on walking an hour per day at a slow pace to knock off 10 kilos, allow round six months to accomplish your objective.
- If you stroll every day, at some point you’ll notice you actually do see a change, it just took time to see it.
- In this case, apply 20 seconds per mile to the velocity you will do to complete a 10 K for a half-marathon calculation.
The Google calculator doesn’t convert decimals to minutes, but you probably can simply multiply the figures to the right of the decimal instances 60. Here is a brief page just overlaying pace equations. There are a lot of Americans who can be challenged to keep shifting for a mile, to cover it in 30, 40 or extra minutes. I began strolling with a friend I informed her it should take about 18 min to stroll a mile she says 20 min. But then I heard 15 might someone assist us with this.
How Lengthy Does It Take You To Walk A Mile?
However, as someone who has been monitoring energy for years now, I can attest to the good factor about monitoring steps as nicely. It could be very motivating to look at the steps tick upwards because the day progresses. The pedometer motivates me to maneuver more – no matter my train plan. And all of those suggestions to park further away, rise up and move during TV commercials, and so on. make more sense within the context of steps.
How Far Do I’ve To Stroll To Hit My Goal?
Our group was climbing three mph average in the Cascades (~4-7K ft elevation) with 20-30# load and could easily make 15 miles in a day. In the Sierras our average mile walking time was more like 1.5 mph and 12 miles was a protracted day. That base estimate of two mph or 2000 ft/hr is amazingly sturdy. In my 30’s, once I labored in construction all the time on my toes and infrequently carrying 25 to 50 # from place to put, it labored for a relaxed eight to 10 hour hike. In my 40’s, once I had a desk job but really received extra mountaineering in, it labored as intended for 3 to 6 mile hikes. Now that I am a quantity of months short of 70 and spending plenty of time caring for parents and different members of the family quite than hiking, it really works fairly well if I _don’t_ count rest breaks .
I don’t plan to neuter our Lab, but if I do I will attempt to wait until he is no much less than 18 months old and near being physically mature. Other components embrace weight, overall well being and food regimen. I don’t run with my pet but, and I don’t encourage him to jump on or off obstacles. Visiting the park or happening a slow stroll are both nice ideas for exercising a puppy.

The latest twist on the return to office? For many companies, tentative dates are being pushed back due to the delta variant and rising coronavirus cases. There’s still time to fine-tune your return to office or hybrid work plans. Many HR and L&D leaders plan to focus the remaining months of the year on preparing their workforce for an uncertain future. Here’s the latest news roundup from July 2021.
How to win with hybrid work
Want to create an inclusive environment for the new world of work? Consider your approach to the hybrid setup with some employees in the office and some working remotely. “Companies need to start paying more attention to process, and, most important, people,” writes Sue Bingham. Head to Harvard Business Review for tips on creating the ideal hybrid setup.
Coach your managers to success
Stand-out individual contributors often get rewarded with promotions. But they don’t automatically have the skills that will help them succeed as a manager. Recent research from Forrester finds that helping new managers develop their coaching skills drives employee engagement and performance. Get the full story on HR Dive.
New perspectives on lifelong learning
New research shows that workers are embracing reskilling and lifelong learning. Sixty-eight percent of workers said they’re open to retraining, whether their employer requires it or not. Dig into the data and findings on the Association for Talent Development blog.
The downside of internal mobility
“Great hires are often in our own internal talent pools,” writes Udemy’s Senior Vice President of People + Places Cara Brennan Allamano. But there can also be a downside to internal mobility. When internal candidates get rejected, they often lose job satisfaction and commitment to the organization. Find out what you can do to avoid this on Harvard Business Review.
Microsoft Viva and Udemy Business make learning part of everyday work
“For companies to compete in today’s global markets and upskill employees for the future, learning must be a natural, cohesive part of everyday work and company culture,” says Greg Brown, President of Udemy Business. And with the new Microsoft Viva and Udemy Business integration, customers can centralize opportunities for learning at work. Get the full scoop at Business Wire.
Maybe youth isn’t wasted on the young after all
In case you needed some news to lift your spirits, new workplace findings are in from the World Economic Forum. Based on their survey of 11,000 young people worldwide, two-thirds of respondents believe they’ll get the job they want. Respondents also say the pandemic has bolstered their resilience. Keep the good vibes going over at the World Economic Forum.
Set your organization up for success – no matter what’s next

This chapter begins with the rebellion of Moab against Israel, 2 Kings 1:1 , relates a fall of the king of Israel in his house, which brought on him a sickness, about which he sent messengers to inquire of the god of Ekron, who were stopped by Elijah, and bid to return, as they did; and upon the king's examination of them about the cause of their return, he perceived it was Elijah that forbad them, 2 Kings 1:2 , upon which the king sent to him two captains, with fifty men each, one after another, to bring him to him, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them, 2 Kings 1:9 , but a third with fifty men sent to him were spared, and he is bid to go along with them with a message to the king, as he did, 2 Kings 1:13 and the chapter is closed with the death of Ahaziah, 2 Kings 1:17 .Allen Street and Franklin Street are both completely opened to traffic.

About Our Approach to Operations and HostingAUSTIN—Today, the Texas Public Policy Foundation released the research paper, The Economic Fall and Political Rise of Renewable Energy.
The paper’s author, Robert L. Bradley, Jr., the CEO and founder of the Institute for Energy Research, offered the following statement:
“The modern history of wind power and on-grid solar power can be summarized in four words: economically incorrect, politically correct. As documented in the paper, U.S. companies invested heavily in renewable energy technologies in the 1970s/1980s only to suffer losses and, in most cases, to exit. Only massive taxpayer and consumer subsidies in the 1990s reversed these market verdicts, leading to today’s government dependence.”
Key Points:
- Renewable energy had almost of 100% market share throughout human history until it was replaced by more affordable and efficient mineral, carbon-based energies that powered the industrial revolution and vastly increased living standards.
- The birth of wind power as commercial energy began in California in the early 1980s. The winds were no stronger than before, but government largesse kicked in as a misguided response to the 1970s energy crisis.
- Massive government subsidies to solar and wind energies over four decades have enriched companies like Enron and NextEra but have failed to make these sources of energy competitive with fossil and nuclear fuels
- Corporate cronyism has cost consumers and taxpayers billions of dollars, making energy in American less affordable and reliable.
- Human ingenuity and innovation free of government intervention continue to enable the ever-expanding use and ever-decreasing cost of modern fuels to support our daily energy needs.
“Vast subsidies for renewables have made electricity in America less reliable and affordable,” said Bill Peacock, vice president of research at the Texas Public Policy Foundation. “As both Texas and the federal government seek to address this problem, the answer is not more subsidies for fossil and nuclear fuels. The answer is to eliminate subsidies and mandates for all sources of energy.”

#gossip #drama #hollywood #celebrity
Hold up, hold up . . . let’s double-check the year, shall we? Urban Dictionary is suddenly all over our
Myspace Instagram feeds, and it’s a blast from the early-’00s past. The online dictionary, which hosts user-generated definitions for slang words (and apparently human names), is seeing a major rebirth thanks to Instagram user @bymayuuu‘s viral "Show us your name in Urban Dictionary" Instagram Story trend. The trend involves heading to Urban Dictionary’s website, searching your name, and posting its definition on your Instagram Story. No, it’s definitely not always accurate (mine says I only date guys whose names start with "D"), but it certainly is entertaining! The trend utilizes Instagram’s popular "Add Yours" Story Sticker, which has given way to a handful of viral moments this past month, such as the "Who are you in love with?" Instagram trend and the "We’ll plant one tree for every pet picture" photo chain. If you’re interested in joining in on this Instagram Add Yours prompt, here’s a look at how to do so.
How to Do the "Show Us Your Name in Urban Dictionary" Add Yours Story Trend on Instagram
- When you come across the "Show Us Your Name in Urban Dictionary" Sticker on someone’s Instagram Story, tap the "Add Yours" button to join in yourself.
- Without closing Instagram, head to Urban Dictionary’s website, search your name, and pick the best "definition" that appeals to you.
- Screenshot the definition, save it to your camera roll, head back to Instagram, and choose the screenshot as your "Show Us Your Name in Urban Dictionary" Sticker background. Then, post away.
Yes, it’s really that simple. Now, go ahead and get started on this Urban Dictionary trend yourself before the next one comes along. (And trust us, there will be a next one.)

It is not in people or in things, but only in God that I and you, can find worth, significance and importance. Everyone and everything will fail, but God never will.
Here's a question for you and I, 'Where, or in whom or in what do I validate my life in?'
Here's a test to help us where we're at with God: If I live by finding my value in people, things, careers, money and etc., anxiety and worry will dominate my mind. But if I live by trusting in God, finding my worth in him, peace and joy and courage will dominate my mind.
So whatever negative dominates your mind it doesn't need to. You only need to acknowledge to yourself, and to God what it is. And turn to him in confession and prayer for his Spirit and grace to help your heart to trust God and find worth in him alone.
Life of faith is a daily battle. So on a daily basis you and I must turn our hearts to him to search us, and to show us where we're at with God. Is it trust in Jesus, resulting in peace, joy and courage? Or is it distrust or trust in yourself, which results in worry and anxiety that rules in your heart. Only one of those brings glory to God.
"And because of him you are in Christ Jesus". (1 Corinthians 1:30a)

The debate over “the best” or “the greatest” entertainer will almost certainly rage on as long as there is music to be heard and speakers to play it through. Decatur, Georgia-bred vocalist Jacquees consciously put his name in the hat when he named his album King of R&B two years ago, and it’s been a topic of discussion ever since.
The Cash Money crooner’s proclamation came to a head when he literally bumped into Keith Sweat at the 2018 Winterfest in Atlanta. The initial altercation, which saw him hastily explain his position as the “king of this generation,” quickly went viral, leaving many to wonder if there was real friction between the two. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed, even though Jacquees admitted he thought Sweat was going to “whoop” him before they squashed things during an interview with Big Tigger and Tank.
“I didn’t know it was Keith Sweat,” he recalls. “I was moving fast. I’m in my zone, just got offstage [and] … I go in not knowing it’s Keith Sweat. The camera’s on. … I’m just going and Greg Street came in my room, and he was like, ‘Jacquees, that’s Keith Sweat. You got to come back out here.’
“So I went out there with Street. [Sweat] pulled me in the corner. He was like, ‘Hey, young n—-, you know I made Silk. I did this. I did that …’ He was just running it. And I was like, ‘Damn, OG. My bad.’ He was like, ‘Nah, but I like you. I like your confidence.’ From that day, [we’ve been cool].”
While he completely embraced the idea of being top dog of his era then and continues to do so today, Jacquees revealed to rolling out that he was actually anointed “king” by an unlikely source.
“The concept for King of R&B was really just me stamping my generation for who I want to be for years to come, and I was just like, it’s now or never. I got to do it right now, or I can never do it. I can’t let another artist come out and do it. … I actually heard another radio DJ say it on the radio. He was calling me the ‘King of R&B’ after I performed at a certain radio station function.
“He was just like, ‘If you got kids, Jacquees is the King of R&B. He’s everywhere.’ He was like, ‘for his generation,’ and I just ran with it.”
That album — his second full-length project for Cash Money Records — originally was called Round 2. However, after some dialogue with label execs and other confidants, team Jacquees firmly accepted the revelation as a blessing. With RIAA-certified platinum hits like “B.E.D.,” “At The Club” and “You” to his credit and more on the way, it was a foregone conclusion that Jacquees had the potential to live up to the billing.
It’s hard to determine what could have been since the release of the album and the global pandemic coincided with tour dates and promotions. However, Jacquees’ name remains one of the most sought-after in the music industry, as evidenced by his inclusion in this year’s Black Music Honors, where he pays tribute to R&B icon Ginuwine.
“Man, honoring Ginuwine was everything,” he says of the experience. “Ginuwine [is] a legend. For him to want me to be there and perform, it meant a lot to me. ‘Pony’ was one of the first records I ever heard, period, in music. So, just to go down and perform ‘So Anxious’ and to get his reaction, it was crazy. Everybody loved me. Ginuwine, the legend himself, standing ovations, the whole nine. It was everything that I thought it was going to be.”
Ginuwine was so impressed by the performance that he weighed in on the debate, leaving no doubt about his opinion of Jacquees’ standing.
“He told me I was the king,” Jacquees discloses, “for this generation, of course. Ginuwine is one of the OGs that shows the young boys love. He’s not one of the guys that rains on your parade. He’s somebody who’s gonna clap you on.”
Speaking of supportive legends, Jacquees has managed to engage Sweat on new levels and their relationship actually has matured in ways many onlookers never imagined.
“I was just at his crib last week recording a record,” he reveals. “We got like two records in the can. He just calls me with concepts. We [share] ideas. [It’s] like that.”
Those concepts and more will likely play out on Jacquees’ third full-length album, P.T.O.F. (Panties Thrown On the Floor), as the self-proclaimed King of R&B embarks on a new journey with the same ole swag.

Библиогр.: с. 724-726
The article focuses on diasporas and migration in the Mongolian world (both inside and outside its borders). There is a wealth of ethno-diasporal forms and mechanisms, unexpected and peculiar adaptation processes of migrants and host societies on this research field. The novelty lies in the attempt to compare the Buryat migrations to Mongolia, China and South Korea. The rich “line” of migration types from traditional migrations to modern educational and labour migration in a globalizing world makes the problem extremely urgent. The goal is the analysis of diasporal strategies (from the transplantation version of Shenekhen Buryats to modern cross-border Buryat migrants consolidating via the Internet) and a preliminary assessment of the characteristics of crossborder Buryat migration to South Korea. The study of ethnomigration processes makes it possible to consider the practices of adaptation of migrants to the host society, strategies for constructing migrant communities, the institutionalization processes of the Buryat diasporas associated with the creation of interaction mechanisms in host countries. The study takes into account the latest achievements of various sciences, at the junction of which it was carried out. Along with general historical approaches, methods of qualitative sociology were used: interviews, polls, discursive analysis of the media, and research on a set of official documents, statistics. The article consists of three case-studies and is based on an analysis of Russian, Mongolian, Korean official documents, media materials, a series of conversations and interviews obtained during field studies of the authors in Mongolia, China and South Korea.

The manganese hydride dimer, [(2,6-iPr2PhBDI)Mn(μ-H)]2, was found to mediate nitrile dihydroboration, rendering it the first manganese catalyst for this transformation. Stoichiometric experiments revealed that benzonitrile insertion affords [(2,6-iPr2PhBDI)Mn(μ-NCHC6H5)]2 en route to N,N-diborylamine formation. Density functional theory calculations reveal the precise mechanism and demonstrate that catalysis is promoted by monomeric species.

Here’s some information regarding Canadian geese and things that we can do to help control the population. The geese lay eggs in April and early May. If you find eggs on your property, please note the steps you may take to prevent them from hatching. There is a requirement to register for geese control.
Geese produce one pound of droppings per day (YIKES!) and live more than 20 years and mate for life. They begin breeding at 2-3 years old & produce more than 50 young in a lifetime. They return to nesting area in March and lay eggs through April, early May, then undergo a 4-5 week flightless period to shed and regrow feathers in mid June/July.
PLEASE DISCOURAGE GEESE! – do not feed – let grass grow 10-14 inches at shoreline – plant ivy, pachysandra or juniper at shoreline – install fencing during molting period (June and July) – hang mylar tape or pinwheels – puncture, share or apply 100% corn oil to eggs (register for a permit at link above) – hunt in September if licenses for water fowl permit.

Salman Khan comes in with a sore throat and informs ‘Sultani Akhada’ where all the three men of the house have to wrestle to become the winner of the last Sultani Akhada. Cut to, Salman comes on the stage, and he continues the show with his cold throat, kickstarting the first finale night.
He entered the house and reminded everyone that only six people will go further to the finale. He also congratulated Paras Chabbra and Mahira Sharma for going ahead to the next stage. He also expressed it. Devoleena tries to defend herself but failed to do so. Salman warns them that since everyone is nominated apart from Paras and Mahira, they should be ready to face the consequences. Meanwhile, Salman also tells everyone about what is going on and where they are going wrong.
Salman also highlights how Mahira went to the next stage swiftly irrespective of the fact that she wasn’t even in the top six as far as the voting trends are concerned. Meanwhile, Arti and Paras talk to each other and everyone else as well as to what went wrong over the decision they took on Friday during the BB Delivery task.
Salman then welcomes Bigg Boss Season 7 winner Gauhar Khan and she performs to “Dilbar”. Salman asks Gauhar about what she feels about the show and she explains how every ‘Googly’ of Salman is what is making the show interesting. Salman also asks her about her pick of top 4 contestants and she names Sidharth, Rashami, Shehnaaz, and Devoleena. Salman then asks Gauhar to quality-check the wild card entrants.
Salman introduces Arhaan Khan where he is scrutinized by the newly appointed Contestant Control Officer, Gauhar Khan. She asks some twisted questions to him to test his strategy and potential to be in the game. Passing the test, Arhaan gets the approval to enter the house. The host later introduces the “Kaanta Laga” girl Shefali Zariwala who fearlessly answers Gauhar’s questions and impresses her with her honesty.
Next up in the line is Hindustani Bhau whose charm and innocence attracts Salman Khan and he arranges for a special surprise for him. He shows him a special video message from Jackie Shroff and gets him to speak to his idol Sanjay Dutt over a phone is called including Bhumi Pednekar and Yami Gautam to interrogate Himanshi and about her equation with Shehnaaz. After introducing the new contestants, Salman meets the housemates and gives them shocking news of elimination.
Salman enters the house once again, for the final evictions, while Arti begins to cry. Salman then asks everyone to come again and indulges in some leg-pulling. He later announces the 3 contestants, and calls out Shefali’s name first, followed by Devoleena, and Rashami.
Earlier, during the episode, Salman had decided to have some fun and says that Shefali, Arti and Asim have been eliminated, who then go out and wait for the main entrance to open. However, the door doesn’t open and Salman calls them back in to give the news of the real evictions.

The newly introduced banana-flavored Choco Pie that was developed to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Orion. [ORION]
It has been 42 years since Orion launched the first marshmallow-filled mushy chocolate.
Orion on Monday said it was adding banana-flavored Choco Pie to celebrate the company’s 60th anniversary.
According to the confectioner, the first development on the banana-flavored Choco Pie was launched in 2013, and the company wanted to celebrate its 60th anniversary with something new. The development was led by Kang Soo-cheol, who is head of the pie development team and has worked on improving Choco Pie for the last 20 years.
The team, made up of 10 researchers, tried about 20 different flavors, but when it came to the final decision, banana took the No. 1 spot.
Orion said it has put banana in the marshmallow, which makes it much softer and maximizes the sweet flavor. The newly released banana-flavored Choco Pie also has an increased amount of eggs and milk in the biscuit.
Because of the changes, the diameter of the confectionery remains the same, but the height has increased from 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) to 2.6 centimeters, and the weight has fallen from 39 grams (1.4 ounces) to 37 grams.
Orion said it plans to market the original Choco Pie and new flavored version as separate Korean confectioneries in the global market.
“Like when you go to Japan, you eat ‘Tokyo Banana’ [a sweet banana confectionery] and when you go to Taipei, you purchase pineapple cake,” Orion official Yoon Hyun-ho said. “We will focus our marketing so that foreigners visiting Korea will look for banana-flavored Choco Pie.”
Choco Pie has a larger following overseas. Last year, 301 billion won ($250 million) of Choco Pie was sold overseas whereas in Seoul, it sold 102 billion won.

Nate Moore, VP of Marvel Studios, talks about if Captain Marvel is more powerful than the Eternals. Brie Larson’s Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero was launched in her own 2019 film and rapidly rose to become one of the Avengers’ most powerful members.
The next MCU film, Eternals, directed by Chloé Zhao, is set to hit theatres on November 5th.
Fans have been compelled to compare superhero teams’ relative strength levels for as long as they have existed, Putting them against each other in hypothetical clashes to see who would win.
Captain Marvel’s history exposed the Tesseract (a.k.a. the Space Stone) as the direct source of her powers, instantly establishing her as a force to be reckoned with when she joined the MCU.
Larson’s superhero ended up becoming a new MCU baseline by which all future additions may be compared as debates raged over whether she could single-handedly beat Thanos in Endgame.
Producer Moore was asked to compare Angelina Jolie’s Thena to Captain Marvel at a press visit to the Eternals set attended by SR, and he admitted that it’s a difficult task for any warrior.
He described the fighter Eternal as Captain America with cosmic abilities, so she shouldn’t be written off right away, but the producers didn’t want the characters to be too godlike.
Even the totally human members of the Avengers would undoubtedly be able to hold their own:
I mean, when Captain Marvel goes binary, that is tough, but it would be as if Captain America-
– who I would argue is probably the best physical fighter– was powered by cosmic weapons, like, she’s going to be a problem, but again, Captain Marvel going binary, that’s tough.
[…] I mean, look, they’re obviously stronger than humans. I think you look at our amazing heroes, like Hawkeye and Black Widow wouldn’t have a problem.
We didn’t want them to be too godlike because I do think you run the risk of them being less relatable. And I guess Thor’s managed that pretty well.
But we don’t necessarily have a ranking system.
We do think they occupy their own pocket and I do think down the line, if and when they were to intersect with other characters…
that’s a fun thing to investigate.
Because the Eternals were created by the Celestials, mysterious creatures that have primarily existed on the films’ peripheral so far, fans have reason to wonder where they fit into the MCU’s power rankings.
The superhero team was dispatched to Earth to guard humanity against their counterparts, the Deviants, and were given stringent orders not to assist in battles that were not within their scope – regulations so strict that they did not participate in Thanos’ battle.
With that problem mentioned directly in the Eternals teaser, fans are understandably speculating if they might have changed the outcome in Avengers: Infinity War and if they will become more involved in the MCU’s future.
While Moore makes it sound like the Eternals aren’t beyond human superheroes’ skills, viewers may be wary of that notion.
Earth must be unable to defend itself against the Deviants for them to have a purpose to exist, and the Avengers include some extremely powerful individuals among their ranks.
The Eternals producer did state that the film’s new heroes work in their own specialty, so it’s possible that when the film comes out in November, audiences may discover more about the exact nature of their skills.

Each system has a distinct verb stem, from which all the various tenses and their respective “voices” are built (first image). In order to recognize a Greek verb, it is necessary to be familiar with its principal parts.The “regular” principal parts system is represented by the normal, “model” Greek verb λύω.

Since India has a tropical climate, it is best to visit in winter months. To most people outside the country, India is an exotic land shrouded in mystery and mysticism, but it has come a long way from being the ‘land of snake charmers’ and cattle roaming about in the streets (although there are still places where you might encounter that!). Here are some of the famous Indian places one can visit in January:
Shimla
Located in the lap of the gorgeous snow-capped Himalayas, Shimla is the ideal destination for snow lovers. The scenic beauty is simply breathtaking and apart from the usual sightseeing, you can also enjoy adventure sports like paragliding, skiing, etc.
Rajasthan
The one place that you definitely should not leave out of your itinerary is Rajasthan. Some of the most popular tourist spots are Jantar Mantar, Hawa Mahal, Chittorgarh Fort, etc. Also, the famous Jaipur Literary Festival is held in January, drawing the who’s who of the literary world to Jaipur.
Goa
One of the most popular Indian Places to visit in January is this coastal paradise, with its warm sun kissed beaches. Besides enjoying the sands, make sure to visit the numerous churches, which have a very strong Portuguese influence on them.
Gulmarg
Another tourist spot one can visit in January is Gulmarg. Famous for its unparalleled beauty which is best enjoyed in the winter, Gulmarg is heaven on earth. Located in Jammu & Kashmir, it is one of the famous skiing destinations in India. A must visit for anyone visiting India in winter.
Madhya Pradesh
Since the summer months in India are quite hot, it is advisable to visit Madhya Pradesh in January. You can visit the national parks such as Bandhavgarh and Kanha. Also, do not forget to visit Khajuraho and appreciate the sculptures celebrating life and love.One afternoon, while heading home
Upon a hot commuter train,
I fell asleep, and dreamed this poem,
As summer’s light began to wane.
I saw a scene of baseball’s past
When stadiums were built to last
With brick-and-ivy outfield walls
Bombarded hard by sluggers’ balls.
And every man, and every maid
Would swelter in the noon-day heat.
And by the time the game’d been played
They’d smell as bad as postmen’s feet.
My reverie became a wish
That bordered close on heresy:
That Fenway Park, the Red Sox home,
Become an air-conditioned dome.
And as I slept the train rolled on
Past Back Bay then to Newtonville,
My narcoleptic state absorbed
What otherwise was time to kill.
Through Wellesley Farms to Wellesley Hills
And Wellesley Square I slept.
Through Natick and West Natick too
The engineer appointments kept.
When hot and groggy I awoke
To the conductor’s awful yawp,
The scenery out my window showed
We’d rolled four stations past my stop.
I stumbled off the train to see
A wave of fans in front of me
With baseball caps upon their heads
That bore the letter “B” in red;
it was–
The Night of the Red Sox Living Dead.
Their heads had swelled (or was it mine,
That lay asleep for all that time?)
“Ortiz” and “Schilling” on their backs.
With wild surmise and looks quite wacked.
They staggered towards me, two by two,
I froze, then turned and tried to flee.
Well, what exactly would you do,
If I were you, and you were me?
They seemed intent on mayhem mad
Or maybe something even worse.
As I imagined just how bad,
A mother hit me with her purse.
“Get out the way, we’re comin’ through!”
She screamed from deep within her lungs.
She pushed a snot-nosed kid or two–
Why is youth wasted on the young?
I stumbled back on to the train
Not knowing how or even why.
Crushed flat beneath a press of flesh
I thought that I was going to die.
We rattled back towards the town
From whence I’d come when wide awake,
Squeezed tight so I could make no sound
Squashed flatter than sardine pancakes.
West Natick first, plain Natick next
By Wellesley Square I’d caught my breath.
“Excuse me,” I could finally say,
“I’m getting off, my stop is next.”
“This guy here thinks he’s getting off!”
A ghoulish fan saw fit to scoff,
And then a chilly chorus said,
“He didn’t say the magic word!”
I racked my brain both high and low,
Then left, then right and upside down.
What sound would cause the zombie hoard
To let me off at Wellesley town?
I couldn’t think, I had to beg,
“Please tell me,” I implored a girl.
“I’m really not too bad an egg,
If not the nicest in the world.”
She looked at me with deep brown eyes
That bore through me like fine drill bits
A loyal fan, quite undersized,
She’d brought along a catcher’s mitt.
Child of the Damned, in schoolgirl clothes,
A tartan kilt of blue and green;
She wore a pair of Mary Janes
Her brown locks tossed by breeze unseen.
“If you want to get off this train
In Wellesley Square, one stop away
You’ll have to say the magic word!
Or ride with us to Yawkey Way!”
I didn’t want to go that far, I’d rather
–if the truth be known–
Be sitting in my easy chair
And watch the stupid game at home.
She read my mind by ESP
The zombies then advanced on me.
“Just say the simple syllable
And we’ll ride on while you go free!”
My mouth was dry, no words would come
I guess you’d say I’d been struck dumb.
In fear I struck a fetal pose,
And on they came, as zombies come.
The little girl sank to the floor
Like Jolson, skidding on her knees,
And screamed “You silly nimmynot–
The word you need to say is ‘Please’!”

Hasseris Gymnasium, a development-oriented school located in the Danish city of Aalborg, employs approximately 100 staff to oversee more than 750 students. With a clear focus on talent development, the school offers a wide range of specially designed courses covering a range of topics, from science and social studies to the humanities. The idea is to encourage young learners to strive to be inquisitive thinkers and communicators, always with open minds. Additional emphasis is placed on being caring but also encouraging qualities such as risk-taking, balance, and reflection.
In short, Hasseris Gymnasium is not just a place to come and passively receive teaching before returning home. Indeed, there are also plenty of extracurricular leisure activities, where the school provides a framework for enjoyment and fun. Students are encouraged to investigate, collaborate, produce, and express themselves. Children can learn to play instruments, for example, or join a band. Alternatively, there are sports teams to join and a variety of related activities. Both inside the classroom and out-, this is an ideal environment for students to discover and develop themselves.
As part of the school’s mission to provide all students with a quality educational experience — one which allows them to achieve their full academic potential — technology has become a central teaching aid. Determined to become a leading school, providing students with a complete education, the school found that it needed to upgrade its network infrastructure to achieve its ambitious goals.
Hasseris Gymnasium
It's the same for schools as it is for every other organization: demand for connectivity keeps on growing. And over the last few years, providing teachers and students with instant network access — to online learning tools, approved web-based content, e-books, and assessments — has become as important as access to traditional textbooks. However, a large number of concurrent users surfing the Internet was beginning to strain the school's legacy network. Catering to more than 1500 individual wireless devices with plans to increase the figure to 2500 in the future, around 1000 devices were accessing the network every day — not including personal wireless devices — making a fast, reliable, and secure wireless network key to future growth.
The school's Information Technology (IT) team quickly recognized that it needed to replace the wired network with a next generation Wi-Fi 6 network that could excel, providing robust coverage across classrooms, auditoriums, and offices. In addition, IT staff hoped to simplify network management with cloud-based management, and make new service deployment far faster.
With a firm focus on ensuring an exceptional learning experience for every single student, Hasseris Gymnasium was determined to deploy an innovative solution that would provide safe connectivity and reliable coverage throughout its facilities. With a plan to use more cloud-based services and platforms in the future, the school needed network infrastructure that could also make this happen.
"Over the past nine years, we've been satisfied with hardware from another vendor," said Thomas Fogh Thomsen, IT Manager at Hasseris Gymnasium. "However, providing sufficient wireless coverage at the campus, especially during graduation ceremonies or other large gatherings in our venues, was a challenging experience. By 2020, we decided to replace our Local Area Network (LAN) infrastructure with Wi-Fi and strive for the concept of 'Wi-Fi first'."
The project began with a search for a high-end Wi-Fi solution, one that could implement real-time analysis and monitoring, automation, and intelligent Operations and Maintenance (O&M). The solution would also have to be able to deliver high-quality wireless services and enable increased performance across the board. After a thorough review of available products, the Gymnasium conducted Proof of Concept (PoC) tests to compare all mainstream vendors. "In February 2020, we completed several PoCs from a range of high-end Wi-Fi suppliers, but quickly settled on Huawei. For Hasseris Gymnasium in 2020, Wi-Fi is critical infrastructure, and with over 1500 devices online, we required network stability and speed. Huawei kick-started the project by putting themselves in our shoes," Mr. Fogh Thomsen said. "The team completed thorough PoC testing, which, in turn, made us feel absolutely safe about our solution choice."
With Huawei products having proven levels of performance, responsiveness, and customer-centricity, after several rounds of technical discussion, Hasseris Gymnasium decided on Huawei's CloudCampus Solution, powered by Huawei AirEngine Wi-Fi 6. CloudCampus offers several advantages, from fast deployment to simplified management and diverse advanced applications, helping customers develop core competitiveness for the cloud era.
The solution for the school includes Huawei AC6508, a small-capacity fixed wireless Access Controller (AC), AirEngine AP7060, a cutting-edge Wi-Fi 6 wireless Access Point (AP), and AirEngine 8760-X1-PRO, Huawei’s flagship Wi-Fi 6 indoor AP. The Gymnasium also paired this network equipment with Huawei CloudEngine S-Series campus switches. To help reduce both Operating Expenditure (OPEX) and O&M costs, the Huawei team also suggested iMaster NCE-Campus — Huawei's next-generation autonomous driving network management and control system for campus networks — which implements Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based network planning and deployment, supporting automated and intelligent network management and the provisioning of network services in mere minutes. This greatly simplifies network deployment and shortens network construction time. In addition, iMaster NCE-CampusInsight — a campus network analyzer — provides an excellent network service experience by analyzing each user's data at every moment, helping to troubleshoot network anomalies and optimize the network rapidly and in real-time.
Facing an increasing number of wireless users and growing demand, the Huawei CloudCampus Solution helped Hasseris Gymnasium build a one-stop network management center, powered by industry-leading cloud management architecture. With automated and intelligent network management, it's now far easier to check the network's current status and ensure network security. The school's IT team is also confident the system can be expanded with ease, to accommodate more students and school staff as required. This is particularly important considering the rapid growth the school has been enjoying and expects to in the future.
From smartphones to tablets and laptops, students can now access the network using a full range of devices from anywhere on campus, fostering collaboration between students and staff. And when the Gymnasium hosts gatherings and events, it can now rely on uninterrupted Wi-Fi access, even when crowds are dense. Indeed, an AirEngine Wi-Fi 6 solution is designed to work seamlessly during extreme traffic peaks, with one eye on future growth, whether that be an increase in the number of users or an expansion of the physical coverage area.
A wireless network brings with it campus-wide connectivity, with the flexibility to provide reliable access everywhere. It helps teachers to use Information and Communications Technology (ICT) to enrich their teaching. And it helps students do what students do best: learn, grow, and discover.

Washington D.C. 20560.!”.B.C. previously released their details on a 4 step reopening plan that slowly would ease pandemic restrictions. Travel restrictions around the province have recently been eased as a part of that plan. As well the rules relating to indoor dining and other activities have also been eased. More and more people are going out now to enjoy summer and travel around their communities and the province.
Cases have been dropping in Canada and the province, and B.C. officials say that they are comfortable with where things are going and with the reopening right now in general.
More than 1 million in B.C. fully vaccinated
There are more than 1 million people in B.C. who have already been vaccinated and more than 20% of the country overall that has been fully vaccinated up until this point. Still, officials have previously suggested that at least 75% vaccination is needed before the border might reopen fully for Canada.
They might not be ready to reopen the border just yet but they are ready to lift some border restrictions soon for some who are fully vaccinated.
Movie theaters in B.C. recently got the green light to reopen and now nightclubs in Vancouver and around the province will also be reopening. Casinos are going to be reopening too as a part of the next step in the 4-step B.C. reopening plan.
In Ontario there have been discussions about moving into their reopening a few days early now because of how well things have been going. Might B.C. do the same?
We can expect that step 3 of the 4 step B.C. reopening plan will begin on July 1 which is Canada Day and that this will be the earliest for right now that we might see the province move into that next phase. We have already met the 70% vaccination rate for that step to take place, more than 75% of individuals in B.C. have had their first dose already. And it looks as though case counts and hospitalizations are still low for B.C. too. That downward trend has continued.
However officials are still warning about the dangers of the disease still spreading through the community.
Alberta recently announced that they plan to reopen fully on July 1 and slowly things around Canada are taking a turn and beginning to make their way toward normal again, with an increasing number of restrictions being eased now.
People in B.C. and around Canada are ready to get back to normal, get out and visit friends, family, travel, and engage in their regular routines once more. To help them do that we will soon see B.C. make changes in allowing casinos and nightclubs to reopen and other pandemic restrictions to be eased.
Less than 2 weeks away from Step 3 of B.C. Reopening Plan
We are only a few days away from the next step in the B.C. reopening plan for 2021 that will see more restrictions being lifted. This means casinos are reopening and other changes are coming.
We can also expect a return to normal for indoor and both outdoor personal gatherings in the province, without any limits. Sleepovers can take place once again, we will see fairs and festivals (possibly PNE 2021!), as well there will be more capacity for indoor and outdoor organized gatherings. We will see this next step bring about no limits for groups at indoor or outdoor dining, liquor service restrictions to be lifted, and more. We will not see the next step come about for another several weeks.
When is the earliest we might see Step 4 of the B.C. reopening plan begin? September 7 2021
However, if we see Ontario or other areas reopen early then why not B.C. as well? If they meet their criteria for moving forward in their plan then what reason is there to keep things closed? That is what some have been asking. We will have to wait and see how B.C. navigates the remaining steps of their 4 step reopening plan for this year. For now we are already well underway with that plan and moving on it looks like to step 3 coming soon.Ghent University PhD Scholarships 2022 in Belgium present a fantastic opportunity for students who are looking to study abroad.

Item CUP201The distinct novel of the caul is told by, to, and about, those supernaturally. So to whom it may concern, the energy will automatically resonate.
What is read from the title down to each and every paragraph is an autobiographical chronicle, chronicling the autobiography of a life not published for a mainstream audience.
As one born of the caul the experience is an individual chapter into the pages of a book written especially for the author.
It’s controversial when the lessons and so called facts taught and explained within society is highly contradicted by the mysteries of the unknown.
Connections through out the universe and outer scope are closer linked than one would imagine.
Vibration has a tendency to envelope us within the reality of truth in a way that allows our senses to remarkably interpret the things we intangibly hear, see, taste, feel, know, and inevitably discern.
In the instance of serious preternatural faculty the capacity is not measured by who’s life story one is able to look into or not look into, it is measured by the degree as to where, and how far one is able to view, and to look into life, and into creation.
I can account, and attest to the gravity in which a true caul birth holds, and denotes.
The sense of one having existed before or already having a familiarity with the encounters and the experiences within life on this plane or beyond is the connection and revelation to a life force and energy reflecting back to one’s very own actual state of being.
The circumstance of encompassing intense spiritual propensity is not only a connection to the otherworldly, it is the essence of life itself, to literally walk in spirit.
There is so much more to the nature of being born with a caul than just seeing visions and intuitively delving into the past, present, and future, through extra sensory perceptive ability.
We must heed and follow in accordance to the instruction and guidance within the knowledge naturally learned and granted to us through extraordinary faculty.
Yes, it is who some of us are, but it is also, what some of us are also liable for, due to the nature of the fortunate advantage we were born under.
To possess extreme spiritual propensity is a deep spiritual responsibility.

There are three parts to our May Day event: the Parade, the Tree of Life Ceremony, and a Festival in Powderhorn Park. We caught the tail end of the parade, part of the ceremony and the festival.
The theme this year is – What You Feed Grows – it’s all about love. There were the usual actors for the ceremony – the red boats that cross the river, the gods and goddesses with some new ones including my new favorite pink birds. It’s amazing to see the work that folks do in creating their costumes.
May Day is an ancient holiday – going back to 29 BC and possibly before. It was originally a festival of flowers, which makes sense given the spring timing. In more modern time the May Day was associated with the May Pole or even with the religious ceremonies crowning Mary, the mother of Jesus. I can remember collecting lilacs and doing a march for Mary at some of my schools as a kid. In the last 19th century, the Socialists decided to make May Day International Workers’ Day. So there’s also a historical tie to Socialism.
The Powderhorn Park version of the holiday is heavy on celebrating spring, socialism and opportunities for inclusive approaches to life and politics. The parade includes floats and puppets that carry the theme – as well as a host of supportive/supported groups. The Women’s March marched. And many candidates march. The festival includes music, food, and booths from various organizations. The ceremony happens on the shore of the lake, featuring characters from the parade, and culminates with the giant sun coming by boat to the shore.Ancient Magic Machine Soldier, Aqua Knight, Automata, Inventor, Puppeteer, Rocket Trooper, Sapper, and Steam Knight classes.

AGREEN BAY – General Manager Brian Gutekunst made two things very clear about the trades he made Tuesday at the NFL's trading deadline, sending safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix and running back Ty Montgomery to other teams for draft picks.
They were performance-based decisions, and they're in no way any indication the Packers aren't committed to winning in 2018.
"Performance comes first. That's always the major factor in these decisions," Gutekunst said Wednesday morning, without saying Clinton-Dix had not resumed his Pro Bowl form from 2016 and that Montgomery's fumble with two minutes left last Sunday against the Rams was the lowlight of a disappointing season for the fourth-year player.
"I'm really excited about our team. I think we're humming at just the right time. We have some challenges ahead of us, but I'm really excited about where this team is headed."
Gutekunst also downplayed the notion the moves were about cleaning out potential problems in the locker room, though he did say everything is taken into consideration.
Clinton-Dix in recent weeks had expressed that he likely wouldn't be back with the Packers next year. He's currently playing out the fifth-year option on his rookie contract. Montgomery's words Monday about not trusting teammates who questioned the motives behind his decision to run the fateful kickoff out of the end zone are the types of comments rarely heard in Green Bay.
"I'm not really into sending messages to the locker room," Gutekunst said. "Anybody who's ever played in the NFL understands it's a performance business, and if you don't perform there will be consequences.
"We've had some inconsistent moments. We've been up and down, but we've had some really good moments and I like the way we're trending. I like the way we're coming together. I like the way the locker room is coming together."
More roster moves are coming, because the Packers will need a third running back. The secondary is now thinner at safety, but the team's best depth is at cornerback, so there are in-house resources.
Head Coach Mike McCarthy emphasized that Clinton-Dix's departure opens the door for other players to seize an increased role. That includes safeties Kentrell Brice and Jermaine Whitehead, who have played a lot already, and second-year pro Josh Jones, who has been relegated mostly to special teams.
McCarthy wasn't going to give this week's opponent, the New England Patriots, any advanced hints as to how the defense will line up Sunday night, suggesting other options at the safety position could be on the table as well.
"I think it's obvious the way we play on defense, we have multiple personnel groups," McCarthy said. "What's most important is to the players that now have an opportunity. I'm excited to see these guys step up."
Receiver Trevor Davis is a candidate to come off injured reserve to help the return game, but Gutekunst did not confirm that would happen. He does expect the roster to be back to a full 53 players by the end of the week.
"Our locker room knows where we're headed," Gutekunst said, also emphasizing the communication with the coaching staff has been constant throughout the process.
"You're always going to see some inconsistencies before your team settles in to what it's going to be. I think we're getting close to that."
As if anyone needs to know what's next, it's the Patriots, on the road, in prime time, Tom Brady vs. Aaron Rodgers, and a chance to prove what Gutekunst is saying – that taking the unbeaten Rams to the wire and coming up just short is a better indication of who the 2018 Packers are than the roller coaster the team rode through the first six games before the bye.
"It was a different Tuesday for us as a staff, having that going on in the middle of game-planning," McCarthy said of the trades. "But we're about the Patriots right now. It's a big game."decision for everything to happen all on the same day, ‘don’t make too many big changes at once’ and all that, but it do be like that sometimes.
The ironic thing is, I absolutely hate change. I’m terrible with it. Along with like 78% of the population (at a guesstimate). For one, I got my first ever MacBook last year and I still haven’t learned how to use it properly. I’m also very awful with every diet or trend I take part in… It never lasts longer than a few days, but that’s because I like things the way they are. It’s the same reason I’ve known many of my close friends for 10+ years. Why reinvent the wheel when I’ve got the best set already, y’know?
But sometimes change needs to happen. Sometimes you need to make new friends; get a new job; or try a new type of shampoo that doesn’t give you a dry scalp. There’s a lot of change that will happen every day, because without change we’d all be very very bored. And have itchy scalps. So why do we hate change so bloody much?
We’re Creatures of Habit
We are beings that go through much of life using habits deeply engrained in our heads: making a cup of tea; mindlessly walking to the kitchen and opening the fridge; driving along thinking about life and suddenly discovering you’ve arrived at work… We are quite literally ‘creatures of habit’. These habits are great for a spot of multi-tasking, but can be quite irritating when you want to give one up, like smoking, for example. The habit is so deep rooted that it can be very difficult to break free.
“The chains of habit are too weak to be felt until they are too strong to be broken.” – Samuel Johnson
And habits can appear in many areas of life. This is why some people will go back to awful relationships again and again, because your brain has picked up that habit of going for shitty people. Not what you want really.
Feelings of Uncertainty
Uncertainty of the future is another reason we may not want to make changes in life: why would I give up my stable career as an accountant to become an artist? Taking that leap is very fucking scary, because who knows what’s behind each door.
But the thing is, anything in life is a gamble: you could lose your ‘stable’ job tomorrow, whereas that art career you daydream about could make you millions.
Not Wanting to Admit You’re Wrong
The feeling that you’re always in the right is a very common one; only a handful of us actually are always right. But that feeling, and then not wanting to admit we’re wrong, can be a reason for not changing when maybe it is necessary.
This professional development blog takes this further, and hits the nail on the head:
“Psychologically speaking, [people] genuinely believe what they’ve been doing, and how they’ve been doing it is the best possible way to do it… And the longer they’ve been doing it this way, the better, more efficient, more economical, etc., it is (or so they believe)”.
So we don’t like change because we don’t want to admit that we’ve been doing things wrong this whole time? Yeah sounds about right. That’s why people will stay in jobs they absolutely hate, or working on big expensive loft conversions that turn out to be a terrible idea. The projects never come up cheaper than expected (we’ve all seen Grand Designs) which can lead to fuelling unnecessary time and money into something. It’s less scary than admitting they were wrong the whole time.
Having to Put Some Effort in
“Order from some place else” Carries tells Miranda in Sex and the City, when she finds herself having an issue with her usual takeaway. “But this place is my favourite,” Miranda tells Carrie, “I like their cold noodles… And it’s easier than figuring out where else to go.”
Keeping things the way they are always feels like the easiest option, because it requires no effort. It can be a real inconvenience putting that effort in; whether that be discovering your life’s great passion, or finding a new hairdresser. Both can be equally as annoying.
It doesn’t matter what the issue is, it’s far easier to bob along keeping things as they are than make a change. It requires far more effort to figure out what’s actually best for you. I think it’s a hugely overlooked, yet relevant point in the discussion of humans disliking change. And something an ex-lazy person like myself really notices.
The reason I no longer consider myself a lazy person, is that as soon as I started putting some effort into life, I realise the impact it has on… Well, life… And now here I am making a million changed to everything.
Can We Learn to Love Change?
We need to tell ourselves why the change is good. Take that leap of faith, stop giving a shit what others think of you and get off your damn arse and make that bloody change! Do you feel motivated yet?
We can all change really, and it isn’t so bad. And we all know that deep down, because we are constantly making little changes every day… Even just trying a new brand of sausages.
In fact, over the past few months, more or less everyone on the planet has had to alter the way they do life due to the pandemic. We’ve shifted the way we socialise; the way we exercise; even the way we do our weekly shops. If we can change every part of our life to fit around a global pandemic, we can certainly change areas of life to make for a happier existence.
I sit here, a month on from my break up and I’m making friends at a new job; planning the layout of my new house and writing this post on my lovely MacBook… It’s clear that change is pretty good for us sometimes. And that we can totally learn to love it.
Thanks for reading!
2 thoughts on “Why do We Hate Change?”
I hate change too, for many of the same reasons you’ve mentioned above. Although it’s difficult, we have to remember that change only lasts for a little while before it becomes the new normal.
Oh my god this speaks to me. I hate change! But I’ve also been trying to make positive changes recently and reaping the benefits.SHAIcon | Fiza Pirani: Writer, Artist, Entrepreneur
We're so excited to introduce our SHAIcon series, where we spotlight inspiring figures who are defining culture on their terms and making the world a better place by doing so.
Our first SHAIcon is Fiza Pirani, a journalistic force, mental health advocate, and talented artist (talk about a triple threat). Fiza is the founder of Foreign Bodies, a mental health storytelling newsletter centering immigrants, refugees, and diasporas. She is also an award-winning freelance journalist, as well as a watercolor + ink artist, showcasing her work on Doodles by Fiza.
Fiza purchased our Inshadycompany Green Bandhani Cap and it served as her muse for this gorgeous painting:
We were touched and honored that she drew inspiration from one of our pieces. It takes courage to put your creative work out there for the world to see, and Fiza's vulnerability is a strength that fuels her career and empowers others. Learn more about Fiza in our interview with her below!
What made you decide to launch Foreign Bodies and Doodles by Fiza? What's your mission behind these endeavors?
First of all, thanks so much for the lovely introduction! I am such a fan of SHAI and the delicate, thoughtful selections and collaborations you're bringing to the world.
I launched Foreign Bodies in 2018 when I was awarded a reporting fellowship with The Carter Center. Originally, the plan was to publish a couple of news stories in my local newspaper, where I was a staffer, but as I began reporting, I realized that to address all of the conversations I kept having around the immigrant experience and mental illness, I needed to have a space that was unapologetic, candid and intimate. Around that time, email newsletters were making sort of a comeback. It felt like the ideal medium to foster a safe space for sensitive issues that didn't feel too confrontational. Foreign Bodies has really grown since 2018, and it means the world to me to be able to spend so much time on a subject dear to my heart with a mission to help de-stigmatize pain, vulnerability and mental illness across marginalized communities through the power of storytelling.
Doodles by Fiza, on the other hand, started with random sketching in notebooks when I was on bedrest following a spine/nerve injury that made it difficult for me to sit up and write. Obviously, I'm a writer by profession! So not being able to really work at my full potential was devastating. To get my thoughts onto paper, I started doodling with ink while in bed and posting on my personal newsletter, fiza's word vomit. Once my injury improved with physical therapy and aquatherapy, I found myself picking up watercolors and sticking with the evening ritual of doodling and painting. Now, I commission 1-3 custom pieces a month based on my availability and sell select original works (and prints!) to help support my writing endeavors, from Foreign Bodies to novel writing, magazine submission fees and everything else in between. It is primarily a project to help me unwind when life gets to be too overwhelming, but getting to share my creations with the world is incredibly fulfilling.
Is it difficult balancing multiple lines of work, or do they feed off each other?
Creative labor really does feel so mystifying, doesn't it? I mean, it's impossible to say these projects don't feed off of each other, because while the tools I'm using vary by medium, I'm bringing the same kind of energy wherever I go. Those tools—whether it's a paintbrush or a keyboard or a pen or a recorder—just complement the product. That being said, I kind of thrive in the mish-mash and the chaos. Creating is my full-time job. And creating can get messy. Rarely does it involve only a blank canvas or page.
When I was working full-time in a newsroom, balancing Foreign Bodies or other creative work on top of a job in a highly toxic industry (at least for many young journalists of color) felt impossible and it was certainly proving harmful to my own mental health. But since I decided to go independent with journalism—a choice rooted in privilege—I've found so much comfort in the endless possibilities of creative labor.

Most of my friends and acquaintances already knew I was a journalist, and the reporting fellowship with The Carter Center added a layer of mentorship and credibility, I believe, to my work on Foreign Bodies. At first, I just asked my friends and family to offer feedback, and once I felt comfortable, I began promoting each free newsletter issue on my own Twitter and Facebook accounts.
When I quit my full-time job, I began dedicating more time to social media promotion and even added a paying subscriber option that went beyond the monthly issues (weekly roundups + discussions!). I also work with immigrant and diaspora authors on exclusive book giveaways for subscribers, and that's really expanded my literary network. Foreign Bodies is, after all, primarily about healing through storytelling. I realized the more time I spent on creating quality content that was truly authentic, the more new readers gravitated toward Foreign Bodies.
Substack has also been an incredible platform to work on. I've never seen a tech company so aggressively partner with and amplify independent creatives. I'm excited to be a mentor for its first writer's mentorship program this year!
What goes into producing a single newsletter?
The monthly(ish) newsletter issue is topped off with a personal essay on a particular immigrant experience, followed by research on its connection to mental health and well-being. It features resources and insights, a compilation of additional #relatable stories, plus expert Q&As and dog pics of my rescue pup, Lady. These issues require about ~20 hours of often unpaid labor, from initial brainstorming and outlining, collaboration, interviewing, researching, writing, editing and art. And more editing! It's more work than I can usually financially afford during a global pandemic, which is why, for now, I've decided to publish once every few months to ensure I can pay any volunteer copy editors/illustrator for their work without drowning!
The exclusive weekly roundup issues for subscribers, which are so fun to put together, involve about ~3-4 hours of labor each, and much of that time is spent reading beautiful personal storytelling from indie publications and finding the latest news on the intersection of immigration x mental health. These roundups also include writing opportunities, shout-outs, resources, community updates and more.
Do you do custom orders? If so, what sort of custom requests have you received?
Yes! I do about 1-3 custom Doodles by Fiza orders per month, depending on how many reporting deadlines I have. So far, I've commissioned lots of pet portraits and a handful of family portraits. Some requests have moved me to tears, too. I recently painted a portrait for someone who lost a loved one and, for a friend's wedding gift to her fiancé, I painted an abstract landscape of their outdoor wedding venue. The best part of these custom orders is working directly with the client. I put together a contract and ask about favorite colors, vibes etc. to ensure the piece really speaks to them. It's so, so fun.
What made you want to paint our Inshadycompany Green Bandhani Cap?
I'm obsessed with my Inshadycompany Green Bandhani Cap! It's funny, I'm actually not much of a hat person, but I wear this...almost every week? And my grandparents love it, too. I wanted to paint this product because it truly brings me joy to hold and wear. And as someone who doesn't really enjoy shopping for and wearing South Asian attire but *adores* the intricate, traditional patterns of the cultures, I felt it was an appropriate way to show my appreciation.
What else has been inspiring you lately?
I'm an avid reader, so books are always inspiring me in all my creative endeavors! My recent reads include A Burning by Megha Majumdar, which is set in present-day India, and Raven Leilani's incredible debut novel, Luster. I'm also constantly inspired by the changing leaves, walks in the park and when the pool water is just warm enough for a quick dip.

The Bell Brothers Piano Company was established around 1915 in Muncie, Indiana. The firm was known for building very good quality pianos, and they were widely distributed throughout the Midwestern United States. In addition to the Bell Brothers name, the firm built pianos under the Deterling and Merriman brand names. Deterling and Merriman were sold as affordable alternatives to the costlier Bell Brothers brand, while offering comparable quality. The Bell Brothers Piano Company was out of business before 1930 due to the Great Depression.

The RNPIA-2021 conference is organized by Future Africa, University of Pretoria in collaboration with Makerere University and this year’s theme is “Advancing Africa’s Natural Products Industry through Transdisciplinarity and Sustainable Innovations”.
Climate change, biodiversity and ecosystem loss, low resilience to natural disasters, potential non achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), energy crisis, limited benefits from globalization, disease and poverty are the major challenges facing the Natural products industry in Africa. Nonetheless, the richness of Africa’s biodiversity offers us valuable opportunities to preserve this wealth by pursuing new routes to sustainable processes and products. However, the concept of natural products industry is still in its infancy in many African countries. Thus, RNPIA-2021 is a technical meeting designed to host scientists and professionals from around Africa to discuss the latest state-of-art technologies, products and solutions used in the Natural products industry. This event will offer scholars, practitioners in industry, non-governmental organizations, and policymakers an excellent opportunity to meet and network with high-ranking officials and top-tier leaders from academia and industry.
We have an exciting program to include comprehensive coverage of current and future trends in the Natural products industry. The technical programme will feature graduate student presentations (Hons, Masters and PhD), early career researchers’ presentations, keynote sessions, poster sessions, exhibition sessions, plenary sessions, industry, and senior level presentations. The three-day event is packed with in-depth technical content focused on: drug discovery and drug design, natural products chemistry, cosmeceuticals, nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals, ethnoveterinary medicine (applications and practices), intellectual property and permits, pharmaceutical market in Africa, gender and conservation, climate change, policy and governance.
We are confident that you will find the RNPIA-2021 conference both valuable and enjoyable.
Thank you all for joining us.

we have an older woman whom does not have a mic or camera on her older desktop. She can see us but can’t hear us and she had her speaker turned high. Is there a way for her to hear us even though she doesn’t have a mic? If so what does she need to do on her desktop to hear the rest of the group?
Thank you Mrs Geek. We have another meeting on Monday 13th and she would like to attend.
So sorry, I didn’t see this message, and your meeting was yesterday.
She should be able to hear you thru her computer speakers even though you can’t hear her. Not sure why she doesn’t. When she first joins, there should be a screen to test sound – one button for testing speakers, another for testing microphone. If she clicks to test speakers and she doesn’t hear, she should see some suggestions as to what to do. If she has earbuds, or some other kind of headset, she can choose those from the Sound Settings button:
If you still need help, my suggestion would be for her to join using a telephone – not a smartphone (although if she has one, that would be best) a regular old telephone can call in to a meeting and she will hear you and you will hear her.

Thanks, Mrs. Geek, she stated she still wasn’t able to get the sound; however, I ‘m not sure she did everything correct. I may have to go there and try to figure it out. She probably wouldn’t want to do the phone and I think the Meeting Host would have to set that up ahead of time???
Question for you….Is there a way for me to check this out without being on a meeting. It doesn’t appear you can set anything up by just logging in to your account???? Like I would like to put a background on mine, but I don’t see a way I can do it, unless I’m in a meeting or conducting a meeting and I don’t want to do that.
As always, thanks for your help.
Al,
RE her sound: I haven’t actually used the call in by phone option but I don’t think there’s anything that has to be set up beforehand. The host does need a paid Zoom account. Check out Zoom’s support page for Join meeting with phone.
As for checking things out – yes, you do have to be in a meeting. If you have an account, from the web interface you can just click Host a Meeting – with video on. And, voila, you’re in a meeting. From the app, just click the New Meeting button and you will find youself in an instant meeting. then you can try out a virtual background.
Let me know how it goes
Just wanted to add an extra comment here because it has come up with other people.
When Zoom gives a number for “Call in by phone” they’re talking about a dumb phone. If you have a smartphone, you use the meeting link just like you would on a computer. There is a Zoom app for both Android and iOS.

Back home in your kitchen you start cooking following the recipe step-by-step. It should be perfect but it’s not. There’s too much liquid in the cake batter, not enough flavor in the soup and despite the amount of time cited for cooking the duck, it’s done and getting dry in half the time. In other words, the meal is a mess. That’s one reason why Ina Garten, the Barefoot Contessa of TV and cookbook fame, has always been one of my favorites. And so I was glad when my friend Carrie Bachman, who is a cookbook publicist in New York, told me she was representing Barefoot Contessa Foolproof: Recipes You Can Trust (Clarkson Potter 2012; $35).
“People look at a recipe and think if you just follow it, it’ll come out perfectly every time,” says Garten, who interestingly, majored in economics in college. “But every time you make something, the ingredients are a little different or you have another way you want to try it. So it’s a lot like driving a car; you have to make small adjustments along the way.”
That’s why Garten often tests each of her recipes 25 times and also has an assistant try them as well. She wants those who watch her shows or buy her cookbooks to always a meal they’re proud to serve and, even better, enjoy eating. Indeed, Garten wants her recipes to be foolproof.
“I want recipes that I know will come out perfectly every time,” says Garten who is also now blogging at. “Cooking is hard, it takes a lot of ingredients, you go shopping, you cook, you clean up. a lot of ingredients, you go shopping, you cook, you clean up. You can get free recipes anywhere, so why should anyone want to buy a cookbook? What makes it worthwhile and worth the price? It’s the level of confidence in the writer. One of the things I’ve always strived for is recipes that work every time. You feel confident that this recipe is good, but also that you trust it.”
