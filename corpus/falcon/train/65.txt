Errol
Errol is a Force affinity legendary from the Sacred Order. Errol is an out and out Arena champion with an ability to wipe out a single target easily with his A2 or his A3.
The issue with Errol is a lack of survivability to go alongside his nuke, you really need to play him alongside champions that can veil him or revive him to make real use. Strategies such as Cardinal full team revive and turn meter boost to let him nuke another person.
Remember each skill has 30% more chance to crit therefore you can comfortably build him with 70% crit rate.

New Delhi: The central government on Friday (May 28) said that reports claiming Bharat Biotech producing 6 crore Covaxin doses per month are false. It said that such production capacity would be achieved by July.
The Centre further said that the production would reach nearly 10 crore doses per month by September.
“There have been some unfound media reports on unaccounted vaccine doses of Bharat Biotech. These reports are incorrect and are not supported by full information on the matter,” the Centre said in a statement.
“The claims of Bharat Biotech having 6 crore doses is an error of comprehension among some quarters reporting the said matter,” it added.
,” the government said, adding, “It is expected to reach nearly 10 crore doses per month by September 2021.”
The government said that as of May 28, Bharat Biotech has supplied 2,76,66,860 vaccine doses to it.

Inspired by National Science Week 2021, this month we’re sinking our teeth into research on the theme: “Food: Different by Design”. From tracking where our food comes from, to engineering solutions to problem pests; utilising land and energy for food, and keeping you safe.
>>IMAGE<<.The New Orleans Saints will be without Pro Bowl kicker Wil Lutz for the remainder of the season.
Lutz, who had been designated to return from injured reserve last week, announced on social media that he had a setback during his recovery from core muscle surgery and has to “shut it down” for the rest Saints team that was finally starting to get healthy after missing eight starters for most of the first five games this season.
The Saints will now stick with undrafted rookie kicker Brian Johnson, whom they just signed off the Chicago Bears‘ practice squad two weeks ago. Johnson made both of his field goal attempts in wet and windy conditions Monday night at Seattle — including the go-ahead 33-yarder in the final two minutes of New Orleans’ 13-10 victory over the Seahawks.
Johnson is the fourth kicker the Saints have used since Lutz had surgery in the preseason. The Saints made just 1 of 4 field goal attempts in the first five weeks (all by Aldrick Rosas), and Cody Parkey also missed two extra points.
When Johnson was asked after Monday’s game what his thought process was in a clutch situation in nasty weather in front of a hostile crowd, he said, “Not to think about any of those things. Not to overthink things, just to go out there and do what I’ve done plenty of times before.”
Lutz has made 86.6% of his field goal attempts in his five-year career, making the Pro Bowl in 2019.Dear Radhika Ma’am I am very grateful to you for the right guidance you provided for my UCAT preparation.

Short summary
Global mean sea level change observed from 1993 to 2016 (at a mean rate of 3.05 mm per year) matches the combined effect of changes in water density (thermal expansion) and ocean mass. Ocean mass change is assessed through the contributions from glaciers, ice sheets and land water storage or directly from satellite data since 2003. Our budget assessments of linear trends and monthly anomalies utilise new datasets and uncertainty characterisations developed within ESA's Climate Change Initiative.

Black carbon (BC), an aerosol that contributes to glacier melt, is important for central Himalayan hydrology because glaciers are a water source to rivers that affect 25 % of the global population in Southeast Asia. Using the Dasuopu ice core (1781–1992 CE), we find that drought-associated biomass burning is an important source of BC to the central Himalaya over a period of months to years and that hemispheric changes in atmospheric circulation influence BC deposition over longer periods..

This work indicates all glaciers in the Pamir that surged between 1988 and 2018 as revealed by different remote sensing data, mainly Landsat imagery. We found ~ 200 surging glaciers for the entire mountain range and detected the minimum and maximum extents of most of them. The smallest surging glacier is ~ 0.3 km2. This inventory is important for further research on the surging behaviour of glaciers and has to be considered when processing glacier changes (mass, area) of the region.

Energy consumption in Asia has substantially risen since 1970, leading to increased levels of air pollution, which can have severe impacts on human health and the environment. We present the first continuous ice-core record of toxic trace metals that covers 1971–2015. This new record from the Guliya ice cap in northwestern Tibet shows that Pb, Cd, Zn, and Ni, emitted mostly from fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning in South Asia, have reached the remote, high-altitude glacier since 1990..

A glacier inventory of the AP (63°–70° S), consisting of glacier outlines accompanied by glacier-specific parameters (i.e., elevation distribution, slope, aspect, thickness and volume), was achieved by digitally combining already-existing data sets. This resulted in 1589 glaciers, covering an area of 95 273 km2. These freely available data provide new insights into AP glaciers, their behavior in response to a changing climate and their corresponding contribution to sea level rise...

We present and compare different geostatistical methods for underglacial bedrock interpolation. Variogram-based interpolations are compared with a multipoint statistics approach on both test cases and real glaciers. Using the modeled bedrock, the ice volume for the Scex Rouge and Tsanfleuron glaciers (Swiss Alps) was estimated to be 113.9 ± 1.6 million cubic meters. Complex karstic geomorphological features are reproduced and can be used to improve the precision of underglacial flow estimation..

Recently, discussions have focused on the difference in limiting the increase in global average temperatures to below 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 °C compared to preindustrial levels. Here, we assess the impacts that such different scenarios would have on both the future evolution of glaciers in the European Alps and the water resources they provide. Our results show that the different temperature targets have important implications for the changes predicted until 2100.

Glacier centerlines are crucial input for many glaciological applications. We propose a new algorithm to derive glacier centerlines and implement the corresponding program in Python language. Application of this method to 48 571 glaciers in the second Chinese glacier inventory automatically yielded the corresponding glacier centerlines with an average computing time of 20.96 s, a success rate of 100 % and a comprehensive accuracy of 94.34 %.

Glaciers and ice caps are currently the largest contributor to sea level rise. Global monitoring of these regions is a challenging task, and significant differences remain between current estimates. This study looks at glacier changes in High Mountain Asia and the Gulf of Alaska using a new technique, which for the first time makes the use of satellite radar altimetry for mapping ice mass loss over mountain glacier regions possible..

Among mountainous permafrost landforms, rock glaciers are composed of boulders, fine frozen materials, water and ice in various proportions. Displacement rates of active rock glaciers can reach several m/yr, contributing to emerging risks linked to gravitational hazards. Thanks to passive seismic monitoring, resonance effects related to seasonal freeze–thawing processes of the shallower layers have been monitored and modeled. This method is an accurate tool for studying rock glaciers at depth..

It is commonly assumed that a present population is a descendent of a small number of specific sequences called founders. The recombination process consists in given two equal length sequences, generates a third sequence of the same length by concatenating the prefix of one sequence with the suffix of the other sequence. Due to recombination, a present sequence (called a recombinant) is thus composed of blocks from the founders. A major question related to founder sequences is the so-called Minimum Mosaic problem: using the natural parsimony criterion for the number of recombinations, find the "best" founders. In this article, we prove that the Minimum Mosaic problem given haplotype recombinants with no missing values is NP-hard when the number of founders is given as part of the input and propose some exact exponential-time algorithms for the problem, which can be considered polynomial provided some extra information. Notice that Rastas and Ukkonen proved that the Minimum Mosaic problem is NP-hard using a somewhat unrealistic mutation cost function. The aim of this paper is to provide a better complexity insight of the problem.

Over the years, Flume has grown to be quite the legend with an outrageous fanbase. Also known as Harley Edward Streten, he is known for his distinct and atmospheric sound inspired by house and UK garage. He stole the hearts of many with his first EP in 2011, Sleepless, his solo album titled FLUME the following year, and blew everyone away with his 2016 album that was long awaited, Skin.
While his fans go crazy over his music, do they ever wonder what the man himself listens to? I sure do, and Flume has created an essentials playlist on Spotify titled ‘Beats and Things’ so his fans can take a peek at what he’s got playing in his headphones.
Flume currently has 13 tracks on the playlist that all span a wide variety of genres inside and out of dance music. From Hermitude to J Dilla, Flume’s taste in music is vast. He recently shared on his twitter that he had updated the playlist with some of his favorite’s from over the years.
While Flume himself has inspired many with his own music, his fans now have the opportunity to listen to the music that inspires Flume. Flume definitely has a unique, and what some might call strange in a good way, sound to his music, and I think it’s safe to say that he’s into listening to the same style. Stay tuned with Flume on his twitter for more playlist updates.

Description of original award (Fiscal Year 2010, $219,159) City of Norwalk, CT will build on its community-based anti-gang initiative including its experience in successfully establishing the Norwalk Juvenile Review Board (JRB) through a 2008 Gang Prevention Coordination Assistance Program grant from OJJDP and implementing the Gang Prevention Assistance Mentoring Program through an OJJDP grant in 2009. The City's Youth Services Bureau will replicate the Aggression Replacement Training (ART) Program due to the number of youth we see through the JRB and Gang Prevention programs who display anger and aggressive behavior. ART will complement the existing Gang Prevention programs by providing a needed service.The target population for ART will be youth ages 10-17 who demonstrate characteristics that could lead to gang involvement. The project goal is to reduce the impact of youth gangs in Norwalk. The objectives are to reduce delinquency and gang activity; improve coordination, planning, and development; improve prevention/intervention program activities by enrolling 260 youth in Aggression Replacement Training and reduce violent gang-related incidents in the target area. Staff will conduct an evaluation of quantitative, qualitative, and process outcomes at both project midpoint and project end. The evaluation will be based on the performance measures as well as the program objectives.

“Home windows 10, model 21H1, is now out there for business prospects to start function exploration and validation previous to being launched for common availability,” Aria Carley, senior program supervisor, wrote in a March 18 post to a company blog.
Microsoft has not but divulged a launch date for Home windows 10 21H1, the yr’s first function improve, as famous by the H1 — for first-half — designation. Nevertheless, a month in the past, the Redmond, Wash. developer implied that, not like in years previous, the spring refresh could be a minor improve, one with few if any new options and little new performance.
Carley’s submit confirmed that.
“Model 21H1 might be delivered to gadgets at present working Home windows 10, model 2004 or model 20H2 utilizing an enablement bundle,” she stated. “This is similar expertise we used to replace gadgets from Home windows 10, model 2004 to model 20H2.”
The enablement bundle Carley talked about was the tip-off, as that small code fragment is what remodeled Home windows 10 2004 into 20H2 final yr. That was attainable as a result of 20H2 was nearly the identical as 2004 as launched and precisely the identical as 2004 by the point 20H2 was to debut.
(Confused? Microsoft constructed Home windows 10 21H1 by taking October’s 20H2, collected every part that modified from that time on — these modifications had been issued within the month-to-month updates since October — and added a handful of recent options. Voilà: Home windows 10 21H1. Microsoft delivers these minor upgrades by means of the same old Home windows Replace/WIndows Replace for Enterprise/WSUS channels because the month-to-month cumulative replace. The enablement bundle is actually a command given to Home windows to “change on” the brand new model, because the code for it’s already onboard.)
As a result of Home windows 10 21H1 is the second minor improve in a row, the enablement bundle mechanism works on all PCs working Home windows 10 20H2 or 2004. These enterprise methods working earlier variations of Home windows 10 should obtain all the OS to achieve 21H1. (That, too, might be out there, both as a manual download in .iso disk image format or by means of WSUS.)
WSUS (Home windows Server Replace Companies) customers can deploy the 21H1 pre-release replace after synchronizing the “Home windows Insider Preview” class.
That is additionally the second replace working that Microsoft has explicitly informed business prospects to begin placing the model by means of the testing wringer. Final yr, Microsoft made the same “commercial pre-release validation” announcement for Home windows 10 20H2 precisely two months earlier than it unveiled the so-called improve to the general public. It seems that Microsoft has determined so as to add this announcement to the servicing course of when it is making ready to concern a minor improve.
If Microsoft hews to the timetable of 2020 — announcement made two months previous to launch — it’s going to launch Home windows 10 21H2 within the third week of Could, maybe Could 20 or Could 21.
Mockingly, Microsoft’s declaration of open testing of Home windows 10 21H1 might fail to maneuver company IT personnel; the spring replace, regardless of whether or not main or minor, comes with solely 18 months of help, a yr shy of the 30 months awarded by every fall’s refresh to the Home windows 10 Enterprise and Schooling SKUs (stock-keeping items). Spring updates are, merely put, second class, and organizations are unlikely to trouble deploying 21H1 except pressured to by circumstances, similar to proudly owning methods set to exhaust help within the subsequent seven or eight months.
With a Could launch of Home windows 10 21H1 nearly sure, the model ought to obtain help till Dec. 13, 2022.Human validation!

Culture-Castle
This castle was used in the Game of Thrones series. Though there are payable tickets to walk it, the steps are not for the fainthearted. I also heard that it gets quite busy along the narrow walk. Because I wanted to save time on the walk and more importantly, get some birds eye view photographs, I chose to follow the lesser known and short footpath to a great view point. It is reached by walking past the restaurant, Eneperi and passed its car park (not towards the ticket entrance for the steps) along the road, Gibelorratzagako San Pelaio Auzoa and you'll see a slightly trodden short path (pic 1) - the terrain is fine, (but wear trainers/flats) and don't let small children/pets run ahead of you as it does not have much in the way of barriers.

ReviewsIt’s election season (duh), and as is often the case, a few Colorado breweries plan to get in on the action with election-related beers, votes and contests. The first to jump into the fray is Kirin-owned New Belgium Brewing, which wants the public to vote for the first Voodoo Ranger IPA rotator of 2021. To help decide, New Belgium has laid out various qualities of the candidates, such as character, personality traits and tasting notes, but the brewery also sent versions of both beers to the media, to try to get some early influence going.
The candidates: 1) Agent 77 IPA was brewed with Nelson Sauvin and Galaxy hops “to create a fruity and floral IPA that’s as charismatic as it is citrusy,” the brewery says, while 2) Captain Dynamite IPA is locked, stocked and fully hopped with Mosaic, Simcoe and Cascade hops to provide tropical flavors and aromas.
From my perspective, the “tropical notes” in Captain Dynamite were extremely muted, which is often the case with New Belgium’s subtly flavored beers. Agent 77, on the other hand, tasted more like an IPA (West Coast style) with the hop characteristics fully born out. So there you go.
Voodoo Ranger has become a major hit for New Belgium, and three of its variants, Voodoo Ranger IPA, Voodoo Ranger Imperial IPA and Voodoo Ranger Liquid Paradise IPA, are among the top-thirty-selling craft brands in the country (along with Fat Tire Amber Ale and Rampant Imperial IPA). Want to participate in Vote Voodoo: The Thirsty Games? Go to votevoodoo.com by the end of September. The winner will be announced October 1.

Cerebral Brewing releases Haptic Feedback IPA. Double-dry-hopped with Citra, Mosaic, Citra Lupmax, Mosaic Lupmax and Strata hops, this 7.1 percent ABV beer is hopped to the max.
A few breweries waited until the first day of fall to release their pumpkin beers. Strange Craft Beer Company was one of them, tapping its robust, much-loved Pumpkin Porter earlier this week.
Falling Rock Taphouse
Thursday, September 24
Every fall, when the Great American Beer Festival comes to town, Falling Rock Tap House serves as the unofficial meeting place and headquarters for beer lovers from all parts of the globe. But in 2020, the pandemic forced the cancellation of the festival (though there is an online version) and severe seating and operating restrictions for Falling Rock. So the beer bar is looking to pull off an alternative that it says will give people a little taste of the GABF atmosphere, but “done in as responsible of a manner as possible, and following all local guidelines.” Introducing FRAFOGB (Falling Rock Alternative Festival of Great Beer), which will have four sessions (just like GABF) from September 24 through 27. The seated series of events will be spread out throughout Falling Rock’s upstairs, downstairs and patio, and will include two different lineups of thirty two-ounce beers, poured in six flights of five each. There will also be food (see Falling Rock’s website for details). “We will be pulling out all the stops in our cellar as well as bringing in some tasty treats in order to fill up the two lineups with exceptional beers. Help us continue the tradition of Falling Rock during GABF Week in this challenging year in a new way,” Falling Rock says. Tickets are $100 per person, and tables will seat a specific number of people. Reservations are required — as are masks while going to and from your table.
Friday, September 25
Call to Arms Brewing will inundate you with the freshness today as the brewery taps three different fresh hop beers, including More Like Bor-O-Phyll and Fresh Hop Janet Reno’s Dance Party, both brewed with Strata.
Copper Kettle Brewing brings back Snowed In Coconut, a “velvety smooth oatmeal stout that is aged in bourbon barrels and made with fresh coconut flakes and chocolate,” the brewery says. This seasonal beer will be available starting at noon on tap and in 19.2-ounce cans.
Falling Rock Tap House continues its Falling Rock Alternative Festival of Great Beer in lieu of the Great American Beer Festival this year. See Thursday for details.
If this had been a normal year, the Great American Beer Festival would have been in town, along with the twelfth annual Denver Rare Beer Tasting. But this is not a normal year, so the organizers of Denver Rare Beer have decided to throw a virtual series of events featuring eight hours of content spread across three days, including an auction, panels on beer topics, meet-and-greets with luminaries of the craft-beer world, videos from breweries around the country, and virtual bottle shares. In addition, for the cost of a $60 ticket, participants can get a commemorative tasting glass and T-shirt shipped, VIP status for next year’s in-person Denver Rare Beer Tasting (scheduled for October 8, 2021), and access to special releases (the cost of which is separate) at breweries around the country — all of which will benefit the Pints for Prostates campaign, which raises money for prostate cancer awareness. Participating Colorado breweries include WeldWerks, Westbound & Down, Burns Family Artisan Ales, Westfax Brewing, Great Divide, Joyride, River North Brewery and Verboten Brewing.
4 Noses Brewing debuts a brand-new hazy IPA called Lotus Rising. “This is our first time experimenting with the new Lotus hops,” the brewery says. Combined with some Nelson hops, the New England-style IPA “packs a citrus aroma, notes of tropical fruit, and a fluffy mouthfeel.”
Luki Brewing in Arvada taps Boardwalk Cream Nitro. “This light cream ale has a touch of lactose and vanilla that will remind you of nights at the carnival and boardwalk, funnel cakes and all,” the brewery says. “Nitro adds a creamy texture that makes this 6.4 percent ABV beer reminiscent of a Nilla Wafer.”
Over Yonder Brewing in Golden re-releases a fan favorite, Cream and Sugar, Please. This blonde coffee stout was brewed with cocoa nibs, lactose and cold brew from Launch, the brewery’s neighbor. “This light coffee beer has all the flavor and aroma without the dark bitterness,” Over Yonder says.
Wild Provisions Beer Project in Boulder releases the next in its line of Czech-style lagers. Half Dark Czech-Style Lager was fermented for two weeks in open-top vessels and an additional six weeks in horizontal lagering tanks, naturally carbonating along the way. It was triple-decocted with soft water, floor-malted Bohemian malts, and Saaz hops from the Czech Republic, Wild Provisions says. It will be on tap and in cans to go.
Burns Family Artisan Ales hosts a special release.

Seedstock Brewing brings a taste of Munich to Colfax Avenue with an Oktoberfest-style event featuring the tappings of Special Hell, a Helles lager. “Its rich malty aroma is balanced by a slight cracker sweetness that, rather than filling you up, leaves you wanting more.

There will also be polka music. Come dressed in your lederhosen and dirndl.

He has written in more notebooks than he can count, in infinitesimally small hieroglyphic script his findings on nearly 20,000 beers. He has translated that script into concise, fair ratings on RateBeer.com, and become a sought-after critic in the world of beer. We are so proud to release a beer worthy of his 20,000th rating.” The 14.5 percent ABV Blended Barrel Aged Old Ale was brewed with input from Ratman himself.

tinyurlis.gdu.nuclck.ruulvis.netshrtco.deThe Peterborough Telegraph are running regular spotlights on rehoming animals. This week we are highlighting black cats, as it’s Halloween and black cats are considered unlucky in some cultures and adoption centres find themselves with a lot of black cats in their care..
Lovely Timmy had been a homeless stray before coming into our care through a veterinary practice. He is around 5 years old. Timmy is a shy boy who is nervous around people and will benefit from a quiet adult only home. He will need a patient and understanding owner who can slowly earn his trust over time. Timmy is already making progress and can be won over with dreamies. He does welcome and enjoys a little bit of stroking on the head but he is not keen on extended periods of contact. Timmy may be able to live with another cat after slow and careful introductions.

Shy little Fig is around 2 years old and was originally rescued in January from a multi-cat house with nearly 40 other cats. Fig was adopted 7 months ago with another cat from the same rescue. Unforeseen tension and stress between her and the other cat lead to her return. At the end of August, she was adopted once more but sadly, through no fault of her own, poor Fig finds herself back in our care. Fig needs a patient owner who can help her feel safe. Building a relationship with cats like Fig takes time and patience. Unfortunately, she may never fully learn to trust humans due to her experiences and a lack of socialisation in early life. She is what we might call an "inbetweener", not quite a pet but not a free-living cat either. Fig's new owner will need to be understanding and happy to share their home with this beautiful girl but accept that Fig may always remain shy and elusive.Shy little Fig is around 2 years old and was originally rescued in January from a multi-cat house with nearly 40 cat

Lovely Raffles is another stray who had been fending for himself for a while. He had wounds consistent with fighting with other cats which have been treated and have now healed. We think he is around 3 years old. Raffles is an interesting fella, he does like a little fuss but is wary around people and is prone to swiping feet. He is looking for an indoor home as an only cat as he is FIV positive. He would benefit from access to a catio or an escape-proof garden. More about FIV can be found here: We would like to find Raffles a loving and understanding home where he can relax. He would be best suited to a more experienced cat owner with no children.

This sweet girl is Sooty and she found herself in RSPCA care along with many of her friends. After some time here at Block Fen she is now ready to look for her forever home. Sooty is a shy girl and has found cattery life quite daunting. She has settled in somewhat but still has a way to go before she is completely comfortable in her surroundings. She is learning how to enjoy a fuss and and is becoming more trusting but she will need continued support with this in her new home. Sooty would benefit from a quieter household where she can settle in to her new environment in her own time. She has lived with cats previously so may be able to live with another friendly cat as long as introductions are done slowly and in the right way. Due to her timid nature this pretty little cat will need a space of her own to be able to go to if she feels things are a little too much and she needs a retreat. We feel that given time and patience Sooty would make a great addition to the family.

It’s estimated that out sourcing work in the united kingdom has seen growth of some 30 percent within the last two decades .
Writing can be just a specialization and also in the event that you are able to do it, you will do it. ethics essay Writing products and services have become vital for many organizations since it may be applied to improve a corporation’s revenue.
A number of companies have seen problems in their global economy. This was mainly on account of this European economy’s weakness. Applying composing providers is still one particular way If a company has to make use of to develop its business enterprise.
There are opportunities for foreign language writers as it’s a trend for many businesses to produce jobs and hire language authors to compose them to write for world wide employers. You’ll find two strategies. The first is always to bring to create for your benefit, and also the next thing will be to really go on your outsourcing.
One of the most usual services an author has will be in a position to bidding for a mission. This way, they can get into the sector, have work, and also earn cash flow. This really is a excellent way since language authors are offered at any time to complete things.
By setting an advertising on line, which can earn job from several origins an author may even enter the writer’s current market. For instance, writing for overseas languages really are part of life. Having someone go through a sentence, interpreted the sentence for a different person, after which idea concerning any of it will probably always be described as considered a need.
There are a number of men and women who are looking to provide work. This may help them learn more about the industry, to increase their skill, and add to their knowledge base. This is one of the best ways to get.
Writing products and services is incredibly similar to a number of different kinds of out sourcing on the planet. The thing that can make this distinct would be that the ability. The other distinction is that this type of work is achieved for the author. It’s maybe not done for a corporation.
One strategy will be always to look at how writing companies in the UK have done in the past. Many authors and authors have been able to profit out of it. The grade of the task and also the service supplied is just one among the benefits.
The disadvantage is there is not any guarantee that this type of workout will last to emerge later on. It’s likely that certain markets will dry up, also it’s likewise feasible that there will soon undoubtedly become a increase in the demand for authors. This makes it very important for companies to always be searching to hire.
There is the possibility which they will drop outside from the small business once a broker or writer becomes contracted. Some authors may want to keep and make the most of the opportunity they were awarded. That is often achieved by discovering work in states, in which lots of states are overpopulated.
For writers in both underdeveloped countries, their work needs to be bilingual. It is possible for an author to decide where they would really like to do the job based around the access to work from the countries. This really is something that may ensure it is much simpler to allow them to stay informed about their work.Training Staff

Aries Keyframes + Quiz
The marketing around Song Machine has begun to develop a pattern. First, we got the episode, then the Debunked session, then the instrumental; and now we’re starting to see keyframes from the Aries video via Gorillaz’ social media.
This slideshow requires JavaScript.
On top of this, the band’s online quiz to win a 20% store discount has been updated to test your knowledge of the Aries video; you can try it below.
New Interviews
We’re all stuck indoors right now, and so are the band. The news site Daily Star have interviewed Gorillaz to ask how they’re coping with the lockdown.
Music site, Loud and Quiet also interviewed Murdoc for their “Sweet 16” column; having him reminisce his youth and listing even more failed bands he put together before Gorillaz. You can read the article here.

It’s the fourth week of G Club’s event, here’s the picks.
New 2D Art
Jamie’s Instagram has once again given us another teaser, this time it’s a new image of 2D.
New Noodle Cam
Gorillaz themselves took to Instagram too, posting a new Noodle Cam clip to their story. This video gives us footage from the Aries recording session with both of the song’s features.
Artbook Delay
Speaking of Jamie’s art, the upcoming Taschen book, ‘Jamie Hewlett – 40’ was originally planned for release yesterday (based on Amazon’s listing). While the book still isn’t out (or even officially announced), Amazon.fr have changed the release date of their listing to the 27th of May; which you can see here.
The Return Of Superplastic?
Last November, Superplastic blew us away with an incredible figure of 2D (which you can still buy), but recently a fan got in touch with the company to ask about the future of their ties with Gorillaz and got the following response…
It’s likely that amidst the collabs with DJ Whoo Kid & Steve Aoki, Gorillaz have been on the backburner for this company. Fingers crossed for some updates soon…
Gorillaz: The Movie?!
In G-U’s last fanzine, Jamie alluded to a project much larger than Song Machine being in the works right now; and Humility’s guest actor, Jack Black might have just revealed what Jamie was talking about. The Instagram screenshot speaks for itself.
The contestants are greeted by the leader of the Chromatic Lords, the Red King. The tourney was only another test before the final one, the one where the mystical mantle of power would judge its future wielder. Before the start of the festivities, it would seem that Beren had some familiarity with the Red King, as his casual and nonchalant display left many of the contestants and the eight sages in awe and shock. After a night of rest, the group assembled once again and were escorted to a large circular pit dug from the mountain rock. The Chromatic Lords sat and judged, while the elven guardian from before presides over the ceremony. The final tourney was about to begin.
Previous Episode/Anthology Episodes
The contestants were gathered to another wing of the tower, greeted and escorted by the same ancient elf in dark robes. After passing through a doorway that led to a different set of mountains, the path ended at a large circular pit carved out of the mountain rock. A spectral procession of the Chromatic Lords sat on ghostly thrones, high above the arena. The high winds were cold and vicious, while the presence of snow was not as prevalent, the extreme environment could prove to be useful to some who preferred the cold.
The elf guardian stood before the eight warriors. “Greetings again, the lords and lady shall preside over this tournament as observers. I shall be your conductor of the upcoming events, my rulings are final. Two contestants will enter the arena and fight. Death is not necessary, but you must incapacitate your opponent. You may also knock your opponent out of the arena, should they be unable to return to it within ten seconds, they are disqualified and lose the challenge. Fighters that are incapacitated or unable to fight for longer than ten seconds lose. Any warrior that surrenders, lose. The victor of each bout progresses further until a single fighter is left. But know this, a champion will not be declared until the Mantle determines otherwise. The Mantle’s judgment is absolute.”
The eight remained silent and nodded to acknowledgment. The elf produced a wooden box with a large circular hole cut on the top.
“To determine which of you shall fight, there are eight spheres in this box. Place your hand and retrieve your sphere. There are four colors inside, those with matching colors will determine your opponent. You will have a few moments to prepare yourselves once the selections have been made.”
One by one, the fighters plucked the fist-sized spheres from the box. Shiro, the Black Frost had been paired against Lao Jiu, the White Swan. Beren was paired with the oversized Goliath warrior, Rend of the Adamantine Dragon, Jade Tiger against the Kenku assassin, Shink of the Twilight Gale, and Mei Fong would fight against Hangul, the Demon of the Nura Clan.
The warrior from the White Swan had notable elven features, but also human traits as well. Mei assumed that he was most likely a half-elf. She had spotted the man chanting hymns and sermons that were synonymous with those who trained with the White Swan clan. A priestly monk in a such a bloody ordeal, perhaps some prayers would be needed for the departed from this tournament. Shiro was a pale-skinned human with black spiked hair, as the two approached the arena, he shed his dark robes to reveal a nearly clear and pristine muscular physique. She had heard stories of his powerful abilities to manipulate elemental ice.
The elf stood at the center of the arena and assessed both warriors before shouting the start of the fight.
Shiro instantly tossed large jagged pieces of ice towards the lightly robed White Swan priest. A yellow glow emanated from him, causing the shards of ice to shatter and break around his divine aura. The priest launched a series of fiery bolts at the Black Frost, which he easily deflected with his bare hands. Mei knew he had created soft pillows of airy ice to absorb the heat of those spells. He was good. Shiro began chanting, and the arena became encased in dense fog. No one could see past the makeshift cloud, but the sounds of their fight were still recognizable. The sound of weapon strikes, words to powerful spells, and their shouts to each other. Mei found it difficult to keep track of the action, she turned to both Beren and Jade Tiger to find them transfixed on the arena. Their eyes moving through the cloud as if they could see the fight itself. She deduced Jade Tiger with his sense of smell could follow along with the trail of scent from both fighters. But what about Beren? She thought.
The fog cloud began to fade, revealing the clear victor. The priest of the White Swan was encased in a solid block of ice while Shiro stood triumphantly next to the frozen spectacle. He was declared the victor; the next fight was to start as soon as possible.
Beren and the tall Goliath walked over to the arena. The warrior announced himself as Rend, for he was good at it. A giant sword with jagged edges, showcasing many uses and abuses on the weapon itself. Any swordsmith would lament at the sorry state of the blade, yet it still remained intact despite everything. Beren cracked his knuckles and stretched into a few poses before meeting his opponent in the center of the ring.
“Ready?!High school rowers were fitted with personal dosimeters—instruments for measuring UVR—and data was collected over five regattas in consecutive summers at the South Island lake. Fukushima has distributed radiation monitors to 280,000 children at its elementary and junior high schools. Children tend to be afraid being left alone at school, fearing they now have to mingle with other kids and the new image of the teacher. Now you have to understand that compactor bags are more expensive than traditional garbage bags, but you only have to use half as many. How much money do you think you spend a year on normal kitchen size garbage bags? Like a muscle that becomes exhausted after exertion, too much self-regulation actually depletes our ability to self-regulate in various domains including physical health and goal accomplishment. The race is expected to take competitors no more than 3 days to complete including vital resting and preparation time. The process gradually starts to take place from the mid 30s, however improper lifestyle routines can result in premature aging too. Full sunlight coming through sparse trees makes for a lot of bright spots on the ground is not the best place to photograph.
A day spent at an Australian beach should be a fun experience, full of fabulous memories. And instead of saying “rusty,” how about “needs paint” – and instead of saying “full of bullet holes,” trying saying “charming custom bodywork.” But upload a photo, too, for credibility. Eventually, as these toddlers turn to pre school age, the first few days of school is a very terrible time both for parents and the preschoolers. Dress up games and plays may help them develop their social awareness and could be a great start for parents to learn what their interests are. When they turn toddlers, parents could start at this early age to organize play groups among friends and neighbours. This is the reason why there are shows at school that makes children wear different costumes and play different roles. A helpful social activity for the play group could be a dress up game or dress up play. No wonder, even adults love to dress up in costume parties.
Children love to dress up, crushed velvet durag either in their parent’s clothes or in some fancy costumes. Children are often shy and have difficulty relating to others especially when they just turned into toddlers. These compact towels are easy to wash even at low water temperatures. The fact is that there are a lot of bad habits, as well as outside factors, that can cause temporary and even permanent damage to our eyes. If you are not fond of taking out the trash and constantly changing out the bags, then a trash compactor could be the solution you have been looking for. Taking out the garbage is a chore that nobody ever volunteers to do because of the smell and the bulk. When you have a compactor, you do not have to do this hated chore as often as you would when you have a machine that making space for the garbage in the bag.
If you own a compactor, then you will be sending an already condensed version of your normal household trash to the landfill that will decompose faster, and leave a little more space for the garbage of others. For one thing, it is not recommended that you put glass in a trash compactor, therefore you would have to set it aside, silk hair bonnet making it really easy to put it in a bin with the rest if your recycling. It is one healthy way to promote a child’s development and understanding of the world. One healthy way to build confidence and encourage children to socialize is dressing up. Dressing up can also make children adventurous. The most classical are animal costumes for little children. The most famous of the islands here include Antigua, Barbados, Jamaica, St. Lucia and the Bahamas and these are rated as also having some of the best beaches in the world.✅ 4% fee is $1., 🤣🤣🤣😂, 🔅name: safewhitetiger.

I started by adhering the Watercolor Forest Greenery Washi Tape onto white cardstock and cut out an oval shape from it.
I then die cut the Diamond Snowflake Oval Frame from blue glitter cardstock and adhered the washi piece behind it. This was attached to the card base.
I die cut the body and head of the Whittle Friendly Snowman from White Woodgrain paper (it adds texture), his eyes, nose and hat from white cardstock and his scarf from plaid cardstock. Using Copics I coloured in the hat, nose and eyes.
I assembled the snowman and popped it up with foam squares. Love how jaunty he looks in his plaid scarf and top hat!
I felt there wasn’t an ideal spot for a sentiment on the card front so I put it on the inside.
Thanks for stopping by the blog today!
SuppliesOwning your dream home is one of the biggest dreams for many families in here in Canada. However, with the continuous rise of real estate prices across all provinces, it’s becoming harder and harder for people to save for a down payment and get into homeownership. That’s why the Liberal Party is also promising a $1 billion in loans and grants to improve and develop rent to own projects with private, non-profit, and co-op partners for aspiring homeowners. This will open up opportunities to help renters actualize their homeownership dream while renting.
The rent-to-own program aims to help financially struggling renters who can’t meet the threshold of qualifying for mortgage loans. By committing to a rent to own program, renters can hold onto their dream homes by leveraging on their monthly payments.
By delaying the home buying process, the renters get a chance to rebuild their credit score and align their finances so that they can save up the required down payment at the end of the rent-to-own agreement period.
With an effective and well-regulated rent-to-own program, homeownership ladder will be within reach for many renters who have issues with credit or insufficient down payment. If you have always wanted to transition from a renter to a homeowner, we have good news for you. Kindly sign up for our rent-to-own pre-approval form to get you started with a curated game plan and steps to homeownership.Cabochons two pendants earrings

On 10 March, the Swedish Family Law and Parental Support Authority (MFoF) launched a new report about children’s rights in parental support initiatives written by Frida Lygnegård, researcher at the School of Health and Welfare, Jönköping University. In connection with the launch of the report they also put out a webinar where Frida Lygnegård presents the result findings in the report.
Image from the webinar by MFoF. Pictured is Frida Lygnegård as well as Maria Andersson, analyst at MFoF.
Frida Lygnegård is a researcher at the School of Health and Welfare at Jönköping University and the main focus of her research is children’s and youth’s rights. During the autumn of 2020, she has been working with a task from the Swedish Family Law and Parental Support Authority and the task has now resulted in a report about how children’s rights can be made visible during parental support initiatives.
“It has been a very rewarding collaboration with the Swedish Family Law and Parental Support Authority, and it feels good that they now choose to launch the report and the webinar at the same time. In the broadcast, I start by talking about the report I wrote, and it later also includes staff from the The Ombudsman for Children in Sweden and Save the Children. In addition, a group of children also participate in the webinar, which is completely in line with what I advocate in my research and teaching, i.e., the importance of us taking the children's own perspectives into account,” says Frida Lygnegård.
In line with national strategy
Frida Lygnegård
The Swedish Family Law and Parental Support Authority (MFoF) is an expert authority for parental support, family advice, and questions relating to the family law matters handled by municipal social welfare committees. On 30 August 2018, the Swedish Government decided on a new national strategy for improved parenting support, where the goal is for all parents to be offered parenting support throughout the child's upbringing. The national strategy strengthens the writings on the rights of the child and states that the principle of the best interests of the child shall permeate the parental support provided.
“In line with the Government's national strategy, I was commissioned by MFoF to carry out a literature review of current research on children's rights to provide a picture of the existing knowledge. The report can be used as a knowledge support for decision-makers and professionals who work with the implementation and follow-up of parenting support initiatives, but also as a guide on how the child's own voice has been considered in written material concerning these interventions. My hope is also that the literature review can contribute to increased collaboration around a strengthened parenting support between affected actors at both local and regional as well as national level,” says Frida Lygnegård.
The report, which in Swedish is called ”Barns rättigheter i föräldraskapsstödjande insatser”, as well as the webinar is now available on the MFoF:s website via this link

Salahuddin: Govt wants to collaborate with China on new technology to improve rice yields
KOTA BELUD, July 13 — The Ministry of Agriculture and Agro-based Industry (MOA) wants to collaborate with China to introduce new technology here in efforts to improve rice yields in the country, says its minister Datuk Salahuddin Ayub.
He said the use of modern technology in the paddy sector in China has allowed the country to produce up to eight tonnes per hectare apart from storing enough rice supply for the use of its 1.4 billion people.
“During the Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s visit to China with me and accompanied by MOA’s secretary-general Datuk Sallehuddin Hassan, we obtained interesting information on how China sustains its annual supply of rice and to keep it sufficient for its 1.4 billion population.
“Based on that, we heed to the prime minister’s call for Malaysia, particularly us at MOA, to collaborate with China to introduce new technology (that China used in rice sector) in the country,” he told reporters after handing over the key of rice harvesting machine to farmers in Kampung Merabau here, today.
Also present were Sabah Agriculture and Food Industry Minister Datuk Junz Wong, Sallehuddin and Kota Belud Integrated Agricultural Development Area (IADA) director Salmah Labulla.
Salahuddin said he planned to visit Hainan, China, as it was among the successful sites in the country’s rice sector as well as visiting several research institutions.
He said modern technology used in rice cultivation in China, to be introduced here, would cover the whole value chain in the sector including looking at the use of drones and Artificial Intelligence technology.
Such high technology was expected to be implemented by Kota Belud IADA towards increasing rice yields and further boosting farmers’ income, he said.
In another development, Salahuddin said the MOA to formulate a new policy in the fisheries sector to ensure better yields for fishermen, thus generating substantial returns to the group.
He said the new policy was also in line with the government’s efforts to safeguard marine resources, apart from carrying out enforcement against foreign fishermen who trespassed into the country’s territorial waters.
“The ministry is drafting this new policy and it is (expected) to be completed within three months,” he said. — Bernama

Surgery, chemotherapy and radiation have considerable effects on the body. Physical therapy can reduce pain, symptoms and help recover function.
Speak to your provider about physical side effects you may expect from treatment. In conjunction with your medical treatment, physical therapy can help you regain function and strength to return to daily life.
Physical therapy starts with a good, thorough physical examination to see where function needs to be restored. The patient is given a treatment plan to rehabilitate any affected areas and strength needed for life activities. Difficulty manipulating a toothbrush or pulling on pants are simple life tasks that may require a care plan. Your physical therapist will work with you to resume this function.
Every patient is different, as is every surgeon’s protocol. Physical therapy may not begin until risk of infection is significantly reduced. Speak with a physical therapist early in the process so you know what to expect after your cancer treatment.
Listen as Dr. John Gallucci joins Dr. Pamela Peeke to share how physical therapy can help women recover from breast cancer surgery.

Growing consumption of fresh and processed meat products and developments in material and design will support long term growth.Global reverse osmosis pump market is set to be valued at US$ 6,077.8 Mn in 2021.

Request a Complete TOC of this Report with figures:
The selection of clear packaging forms is gaining traction among meat packaging producers. Clear packaging has become increasingly popular owing to its functionality, especially with regards to promoting transparency in business, which is key to achieving faith and confidence among consumers.
Transparency of a package is extremely crucial in terms of product quality. The growing requirement for clear and genuine packaging is rising on a large scale, particularly in the food and beverages industry.
See-through packaging is accomplished by using films for superior gloss and excellent transparency. This additionally reduces prices for printing and labelling, as compared to opaque alternatives. Consequently, the appropriation of such packaging solutions is anticipated to expand the sales of meat packaging in the near future.
Various advancements in technology and powerful automated production lines have opened possibilities for the meat packaging businesses. A recent development in the industry is high-pressure processing (HPP), which does not require heat while packaging meat products.
It is a post-processing method that uses cold pasteurization. In this procedure, packed meat products are placed within a tremendous level of isotactic pressure. The high-pressure processing technique is adopted for prolonging the shelf-life of the product. This innovative packaging system enables meat producers in supporting product differentiation from competitor offerings.
Key Takeaways of Meat Packaging Market Study
- Polyethylene (PE) plastics are gaining traction owing to their superior barrier attributes. The segment is forecast to expand by 1.7x of its current valuation, generating incremental opportunity of approximately US$ 2.5 Bn.
- Modified atmosphere packaging technology will account for more than 40% of the market share by the end of 2031. The demand for the technology will increase due to its aesthetic appeal and improved shelf-life.
- China will hold 42.3% of the East Asia market in 2021, driven by a vast non-vegetarian consumer base.
- Germany and Italy are exhibiting high growth potential, accounting for over 15% and 13% respectively, in the Europe market, driven by rising export activities.
- The U.S. will hold over 84% of the North America market, supported by a large consumer base and presence of a matured meat processing industry.

Impact of COVID-19 on Meat Packaging Market
Meat packaging is gaining traction owing to benefits such as extended shelf-life and cost-effectiveness. COVID-19 has caused disruptions in several end-use industries because of which the meat packaging market was hurt in 2019.
The pandemic also caused disruption in supply chain and global sales. Most raw materials are sourced through imports. Raw supplies are dispatched to meat packaging producers and then to the merchants of various countries for business and shipping across the globe.
However, because of the extensive restrictions prompted by the pandemic across manufacturing plants, the meat packaging market has witnessed a slowdown in production and adoption.
The food and beverages industry will register impressive growth in the post-pandemic era, which will push the demand for meat packaging in the near future. Frequent investments into research and development is anticipated to boost sales by 2020.
Meat Packaging Market Landscape
The global meat packaging market is highly fragmented in nature. A larger portion of market share is held by domestic and local market players. Leading players in the sector are focusing on the expansion of production capacity, in addition to investing in tech improvements.
Some of the key players operating in the global meat packaging market are Amcor Plc, Berry Global Inc., Winpak Ltd., Sealed Air Corp., Mondi Group, Amerplast Ltd., Faerch Plast A/S, Bollore Group, Constantia Flexibles Group GmbH, Sonoco Products Company, Thantawan Industry Plc and Cascades Inc.

It’s Time To Change...
‘To Do’s are a huge part of most of our days and ensuring things don’t keep getting pushed to the bottom of that list can be hard. Nowadays the world of ‘must have right now’ takes over and it can be easy to lose sight of the things that are most valuable to us. Yet good old hard work pays off, along with the idea that mental well-being is important and getting that balance right is now a priority for everyone from production floor to CEO offices. Making changes for the better does require attention and energy, so refreshing that ‘to do’ list is important. While the past cannot be changed, things do get better with time and patience they say. We have seen change in the making a lot this month. Despite a slightly difficult birth there have been some very positive results from the digital expo that was FENEX, new incentives, NFA nominations and voting now underway are all giving the industry a much needed boost. Carrying on with the theme of change, it is interesting to see a new Cabinet now in place after Boris Johnson walked into No.10 with a scythe.
That was quite a shake-up to his front bench since he took office and how it will affect voters and our lives in general remains to be seen but it certainly caused waves as it was far more extensive than anyone could have predicted. Clearly Mr Johnson’s revamp across the seats at the top table of his government benches demonstrates a major To Do list, with a focus it would seem on bringing in domestic changes before another general election. I doubt it came as any surprise that Andrew Neil left hist position as chairman and anchor of GB News after it launched three months ago. Will this news avenue be able to survive now? - again a fo-cus on change will be inevitable. Will Christmas Be Cancelled Again? Fuel companies in crisis and the threat of extortionate rising costs don’t bode well for a happy Christmas season this year. Whilst everyone was accepting, albeit glumly, of families having to be separated due to Covid, it doesn’t look hopeful this year for anything that much better. The threat of food shortages combined with worries on deliveries in just about

FROM HELEN DUVAL 2021
every sector along with a lack of drivers, seems to infer that we should all get planning now. Covid-19 is still wreaking havoc although things do appear to be looking brighter thanks to the vaccine programme that has been rolled out. Although the story of the global pandemic is still a work-in-progress, its effect has caused us all to take stock and evaluate the important issues such as, sustainability, mental health, climate change and business adaptability. As people in communities we are extremely fragile and need to evaluate environmental goals at every level. These considerations and the resulting changes will have dramatic effects on business moving forward into next year. Booming demand for builders and installers continues to force prices up. This alongside the shortage on essential products across construction continue to make companies evaluate how to cope. The UK’s construction sector is wonderfully busy but it desperately needs answers to stay healthy and make changes for the better for everyone. The UK government has greatly supported the construction sector in theory, with the
resounding cry of“build back better” to help drive business forward and create growth. These ambitions are wonderful news in a bid to build more homes that are safer and to develop new transport initiatives all of which will bode well for commercial and retail projects….if deliveries and shortages improve. This all sounds wonderful, but as commendable as it seems, the impact of Brexit together with fuel cost implications for business and homeowners will need to see changes for the better and quickly.

NEWADDITIONS TO GREENTEQ LIFESTYLE RANGE
Hardware specialist VBH has added a number of new products to its Lifestyle range of products, their umbrella term for hardware solutions for patio doors. Having introduced the greenteQ Clearspan for bi-fold doors 8 years ago, VBH reports that it has enjoyed great success with the product and it is now one of the company’s most popular ranges. Until recently Clearspan has been available for two aluminium profile systems but a flurry of new product development has seen the introduction this year of solutions to suit five more leading systems, including Exlabesa and Reynaers. VBH Marketing Manager Gary Gleeson says “We get nothing but great feedback from customers who already use Clearspan and we’re very excited about making the product available to many more fabricators with the introduction of solutions for more aluminium profile systems.”
Although the Lifestyle range also encompasses Clearlift hardware for aluminium lift/slide doors, and Aspire handles to suit, VBH point out that PVCu fabricators will also find products under the Lifestyle umbrella. As an example, VBH have recently launched the greenteQ Clearslide stainless steel hook lock for PVCu inline sliding doors. Gary adds “Because of the success we’ve had with bi-fold and lift/slide hardware, we’re seen by many as the industry’s patio door hardware specialist. “Clearslide has come about in response to requests from fabricators for VBH to develop an 8 hook locking system within the greenteQ brand. It suits the leading PVCu sliding door systems and our customers can now fit a Clearslide lock, Orion 3 star cylinder and their choice of standard Alpha or Coastline stainless steel handles for a true greenteQ sliding door solution.” To find out more about VBH’s range, visit, email sales@vbhgb.com, or call 01634 263263.

DECEUNINCKALUMINIUM EXPANDS CUSTOMER SUPPORTTEAM
“As Customer Services Coordinator it’s my job to make sure that that offer is underpinned with the right levels of service and support. “Even in the short time that I’ve been here, we’ve brought on a number of new customers and it’s great to be part of a rapidly growing and very dynamic business.” Decalu by Deceuninck Aluminium’s aluminium was launched in the UK in January 2020, gaining traction on the strength of manufacturing efficiencies of up to 40%, plus major installation gains, including the use of a pre- inserted co-extruded gasket and knock-in glazing bead.
Deceuninck Aluminium has expanded is customer support function with the appointment of Klare Dean as Customer Service Coordinator. Starting out in the banking industry, Klare took a career break to raise her family, returning to work in an order processing role in the printing industry in 2016. She joined Deceuninck in 2018 as a Customer Service Administrator, within the PVC-U side of the business, later training as an internal auditor. Klare joined the Deceuninck Aluminium team in July, becoming a key point of contact for its rapidly expanding customer base. She said: “The enthusiasm here is infectious, the team, the customers. Everyone is behind this product. Whenever I’ve spoken to anyone about Decalu, it’s been a positive.
The range includes the ultra-energy efficient Decalu88 Bi-folding Door, the Decalu163 Lift-and Slide; aluminium entrance doors; casement windows; turn-and-tilt; and reversible windows. Nigel Headford, Director, Deceuninck Aluminium, said: “Klare is passionate about service and that’s absolutely key for us because from day one we’ve always said that if our service levels are the same as everyone else’s then we’ve failed. We want to be the best. “Klare’s appointment is a key part of the jigsaw and she’s going to be instrumental in taking us to where we want to go.

LASER UPGRADES: ADDIN VALUETO STANDARD PRO
Thanks to laser technology, the glass industry can do something that would be almost inconceivable in any other sector. Laser finishing treatment enables manufacturers to enhance the value of largely standardised products and increase their functionality. With prices for traditional IG units and facade cladding coming under increasing pressure, using laser upgrades to create bird protection glass, RF-transparent glass and anti-bacterial glass gives manufacturers the chance to tap into new target markets and increase their profit margins. HEGLA boraident of Halle/Saale, Germany, is a company that specialises in these types of laser applications. The HEGLA Laserbird is a system that can manipulate the top layer of a pane of glass or use laser printing to alter its properties, thus providing the glass with an additional benefit for the customer. “The high degree of flexibility and precision that laser technology offers is what sets it apart from other processes. You can switch between different finishing treatments without wasting time retooling, and the system can be used to work on both individual panes and finished IG units,” explains Dr Thomas Rainer, Head of Development at HEGLA boraident. Bird protection and RF-transparent glass RF-transparent glass is created by removing a layer of the coating in a dodecagonal pattern with extremely thin lines. Once this is done, the interior behind the pane of glass in question will enjoy full data and phone reception – perfect for conference rooms, office buildings and public transport. The pattern is almost invisible, and imperceptible when used as part of a finished IG unit.
Birds can be protected from colliding with glass by lasering a different shape into its coating. For optimum results, Dr Rainer recommends applying the laser to the pyrolytic coating on the outside of the IG unit. However, the glass can also be functionalised without this layer. In such cases, a laser printing process is used to apply a pattern that birds will recognise as an insurmountable obstacle onto the outside of the facade glass. “In Europe alone, 250,000 birds die every day from collisions with glass windows and doors,” the Head of Development reports. “New legal requirements at the international level have opened up a new market for these applications, and the demand for these types of glass in public and commercial buildings is growing in many local markets as well.” The print is weatherproof, scratchproof and lightfast.
Silver ions for an antibacterial effect An antibacterial effect can be generated using a new, patented finishing treatment that involves embedding silver ions in the surface of a pane of glass. When bacteria and germs come into contact
26 NATIONAL FENESTRATION AWARDS MAGAZINE
NG ODUCTS
with such a surface, the silver ions reliably kill them off. There are plenty of potential applications for this technology, especially in sectors with strict hygiene requirements, such as hospitals, commercial kitchens and public buildings. Technical application The physical conductivity of the top glass layers also makes them suitable for technical applications. For example, the low-E layer can be textured in such a way that it creates conductor circuits. This technique can be used to slightly heat up the glass panes in cooling units to prevent them fogging up. This technology is especially popular in conservatories in cold countries, which need to be protected from excessive snow loads. Conductive glass can also be used for burglary protection systems, triggering an alarm if the glass is damaged or broken. Gentle decoating in a top-quality process Whether you want to perform edge decoating or partial coating removal to create lighting effects, laser technology makes the process gentle and precise. “The lasered area is crystal-clear and free of scratches, which means this form of decoating produces perfect results even for the high standards of structural glazing and visible areas in general,” the Head of Development and authorised signatory for the company explains. The surface of the glass remains completely intact, as do its dazzling looks. App control and automation The Laserbird’s various finishing treatment programs can be selected via an app-based control system.
The lasering jobs can be created in advance using the work preparation software in your office, then you can save them in your ERP system or directly in the Laserbird system itself. Once the job has been selected, the glass is automatically transported into the system and the lasering begins. The Laserbird system can also be integrated into your ERP system for full data access, or you can use glass markings and an automated scanner to create a localised control system – thus making the experience even more user-friendly. As soon as the pane of glass or IG unit is available, the system scans the marking and the finishing treatment is activated. If your Laserbird is fitted with this scanner-based control system, the glass can be loaded onto it from a rack or harp rack in any order. Alternatively, it can also be connected directly via an AGV, for example. “The best place to position the Laserbird is at the end of your production line, as a stand-alone process station,” Dr Rainer recommends. “This keeps the finishing treatment separate from the glass flow, so it can be optimised to suit the process and delivery deadlines at hand.”

An exciting new consortium led by the University of California, Davis, and the UC Working Lands Innovation Center is setting out to find new ways of taking excess carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere using Nature’s best resource — soil.
The multipartner consortium has received a $4.7 million grant from California’s Strategic Growth Council to research and study the use of soil amendments in carbon sequestration.
Carbon sequestration is the process of removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it as a fixed molecule in a carbon sink, such as soil, oceans or plants. While this happens naturally, human advancements in agriculture and industry have affected natural sequestration by stripping the soil of amendments that allow it to absorb CO2. Therefore, the excess CO2 in the atmosphere is instead absorbed by the oceans, raising acidity levels and hurting wildlife.
By addings amendments such as rock dust, compost and biochar into California’s soil, the consortium hopes to find improved methods of carbon sequestration.
“Previous research points to some promising avenues for carbon capture and storage through the use of soil amendments,” states UC Berkeley professor Whendee Silver on the university’s website.
“For example, we found that adding organic waste — food waste, green waste, livestock manure — as composted soil amendments could save the equivalent of 28 million tons of carbon dioxide using just five per cent of California’s rangelands. That’s equal to approximately 80 per cent of the emissions from the state’s agriculture and forestry sector.”
The studies will assess whether soil amendments can bring additional benefits to California farms, such as improved soil health and crop and rangeland productivity.
The consortium will conduct 29 site studies across the state. The Working Lands Innovation Center will partner with California industry, community groups, farmers, ranchers, native tribes and small businesses to support the state’s agriculture and natural resources, as well as the livelihood and wellbeing of Californians. The grant runs for three years and promises to advance California’s climate goals while also helping disadvantaged communities.
Louise Bedsworth, executive director of the California Strategic Growth Center, states: “In addition to supporting the development of innovative new technologies and approaches to reduce global warming emissions, these awards help to build critical partnerships between researchers and the people on the ground advancing climate solutions. SGC is proud to support the partnerships that are critical to solving the climate challenge.”
Sabrina Dengler graduated from Hampshire College in 2017 with a degree in Environmental Studies. She is passionate about challenging the idea of nature as separate and distant from society and works to promote intersectional environmentalism using science and sociology. Her background in writing and organic agriculture lead her to work with RTE and she is excited to share her skills in research while learning about the nonprofit sector.

Have you ever been looking forward to a great night out at a lovely new restaurant with your friends and you get there and the food is amazing, the service is second to none, but you still didn’t quite enjoy the night and settle into it?
We’ve all experienced this at one time or another. We look up a restaurant’s website, peruse their tempting menu and make a booking. We’ve heard the food is to die for and we’re looking forward to a great night out. But on the night, something is just not right. It falls flat. Maybe the noise level was through the roof or there is no privacy or intimate spaces or you were practically sitting on top of the people next to you. Maybe it felt too stark or the waiters kept bumping you as they passed you with plates of hot food.
Whatever the issue, most likely your night fell flat because the something was ‘off’ with the design of the restaurant. Some of the critical design elements, needed to make a restaurant really work, were missing or out of harmony and this is what makes the experience fall flat.
Why customers will leave a restaurant and never come back if the design is not right.
If you are the owner of such a restaurant, you might be asking at this point ‘how do I know if something is ‘off’ in my restaurant design and what do I do to fix it?
Well, the first thing you need to understand is that your customers will not stick around for long if they are not comfortable in your restaurant. Whilst that might work well in the fast food business, if you are at the other end of the restaurant scale, you want your customers to spend 2 or 3 hours with you and order that second expensive bottle of wine or that third course of food. You want your customers to stick around and that means making them comfortable.
How can you be 100% sure your customers will be comfortable and that your design will work?
My advice is always to hire a specialised commercial designer who knows the in’s and out’s of restaurant design and branding. Find somebody who understands what it takes to make the many elements of design come together to create that perfect dining environment.
However, in the meantime, here are my top 5 tips for you to consider. Have a look at your own restaurant and try to work out if you are making any of the following mistakes:
- Lighting
When the general dining public enter a restaurant, they are looking to be entertained, they are looking for a little bit of magic and fantasy and escapism…as well as a great meal.
Nothing can set the tone for that magic and fantasy and escapism quite like lighting.
Think about that for a moment. If your customer walks into your restaurant only to find that the overhead lighting is on full tilt and they can see every wrinkle and blemish on the faces of their dining partners and they can see every detail of your restaurant, including that slightly discoloured table linen or the aging of your chair fabric, then all fantasy and magic has just gone out the window. They are hit with the stark realities of life. The reality that their partner is aging and so is your restaurant!
This is the very reason we have ambient and mood lighting. As restaurant owners, it is not only your job to feed the dining public, but to offer that much needed escapism from reality too.
A well designed restaurant should be a feast for all the senses!
Getting the lighting right is a delicate balance and really depends on a number of things including the surface finishes used, the shapes, lines and forms used, the spatial layout and of course the atmosphere and environment you are trying to create.
I could not impress upon you more, the importance of hiring a design team like McCabe Design Group to help you get this right. It is very very easy to get it wrong and, unfortunately, when it does go wrong it can create an unwanted atmosphere that will simply drive business away!
- Acoustics
Next up is acoustics.
A loud environment is the number one reason for early exit of diners.
If your customers come to your restaurant to enjoy a meal and a chat, only to find they can’t hear themselves think because every noise and voice and clash of dinnerware reverberates around your restaurant like a great big concert hall, then you can bet that as soon as they finish their main course they will leave your restaurant and find somewhere quieter to catch up. Not only that, they won’t be back!
Restaurants, by their very nature attract people wishing to have loud conversations, or families with their young kids who don’t quite understand their own noise levels yet. They are also places of action, with the sounds of the kitchen, dinnerware clashes, phones, waiters calls and so much more going on in one small space.
Now I know I said a restaurant should be a feast for all the senses, but if any one of those senses is completely overwhelmed, what you end up with is not so much a feast but more like frustration, fatigue, folly… you choose the F-word. The outcome is the same!
Some restaurant owners will choose to section their restaurant based on different noise levels for different atmospheres. They will create some areas where the sounds bounce through the space, giving a busy, vibrant atmosphere. They may then create other spaces where the acoustics are softened somewhat for a more intimate experience.
Acoustics are difficult to get right and are largely dependent on the internal structure of your space as well as the choice of materials used, particularly where you are choosing modern materials with clean lines and finishes.
Many designers will work with an acoustics specialist or will create hidden acoustics technologies in all the right places to get that balance of busy, vibrant hubbub and more intimate dining just right.
My advice is to think about the ideal atmosphere you are trying to create and then work with your designer to create just that.
- Colour
Colour is one of those very subjective design decisions. It completely depends on a number of factors including your own branding, your style of restaurant and food and the atmosphere you are trying to create.
Colour is also a mood enhancer. Different colours are said to have different psychological effects on people. Colour psychology is a study in itself and a very important decision for your restaurant.

- Spaces
Different customers will come to your restaurant with different agendas every day. Some will want a quiet space to conduct a business meeting or have an intimate conversation, others will want a setting where they can have a big noisy group dinner, without feeling like they are disturbing others. Some want to sit where they can be be seen or noticed and some will want a view to look at because they have little to talk about!
Having a space suited to each of their needs is important and is one of the major contributing factors in getting your diners to stay longer. Again, they are looking for an emotional experience and by the time they come through the door, they already know what that experience should feel like.
Creating a number of meeting and seating options such as a circulation space, a bar, high seating, booth seating, intimate seating and group seating is paramount to meeting your customers needs.
A well designed circulation space, for example allows diners to meetup with their dining companions, whilst also allowing your restaurant staff to move them through to their table seamlessly and without disturbing other diners.
A well designed bar allows potential new customers to come in, have a drink, check out the feel of your restaurant and of course, your menu, whilst deciding whether or not to stay.
The importance of these multiple seating options cannot be overstated.
- Functionality – Front of house meets Back of House
Finally, the functionality of your restaurant – We have spoken in length about the customer experience in the front of house. But what about behind the scenes?
A professionally designed kitchen with the all important magic ergonomics and flow, needed so that your chefs and wait staff can do their jobs easily and efficiently and without interruption to their work, is essential to the running of your restaurant.
Mistakes here can be costly in terms of the quality and efficiency of your food and your service, ultimately affecting your bottom line.
In addition to this, the relationship between Front-Of-House and Back-Of-House needs to be seamless. Wait staff need to have the space and freedom to move food through your restaurant and communicate with your kitchen seamlessly.
All-in-all restaurant design is a tricky and complex business. But when done correctly, it is very often the major difference between a booming business and tumbleweeds!
Before you open your doors, make sure you hire a designer who can offer you an end-to-end design service that includes all of the services and elements we have spoken about in this article.

Delhi typically sees temperatures soar in summer (Photo by Jack Zalium)
With the Met department predicting an exceptionally hot summer this year, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has sounded out vulnerable states an early warning against the imminent heat. But the Delhi government still does not have a heat action plan and citizens are yet to understand the magnitude of heat stress, as there is total absence of any form of communication in this regard.
More than 2,400 people died in India during heat wave of 2015, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). And the actual temperatures can go higher than what is reported in news as seen in the case of Delhi.
“We are using geographical information systems plotting heat gradient maps for cities. Through satellite data we found the maximum temperature in Delhi to be as high as 52 degrees,” Rohit Magotra, Assistant Director, Integrated Research for Action and Development (IRADe) told indiaclimatedialogue.net. “There are only few stations in Delhi and they are not measuring temperatures across the city.” IRADe is a research institute working in the areas of environment and climate change, urban development and energy, among others.
A comparison of heat gradient maps of Delhi show that the minimum temperature in the month of May has increased from 21.93 degrees Celsius to 29.53 degrees between 2013 to 2017.
Low awareness
Despite increasing warnings and projections of high heat events for the coming years, public recognition of the magnitude of the problem remains low, experts say. Further, administrative support systems generally lack preparedness measures and are not scientifically robust to understand impacts of heat stress on human health and productivity, they say.
To fill this gap, IRADe is helping the Delhi government come up with a heat action plan that will be taken up by the municipalities. The project will develop spatially differentiated and gender sensitive Heat Stress Action Plan for Delhi and two other cities (Bhubaneswar in Odisha and Rajkot in Gujarat) with the funding from International Development Research Centre (IDRC) Canada in association with Indian Institute of Public Health (Gandhinagar and Bhubaneswar), and Odisha State Disaster Management Agency.
Heat gradient maps of Delhi show that the minimum temperature in May has risen from 21.93 degrees Celsius to 29.53 degrees between 2013 to 2017 (Source: IRADe)
Some of the objectives of the project are to identify spatial vulnerability of populations during extreme heat events in selected areas; identify the impacts of extreme heat events on the health, work productivity and livelihoods of vulnerable population, to select appropriate, innovative and affordable climate adaptation measures for improving health and livelihood resilience for the urban population with consideration of gender-based implications, to strengthen the capacity of key stakeholders through training opportunities and to facilitate active use of information and evidence for policy-makers to drive the implementation of the Heat Stress Action Plans into municipal disaster strategies.
The project is currently in the first phase where research is on-going to understand the heat vulnerable areas of Delhi and its effect on various populations over two summer seasons.
“It is not just about temperature. We don’t know at what temperature, heat can kill a person, as there are various factors. For instance, in Odisha humidity plays a big role in increasing heat stress even if the temperatures are not as high as Delhi. Also, people are better adapted in rural areas than in urban settings,” said Magotra. “Delhi gets lot of migrant population and these people from rural areas have natural ways of adaptation like sleeping on open terrace, wearing turbans, etc., which they are not able to follow when they shift to Delhi. Also, it matters where a person is coming from. For example, a person from Kashmir would be able to cope much less to heat compared to a person coming from a hotter region.”
The plan is expected to be ready by 2019. However, given the adverse forecast of a hot summer ahead, experts have decided not to wait for it and issue heat advisories with the help of the municipalities during peak heat this summer.
Delhi is late in formulating a heat action plan as compared to other cities mainly because of multiple agencies and lack of coordination between them. The plan would be adopted first by the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and then by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC).
Hospitals are prepared
Despite the lack of any systemic approach by the Delhi government to combat heat stress cases in the city, government-run hospitals are geared up to treat patients affected by extreme heat and humidity.
Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital (LNJP) in central Delhi, which has registered three to four cases of patients suffering from heat stress per day last year during the summer months, is not taking any chances this year.
“We are fully equipped to deal with heat stress related cases this year. The emergency section of the hospital is fully air-conditioned with around seven doctors available per shift and ten nurses to handle patients who come to casualty. There are paramedics in good number to attend to emergencies. We have 55 beds available in the Medicine emergency section where we will treat patients who will be admitted for heat stroke, dehydration and other heat related complaints. We have also stored adequate fluids for IV drips and for hydrotherapy,” Ritu Saxena, chief of Accident and Emergency Section at LNJP hospital, told indiaclimatedialogue.net. “Circulars and notices have been sent out to all relevant departments to alert the emergency section on complaints of heat stress.”
The Chief Medical Officer of Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Namita Rai, said that the hospital has a well-equipped casualty section, fully air-conditioned and fitted with air purifiers. According to her, the hospital has stocked up on fluids for intravenous drips and medicines to deal with patients affected by the heat as temperature begins an upward swing.
K. K. Aggarwal, former president of the Indian Medical Association and a cardiologist, is of the opinion that both the central and state governments must put concerted efforts to raise awareness on the adverse effect of heat waves and how best to protect people from exposure to extreme temperatures in summer.
“Just as everyone is now aware of the pollution index, the government must also put out the heat index in different parts of Delhi so that citizens are aware and can avoid staying out in the heat for too long,” he told indiaclimatedialogue.net. “The best indicator of someone suffering from heat stress is to do the arm pit test. If the armpits are dry, then it is a sign of heat affecting the body, which could lead to exhaustion, diarrhoea and even heat stroke. Wear light cotton clothes, keep yourself hydrated and avoid moving out in the heat when heat index is high.”

Student Researcher: Theresa Chen
Mentor: Satish Puri
Project Description
Rapid melting of sea ice is one of the most urgent environmental problems today. In order to better understand the effects of climate change, it is important to develop accurate models of sea ice change. This project will use machine learning to predict the thickness of sea ice around polar regions. Sea ice thickness is not only an important indicator of how the polar oceans are responding to a warming climate but also useful for forecasting of future changes in the polar regions.
Data used for this project was collected from NASA's Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat‐2), launched in 2018 to measure accurate surface heights for understanding changes in ice sheets and sea ice around the arctic. The satellite uses lidar remote sensing to collect elevation (height) data for different locations around the earth which is used to estimate the thickness of the sea ice..
Student Research Activities
Research activities encompass many aspects of data science: data cleaning, data wrangling, data visualization, implementing and evaluating machine learning models for accuracy, etc.In the spring of 2017, the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority (WKCDA) organised a competition to develop a Temporary Pavilion, located within the Nursery Park at the West Kowloon Cultural District. The goal of the competition was to provide an innovative architectural space to be enjoyed by the public and to raise tje profile and visibility of WKCD is a project for Hong Kong people. Located near the waterfront, the site provides views across the harbour and is a natural congregation point for the public. The pavilion was to act as an informal space where the public can sit and relax, and was to be capable of being utilised as a venue for talks, workshops or small events and potentially hosting small performances.
LEAD responded to this brief by proposing a hyper light-weight temporary structure with unique architectural qualities, made from ‘objets trouvés’ (found objects) like fabric and aluminium tent poles. The design is conceived is an ideal meeting place for visitors, hosting a variety of flexible programs, events and activities. Its playful and dynamic geometry sparks an iconographic moment across the West Kowloon harbourfront. Its massing, orientation, and openings align with the city’s sun path and site circulation networks. Visitors find a sheltered space to gaze across the waterfront while enjoying public activities and programming.
In dialogue with temporary architectural additions found ad-hoc in Hong Kong canopies, enclosures, and shelters, this pavilion combines straightforward low-tech on-site craftsmanship with innovative computational design and engineering power for the invention of a new event space. The organically-shaped tension membrane creates an elegant shelter and podium area that activates the surrounding landscape. By bridging digital technologies with the limitations of practice, its architecture links design methodologies with the realities of professional practice, construction materials and on-site skills.
LEAD’s proposal was selected as one of the highlighted entries.

By Ryan Alexander.
The F-35’s failures go beyond its exorbitant cost. For a plane that is supposed to be stealthy, it is an order of magnitude louder than the planes it is replacing, particularly the short take-off and landing variant being tested for the Marine Corps. Software development for the plane has fallen behind schedule, as detailed in a recent report by the Pentagon’s Office of Test and Evaluation. This, in turn, has a negative impact on the ability to complete development and to flight test the initial combat software package prior to the Marine Corps’ stated desire to have operational aircraft in the last half of 2015.
In many ways, the F-35 was doomed from the start. The plane was originally conceived as a so-called “joint” development program with the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, all looking to produce a next generation aircraft to replace, among others, the F-16, the F/A-18 and the AV-8B. And here is where the problems start. These three aircraft have vastly different capabilities, and these three military services have vastly different requirements.
The theory behind these joint aircraft development programs is that, by all three services pitching in to develop the aircraft, duplicative development costs can be avoided and the government saves a lot of money. That’s the theory. But these huge joint development programs rarely end well, as anyone who remembers the A-12 can attest.
The Rand Corporation recently found that joint development leads to increased risk, increased complexity and increased weight in aircraft programs. And all three of these issues will lead, eventually, to increased costs.
Even if you accept the current Pentagon cost estimates for what each variant of the F-35 will cost, and we think these estimates are low, there are real savings to be had in ending the F-35 program and continuing on with the most modern versions of the current aircraft. In the final version of the Department of Defense Authorization bill for this fiscal year, there is a total of $29.2 billion to be spent on procurement of all Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force aircraft. Of that, about 20 percent of the total will be spent just on F-35 procurement: $6 billion. The next highest level of procurement funding for any aircraft in the bill is $3.2 billion for 16 maritime patrol aircraft for the Navy – the P-8. There is also $1.9 billion in R&D for the F-35. That brings spending on the F-35 in fiscal year 14 to just under $8 billion.
At Taxpayers for Common Sense, we did a recent analysis of the money the Pentagon could save by buying F-16s and F/A-18s instead of F-35s. Just in the current fiscal year, more than $4.5 billion could be saved by buying the most capable, newest versions of these aircraft rather than the F-35s that were in the budget request. And keep in mind, the F/A-18 and the F-16 are among the most highly capable military jets anywhere in the world. You don’t need to take my word for it. Here is what the Navy says about the F/A-18. And this is how the Air Force describes the F-16. We are not in danger of being outclassed in the air by likely adversaries.
So while Lockheed Martin may be able to skate by the controversy in Sochi and let Under Armour take all the heat, this massive defense contractor shouldn’t be allowed to fly under the radar on the issue of the enormous, and mounting, costs of the F-35.

Some questions might be hard, and you might get sad or uncomfortable answering them. However, it is very important that you answer all questions as the hearing is about you, your fear. At the end of the hearing, your lawyer will also have an opportunity to ask you further questions and will also provide with oral submission as to why your claim should be allowed based on the evidence submitted, the case law and the regulations. The hearing can take from 1 hour to 5-7 hours and can be adjourned to another day if not concluded. You might get the decision at the end of the hearing verbally – however, this is rare. Most of the time the decision will be sent in the mail about 30 to 60 days later.
Many refugee claimants decided to have legal representation – we highly recommend this given the administrative process for submitting an adequate and complete refugee claim. Your representative will assist you in preparing for the hearing. This is important as the refugee determination process is complex and involves many different steps and procedures.On 8th November, 2021, Telangana Social Impact Group (TSIG), the CSR Cell of the Telangana Government organised the ‘T-SIG COVID-19 Warriors Event’ at HICC, Hyderabad.

This section covers each of the chosen characters in detail, including the following aspects: the things you’ll need to replicate the costume, the accessories, and some really cool trivia about the character. Additionally, we’ll tell you what makes each of the Overwatch characters we picked wonderful choices for cosplaying.
So, without further ado, dive right in!
1. McCree
McCree, one of Overwatch’s Damage Heroes, is the epitome of precision, stealth, and speed. His weapon, known as the Peacekeeper, operates with a unique technique that makes it really powerful and equally unpredictable.
McCree is known for being a strategist and has abilities like the Combat Roll, Flashbang, and Deadscan. What makes McCree all the more interesting is his uber-cool attire. If you want to replicate the look of this star Overwatch marksman, you’ll need the following things:
Cowboy Hat
This is an essential item, as McCree is rarely even seen without his cowboy hat on. His hat has a distinctive brown shade, with a black belt-like strap running through the middle. Further, the strap features gold buckles. You can easily find this hat online.
DIY: You can try to refashion an old hat or create a new one using brown and black cloth pieces, and some golden felt for the buckles.
Red and Orange Flannel Scarf
The Red Flannel Scarf gives McCree a truly formidable look, so it’s something that you cannot miss. While the scarf is predominantly red in color, there are distinct patterns of orange that you need to get right.
You’ll find many scarfs online, but finding an exact lookalike of McCree’s scarf can be hard.
DIY: Can your fingers make the sewing machine dance to their tune? If yes, feel free to take a plain red flannel scarf and sew the patterns onto it with orange cloth or ribbons. There are many pictures of McCree and his scarf online that you can use for reference!
Brown Shirt and Pants
McCree seems to be obsessed with brown garments. Considering that he wears body-hugging clothes, try to find a brown shirt and a pair of brown pants that fit you perfectly. If you’re looking to nail McCree’s look to the T, you can also throw in a pair of brown leather chaps.
Gloves
While McCree’s weapon Peacekeeper is swanky enough by itself, it looks a lot cooler in the marksman’s ornately gloved hands. There are two types of gloves you’ll need: brown leather gloves and latex gloves.
The latex gloves need to have shades of gray, with tinges of silver. While putting on the gloves, make it a point to slip on the brown leather gloves only after wearing the latex gloves first.
If you are not very particular about getting all the elements right, you can consider dropping the latex gloves altogether.
Golden Armor
You can easily find gold armor in toy stores near you, or you can buy it online. Just ensure that the armor makes for a snug and comfy fit.
Cowboy Boots
Get a truly striking pair of brown cowboy boots to complete the trademark McCree look. If you don’t own a pair yourself, you can consider asking others who might have one. Alternatively, you can purchase them online.
Remember to buy boots that can reach your knees.
Accessories
McCree has quite a few accessories, and listed below are the ones you must have:
- A puff cigar
- A revolver (to represent the Peacekeeper)
- A gun holder that goes around your waist
You can easily find toy revolvers in your local toy stores at super affordable rates. And, finding a puff cigar should also be a breeze.
DIY: If you aren’t keen on buying a gun holder (holster), you can easily make one out of cardboard. You’ll need the following materials: cardboard, corrugated cardboard, glue, and a couple of clamps.
Step 1: Cut the cardboard into the necessary shapes
Step 2: Also, set aside a few small pieces of cardboard to make the clasp
Step 3: Glue the various cardboard pieces together
Step 4: Paint the assembled belt brown to achieve the leather finish
McCree Trivia
Here’s some interesting scoop about McCree that you simply cannot miss:
- His catchphrase is: “Justice ain’t gonna dispense itself”
- His full name is Jesse McCree
- McCree’s videogame design was inspired by Chris Metzen’s sketch of a character known as Prospector Logann
2. D.Va
It won’t be wrong to say that D.Va is one of the most popular and well-liked Overwatch characters. Classed as a Tank Hero, D.Va is a super-skilled mech pilot. She has top-notch mech weapons to complement her skills, namely the Fusion Cannons and the Light Gun.
Add abilities like Self-destruct and the Defense Matrix to the mix, and you’ve got yourself a character to reckon with. If you’re someone who thrives in competitive situations, D.Va is who you should be cosplaying. Here’s what you’ll need to achieve her look:
The Bodysuit
In Overwatch, D.Va wears a custom bodysuit that’s not easy to replicate. Her suit is dominated by shades of blue, black, and pink. Considering that the costume is crucial, it would be best if you bought it online.
The D.Va costume is usually made of spandex and matte leather, making it super comfortable to wear.
Wig
D.Va is characterized by long and wavy brown locks. If you don’t have long or wavy hair naturally, you can consider wearing a wig. You’ll find that the wig is easily available online.
Makeup
You’ll need some makeup to nail D.Va’s look. Many YouTube tutorials can help you in this regard. However, we have also listed the steps below:
Step 1: Apply moisturizer on your face
Step 2: Apply any face serum
Step 3: Once you have applied the face serum, follow it up with some foundation
Step 4: Apply a fairly thick coating of eyeliner to your eyes
Step 5: If you’d like to, you can opt to wear a pair of fake eyelashes
Step 6: Use a face contour cream to achieve a complete look
Step 7: For the lips, keep it minimal with very light shades of orange. You can seal the look with some lip gloss
Step 8: You can use lipstick or body paint for the whiskers. Just make sure that you get the shade right
The Boots
Like the costume, D.Va’s boots can prove to be hard to replicate. That’s why it is recommended that you buy them online. Alternatively, if you happen to have a pair of white rain boots or gumboots lying around, you can use those.
In that case, you’ll have to paint the heel region grey, with a coating of black color to go with it.
Accessories
When it comes to D.Va, the following accessories become really important:
- The D.Va Headset
- The D.Va Handgun
Considering that D.Va is a really popular Overwatch hero, you can easily grab a D.Va Headset and Handgun online. Or you can reach out to fellow Overwatch fans. If someone has cosplayed D.Va before, they’re sure to have the accessories you need.
D.Va Trivia
Even if you call yourself a die-hard D.Va fan, there are a few facts about her that you need to know:
- Her real name is Hana Song
- She has donned many hats with absolute ease – professional gamer, mech pilot, and an actress
- Quite fittingly, her catchphrase is: “I play to win”
3. Mei
A Damage Hero in Overwatch, Mei has the wizard-like ability to bend the weather to her will. She’s an incredibly strong fighter, and her weapons and abilities like the Endothermic Blaster, the Cryo-Freeze, the Ice Wall, and the Blizzard make her a force to reckon with.
While Mei might not be a conventional cosplay choice, there’s still a lot of fun to be had! To transform yourself into this Overwatch character, you’ll need the following:
The Fur Overcoat
Mei’s Fur Overcoat is a key aspect of the costume. Her overcoat is mostly dominated by blue and white colors, with fur lining throughout the edges. While you can buy the overcoat online, this piece of costume has something for the DIYers as well!
DIY: If you have an overcoat with a design that resembles Mei’s, you can consider attaching fur on the edges with superglue. You can also sew the fur if that’s more comfortable for you.
Blue Pants
This part of the costume is probably going to be the easiest to replicate. Mei’s pants look very similar to a regular pair of blue denims. And, that’s all you’ll need. You can achieve the exact look of the pants with a little DIY.
DIY: Take felt cloth, chart paper, or ribbons that are light blue in color. Cut them into long strips, such that they cover the entire length of the denims. Fix them onto your pants with some superglue, and you’ll be good to go!
The Gloves
In Mei’s case, the gloves happen to be one of the headline features of the costume. There are many complex aspects of the gloves that are hard to replicate, so you can consider buying them online.
The Boots
You’ll need black or brown knee-length boots that have straps running around them. As was the case with the overcoat, you can attach a layer of fur across the opening of the boots. For added effect, you can attach spikes to the boot soles.
Here’s a tip to keep in mind: Ensure that the boots are roomy, as that’s the kind of effect you’d want to aim for.
Wig
In Overwatch, Mei has short, dark hair that is tied up as a top bun. You won’t need a wig if your natural hair color resembles Mei’s or if you’re willing to color your hair.
If neither of the two options mentioned above is lucrative, you can always nail the look with a wig. It would be helpful if you looked at Mei’s hairstyle and color before choosing a wig that is just right for the occasion.
Accessories
Take a look at the accessories you’ll need to compliment your costume:
- A pair of black-rim glasses
- A replica of Mei’s primary weapon, the Endothermic Blaster
- A multi-purpose belt running across the waist
For reference, Mei’s multi-purpose belt looks exactly like the one an electrician wears to keep all his tools in one place.
Further, the Endothermic Blaster is the key accessory. You can purchase it online or ask around in your circle of Overwatch fans.
Mei Trivia
Has Mei got you intrigued? Read our trivia to know more about her:
- Mei is originally a climatologist by profession
- Although Mei looks young, her chronological age is 40!
- Her catchphrase embodies her fighting spirit and never-say-die attitude: “Our world is worth fighting for”.
4. Tracer
Everything about Tracer is super cool. She’s a Damage Hero and one of the most skilled Overwatch agents in the game. What makes her truly amazing is her ability to ‘blink’ her way through space and time.
When coupled with her weapons, Pulse Pistols, and Pulse Bombs, Tracer’s speed and close-range exploits make her a hero whose motto of ‘righting the wrongs’ is truly noble and inspiring.
If Tracer is the one you’d like to cosplay this time around; you’ll need the things listed below:
The Bodysuit
Tracer’s bodysuit is big on shades of fiery yellow that tapers into equally fiery shades of orange towards the bottom. If you try to recreate the bodysuit by yourself, the chances are that you might miss a few details.
You can purchase the Tracer bodysuit online.
The Brown Jacket
Tracer’s brown jacket is not only funky but also very easy to replicate. You can use any brown winter coat that’s been lying around in your closet. However, there are a few boxes that your brown coat needs to check:
- It should only reach up to your waist
- It should have a zipper
- Preferably, it should be a leather jacket
The Gloves
Usually, when you buy Tracer’s bodysuit online, you’ll find that the gloves come along with it. Therefore, you needn’t worry much about this aspect of the costume.
However, if you’re willing to depart from the blueprint and drop the white attachments that Tracer’s gloves typically have, things can become a lot easier for you. A pair of regular, black biker gloves will suffice.
The Wig
Tracer’s mopped brown locks are instrumental in lending her the no-nonsense look. If you already sport cropped hair, you can achieve Tracer’s hair-do with minimal effort. A bottle of hair gel and hair styling tools are all you’ll need.
Alternatively, you can pay a quick visit to a costume store near you and check out the wigs they offer. Try to find a wig that matches Tracer’s hairstyle, and you’ll be set!
The Boots
At first glance, Tracer’s boots can seem to be deceptively simple. They almost resemble a regular pair of white Crocs. However, there’s more to them than what meets the eye.
Thankfully, since Tracer is a very popular Overwatch hero, you can find a pair of boots online. Or, if you know someone who has cosplayed her before, you might be able to borrow from them.
Accessories
Tracer has only two accessories, and she wears them with utmost grace and poise:
- A pair of yellow protective goggles
- A toy replica of her Pulse Pistols
Bear in mind that the yellow goggles need to be oversized. Also, you’ll need two Pulse Pistols.
Tracer Trivia
There’s a lot to love about Tracer’s fearless personality. Here are a few facts about her that you might not have known previously:
- Her catchphrase is: “Cheers, love! The cavalry’s here!”
- She used to be affiliated to the British Royal Air Force
- She plays a key role in reforming Overwatch
5. Soldier: 76
Are you looking to cosplay a character who is a warrior in the truest sense of the term? If this sounds like you, then Soldier: 76 is your man.
He started by being a part of the army and lost no time cementing his position as one of the best-trained warriors. Soldier: 76 is driven by a single goal: to discover the truth behind Overwatch’s collapse.
Armed with cutting-edge weapons such as the Helix Rockets and the Heavy Pulse Rifle, Soldier: 76 is the ultimate combat warrior you’d definitely want on your team.
Here’s a roundup of everything you’ll need to cosplay Soldier: 76:
The Soldier: 76 Jacket
Soldier: 76’s jacket is guaranteed to stand out anywhere, thanks to its wonderful color combination of blue, white, black, and red. What’s more, the jacket has the number ’76’ engraved in bold at the back.
On the flip side, it can be quite tricky to achieve the exact combination and material of the jacket.
So, if you’re particular about getting all the elements right, it would be a good idea to buy Soldier: 76’s jacket.
Black T-Shirt
Hands down, this has to be the easiest element of Soldier:76’s costume. After all, everyone has a black t-shirt in their closet. The t-shirt’s neck needs to have a silver lining, which you can easily add in a single rapid-fire DIY session.
DIY: Take a silver strip of felt cloth, ribbon, or any shiny material. Cut the strip to fit your t-shirt’s neckline. Stick it onto your t-shirt with superglue. For a more permanent result, you can sew the lining.
Grey Pants
If you thought that a regular pair of grey, formal pants would do the trick, think again! Soldier:76’s costume has a very glossy and rubbery finish. And your grey pants need to have that too. Try to find grey pants made of knitted fabric and ensure that they come with a leather finish.
The Boots and Gloves
If Soldier:76’s jacket was a tricky affair, the boots and gloves only serve to complicate matters further. Generally, you will get the boots and gloves as add-ons when you buy the jacket online.
DIY: You can replicate Soldier:76’s gloves by painting one side of your black biker gloves red. Alternatively, you can stick glossy pieces of red cloth too.
The Wig
Soldier: 76 has silver hair, which he wears in a short and cropped manner. To attain his hairdo, you’ll have to raid your local costume store or buy a wig online that meets all the specifications.
Accessories
Soldier:76 loves his accessories, and you’ll have a great time rocking them. See for yourself:
- Face Mask Helmet (with red goggles)
- A Pistol Belt
- A Soldier: 76 gun
- A Spring Air Pistol
- A shoulder belt
- Leg bags
- Boot tops
Soldier: 76 Trivia
Has curiosity got the cat? Jump right into some behind-the-scenes trivia on Soldier: 76:
- You know that he’s a pureblood soldier when his catchphrase reads: “We’re all soldiers now”
- His real name is John Francis ‘Jack’ Morrison
- He’s in his mid-fifties but can still send enemies packing with utmost ease. How cool is that!
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Now that you’ve got a taste of some of the coolest Overwatch Cosplay Costume Ideas, it’s time you’ve discovered answers to the questions that might have been nagging at you:
Question: What are the other Overwatch characters I can cosplay?
Answer: When it comes to Overwatch, the options are endless. I addition to the ones mentioned above, you can also consider cosplaying:
- Reaper – He’s the ultimate Overwatch villain
- Junkrat – His costume can prove to be super difficult to emulate. But, if you’re someone who loves challenges, this character is guaranteed to keep you super busy
- Ana – If the saying, “Age is just a number,” was a person, Ana would be that. Despite being 60 years old, she can do great things on the battlefield. She also has a swanky eye tattoo!
- Genji – Genji is who you get when a ninja meets a robot. His costume makes him a great cosplay choice for males and females alike.
Question: Can I modify the look and costumes of the characters?
Answer: This question is a bit tricky to answer. For starters, the costume and the look of the characters are what make them who they are. So, it would be best to get at least the important aspects right. For example, D.Va’s pink whiskers and Mei’s accessories.
As far as the costumes go, you might have a little flexibility. This is because, in Overwatch, characters come with cosmetic skins. After you’ve chosen your character, you can check out the cosmetic skins associated with them.
If you find the original outfit difficult to replicate, you can replicate a cosmetic skin instead.
Question: What are the DIY Materials I’ll require?
Answer: Thankfully, the materials you’ll need are those that you can easily find at your home. For instance, listed below are a couple of DIY materials you’ll need to cosplay as any Overwatch character:
- Strips of felt cloth or ribbon
- Paint of different colors
- Superglue and scissors
- Cardboard pieces
- A sewing machine (for McCree)

And if you incorporate these habits in your life for a number of years, there is a possibility that you could save enough to reach millions. And firstly, to do so, you will need to change your pre-existing habits. So check these ideas out & see how they can help you!
If there are any payments for things you don’t use, now is a great time to get rid of them. Cable, data, or gym memberships; if they aren’t needed then why pay for them? Looking into your monthly spending is a great way to shave off your spending and increase your savings.
Rather than buying products during the day, go during the evening (after 6 PM). At this time, stores will be more likely to discount products in an attempt to move them and minimize their amount of waste or money loss. Most of these products can still be consumed, or safely frozen for use at a later date.
Rather than showing loyalty to one particular company, it can be more beneficial to switch companies. This could be for your utility bills, but other service providers can also be changed. You could also extend this to other stores, such as where you get your clothes or food. Any saving is a good thing.
Items such as washing detergent can be bought in bulk. Bulk prices tend to be cheaper in the long run. And over time, this can save you a lot of money that can be put aside into your savings.
Rather than spending money without thought, it can be important to put a budget in place. This will show you what money you have coming in, and where it should be going out. It may also help you avoid deviating from your savings plan, or indulging in impulsive purchases.
Rather than paying for new or designer items, hit the thrift shops instead. These can have some great items of clothing or furniture at a fraction of the normal retail price. You can then put the money you have saved aside.
Saving money doesn’t have to be boring. By making a few lifestyle changes you will be able to increase your savings and reach your goals.

Building A Legacy and Preparing For The Future With Estate Planning
Why have an estate plan? Many believe estate planning is a complicated and expensive tax avoidance scheme for the wealthy only. That is a misconception. For most of us, estate planning is merely leaving instructions for the management and distribution of your assets during your lifetime in the event of disability and upon death. It is also planning for healthcare and end of life decisions in the event of illness and disability. Estate planning is protecting the vulnerable and providing for your loved ones. Estate planning is really life planning.
The tools used in estate planning include Wills, Trusts, Powers of attorney, Advance Directives and Living Wills.
Estate planning in Tennessee is an important step in preparing for life, no matter what size estate you have. If you own property, if you have a family, if you have preferences for end of life medical care, if you want to give your loved ones comfort and direction at an emotionally devastating time, you should have an estate plan. Through carefully constructed legal documents you can:
- Make wise choices about how to distribute your property and protect your legacy for future generations.
- Designate someone to act on your behalf if you become incapacitated.
- Select a trusted guardian for your children.
- Outline your wishes regarding medical treatment and end-of-life care.
- Reduce the tax burden on your estate and your heirs.
- Prevent probate disputes and avoid probate.
- Plan for Medicaid eligibility and long-term care options.
An estate planning attorney can help you craft an estate plan that will accomplish your goals and address your needs. If you already have a Will or Trust it is important to periodically review and update your documents, especially if you have gone through a recent life changing event such as the death of a spouse, divorce or the birth of a child.

Losing a loved one is one of the most difficult experiences we go through in life. The loss of a loved one often comes without warning and is a shock to those left behind. Nothing prepares you for the pain that comes with losing someone. There are details to sort out. There are immediate decisions to be made about funeral and burial arrangements. There are important documents to locate and secure. There are insurers and financial institutions to notify. Often, your loved ones are left searching for answers to questions they didn’t anticipate at a time of grief and sorrow. You can make the experience less stressful by making some basic decisions in advance.
While thinking about death is unpleasant, having a well thought out estate plan in place puts you in complete control of your affairs at the end of life and will provide you the peace of mind of knowing you have done what you can to spare your loved ones the expense, delay and frustration of managing your affairs if you become disabled or when you die. Having an estate plan will not alleviate the pain that your loved ones will experience at your death but, it can provide them a certain level of comfort and peace of mind knowing that your were prepared in advance and left a roadmap to follow. Planning for death or disability is a loving act for your family.
What if you are responsible for carrying out your loved one’s last wishes or administering an estate? Serving as Executor or Administrator comes with a lot of responsibility and possible liability if you don’t have advice from an experienced attorney. Probate law and procedure can be complicated. Much of the advice you hear from friends or read online is either wrong or not applicable to your circumstances.
Fortunately, attorney Phillip R. Walker has the knowledge and experience necessary to walk you through the entire process from beginning to end. Often, probate administration can be avoided with the right strategy. Our firm handles all aspects of probate, estate and trust administration. Our Bartlett estate planning attorney can also represent you in court for any estate-related disputes including Will contests, removal of executors and trustees, recovering assets and defending against invalid claims.
Speak With A Tennessee Estate Planning Attorney
Why should you bother to consult an experienced lawyer about estate planning when Wills and Trust documents can be purchased from the Internet? A fill in the blank form may be easy and cheap, but as the old saying goes, “You get what you pay for.” Forms cannot explain how to structure your accounts to minimize or eliminate the need for probate or, how to protect vulnerable beneficiaries from losing important government benefits or being in taking advantage of and losing their inheritance. We offer advice, counsel and direction based on experience, not a “one size fits all” fill in the blank forms approach.

If an artist develops characters, an animator perfectly enlivens them in the three-dimensional space with the help of digital technologies like 3ds Max, Maya, ZBrush, Marvelous Designer, Substance Painter, Houdini, Cinema 4D.
It is enumerated that these key 3D animation tools duly allow acumen experts to move objects and characters in any direction, thus, adeptly making them more believable and realistic in various environments. Moreover the 3D artists often participate in few early stages to provide required services and assure proper character with environment design.
Interestingly 3D animation is largely used in films, cartoons, commercials, and, especially, in the video game industry. To develop 3D animation, there are quality specialist animation makers with sound technical knowledge and in-depth practical experience with graphics computer software. In addition the experts can use any other software to meet specific requirement. The 3D animation studio has own approach to develop animations and unique style.
Important Stages of 3D Animation
Stage of Pre-Planning
It is enumerated that Pre planning of all stages is necessary for the animation. What are the objects/characters that will be animated? At this key stage, it is important to set objectives for each scene. Thumb nailing can be top way to greatly implement a lot of ideas in posing, actions, composition, etc.
Stage of Blocking
They are also called a layout design where the main poses of the whole animation established and shown. They are type of script for a 3D animator to follow in the process. By efficiently going through the whole scene in thumbnails, acumen specialist set the timing and “blocks” the placement of objects in each animation frame. Moreover they also manipulate on a frame-by-frame basis. In addition you have two techniques of blocking utilizing stepped or spline curves.
Stage of Proper lighting
It is also known that 3D models must be under proper light in animation. For that particular reason, numerous virtual light sources can be utilized to real-life scenes even if they are primarily related to virtual reality.
Final Stage of Rendering
So naturally when 3D models are textured and lit as needed, the rendering process begins. A specialist transfers developed images to compositing programs and adeptly extracts the necessary data from them. Then they are combined to develop the final animation frames.

It helps to encourage customers to continue to shop or use the services of the company.
Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)Loyalty is earned, not bought. It is important to understand that loyalty is a two-way relationship. And the more interaction, the higher the involvement. The aim of the AR loyalty programs we've created is to increase engagement at all stages of the buying process. That's why it's important to encourage interactions with your product.
FMCG brands constantly have to overcome challenges to attract new customers. Therefore, it is very important to retain existing loyal customers. Mainly FMCG brands sell their products through intermediaries (supermarkets, online stores, pharmacies, gas stations) and have no direct influence on their customers.
AR/VR solutions help to bypass the intermediate layers and directly reach the end consumer. This enables the FMCG brand to connect with its customers and increase product loyalty.
The consumer's desire to choose a certain brand over and over again does not arise on its own. It is the result of the smart actions of marketers, who always have to use the most effective and relevant tools. Without a doubt, loyalty programs with AR/VR are one of them.
These innovative marketing tools allow you to gain direct communication with your customer. All the customer needs to do is point the smartphone camera at your product packaging.
A great opportunity to take your brand or service to a new level, the level your competitors don’t even know about yet.
Of course, creating additional value for your customers is important. Still, the value of a reward to customers is not determined by its value alone. Sometimes it's enough to pay attention, to understand the desires and needs of your end customers.
The value of rewards must be matched with the effort required to obtain them, otherwise, customers will quickly lose interest and interaction will decline.
We use proven and tested methods to create innovative loyalty programs. That is why we can help you understand your target audience's true value and give them that value.
You'll be able to reach new markets and increase sales thanks to the most advanced technologies we provide you with.Get the consultation
It works for all kinds of products in packaging. Packaging becomes more valuable because it turns into a communication line between the brand and the customer:

We take into account all the wishes and needs of the FMCG brand to create a ready-made working loyalty system.

# # #The activation of Ras by SOS
The link between tyrosine kinases and Ras activation is provided by a nucleotide exchange factor known as Son-of-Sevenless (SOS). Our group has provided a near complete structural description of SOS, in collaboration with
Dafna Bar-Sagi
(NYU), and we made the unexpected discovery that SOS has two binding sites for Ras, and is itself dependent on Ras for its own activation (
Boriack-Sjodin
et al, Nature
1998
;
Margarit
et al., Cell
2003
). This unanticipated feedback loop in Ras activation by SOS was later shown by others to underlie the sharp response of T-cells to the strength of input stimuli. By reconstituting the Ras activation reaction on lipid vesicles, we have shown that SOS integrates multiple signals at the membrane before activating Ras, in collaboration with the group of
Jay Groves
(Gureasko
et al., Nat Struct Mol Biol
2008)
.
The mechanisms by which the activity of SOS is controlled are unexpectedly complex, and different from those of related nucleotide exchange factors. This diversity in the regulation of related signaling proteins is common, and runs counter to our expectation that important mechanisms would be conserved. In an
“Insight” article in Nature (2007)
, Dr. Kuriyan and
David Eisenberg
(UCLA) point out that colocalization, such as at the membrane, can amplify the effect on one protein of random mutations in another protein and can therefore, through natural selection, lead to random interactions between proteins being strengthened and to a startling variety of complex allosteric controls.

Xisca Perello âge, Maison à Vendre Cancún, Paul Biraben Humoriste, écriture Poétique En 4 Lettres, Maes Street Rap Genius, Carte Rigolote Gratuite,December twenty-fourth marked the six month anniversary since the finalization of my divorce. When I tell people I have not spoken to lately that my divorce is now complete, most people instinctively congratulate me. But are congratulations really what are in order?
I never thought much about divorce before my own. Of course, I would hear in passing that someone I knew was getting divorced, or was already divorced. But as the child of a widow, the sense of loss that follows divorce always paled in comparison to watching the anguish my mother went through losing a spouse that I never paid divorce much mind. How misguided and insensitive I was.
My mother became a widow at 39 years old, the same age I was when my husband left me. That year, as my thirty-ninth birthday drew near, I could not help but feel a sense of foreboding. I was now the same age my mother was when my 41 year-old father suffered a massive heart attack and died suddenly. Blowing out the candles on my thirty-ninth birthday cake, as my 41 year-old husband sat beside me, the similarities were not lost on me. That I just needed to get through this year was my only thought. Then history would not, could not, repeat itself.
Four months later my husband would walk out the door and never return to live in our home again. He did not die. Worse, he chose to leave. And I had to let him go.
The emotional war that I waged within myself after he left, a war of would’ve, should’ve, and could’ve, took its toll on me both physically and mentally. For three months, I could not eat. I could not sleep. I could not think of anything except the loss I believed would ravage my mind and body forever.
In all fairness, no one ever promised marriage would be easy. But no one ever warned me that the period after divorce would not necessarily be better right out of the gate. Instead, the pain only proved different, my loneliness merely displaced.
Although my marriage was lackluster on a good day, my mind continues to play tricks on me, toying with me in my darkest hour that perhaps I would have been better off fighting harder to stay in a bad marriage rather than being alone as I am today. After all, my ex-husband still remains the devil I know.
But, the truth be told, he is not the devil. He is only a man, with human failings, just like the rest of us. Fear, it turns out, remains my satanic and maniacal combatant in this uphill battle to redefine and rebuild my life as a single divorced mother, both a monumental and arduous struggle that consumes my every waking moment.
Facing the unknown is daunting. Doing it alone, even harder. I have already met my share of middle-aged “devils” on the road to meeting my soul mate and, to date, I have not yet met the man I am supposed to be with. But I do believe he is out there, looking for me, too. I just need to be patient, although that is difficult, as well.
So, please, do not congratulate me on my divorce. But do not pity me either. Just tell me you are sorry. For what does not matter.Description

Exported By exportyourstore.comA island nation with a great seafaring tradition and history of invasion and occupation that became a republic two years after Ireland. Why Indonesia of course and one of the leading lights of the Celtic-Punk scene are The Working Class Symphony.
Over the years that this site has existed we have reviewed many Celtic-Punk releases from Indonesia. In fact I’d go so far as to say that the scene there rivals Germany in it’s number of bands away from the
traditional Irish/ Celtic diaspora communities. Tenholes, Black Rawk Dog, The Cloves And The Tobacco, Rain In Summer, Dirty Glass have all graced these pages but it was the magnificent Wind From The Foreign Land compilation that really exposed the Celtic-Punk scene to many outside the region. Featuring fourteen bands it is still one of the best compilation albums I have ever heard. Of course todays band The Working Class Symphony were one of the highlights and have gone on to feature here several times subsequently, the last time being August last year.
Founded in 2010 in Surakarta, in central Indonesia, a couple of good friends (one a drunk and the other a musician!) were working together in an internet cafe listening to Irish pub song compilations. Inspired by the music it sparked an idea to get together with some other friends and play similar music. When this became a solid group shortly afterwards they decided to take the name The Working Class Symphony to reflect their roots and positive attitude.
Life in this country is already very difficult, if it still has to be added by listening to mainstream music as it is today … Really it will be FORGETTING..There is no other way than making music that can be uplifting … God Save The Working Class !!!!!
So having missed their 10th anniversary due to the Covid lockdown they see in their 11th with the new EP Mulat Sarira Hangrasa Wani. Recording did actually begin last year at the Biru Solo Studios but were delayed until recently. For those of you not too fluent in Indonesian the phrase translates roughly as “brave with sincerity to see one’s shortcomings”.
The Working Class Symphony in no particular order: @alby.moreno – Guitar/ Vocals * @andreaspyex – Lead Vocals * @mistergomz – Bass * @ami.ragil.sagita – Bagpipes * @erwin_ardz – Tin Whistle * @bimoaryp – Banjo/Mandolin @dannyfvckinshit : Drums @tuan.duaempat : Violin
Their are six songs here. Four new ones a previously released single and a cover. The EP begins with ‘Wani Perang’ and the drone of bagpipes soon gives way to the rest of the band and this is top quality Celtic-Punk. It owes a lot to the sound of Oi! (another genre popular in the underground music scene there) with its catchy rockin’ tune, gang vocals, great hooks and the pure ‘pint in the air’-ness about it! Several elements at play here that all work great together.
Next up is ‘Alerta Song’. This came out as a single last year and is a tribute to Cornel Simanjuntak an important figure in the development of Indonesian music. The song includes many of Cornel’s words and still inspire many today.
The Working Class Symphony dedicate this song to Cornel. With straightforward lyrics, as a picture of the reality that is happening here. Finally, keep on loving our country no matter what happens until the end of closing of your eyes… Freedom.
‘Don’t Forget Your Roots’ sees the Symphony take a much more Punk/ Hardcore route but still with their trademark sound intact. Not a band to stand still and without the confines of a more traditional Celtic-Punk band The Working Class Symphony show their not afraid to get a bit heavy at times. We can only guess at the lyrics but I’m sure from the title we can all agree. A lot of the island’s Celtic-Punk bands play more Trad Folk based Celtic-Punk while The Working Class Symphony have always edged towards that early Dropkicks sound but on ‘Lelaki Bekarja Dan Kemaki’ they show they can do the trad Folk sound too. They continue in this style with ‘Sahabat Yang Telah Pergi’ and every Celtic-Punk release needs a ballad and this is this ones and it is terrific. Sung with passion and gusto it really does soar and it needed worry you that you can’t understand the words. Wrapping up the EP is a cover of ‘The Holy Ground’ and what a fantastic cover it is too. On hearing it I am actually a bit surprised it hasn’t been covered by more Celtic-Punk bands as it has the perfect chorus for shouting and banging tables! Made famous by The Dubliners and Luke Kelly and his dulcet tones here the guys give it the pub feel with plenty of oomph among the “fine girl you are” chorus. The best song here for me but I love the whole EP so I’ll probably change that to something else by the time this comes out. Lyrically The Working Class Symphony usual staples are that of hard work, football and the real events that surround them. To close with The Holy Ground is a real good touch and I’m sure Luke is looking down with a twinkle in his eye at a bunch of young Indonesians paying this tribute to him and Irish music.
The EP artwork is by good friend of the band Jahlo Gomez from Belukar and those with an interest in Indonesian Celtic-Punk will recognise his artwork from other bands releases and logos. It is great to hear from the band that for this release many people were asking for a physical release and has been not only across Indonesia but the entire world. All the great things about Celtic-Punk are present here. Think of the Claddagh ring and its motto of friendship, loyalty and love. That is The Working Class Symphonys message and I’ll leave off with their words
“We hope that this can be the embryo of the rebirth of the punk spirit with its various variations.
Keep on trying, towards infinity and beyond.”

AmphetamineShop.com is an internet pharmacy whose origins are still hidden. It sells medicine that stimulates the central nervous system. Some people use it to fight disorders. Others use it to stay awake. Quite a few depend on it for recreational purposes. You rarely see websites like this that exist to sell only one type of medical product. However, if you want cheap amphetamines, this is not the medical store to visit. Everyone that has used and then reviewed it has called the site a scam.
Domain Details
The domain was created on the 27th of April 2018. It is barely two years old. That isn’t a long time for an internet pharmacy to exist. In fact, it is quite short. Even worse is the fact that its registration is expected to expire in a few weeks. You see this with websites that don’t expect to survive for long online. Such platforms should scare you. They have nothing to lose. As such, they won’t hesitate to defraud you because they don’t have a particular reputation that they want to protect.
Related Websites
The store was awarded a 0 percent trust rating from ScamAdviser.com. It shares its server with websites. All the information surrounding its online activities has been reducted. That is very suspicious behavior. It has a low Alexa ranking which is a sign that it gets little to no visitors. The speed of its platform is slower than average. It is connected to Malaysia which is a high-risk country. It has no SSL certificate, so your communication with the website is not secure. You can probably see why ScamAdviser.com gave it a low trust rating.
Business Profile
The company has no business address, so you have no way of knowing where it comes from. You also don’t know where they get their medicine from. They promise to deliver their products in discrete packages that will keep your privacy intact.
If your package is lost along the way, they will ship it again for free or provide a refund. They only accept orders through their website. To buy medicine, you must browse their menu to find the drugs you want. Select the quantity you desire and then proceed to the check out page. To complete your submission, you are expected to provide some basic information associated with your address and chosen payment method.
Once you make the necessary payments, you must email the company a confirmation. Once this is done, you can sit back, relax and wait for your package to arrive. Of course, because this is a scam, don’t expect to actually receive your medicine. The store doesn’t have much of a business profile. You cannot query the business owner because their identity is hidden. You have no way of knowing for certain that you are dealing with a real pharmacy because their platform is littered with stock images rather than the pictures of real employees.
Regulatory Authorization
The website has no regulatory authority to do its work. It hasn’t been recognized by any organization that monitors pharmacies of this kind. This makes them especially dangerous because you have no one to turn to if your transactions with the platform go wrong.
Available Products
As their name says, the store sells amphetamines. Prescriptions are not required. It is unclear as to whether they sell generic or brand name drugs.
Payments and Deliveries
The prices advertised on this website seem low and attractive. But there is no telling whether or not the medicine you will buy is counterfeit. Payments are made via Bitcoin, Western Union, and MoneyGram. Deliveries are made using:
❋ Express Cargo Line
❋ FedEx
❋ DHL
Shipments to locations in the US cost $35. Shipments to destinations outside the US cost $50.
Reviews
The website has reviews on TrustPilot. However, all the customers that left a review have called it a scam. Apparently, the pharmacy expects you to buy medicine in bulk but it never delivers. Once you make your payment, the person operating the website stops responding to your messages.
Conclusion
The internet pharmacy earns a rating of 25%. Everyone that has ever used it has called it a scam. This accusation would be easy to dismiss if it had come from one person.
But you have to take it seriously because multiple customers have reported the same experience.
Pharmacy RankingWe have created a rating of online pharmacies which gained our trust on the basis of their verified certificates, great customer feedback and quality services. Have a look and find the best store satisfying your needs.

Lellenberg at the Red Circle's 50th-anniversary dinner at the National Press Club on November 20, 2000. Jon was an early member of the Red Circle, attending his first meeting in August 1971, and is the author of the novel Baker Street Irregular. Thanks to Jon for digging this remembrance out of his archives for us.

Giants in the Earth
Jon L. Lellenberg
"There were giants in the earth in those days," says Genesis 6:1-4,
and it was also true at the genesis of The Red Circle.
Some of them lived in Washington, D.C., and some came to visit.
I want to tell you about six of them tonight.
Felix Morley was the first, and of the six of them, had the most to do with Washington, for the most time. The Baker Street Irregulars were founded by Christopher Morley, of course — eldest of three brothers, graduates of Haverford College in Pennsylvania or Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, both where their father taught mathematics, then all three Rhodes Scholars at Oxford (a record to this day), and finally all Baker Street Irregulars.
Felix was the next oldest of the three brothers — “the Second Garrideb,” his brother Chris sometimes called him — and his birthday was January 6th. He became “The Second Stain” in the BSI, after a talk he gave about Sherlock Holmes and foreign policy complications at the BSI annual dinner in 1940, one later published in Edgar W. Smith’s 1944 anthology of Writings About the Writings, Profile by Gaslight.
And Felix, a foreign policy expert himself, had a very distinguished career in political affairs and journalism. After having been a reporter at the League of Nations in Geneva, and then in China in the 1920s, he came to Washington, earned a doctorate in international affairs, served as president of the Brookings Institution in the early 1930s, and then became editor of the Washington Post for the remainder of the decade, winning a Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing.
In 1940 he answered a call from Haverford College, and served as its president during World War II. But after the war he returned to Washington, and lived on Wetherill Place off Ward Circle while working as a news commentator for NBC radio. Chris Morley once told Edgar Smith that he got his news from Elmer Davis and from Felix. If so, he received two very different pitches. Elmer Davis was a Democrat, albeit a cynical one who once described Franklin Roosevelt as the kind of man who thought the shortest line between two points was a corkscrew. Felix Morley was a traditional Republican, for most of the 1930s and ’40s a Robert Taft conservative with a pronounced isolationist streak. In the 1950s and ’60s, though, after becoming president of the American Enterprise Institute, and moving it from New York to Washington, he leaned more in a libertarian direction. After retiring, he lived the rest of his life on Gibson Island near Annapolis, writing works of political philosophy and his autobiography For the Record. Felix Morley died in 1981.
Elmer Davis also had close ties to Christopher Morley, from the time they were Rhodes Scholars at Oxford together in 1911. Davis came from a small town in Indiana, but after his education, and some teaching of Latin in his hometown where his mother was a high school teacher, he went to New York to work for the Times, and spent ten years there as a reporter and then an editorial writer. He quit the newspaper to write freelance, both fiction and non-fiction magazine articles and books, doing so with fair success from 1925 on. Some light-hearted stories and novels of his were turned into movies, like his 1926 tale of speakeasy life Friends of Mr. Sweeney.
But when Hitler came to power in Germany, and Europe started sliding toward war again, Davis’s mood grew somber. Starting in 1936, he wrote a widely-noticed series of articles about the emerging crisis for Harper’s Magazine, assessing Hitler’s remilitarization of the Rhineland, the Munich Crisis, Hitler’s demands upon Poland, and the outbreak of war in September 1939. That was preceded by the Nazi-Soviet Pact in August which made it possible for Hitler to go to war, and with CBS’s Radio’s great newsman H. V. Kaltenborn away at the time, Davis was asked to fill in for him. It became a permanent appointment, Kaltenborn getting a new assignment and Davis becoming CBS’s principal nightly news commentator for the next two years.
All this time, Davis had been a close friend of Chris Morley’s, and part of his Three Hours for Lunch Club in the early 1930s. A Sherlock Holmes devotee since childhood — the generation, he once said, that witnessed the Return of Sherlock Holmes — he was a charter member of the BSI when it was founded in January 1934. Even before that, Davis was who Morley chose to review Vincent Starrett’s The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes for the Saturday Review of Literature; and Davis followed the BSI’s founding event with a whimsical Constitution & Buy Laws for it that Morley published in his Saturday Review in February ’34.
When Davis took the CBS job, though, his broadcast hour meant that he arrived late at BSI annual dinners in January; and after 1942’s he couldn’t at all, for the duration of the war. When Pearl Harbor brought America into the war, Davis felt, and said so publicly, that the Government here in Washington was managing war news badly; and to his dismay, FDR not only agreed, but in July 1942 added an Office of War Information to the bureaucracy, and appointed Elmer Davis its director.
For the rest of the war, and the rest of his life, he lived in a big comfortable apartment at 1661 Crescent Place, off 16th Street. OWI was a thankless job involving constant wrangling with the Army, the Navy, and the Censorship Office, frequent rivalry with the Office of Strategic Services over their disparate propaganda roles in the war, ceaseless bickering from Congress, and little support or even decisions one way or the other from FDR. But Davis fought tirelessly for the right of the American people to know as much as possible about how the war was going.
After it was over, Davis stayed in Washington to be a news commentator for the new ABC network. He continued to write, and became a major critic of Joseph McCarthy. He put a lifetime of political analysis and thinking in his 1954 book But We Were Born Free. But he never lost his sense of play, even appearing as himself in the 1951 science-fiction movie The Day the Earth Stood Still, set here in Washington. Elmer Davis died here in 1958, the year after Christopher Morley’s death.
Paul Gore-Booth was a temporary resident in Washington, an English diplomat. He was First Secretary at the British Embassy in the years immediately after World War II — and a suspect, for a time, as the Soviet spy at the British Embassy, codenamed Homer in intercepted communications, who turned out to be Donald Maclean, part of the Kim Philby spy-ring that fled to Moscow in 1951 after their guilt was revealed.
Gore-Booth came to the BSI’s attention by reviewing the new Baker Street Journal in 1946 for The Strand Magazine. Soon he was attending the BSI’s dinners in New York, then The Red Circle’s meetings in Washington. When he returned to London in the early 1950s, he became a founding member there of the Sherlock Holmes Society of London. He went on in a dual career to be, on its secular side, Permanent Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s senior career official, and in our realm, the chairman of the Sherlock Holmes Society of London.
When the Sherlock Holmes Society made its first pilgrimage to Switzerland, in about 1968, Gore-Booth played Sherlock Holmes in a re-creation of the struggle at the Reichenbach Falls with Professor Moriarty. There was a great deal of editorial comment about this in the British press, not to mention cartoons of the sort that Whitehall mandarins dread. But Gore-Booth withstood the lifted eyebrows. He could do that because he had eyebrows far more impressive than anybody else’s, great bushy ones more arresting than his critics’. His manner was absentminded, as if Britain had not exactly lost its empire, Paul had just mislaid it for a while; but he was in reality a very sharp foreign policy man, the first transatlantic Irregular, and “The Three Gables” in the BSI.
Allen Robertson was the first of three visitors to the early Red Circle I want to discuss: this one a visitor from Baltimore, as we move up the railroad line from Washington, D.C. He was a middle-aged lawyer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad when he emerged into view Irregularly in 1946. He had accidentally discovered the BSI’s existence through the brand-new Baker Street Journal that year, and when business next took him to New York City, he made time to go to General Motors Overseas Operations’ headquarters at 54th and Broadway and, without an appointment or warning of any sort, to accost the BSJ’s editor, the busy senior GM official Edgar W. Smith, at his office. Robertson listened to the startled but delighted Smith explain what the BSI was all about, including its then small number of scion societies, and went home and founded The Six Napoleons of Baltimore, in which he was active for many years thereafter as Napoleon No. 1.
He first attended a BSI annual dinner the following January, 1947, the last one held at New York’s Murray Hill Hotel before it was demolished to make way for a modern office building regretted deeply by the BSI to this day. There was a noisy throng of seventy men at that dinner, many of them ones Christopher Morley did not know or recognize in the hurly-burly of that evening, bothering him greatly. Robertson was so effusive that night in his well-watered enthusiasm for Baker Street Irregularity, that he made himself a “Hokinsonian” in Morley’s eyes, by asking him and others there for their autographs. The upshot was a sharply adverse reaction by Morley to what in his eyes the club he’d created was becoming. He declared that there would never be another BSI dinner, and was determined to make that stick.
With considerable difficulty over the rest of 1947, Smith managed to keep Morley from throwing the baby out with the bathwater, though the 1948 annual dinner was cancelled in favor of something smaller dubbed a “committee-in-camera” meeting at the Racquet Club on Park Avenue. Robertson could have gone down in history as the man who almost got The Baker Street Irregulars killed off, and been cast out. But though attendance was greatly reduced for this “committee-in-camera” meeting, and some never made their way back to the BSI’s dinners, Edgar Smith kept Robertson, and Robertson was there that night in January ’48. He made it from Baltimore despite the mammoth snowstorm which kept Morley at home on Long Island that night —a good thing, if the BSI was to continue as something more than a small circle of his own cronies, as the original BSI had been. Allen Robertson remained part of The Six Napoleons, The Red Circle of Washington, D.C., and the BSI itself for many years, as “The Reigate Squires” as well as Napoleon No. 1.
From Philadelphia to early Red Circle meetings came James Montgomery, one of the era’s best loved Irregulars. When he first visited our scion society he already possessed, at his specific request, the Titular Investiture of “The Red Circle,” BSI. He was a concert singer with a wonderful tenor voice — the BSI’s second and greatest songster, a favorite performer at the BSI annual dinners every January. An early item in his repertoire at the dinners was mimicking Irene Adler singing on an especially crackly early gramophone recording. Another was a sweet nostalgic song about Sherlock Holmes with lyrics set to the Irish tune “If All Those Endearing Young Charms.” Being from Pennsylvania, he also liked to entertain Irregulars with the songs Birdy Edwards sang that made the Scowrers cry, nineteenth-century torch songs like “I’m Sitting on the Stile, Mary” (or, “The Irish Immigrant”), which can make modern ears cry also, if not quite for the same reason.
But of all his repertoire, still on the BSI’s Top Ten today is “Aunt Clara.” This song, and you all know it, was Montgomery’s lasting triumph. It began life as a ribald song written in the 1930s by a non-Sherlockian couple here in Washington, the worse for drink at the time. While not published by them, it came to be privately but widely circulated as years passed, until one day Montgomery heard it at the Orpheus Club in Philadelphia where The Sons of the Copper Beeches met, and onto it Montgomery tacked a legendary aunt of his he claimed to be the Irene Adler of the Canon. Once he performed it at the BSI annual dinner in New York, the song and fable became an instant part of Irregular lore to this day. An entire history of it was eventually written and published by the late, great Irregular W. T. Rabe, of The Old Soldiers of Baker Street.
Montgomery was also a fine Canonical scholar, not only in the Baker Street Journal but a series of now greatly coveted Christmas books of his own, especially one about the illustrators of the Canon entitled A Study in Pictures. He was a co-founder of The Sons of the Copper Beeches in 1948, and in 1950 became one of the small number of men in the BSI invited to join the separate but more than equal society The Five Orange Pips, where for his nom de pip — the BSI’s investiture system is based upon the Pips’ tradition — he took the full, long, impressive string of titles of The King of Bohemia, though we Pips usually let it go at that, when we remember and honor him.
James Montgomery had only one flaw: a big heart, but a defective one, and it broke many other Irregulars’ hearts when he died all too soon at the age of fifty-seven in 1955. His son Bruce, who inherited his father’s musical talent, basically was musical direction at the University of Pennsylvania for forty years, and when he followed his late father into the BSI, it was as “The Red Circle” too.
Finally, in New York City’s environs, there was Edgar W. Smith, the best and wisest man the BSI has ever known. Barring, possibly but not definitely, Vincent Starrett, Smith was as beloved a figure the BSI has ever had, with a friendly face, welcoming manner, and heartwarming smile. In 1936, his boyhood love of Sherlock Holmes was revived by reading Starrett’s Private Life of Sherlock Holmes. He wrote to Starrett, who had him write to Christopher Morley; and soon Smith was writing to everyone in the BSI. From 1940 on, he was its Buttons-cum-Commissionaire.
Smith was a great contributor to the Writings About the Writings. He started writing scholarly papers in the late 1930s, and was thrilled when Morley ran one of them, “The Curious Incident of the Tour de Force,” in the Saturday Review of Literature in 1938. His first major publication came in 1939, Appointment in Baker Street, a comprehensive guide to all the men and women in the Sherlock Holmes stories. After that, he became the dominant figure in our scholarship. He edited a second volume of BSI Writings About the Writings, Profile by Gaslight, in 1944; in 1946, he launched the Baker Street Journal with himself as editor, and eventually editor and publisher both; and, in order to have available as pure an edition as possible of the Sacred Writings, he edited what I call the BSI edition of the Canon, the Limited Editions Club volumes issued in 1950 and 1952, with introductory essays by fellow Irregulars Starrett, Morley, Davis, Fletcher Pratt, Rex Stout, Anthony Boucher, and himself — still in print as Easton Press’s Leatherbound Sherlock Holmes. And throughout the 1950s he issued volume after red-covered volume of Irregular writings, current and historic.
It was an amazing level of activity for someone who, until retiring in 1954, had a very demanding day-job — a vice president of General Motors’ Overseas Operations in New York. He was very important there, and known far beyond GM as a foreign trade authority and management expert. He was central to both GM’s wartime mobilization and its planning for the postwar era. In philosophy he was a free-trader and New Deal Democrat, who made both Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman honorary members of the BSI. More time was spent on his hobby at work than was usual for senior executives, but he made no secret of it, even turning a series of secretaries into helpmates for BSI business; and no one at General Motors complained because Smith was also a tireless and efficient champion of GM interests.
Unlike most New York BSI, Smith loved scion societies. While The Five Orange Pips wasn’t a BSI scion, he became its Sixth Pip even before he was a Baker Street Irregular. In 1940 he was a co-founder of the BSI’s first scion society, The Speckled Band of Boston, and he soon came to call himself a Scion Society Circuit Rider. Whenever in Detroit on GM business, he attended Amateur Mendicant Society meetings. At least twice he got to Scowrers & Molly Maguires meetings in San Francisco. But quite regularly he attended meetings of The Dancing Men of Providence, The Sons of the Copper Beeches in Philadelphia, The Six Napoleons of Baltimore — and The Red Circle of Washington.
Smith had long wanted a BSI scion society in Washington, where he often came on business at the State Department and elsewhere, and belonged to the Army & Navy Club on Farragut Square. But while major figures like Elmer Davis and Felix Morley had not found the time, Karen Kruse, Svend Petersen, Dorothy Bissonette, and Patricia Parkman did and here we are fifty years later.
Edgar W. Smith continued to run the BSI after retirement from his new Morristown, New Jersey, home on a private street he got officially named Baker Street, until his greatly mourned death in September 1960. He was “The Hound of the Baskervilles’ in the BSI, an investiture never to be re-assigned.

Despite abundant research demonstrating good efficacy, pharmacotherapies for substance use disorders are underutilized. Buprenorphine holds promise to significantly increase the availability of medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder; yet despite dramatic increases in overdose deaths driven largely by prescription opioid use, only about half of DATA-waivered physicians prescribe buprenorphine.
Methods
This presentation describes a collaborative care model in an addiction treatment program with an opioid treatment program component partnered with community medical practices in order to: 1) increase the willingness of primary care physicians to deliver office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) with buprenorphine; and 2) enhance the quality of care for patients receiving OBOT services. A collaborative opioid prescribing (CoOP) model was devised, linking primary care sites with an addiction treatment program (Johns Hopkins Broadway Center; JHBC), such that JHBC provided the initial assessment, medication induction/stabilization, and ongoing counseling, while the primary care sites provided OBOT. An adaptive stepped-care model adjusts counseling attendance and medication prescribing/dispensing based on ongoing indicators of treatment response. When necessary, medication dispensing is shifted between the OBOT and JHBC dispensary sites, and care is coordinated during the entire treatment episode. Early evaluation of this model has been very promising.
Results
Since 2009, 81 JHBC patients received OBOT from a total of 22 providers. Twenty percent of these patients were admitted to the JHBC with existing OBOT providers, while the remainder were referred to a provider by the program. Sixty-two percent of these patients were male, 62 percent were Caucasian, and 38 percent were African American. Four percent were ages 18–24, 47 percent were 25–44, and 49 percent were 45–64. CoOP model appears to be a feasible approach to increase the availability and efficacy of office-based buprenorphine maintenance through collaboration between opioid treatment programs and office-based providers. Provision of concurrent psychosocial treatment, collaborative stepped care, and expert consultation by the treatment program can enhance OBOT services.
Conclusions
Facilitation of collaborative systems such as the CoOP model may be a powerful strategy to increase availability and efficacy of mediation-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder.

They’re all contenders to hold the title for the Best Song of the year. Check out the tracks we were loving in 2013.
Lorde’s “Royals”
While many artists struggle throughout their career for a number one hit, newcomer Lorde had no problem finding one right off of the bat. The New Zealand singer released the song “Royals” as a response to other pop songs on the radio. Although some criticized the song for lyrics that could be considered racist, the song still managed to live atop the Billboard charts for nine consecutive weeks. The single is on Lorde’s debut The Love Child EP, which has garnered much attention and critical acclaim.
Wale’s “Bad”
Proving that he is part rapper and part poet, Wale got in touch with his softer side with the single “Bad.” Enlisting the help of songstress Tiara Thomas, the D.C. native rapped about a scorned woman who would rather eff them and leave them rather than risk having her heartbroken by really loving a man. For the remix, Wale recruited the ultimate bad girl Rihanna. “Bad” can be found on Wale’s third album The Gifted and marks the second Wale song that made it into Billboard’s top 40 chart.
Drake’s “Started From The Bottom”
You couldn’t go anywhere without hearing someone rap, “Started from the bottom, now I’m here.” Even though his idea of starting from the bottom was borrowing his uncle’s Acura so he could travel to and from the set of “Degrassi,” Drake’s ubiquitous song was everywhere. The single served as the first single off of the Canadian rapper’s third album, Nothing Was The Same and has gone platinum since its summer release.
Tamar Braxton’s “Love & War”
Tamar Braxton stepped out from behind her older sisters’ shadows over a decade ago for a solo career. Though it failed to take off then, things are different the second time around. Tamar scored her very first hit single with the ballad “Love & War.” The lead single off of the album of the same name shot to number one on iTunes after her friend Lady Gaga promoted the single to her more than 31 million Twitter followers.
Solange’s “Lovers In The Parking Lot”
Although her big sister Beyonce is one of the biggest pop/R&B singers on the planet, Solange is a talented artist in her own right. She proves that once again with this year’s “Lovers in the Parking Lot.” Off of her True EP, which was released late last year, Solange directed and released the video in September. “Lovers in the Parking,” one of the strongest songs on the EP, helped solidify Solange’s image as the answer to anti-pop.
Justin Timberlake’s “Mirrors”
More than a decade ago, boy bander Justin Timberlake left his N’Sync group behind to go at it alone. After being absent from the music scene for more than five years, Timberlake returned with a brand new album. Earlier this year he dropped The 20/20 Experience which contained the chart-topping song “Mirrors.” Inspired by his new bride Jessica Biel and his grandparents, the song was considered the wedding reception song of the year.
J. Cole ‘s “Power Trip”
Fayetteville rapper J. Cole’s first mixtape helped him get noticed by Jay Z and he was soon signed to Roc Nation. Although his first album wasn’t received as warmly as his previous projects, J. Cole found his mark with this year’s Born Sinner. Teaming up with Miguel once again, the Roc Nation signee released “Power Trip” and struck gold. More like platinum. A continuation of the song “Dreams,” J. Cole rapped about his borderline obsession over a crush. The song went platinum and is considered by many as one of the best songs of the year.
Ciara’s “Body Party”
Ciara emerged on the music scene with “1, 2 Step,” wowing fans over with her dance moves. Since then she’s become more famous for things other than music but the Atlanta singer marked her return to music with the ultra sexy “Body Party.” Working closely with her boyfriend-turned-fiance/producer/singer/songwriter Future, Ciara’s “Body Party” received even more play after the NSFW video premiered. Ciara recently vented on Instagram after “Body Party” was snubbed by the Grammys.
Drake’s “Hold On We’re Going Home”
Drake is certainly not the average rapper. He’s never been afraid to get in touch with his feminine side to win the ladies over and in “Hold On We’re Going Home,” Drake sings just as much as he raps. Partnering with his longtime producer Noah “40” Shebib” Drake likened the feel of the song to something along the lines of a Quincy Jones and Michael Jackson collaboration. The song has gone platinum in several countries, including here in the U.S.
Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines”
It took Robin Thicke six albums before he landed his first number one song with “Blurred Lines.” Featuring Atlanta rapper T.I. and producer Pharrell, the song was released earlier this year and has dominated the airwaves since then. The song helped Thicke become a household name and a very rich man. Proving that sex certainly sells, the NSFW video featuring topless models was initially pulled from YouTube. “Blurred Lines” was nominated for two Grammys and is considered a shoe-in for Record of the Year.
Jay Z’s “Tom Ford”
Jay Z just can’t stay away from a microphone for long. Out of nowhere the Brooklyn rapper released his 12th solo album this year, partnering with Samsung with a historic deal that will no doubt change the game again. Over the summer, Hov released “Tom Ford,” his ode to the iconic designer and the finer things in life. While others have been obsessed with Molly popping, the married father of one rapped about “getting high” on fashion. “Tom Ford” has since gone gold since its October release.
Janelle Monae’s “PrimeTime”
Janelle Monae has always danced to the beat of a different drummer. After releasing her critically acclaimed debut album, the Bad Boy artist followed that up with The Electric Lady. Serving as the fourth and fifth installment of her Metropolis concept series, the album contains the hit single “PrimeTime,” featuring fellow singer Miguel. Monae’s second album moved over 40,000 units in the first week, making it her highest debut selling album thus far.
Miguel’s “How Many Drinks”
Singer Miguel was first introduced to the world with the 2010 smash hit “All I Want Is You” with rapper J. Cole. Although his debut album was a sleeper hit, no one slept on the singer three years later. Releasing his second album Kaleidoscope Dream to critical acclaim, the album featured the popular song “How Many Drinks.” Not wanting to waste his time, or his money, the R&B singer inquires exactly how many drinks does it take for a woman to go home with him. Rapper Kendrick Lamar was featured on the remix. “How Many Drinks” earned a Grammy nomination for Best R&B Performance.
Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky”
What do you get when you have two French dudes in helmets team up with Pharrell Williams and legendary writer Nile Rogers? Only one of the biggest songs of the year. You couldn’t walk down the street or go anywhere without hearing about being “up all night to get some.” While most people probably think “Get Lucky” is about getting laid, Williams said the song is really about being fortunate enough to connect with someone. The song has been nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and the coveted Record of the Year.
Big Sean’s “Control”
It’s hard to believe one of the best rap songs of the year has no official home. Big Sean released “Control,” which features Kendrick Lamar and Jay Electronica, to generate some buzz for his album and that it surely did. In his verse, Cali native Lamar called out his fellow rappers and crowded himself the King of New York, ruffling many feathers in the process. Although the song didn’t make it on to Big Sean’s Hall of Fame album due to sample clearance issues, it did become a trending topic and helped Big Sean move over 70,000 copies of his album in the first week.Which disc golf bag is the best?
Disc golf is a great way to get active, have fun and spend time outside. Unlike regular golf, most disc golf courses are free to use without a membership. All you need to play are discs and a bag to carry them.
If you’re in the market for a new disc golf bag, there are several things you’ll need to take into account, such as size, comfort and durability. By taking the time to review the most popular models, you’ll be able to pick the bag that’s right for you easily.
What to know before you buy a disc golf bag
How many discs will you carry?
Knowing how many discs you intend to carry is the most crucial factor in deciding which disc golf bag to buy. For many players, their collection of putters, drivers and mid-range discs grows substantially over time, and they want to carry their entire collection with them on the course. If you have an extensive collection of discs, you may want to consider a bag that you can carry — like a backpack or one with wheels.
If you plan to carry just a few discs, a smaller, over-the-shoulder bag is a more affordable option.
How much does your bag weigh?
Depending on how many discs you intend to carry, your bag can get pretty heavy when fully loaded. With that in mind, you’ll want to ensure that you get a bag that is lightweight to begin with. If your bag is too heavy for you to carry easily, you might run out of steam before you’re done playing, especially if you intend to throw a full 18 holes.
What else will you carry with you?
Most disc golf bags have a cup holder on their side, a helpful feature to stay hydrated while outside. Some bags have convenient loops that allow you to clip on a towel to dry your hands while playing. If your hands tend to sweat while you play, you may want to consider a disc golf bag with a chalk bag to improve your grip.
What to look for in a quality disc golf bag
Durability
When playing disc golf, you’ll set your bag down on dirt, grass and concrete, which can wear down weak materials. Some bags are waterproof, extending the bag’s life if you often play on wet or dewy grass. The bag’s strap needs to be durable enough to consistently handle the weight of your discs as well — especially if you carry a lot of them with you.
Comfort
You must get a bag that doesn’t hurt your back while in use. Many bags have padded shoulder straps and designs meant to distribute the weight of your discs evenly. Some bags have a backpack-like design for added comfort and support, and others even have wheels that allow you to pull the bag behind you. Be sure to avoid overloading any bag with more discs than you can comfortably carry.
Stylish design
In the past, disc golf bags all had the same neutral aesthetic, but nowadays, there are a range of unique options and styles to choose from, including sling bags that can fit a large number of discs while staying slim. Some bags also have unique patterns and designs for added flare. There are plenty of options available to suit any style.
How much you can expect to spend on a disc golf bag
A simple bag that can carry 10-15 discs can cost as little as $15. On the other hand, bags with backpack straps or wheels made to carry 30 discs or more can cost over $100.
Disc golf bag FAQ
What do you need to pack in your disc golf bag?
A. You’ll want to at least have a putter, driver and mid-range disc in your bag. It’s a good idea to pack water, sunscreen, a snack and a towel.
Do they make disc golf bags for kids?
A. Although there aren’t many bags designed specifically for children, most small disc golf bags can be comfortably used by kids as long as you keep them lightweight.

Talk about useless commands…
Swiss Novus Ordo Bishop: “A church in which the priests give the commands, is embarrassing, infertile, and useless!”
Mr. Joseph Bonnemain is one of the latest additions to the Bergoglian bunch of Novus Ordo bishops. A member of Opus Dei, the 73-year-old was made a “bishop” only earlier this year and now heads the diocese of Chur in eastern Switzerland. This diocese was formerly led by “Bp.” Vitus Huonder, who is now with the Lefebvrists.
As we showed in a prior post, Bonnemain is a man after “Pope” Francis’ heart:
The fact that the new “bishop” in Chur has no problem giving “Holy Communion” to known Protestants, blessing sodomite couples, or promoting case-by-case situation ethics, gives a glimpse as to what must be going on behind his forehead, and it’s not Catholicism.… READ MOREContinuing my series about ScoutDocs and the process of building it, this week I’m talking about React.
What is ScoutDocs? ScoutDocs is a WordPress plugin that adds simple file-sharing to your WordPress site.
After the first iteration of ScoutDocs was built and none of the partners on the project were happy with its experience, it became clear that in order to deliver a clean, simple interface for file uploading and sharing we needed to leave the bounds of the WordPress admin. It didn’t take me long to decide that React would be the tool I used to build the new interface.
There is an incredible momentum behind React, and a rich ecosystem of libraries, tools, and educational resources. But beyond all that, React is just plain fun to code. Once you accept the central premise that a view layer and the controller that handles that view are inextricably linked, and once you get over the weirdness of quasi-HTML-in-JS that is JSX, coding in React is a joy.
Make no mistake, learning React is not a weekend project. It will take a while before it feels like home. But once you get it, you feel very powerful.
The first lesson I learned was don’t learn React by rewriting your app in React. I tried this. I read some tutorials about React and it felt straightforward, and I was like “let’s do this.”
This was a bad idea. I was overwhelmed. I had no idea where to start. Next, I tried following some of the interactive tutorials that required me to build a simple React app and then slowly add functionality to it, refactoring it multiple times, until I understood not just the code that I ended up with, but the process of creating it. This went much better.
Start small, and build a bunch of “toy” apps before you use React for your own apps. Once you are able to “think in React”, you’ll be nearly physically itchy to go re-code your app in React, and that’s how you know you’re ready. If you jump the gun, you are going to get stuck a lot, and it will be frustrating.
As you learn React and explore the React ecosystem, you will likely hear about Redux, which is a system for storing application state, and is commonly used with React apps. It looked complicated, and even its creator wrote a post saying you might not need Redux. So I skipped it. This was probably the right call when I was starting out. But as I fleshed out the ScoutDocs app and its complexity increased, I ran into a problem.
See, React breaks your app up into these nested chunks of UI and functionality called components. Data flows down through your components. So if a user updates their name, that change will flow down from higher up components like a Page component down to a PageHeader, down to a NavBar, down to a UserStatus. Once this is all set up and you update data in a parent component, the changes automatically flow downstream, and the UserStatus component updates and re-renders. It’s great. Except that there are a bunch of intermediate components that accept and “forward” that user name data to their children, without actually caring about it themselves. When you inevitably refactor something and need to add new data that flows through these components, every single intermediate one needs to be updated to pass it on. It is tedious. You will hate it.
Worse, because events in React flow upwards, if a user updates their name in the UserName component, that change needs to flow up to ProfileForm, up to Profile, up to Page, and then up to your main App component. When you refactor, you need to make sure this event forwarding chain stays connected. Yet more tedium that you will hate.
Redux solves this by letting your React components, no matter how deeply they are nested, subscribe directly to the data they need.
I really wish Dave Ceddia had written this excellent post about Redux two months earlier.
If you have a component structure like the one above – where props are being forwarded down through many layers – consider using Redux.
This is what I needed to hear, and knowing this would have saved me a lot of frustration and time that I now have to spend converting ScoutDocs to use Redux.
Use Redux when your React data flow starts to get unwieldy.
Another mistake I made early on was making the data my React components accepted too restrictive. For example, I wanted the ability to prefix a
Row component with a clickable icon. So I let the component accept an
icon and
onClickIcon property. I just passed a Font Awesome icon name in, and a function I wanted to run when clicked. It worked great.
Then I needed to add a second icon in front, in some circumstances. Ugh. I certainly didn’t want to do
otherIcon and
onClickOtherIcon. Instead, what I should have done was let the component accept
beforeRow which could be anything… like an array of
<Icon> components or a single one or even other components altogether.
This can be used for many more situations than the one (“put an icon before the row”) that I’d originally envisioned.
Your React components should be flexible, so they can be reusable.

Kristen Stewart Screen-Worn Dress The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part I. This white dress was worn by the character Bella Swan portrayed by actress Kristen Stewart, in the 2011 motion picture, "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part I". The beautiful garment is classic 1960's vintage sleeveless knee length dress is constructed of tussah silk with charmeuse lining.
"Breaking Dawn" costume designer, Michael Wilkinson, is stated to have referenced the Kennedy summer vacation look in designing the wear. Going with crisp, cool natural fibers, he was looking to capture the classic American summer fashion. Stewart wore this dress during the wedding reception scene and as the characters Bella and Edward arrive at their honeymoon cabin. The much anticipated wedding between the two is the culmination of the romance story arc the plot of the film series is centered on.

When a course called Superbrain by an expert in brain performance comes up, you know I’m going to take it and review it in some way on this site. The Superbrain Quest is a Mindvalley course taught by Jim Kwik. Jim has been a brain coach for many organizations, actors, and people like you and me. I took the quest, and what I found is that Superbrain is a 30-day course that gives you some superpowers that will bring about more productivity in your life.
10 Ways The Superbrain Quest Will Impact Your Productivity
1. The Superbrain Quest Will Help Boost Your Memory
How much time do you waste trying to remember stuff? It’s hard to be productive when your memory is poor.
This is the biggest selling point of the Superbrain quest. It says it all right on the page explaining what the quest is about.
You will learn:
- How to develop a skill or absorb information up to 300% faster and accelerate your learning speed.
- How to develop a supercharged memory, where you can remember lists, facts, names, birthdays, anniversaries, and more.
- The fundamentals of having a good memory.
- Techniques that will help you remember things backward and forward.
And, what I found was that at the end of the quest, you will come up with your own ways to remember everything. When you learn the basics of memory and how to boost it, you can get creative and use what works best for you.
I can guarantee you that it’s fun and easy to get a better memory once you learn the techniques that Jim Kwik teaches in the Superbrain quest. You may need to practice the techniques, but once you get the hang of them, it’s so easy to remember those important things that you used to forget.
2. Learn How To Tackle The ANTS
One of the things talked about in the Superbrain quest is ANTS or Automatic Negative Thoughts. Those negative thoughts can kill your focus and productivity.
I can’t count the number of times I have been working and suddenly feel a stampede of ANTS in my head that makes me get out of the flow and lose focus. What a time waster those ANTS are!
Jim helps you understand how to protect your internal and external environments from ANTS. And, he gives a technique to help you tackle an ANT when it comes up and refocus.
3. You Will Make Creative Thinking Your Thing
The techniques taught by Jim Kwik in the Superbrain quest are very creative. It’s not anything like the old way of remembering – learn something, read it over and over again, look away and see how much you remember, read it again, look away and try to remember it again, and repeat the process over and over again.
As Jim says, rote learning – which is a memorization technique based on repetition – works, but it’s an old-school way of doing things. You can supercharge your memory by using the creative and fun techniques he teaches.
I’ve found that creative thinking spills into other areas of your life. The more you practice doing things outside of the box, like the memory techniques Jim teaches, the more you can think outside of the box and come up with creative ways to solve problems, organize, and communicate.
Being creative is very important for your productivity. It keeps you from getting stuck by helping you to overcome obstacles more easily.
Creative thinking, just like anything, develops from practice. So, the more time you spend coming up with and practicing creative ways to remember things, the more you strengthen your ability to think creatively.
4. You Will Improve Your Comprehension
Comprehension is important to productivity. The more you know, the better choices you can make and the quicker you can get things done.
With the Superbrain quest, you won’t just learn how to remember things, you will be able to improve your comprehension while remembering. In other words, you will not just repeat something you remember, you will be able to fully grasp what it is you are remembering.
Part of the quest includes learning how to remember words and their meanings. I was blown away at how easy it was to remember definitions that I could never remember before.
What’s even better is that you will learn how to remember words in another language and be able to fully comprehend the words you learn.
5. You Will Learn How To Read Faster
Jim Kwik has other programs where he teaches speed reading in detail, but he does point out a few techniques in this course. One of the bonuses that come with the Superbrain Quest is on Speed Reading.
If you want to be more productive, you want to read faster. You want to be able to get through articles faster and find a solution or get an insight that you need to move forward.
Plus, reading non-fiction books will help you learn lessons someone took years or even decades to learn. So faster is better!
As Jim says in the Superbrain Quest, “There are no bad readers, just those with bad reading habits.” It’s a skill that you need to develop, and Jim talks about obstacles that can get in the way of reading fast as well as some methods that will help you increase your reading speed by up to 50%.
6. It Will Help You Pay More Attention To Your Habits
Jim Kwik talks a lot about habits and how they impact the brain. He talks about his habits for good brain health and comprehension, and he even gets you to memorize them.
What I found is that all this talk about habits made me pay more attention to my habits. I talk a lot about productivity habits, but it’s really important to understand why they are important so you can keep them in your awareness and maintain them.
In short, Superbrain will remind you why your habits are so important and help you find brain habits that work for you and your productivity.
7. It Will Help You Realize That You Have Time For Those Productivity Habits You Didn’t Think You Had Time For
You need to dedicate about 20 minutes per day to the Superbrain quest. So initially you have to give some time out of your day away to this quest, but in the long run this helps you be more productive.
The quest becomes a habit, and when you are done, you can replace that habit with something else for 20 minutes a day.
It won’t be your Superbrain quest time anymore, it may be your reading time, study time, journaling time, or meditation time. Whatever you thought you couldn’t squeeze into your life before the quest can easily fit into that 20 minutes.
I didn’t think I would have time for it, but I did. At first, I had to schedule it into my day, but then it became a habit. It was a good eye-opener that I could create new habits, even at 20 minutes a day, that would benefit me and my goals and productivity – like reading, creating, taking a course, or even spending time with my loved ones.
8. Learn How To Remember Other People’s Names And Other Information In The Superbrain Quest
How much time do you waste trying to figure out someone’s name? How much more productive would life be if you could remember someone’s name, make them feel validated by you, and then use that to your advantage going forward in the relationship?
Everyone wants to be heard and validated. If you are someone who can remember important things that people tell you, like their name or spouse’s name, then you can instantly become more likable by everyone.
That’s another bonus for productivity. More people will be willing to help you out and get things done when they like you.
9. You Will Learn How To Remember Numbers
Jim teaches a few ways to remember numbers in the Superbrain quest. One of the ways will appeal to most people.
But, there is a more advanced technique to remember numbers that can help you remember all those important things like pin numbers or meeting times and locations. This one takes some time to grasp, but I’m practicing it and implementing it into my life.
10. You Will Spend Less Time Trying To Remember And More Time Doing
The bottom line is that the Superbrain quest can help you spend less time trying to remember things and more time doing things.
For instance, if you always forget where you put your keys, the quest can help you remember where you put your keys. You won’t need to wander around and waste time trying to find them anymore.
In regards to my writing, I’ve found that I spend less time trying to find information that I’ve read and more time just recalling it and writing about it.
For instance, when I write reviews, I normally need to go through my notes a few times to come up with my outlines and fill in some blanks. But, I remember a lot of what I wrote down in this Superbrain quest because it’s all just sitting there in my memory for me to access.
And, I’ve had an easier time communicating my point of view on things. It’s not just my thoughts and beliefs that I have to recall from anymore. I can actually remember the facts that back up my thoughts and beliefs. And I can communicate them effectively without feeling like I’m not fully justifying what I’m saying. It’s insane.
I’ve also found that all this practice with your brain’s strength helps you do things that aren’t even taught in the quest. My brain just seems to be working better overall, and I’m quicker with my recall, communication, and writing without trying.
The Superbrain Quest Will Benefit Your Productivity
If you want to be more productive, I highly recommend the Superbrain quest. This list is just 10 of the ways Jim Kwik and Mindvalley’s quest will help you be more productive. It’s really an important quest to take for so many more reasons.
The Superbrain quest will appeal to everyone who wants a better brain, better memory, and more productivity in their life. It doesn’t matter who you are or how bad you feel your memory is right now. Jim Kwik gives you the tools to improve your brain’s health and strength, and you can continue using and developing those tools for the rest of your life.
Take the Masterclass, experience the awesomeness for yourself, and then sign up for the quest and get excited. You are about to take an awesome course that will impact your life in a big)

I took the Superbrain quest last year and I had enormous benefits to my productivity. I also taught one of Jim’s techniques to a group of friends and everyone was really impressed with my skills! They are still asking me to teach them things that I learn. 🙂 I highly recommend the program.
Kari
That’s awesome. I tried teaching my friend one technique and she wasn’t too interested in it. I guess she doesn’t want to improve her memory! But, I know a lot of people in the Superbrain Facebook group talk about teaching other people in their lives. One girl just talked about teaching her classmates one of the techniques and it went over very well.Trump Cited False Sexual Assault Statistics to Justify His Wall. Sound Familiar?
The president isn't the only one to use misleading data to advance an illiberal policy agenda.
In his State of the Union speech last night, President Trump cited routine sexual abuse of migrant women making the journey north as one reason to support reduced illegal immigration—by building a wall, or by other means.
"Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate—it is cruel," said Trump. "One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north."
This statistic is dubious. As The Washington Post explained, it comes from an unrepresentative sample of just 56 migrant women, 31 percent of whom said they were "sexually abused" during their journey. Just 10 percent said they experienced sexual violence. The study does not clarify the difference between "abuse" and "violence," but suggests that abuse is some lesser category of unpleasantness—nonconsensual sexual contact that does not rise to the level of violence, and trading sex for food, I would guess. In either case, this was a small number of victims.
Another statistic frequently cited by immigration hawks contends that 60 percent of migrant women suffer sexual violence as they make their way to the United States. This figure is even more seriously flawed, and is not based on anything current or reliable. It "comes from interviews conducted a quarter-century ago, making it irrelevant now," writes The Post's Glenn Kessler.
Trump is citing bad data in service of a bad cause, and people should be aware. But while we're on the subject of outdated statistics being used to advance an illiberal policy agenda, I can't help but notice some similarities between misleading claims about sexual assault among migrant women and misleading claims about sexual assault among campus women.
After all, many politicians, activists, and journalists have advanced the idea that as many as one-in-five female students will be victims of sexual assault while on campus—many of them at the hands of serial predators, who commit rape over and over again until they are apprehended. And while The Washington Post has been much more evenhanded and nuanced in its approach to campus rape reporting than other mainstream publications, a 2015 survey co-sponsored by the paper and the Kaiser Family Foundation that offered support for the one-in-five statistic failed to make distinctions between forced assault and nonconsensual touching—precisely the kind of error committed by Trump last night (assault vs. abuse).
Similarly, if we should be skeptical of the 60 percent rate of abuse for migrant women because the figure is 25 years out of date, we should also be skeptical of the data that undergirds the serial predator theory of campus sexual assaults, which was collected at a commuter school—the University of Massachusetts at Boston—during the 1990s.
Under the Obama administration, dubious sexual assault statistics were used to justify new policies that eviscerated due process protections for students accused of sexual misconduct and also imperiled free expression. The new administration, to its credit, is working hard to undo these changes.
Trump is far from the only authority figure to cite bad data in order to guilt-trip the public into supporting his ill-conceived policy ideas. It's important to call out the president, but keep in mind that there are plenty of other "zombie statistics" in our midst.One to one appointments In 'Digital Skills' WorkshopsOur serviceDigital SkillsOnline resourcesOne-to-one appointmentsEmbedded sessions Please note Our advisors are currently working remotely, so appointments are currently taking place via Zoom, Teams and email.

In between catching up with friends and family, we managed to see a few sights around Singapore that proved to be an excellent learning experience for the boys – well, Aristotle more so than Hercules. I really enjoyed our trip because this is how I’ve always envisaged education should be for the boys – we were together as a family and we had loads of fun exploring and learning new things together. After our visits, the boys came away with a fun life experience, new knowledge from what they’d seen and an increased curiosity for the subjects they learned about.
Gardens by the Bay
This turned out to be the real highlight of our trip. We were so impressed by this place that I’ve decided to dedicate a blog post entirely on this. Meanwhile, check out Cloud Forest below…
Maritime Experiential Museum
We saw part of the Maritime Experiential Museum prior to our tour of the SEA Aquarium. This section is a temporary exhibition – “Pirates of the East” (available until 31 December 2012). It offers visitors the opportunity to travel through the ancient maritime silk route. Some of the activities available:
Spice matching – match the spice to its original source and learn more about them. Includes ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and cardamon.
Make your own Chinese Junk – these activity cards are free for visitors to take home.
Play the pirate game and learn more about the ancient Pirates of the East.
We didn’t get to see the permanent exhibits from the Maritime Museum. If you are keen to visit the Maritime Museum, the ticket prices for the Maritime Museum can be found here.
S.E.A. Aquarium
Boasting to be the world’s largest oceanarium, we thought it was not to be missed. Perhaps our expectations were set too high, but this one was a bit of a let down. My godson was disappointed that he didn’t get to see any octopuses (in case you’re wondering, according to the Merriam dictionary, the plural for octopus can be either “octopuses” or “octopi” – both are correct). The sharks were disappointingly small for the “world’s largest oceanarium”. Ironically, the kids were more fascinated with the divers than they were with the marine life.
I should also offer some advice to parents with young children like Hercules… There is a “petting” station where visitors can GENTLY touch the starfish. I would strongly advise against letting your child touch the starfish. Hercules did more than gently touch the starfish – he picked it up, turned it upside-down, and started waving it in the air as he inspected the underside of the starfish (much to the shock and horror of the Aquarium staff).
Naturally, they couldn’t show us the creatures of the deep but we did get to see images of angler fish and tripods – which Aristotle remembered from “Finding Nemo” and “The Cat in the Hat: Wish for a Fish – All About Sea Creatures“.
It seemed rather timely that the Discovery Channel at the hotel was playing “River Monsters“. Aristotle watched the episode on the “Tiger Fish” with avid fascination. He’s now eager to watch the rest of the documentary.
See tickets and visitor info for more details.
Christmas train at Vivo City
We rode this train during our previous visit to Singapore. This time, it was all decked out with Christmas decorations. Hercules enjoyed it so much the first time that he demanded to ride on it again when he realised we were in Vivo City. Hercules has a good recall for locations and remembered that Vivo City was the place he rode the train and he kept asking for it. He wanted to go “again, again” so I had to convince him that it was more fun to chase after it instead. He wore himself out running after the train, yelling, “Catch the train!”
Available 10am-10pm daily at $6 a ride. Children under 90cm need to be accompanied by an adult (no additional fee required for accompanying adults). Tickets can be purchased at the starting point which is located near SingKids #01-171-174.
Theme Parks (JB Malaysia)
We also had plans to visit Legoland / Puteri Harbour Family Theme Park which are in Johor Bahru (on the way to Singapore) but we missed out because we dawdled too long on our decision of which park to visit and ended with with neither. Luckily the boys didn’t notice…
Marina Bay Sands
The other place we wanted to visit but didn’t get time for was Marina Bay Sands. We drove past the building and Aristotle was fascinated by the “ship on top of the three towers”. I finally googled it and found out that it is a hotel/skypark/museum/convention center/casino/shopping mall rolled into one.
What a pity we missed this one because it turns out that they are currently displaying a dragon exhibit at the hotel lobby and dragons are a current fascination of Aristotle’s ever since he saw How to Train Your Dragon (which prompted him to read all the books in the series written by Cressida Cowell). They also have cool activities at the Art/Science Museum like the Art of Brick which will be a hit for Lego enthusiasts.
This is definitely one place on our list for our next trip down to Singapore.

In April 2015, the federal government awarded the Promise Zone designation to all or parts of Allendale, Bamberg, Barnwell, Colleton, Hampton and Jasper counties to help them boost efforts to get needed funding to grow jobs, improve education and meet regional needs. Organizations that apply for funding through the Promise Zone designation are awarded extra points during the application process, which often can be the difference of winning grants and not.
The December grant-writing class, which was held Dec. 19 to 22 at the Allendale campus of USC Salkehatchie, provided students with detailed, introductory lessons on grant writing, including basic components of full proposals and budgeting. They also received training on conducting needs-based assessments to support grant applications, how to develop collaborative partnerships, best practices and ways to evaluate the grant process.
The professionals from the area who took the training involved representatives from municipal and county governments in each of the six Promise Zone counties, including schools, parks departments, emergency services and hospitals.
Students found the four-day sessions to be helpful. One commented, “It was a great course – way more in-depth than I expected.” Another said, “I feel completely prepared to write any grant necessary.”
At least two one-day grant-writing courses will be held later this quarter. Details will be announced soon.NOMIS Awardee Tony Wyss-Coray and fellow Stanford scientists reliably predict people’s age by measuring proteins in blood

Customer Project
Under Canvas began in 2009 with the opening of an all-inclusive glamping adventure package. It has since grown to include eight luxury glamping resorts and a customized event offering, bringing the glamping experience to life everywhere in the country.
Model
The Under Canvas safari-inspired tents include overnight amenities. Happy, well-rested glampers wake to the sounds of nature, perfectly positioned to explore America’s most iconic national parks and monuments.
Under Canvas operates locations in Yellowstone and Glacier (Montana), Moab and Zion (Utah), Mount Rushmore (South Dakota), the Great Smoky Mountains (Tennessee), and the Grand Canyon and Tucson (Arizona).
Structure
The CanopyMarquiTM tent is a nonagonal pyramid with a fabric membrane canvas spanning between each corner pole. The tent’s overall height is 21 ft, with an approximate base radius of 30 ft. The tent frame weighs 750 lbs, and the fabric cover weighs around 150 lbs.
CanopyMarquisTM can be conjoined into larger gathering spaces capable of accommodating hundreds of guests while feeling spacious and connected to the surrounding landscape. The awning sides of the tent are adjustable and can be put up or down to fit the weather conditions, or used as access openings.
The unique shape and flexible features of the CanopyMarquisTM tent create design challenges, particularly with deriving the wind load conditions. Standard codes, such as ASCE 7, do not cover the design wind pressure for unusually-shaped structures. The tent design wind loads were generated using RWIND Simulation, Dlubal Software’s wind tunnel simulation software.
Additionally, RFEM and RF-FORM FINDING were utilized for further structural analysis and design, including determining the shape of the tensile fabric under applied prestress forces. RF-TIMBER AWC was used to design the tent wood structures according to American standards.

Big Health, the creators of the Daylight and Sleepio apps that adults in Scotland will be given access to, said that their apps are now part of the NHS services. The Daylight and Sleepio apps are two examples of apps that are used to help manage mental health problems.
Anxiety refers to the body's response to stress, while insomnia is a sleep disorder that makes it difficult for people to fall asleep.
NHS Scotland Gives Adults to Digital Therapeutics— Scot Gov Health (@scotgovhealth) October 13, 2021
The NHS in Scotland is now offering adults access to digital therapeutics for anxiety and insomnia. Specifically, adults can now access the Sleepio and Daylight apps as part of the NS services.
"From today, adults in Scotland will have access to digital therapy for anxiety & insomnia, as part of the NHS services," the Scottish government announced via Twitter.
According to a post on the Twitter account of Big Health, the creator of the apps, the company "is proud to support @scotgov's world-leading mental health strategy."
Scottish adults in all 14 health board areas of NHS Scotland many now use the apps to self-refer or visit their GPs in order to receive cognitive behavior therapy, per a report by MobiHealthNews.
Access to the apps was first made available to five NHS health board areas in Scotland last year.
Per the MobiHealthNews report, "Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) found that 71% of patients who used Daylight achieved remission from anxiety and 76% of patients who used Sleepio achieved clinically significant sleep improvements."

Anxiety and Insomnia
(Photo : cottonbro from Pexels)
Healthline defines anxiety as the response of a person's body to stress. There are different anxiety disorders that exist. These include phobias, panic disorder, separation anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Symptoms of general anxiety include rapid breathing, restlessness, increased heart rate, difficulty falling asleep and having trouble concentrating.
On the other hand, insomnia is defined as "a sleep disorder in which you have trouble falling and/or staying asleep" by WebMD. Insomnia can be a short-term or long-term disorder. Acute insomnia or short-term insomnia can last from a period of one night to a handful of weeks. Chronic insomnia, according to WebMD, can happen thrice a week.
Symptoms of insomnia include irritability, having trouble falling asleep, waking up earlier than your usual time, and having trouble concentrating.
Using Apps to Deal with Mental Health Concerns
The NHS Scotland's access to the Daylight and Sleepio apps is the latest example of apps being used in order to detect, manage, or even treat mental health concerns.
Another example of this is the Moodbeam Wellness app, which can detect changes in emotions and feelings. Last year, an app called HearMe was launched to help people deal with the pandemic and isolation by providing emotional support.

When we talk about female fertility there is a very important term that all women should be aware of during their routine gynaecological check-up: this term is ovarian reserve. We use this terminology to quantify the number of eggs a woman has at a certain time in her life. The anti-müllerian hormone, which you’ve probably heard of, is very closely related to the concept of ovarian reserve.
When trying to get pregnant, it’s very important that the concept of ovarian reserve is clearly understood. That’s why we want to give you more information today, and explain to you why we measure the anti-müllerian hormone and its purpose in assisted reproduction.
When and how are a woman’s eggs produced?
During the early stages of development of a female embryo, the cells which will later form the ovaries will divide several times, thus resulting in oocytes, or eggs. During the 20th week of development of a female embryo this cell division will come to a halt, and the total number of oocytes formed up until that point (week 20 of intrauterine life), will be what we know as the ovarian reserve.
Right away, these oocytes will enter into a process of cell maturation and apoptosis (cell death). This means that beginning at week 20 of development, the ovarian reserve starts to decline irreversibly and will continue declining once the female is born. Once the ovarian reserve has been depleted, ovulation will no longer take place and the menstrual cycle will disappear. In other words: menopause will arrive.
In conclusion, a woman is born with a fixed number of eggs in her ovaries and, from before the moment she is born, the decline in her ovarian reserve is irreversible.
How do we measure ovarian reserve?
As we just explained, ovarian reserve is a dynamic parameter that diminishes over the course of a woman’s life. Thus, age is the main conditioning factor. When measuring ovarian reserve we can use two methods:
- Antral follicle count. The egg, while it develops or matures, goes through different stages. During these stages the egg is defined as a primordial follicle, primary follicle, secondary or pre‑antral follicle, tertiary or antral follicle and a pre‑ovulatory or Graafian follicle. The antral follicle count performed via an ultrasound scan is a good indicator of ovarian reserve status.
- Anti-müllerian hormone blood test. The menstrual and ovulatory cycle is controlled by endocrine system hormones. That’s why studying and testing the anti‑müllerian hormone can help us learn more about the status of a woman’s ovarian reserve. This hormone is produced by pre‑antral and antral follicles in the ovaries and indicates the “level” of a female’s ovarian reserve.
When and how is the anti‑müllerian hormone measured?
When analysing the anti‑müllerian hormone, we must keep in mind that the level does not fluctuate throughout the phases of the menstrual cycle. Thus, this analysis can be performed at any time during the female’s cycle.
When it comes to measuring the hormone, the process is very simple. The only thing needed is to have a blood sample drawn, and you don’t even need to be fasting.
What are the anti‑müllerian hormone reference values?
Firstly, it’s important to keep in mind that this hormone, in addition to indicating the ovarian reserve level, is a measurement that can predict how well the ovaries will respond to stimulation in an assisted reproduction treatment.
Optimal anti‑müllerian hormone values range from 0.7 to 3.5 ng/ml, and are ideally around 1.0 ng/ml in women interested in undergoing in vitro fertilisation treatment. The results of the antral follicle count (determined via ultrasound), must also be evaluated alongside the results of the anti‑müllerian hormone blood test.
As a result, when we evaluate a woman’s ovarian reserve we can discover that her level is high, normal or diminished depending on factors such as age, ultrasound results and hormone markers. A high ovarian reserve indicates a high risk of experiencing ovarian hyper‑stimulation during hormone stimulation or IVF treatment. This would mean that the patient would be at a high risk for suffering from a complication called ovarian hyper‑stimulation syndrome.
On the other hand, a diminished ovarian reserve is defined as a lower number of eggs than expected for the woman’s age. This is associated with decreased chances of achieving a pregnancy, even with assisted reproduction techniques. A diminished ovarian reserve doesn’t cause symptoms but is occasionally related to menstrual cycle issues, though in the majority of cases the cause is unknown. We do know that endometriosis, surgery on the ovaries, certain immune disorders, chemotherapy and radiation therapy may lead to a premature decline in ovarian reserve.
Due to everything explained here, considering motherhood at an earlier age is necessary. In this regard, we advise consulting with a specialist if you’ve been trying to get pregnant for a while but have not yet been able to conceive. Likewise, we recommend you consider egg freezing as a preservation of fertility technique if you wish to postpone motherhood.
At URE Centro Gutenberg we have all of the physical and professional resources needed to evaluate the status of a female’s ovarian reserve. We can help you get an idea about your fertility so that you can make the best decision regarding your reproductive years. Contact us!

The Chandler Sessions on Integrity and Corruption is a three-year programme convening senior anti-corruption officials from countries worldwide to develop and test a new generation of strategies to entrench public integrity, The Chandler Sessions on Integrity and Corruption are a joint undertaking with the Blavatnik School of Government.
With public anger over government corruption at a fever pitch in many countries, and official efforts to uproot cultures of corruption frustratingly stalled, governments everywhere need a new set of strategies.
The Chandler Sessions on Integrity and Corruption convene a consistent group of 15 senior officials, all known as effective and innovative leaders of anti-corruption institutions. Together with a small group of academics and expert journalists, the officials participating in the Sessions will survey the field, search for effective policy responses, debate the priorities for innovation, and develop and test a set of new strategies for strengthening integrity in government institutions and dislodging entrenched corruption.
The Sessions are generously supported by the Chandler Foundation.
Programme
The Sessions convene the officials, scholars and journalists in-person on four occasions, in January and July of 2022 and 2023, advancing an agenda that they debated in July 2021. Each of the officials will co-author a paper describing ideas and practices that could transform the field. Each paper will be co-authored by two members of the Sessions, with five draft papers discussed at each of the first three in-person meetings. In July 2023, the discussions will return to the full set of ideas and designs, most by then having been tested in practice.
The Blavatnik School of Government and their partners will distribute the finished papers worldwide, and the papers will form the basis of a set of curricular materials on integrity and corruption, available without charge to training institutions everywhere. The papers will be jointly edited by the Session chair, Professor Christopher Stone, and by the programme’s post-doctoral research associate, Izabela Corrêa.

How to download Windows 11 Enterprise
Note that the title of the page mentions Windows 10 – Get a Windows 10 Desktop Environment – but the downloads are for Windows 11; This is likely something Microsoft has overlooked and will address in the future.
To download the virtual machine images, do the following:
- Visit the Microsoft Developer website. The downloads are listed directly on the site that opens.
- Select one of the available Windows 11 Enterprise virtual machine images. All are around 20 gigabytes in size. The newest is the VMWare image, the smallest is the Parallels image. The following virtual images are provided:
- VMware virtual image Windows 11 Enterprise.

In my opinion, driving through the gates of Gunsite Academy in Paulden, AZ is a trip to the happiest place on Earth.
Unfortunately, for those of us on the East Coast the trip also requires a flight across the country that typically eats up most of a day each way. Gunsite owner Buz Mills sent me an email yesterday sent me an email yesterday noting that Gunsite is going to get a lot more accessible for those of us on the east coast..
“We are proud to add Gunsite’s world-class firearms training.”
Colonial Shooting Academy will offer 250 Pistol monthly, and is currently building a wait-list for 350 Intermediate Pistol.
It’s not a secret that I’m a big fan of Gunsite, having graduated 250 Pistol last August.
Providing that training within driving distance of most of the major population centers on the East Coast is going to make the experience more affordable in both terms of time and money for many people, and while Colonial Shooting Academy might not offer the opportunity to view rattlesnakes, javelina, and roadrunners at the range, I don’t think too many people will mind.What Is Your Teen Doing Online Today?

Joel McHale
You’ve been hosting E!’s The Soup (formerly Talk Soup) since 2004. What is it like being on both sides of the aisle, as both a celebrity gossip commentator, and a sitcom star?
I’m the male version of Chelsea Handler. She does the same. I would liken it to a comedian that also acts. I see The Soup as kind of like a long late-night monologue that has a lot of clips in it. I took The Soup because—or rather, they offered it to me and I accepted—not just because of money, but because of the Greg Kinnear pedigree, where he transitioned from Talk Soup into acting, though at this point I’m not transitioning, I’m doing both (thank God). And when people see me on Community, I think they see that I can do both. I don’t think they’re like, “I don’t get it! He’s supposed to be telling me about the Kardashians! He’s not Jeff Winger!” But now, with the movie I’m doing now, it’s no joke. It’s not a comedy.
You’re talking about Beware The Night, with Erica Bana?
Yes, it’s heavy, dark, and violent. And really, it has some not-so-pleasant themes. Obviously Eric Bana brings serious cachet to the movie, and Edgar Ramirez is in it, and Olivia Munn.
Do you ever find that celebrities that you encounter off-screen are afraid that they’ll become targets on The Soup?
No, I mean no celebrity’s ever come up to me and said “How fucking dare you!” I mean, I would justify that by saying, well, don’t drive backwards on the highway while high and then I won’t make fun of you. I’m pretty sure Bruce Jenner’s not a fan of mine, and that’s fine. But The Soup doesn’t break stories – it’s the same thing as a late-night monologue. It’s not like “News flash!” People think that because we’re on E! that’s what happens. It’s just like with Chelsea [Handler] – she doesn’t break stories, she’s just commenting on them.

Of course I haven’t read it. Of course there’s a copy on the bookshelf. Of course I’m not going to read it now. A Brief History of Time it may be called, but life is too short, or rather my concentration is too weak. As second hand bookshops will tell you, “mint” is the default condition for second-hand copies. Critics of the film protest that the film does little or nothing to expound his theories or show their importance. I thought they handled the science just right … just enough to make you feel they knew what they were talking about without having to worry unduly.
A Stephen Hawking biopic, and a romance at that, is an unprepossessing pitch for a major movie, but here it is, and Eddie Redmayne may suffer at the various awards ceremonies because so many people have predicted an easy victory far in advance. Felicity Jones as the female lead is someone we remember fondly from Cemetery Junction (review linked) and is also tipped as Best Actress. The release in the UK comes a full two months after its American debut. It has Golden Globes nominations in all the major categories.
On the Graham Norton Show, Redmayne told a lovely “how I put my foot in it” anecdote about his meetings with Stephen Hawking, and how he enthused away chattily, because you have to wait so long for a response from the voice machine. Redmayne had blurted out that he felt empathy because they were both Capricorn … a long silence while the voice machine did its work and he heard “I am an astronomer. Not an astrologer.” Incidentally, towards the end it is Stephen Hawking’s own synthesized voice in the film.
Redmayne has also pointed out that as films are not shot chronologically (a brief problem with time there) but shot according to locations, as an actor he had to be able to perform at Stephen Hawking’s various levels of disability wherever they were. As there are many stages of deterioration, switching back and forth between them is a phenomenal task resulting in a phenomenal performance. If you view images of Hawking and Redmayne it is very difficult to tell them apart. Both leads are nominated for awards, and rightly so. The camera spends a lot of time on Felicity Jones’s close ups and hers is another exquisitely nuanced performance, an essay in facial expression. Make up has her going from fresh-faced young girl to her twenties and thirties with barely perceptible but definite ageing. At the end, when she is at Buckingham Palace with Stephen to get his Companion of Honour you can see wrinkles on her neck. They’re not there earlier. We both noticed them. I don’t think they would have let their kids frolic with such abandon in the palace gardens.
It is based on Jane Hawking’s own book, and I have to say the point of view stays with her. We feel “on her side” about the burgeoning gentle relationship with the choirmaster, Jonathan, and maybe this is Felicity Jones’s charisma adding to identification. Charlie Cox has a lovely supporting role in this part, and as Jonathan became her second husband, this may be another example of her point of view. He creates an extremely sympathetic character. Hawking was given two years to live circa 1963. Fifty years have passed. His survival is a tribute to his sheer mental power, but also to the love and care of Jane Hawking. The relationship is tender, and her determination to help him fight through it all is powerful.
The Guardian complained that they skated over the exact nature of the “four people in the marriage” – Jane, Stephen, Jonathan (as family friend and helper) and the full-time nurse, Elaine. I thought they were as explicit as you need to be, when Jane goes over to Jonathan’s separate tent and calls his name. This coincides with Stephen’s dramatic collapse at the opera in Switzerland, thus piling on her sense of guilt. Maybe The Guardian reviewer slipped out to the loo at that point. I feel grateful to be spared seeing the exact detailed mechanical nature of Jane and Stephen’s marital relations. Elaine grins as she shows him Penthouse magazine, and in the crude words of the 60s, she looks adept and strong wristed for the task in hand.
I was puzzled by the apparent Swiss mountains setting for the opera and transport to an air ambulance, as both of us clearly heard “Bordeaux” which I didn’t recall as either mountainous or Swiss. Maybe they had said Montreaux, though that’s the opposite end of the lake to Geneva which is mentioned as the location on IMDB.
There is considerable time compression in the film, it all seems to happen quite fast, though in reality they met in 1963, married in 1965, had children in 1967 and 1970, then a long gap to the third child in 1979. Time gets compressed … well, I guess that’s what his book’s about.
The film premiere showing in front of Professor Hawking himself brought tears to his eyes. I reckon that was a common reaction in the general public.
In general, 1963 then the rest of the 1960s and 1970s is lovingly and accurately created. We agreed that all Jane’s clothes “look right” all the way through as do cars and furniture and TV sets. We had a Mini Clubman Estate just like the one in the film in 1977 (it was a very rusty mid 60s model).
Overall, both leads deserve an Oscar. So does the director. The use of light and murkiness at the edges is beautiful. Give one to the writer too. The story flowed and the dialogue never once jarred.
ANACHRONISMS, or brief lapses of time
I’m going to have to be a complete bastard and catch a brief problem with time, right at the start. In early 1963, Jane hands Stephen a napkin with her telephone number on it … 0223 (12345 or whatever). While Cambridge is now 01223, the original STD code was 0223. Ah, but all number dialling codes first appeared in major cities in 1966, and then not outside them. Even in 1972, when I got my first phone, all number dialling had not reached us, and the number was Castle Hill (12345), not 01202 (12345). Hawking’s college has black payphones with buttons A & B. These were for calls via an operator. She would certainly have expressed her number as Cambridge (12345) or simply, in a local situation then, as (12345). It was only recently that you had to use an area code for local calls on the same exchange … I still forget to do it.
I was surprised that her parents seemed to live in Cambridge too, and so did Stephen’s. It was rare in the 1960s in England to attend a university in your home town. Moving elsewhere was part of the experience. In fact his parents lived in St. Albans, and Jane grew up there too. Coincidence? It’s the sort of thing you’d mention on meeting. He appears to pick her up for the May Ball outside her parents’ house all dressed up and ready to go. St Albans is 45 miles from Cambridge and this is pre-motorway days, but let’s face it, Cambridge looks its glowing dreamy best throughout the film, so that was a good call. Imagine it’s all in Cambridge.
So while being a Brief Nerd With Time, I’ve got another. They first meet some time before the 1963 May Ball (which is held in June). As a Sunday lunch gets in between the two dance events, let’s say at least two weeks before. The music is Martha & The Vandellas “Heat Wave.” The American release was July 1963, but Britain … as I remembered … was late in the year. I just checked: October release, and I recall it at Christmas parties. Still … right year, six months too early, and I rather doubt Cambridge science students being hip enough to play Motown that early, and it was not a hit in Britain anyway. They all look like trad jazz fans to me. My excuse for knowing this is that I wrote the Martha & The Vandellas “Toppermost” (linked) and it was such a major hit because it was released during a West Coast July heat wave, and became a July / August US hit.
I think the firework display is very definitely 21st century (but all the better for it).
I meant of course to check all the baffling calculations Stephen writes on the huge blackboard, but hey … it’s a film!
AWARDS SEASON NOTES
I vowed not to go back and alter reviews as the awards come in. I was three-quarters wrong. Eddie Redmayne gets the Golden Globe for Best Actor.
Then Eddie Redmayne got Best Actor in the big on, the Oscars, as predicted.
[…] review of The Theory of Everything is linked here. It’s getting all the Golden Globe and Oscar tips, and deservedly […]
Four oscars from you, Peter. I’ll need to make an effort and go and see it. Glad the sixties and seventies are accurately portrayed. This is important to me. Thanks.
Thanks Peter – can’t wait to see it !!
I read a Brief History of Time and understood every word of course
Hutcho
Hutch, When you see it, do check all those formulas written on the blackboard. I thought there was a mistake in the third line.
Redmayne was singular; a brilliant performance. The last three minutes where they replayed time was quite moving. One other anachronism: as a quark nerd from Oxford I was impressed that at Cambridge quarks were mentioned in a lecture a year before they were hypothesised (1964) 🙂 Beats Imitation Game hands down. Frank Close
Thanks Peter.
I too was a bit surprised at the dialing code anachronism.
I also noticed a post-2008 style of number plate on a French car!
All in all though the 1960s and 70s scenes felt authentic.

ELAFLEX PACIFIC’s success and growth, sees the expansion of our current facility into the adjoining premises.
ELAFLEX PACIFIC has continued to see sustained growth of more traditionally sold product such as nozzles and hoses for LPGas and the petrochemical industry. The company is now taking on another facet of the ELAFLEX product range and allowing room for future growth in other Conti-Tech hose markets such as foodstuffs, pharmaceutical and aviation, as well as the potential to stock standardised ERV flexible expansion joints. The increase stocking ability allows for faster reaction times for customers on a wider range of standard products.
This increase relieves some pressure on our core manufacturing facility producing the GasGuard LPGas refuelling nozzles and accessories. It is a great step towards a more efficient and responsive future for the company.
It was a long time, I was waiting for a trip to Ooty for birding, after seeing the great images of birds made by my co-clickers. Ooty is an area of colourful birds, and almost all the birds are among the charismatic class, in other words, most celebrated by bird photographers.
So, I planned a trip to Ooty in the beginning of March, for a sat/sun. The summer vacation crowd was just starting. The main two areas to cover were - Botanical garden and Doddabetta, as per an expert's advise.
First place I visited was the Botanical garden. I was invited by few Oriental White-eyes which had just started their day, collecting honey from the Bottle Brush flowers. Soon after that, I could see the Nilgiri Flycatcher - the 2nd most popular bird locally.
After a while walking, I could only see couple of Indian Pond herons, Sparrows and Red-whiskered Bulbuls. I was told, the Kashmiri Flycatcher has not visited Ooty this year. Then after sometime, I saw the most popular bird of Ooty - Black and Orange Flycatcher. I fell in love with the bird, the first time I saw it. It was a curious little bird, with black and orange colours in its plumage as its name say.
In Ooty, I could feel that the birds are very much used to humans and are not as shy as the birds I have seen in western ghats. In the botanical garden, I saw Black and Orange Flycatcher, Nilgiri Flycatcher, Grey headed Canary Flycatcher, Bar-winged Flycatcher Shrike, Plenty of Indian Black Birds collecting nesting materials, Red-whiskered Bulbuls, Great tits, Common Moorhen, Indian Pond Herons, Spotted Dove and lots & lots of House Sparrows.
Then I started to Doddabetta after a quick lunch. It was around 7Km from Ooty town, and another 3 Km was reached via a four-by-four jeep drive. In Doddabetta, I found the Nilgiri Laughing Thrush, White-bellied Shortwing and Common Rosefinsh. Also I saw the Nilgiri Wood Pigeon and a Black eagle. The birds here are adapted to feed on the throw-away of fruits from the vendors.
Out of all the birds I saw in Ooty, I liked the Black and Orange Flycatcher the most. The curious little bird is so cute to watch. The way they behave after seeing a person in its territory, the way it calls with its bright orange tail spread to show the territorial display, everything was beautiful about this bird. I saw 2 pairs of them, and a single male, in both botanical garden and at Doddabetta.
Black-and-rufous flycatcher (Ficedula nigrorufa):.
In the breeding season, March to May, these birds are very vocal. They feed on insects by flycatching low over the ground and also pick insects from the ground. Territories are maintained by a pair throughout the year. The threat display involves the male pointing bill up, fanning the tail, opening wings and producing "keet-keet" notes. Males are usually involved in defense but females may sometimes join in. The nest is built by the female, placed in a low bush or fern. Two greyish speckled eggs form the usual clutch. Young birds are brownish and speckled. The nest is unlike that of most flycatchers and is large, coarse, ball-like and made from sedges. The nest has a foundation of dry leaves and ferns. The nest has an external diameter of about 6 inches (15 cm) and the egg cavity which is devoid of any lining is about 2 inches (5.1 cm) in diameter and 2 inches (5.1 cm) deep. The nest is placed usually at the centre of a bush at about 1 to 3 feet (0.30 to 0.91 m) height with an entrance hole close to the top.
The peak feeding activity of the birds is early in the morning and towards dusk. During these period they capture as many as 100 insects an hour whereas at mid-day they are half as efficient.

Chapter overview
Proceeding from the literature review in the previous chapter, leadership behaviors and their effects on work-related outcomes will be the topic of investigation for this work. In addition to direct effects, this research is characterized by the application of contextual variables. In particular, focus is placed on analyzing influences of physical distance, relationship quality, and interaction frequency on the leader- follower relationship. The list of hypotheses is subsequently divided in two sections: (1) direct effects of leadership behaviors on work-related outcomes, and (2) moderating and mediating roles of physical distance, relationship quality, and interaction frequency on the influence of leadership behavior on work-related outcomes.
Only a few attempts have yet been made to relate leadership behavior to facets of self-leadership. Using the Self-Leadership Questionnaire by Anderson and Prussia (1997), Brown and Fields (2011) linked leader self-leadership to perceived leadership behavior. The strongest correlation was found with role-modeling. Practicing behavior-focused strategies and demonstrating a high degree of self-discipline might encourage subordinates to follow their leaders’ example. Relating supervisors’ self-leadership behavior to the entire Full Range Leadership Model is first attempted by Furtner et al. (2013). Leaders’ self-leadership behavior was found to be positively correlated with perceptions of transformational and transactional leadership and negatively correlated with perceptions of laissez-faire leadership. Due to inevitable role-modeling behaviors of leaders (Braun & Fields, 2011) - also in negative ways - it is expected that transformational and transactional leadership trigger self-leadership in followers, whereas it is projected that passive leadership is counterproductive in the emergence of self-leadership in subordinates.
Hypothesis 1.1:
Transformational leadership and transactional leadership behavior both predict positive follower self-leadership, whereas passive leadership behavior predicts negative follower self-leadership.

Transformational and transactional leadership have often been linked to positive organizational outcomes. Considered a multiple-level phenomenon (Chun, Yam- marino, Dionne, Sosik & Moon, 2009, p. 689), leadership may occur on organizational, team, and individual level (Braun, Peus, Weisweiler & Frey, 2013, p. 271). The researchers discovered a positive relationship between followers’ perceptions of transformational leadership and job satisfaction on individual level. On team level, positive correlations between team perceptions of transformational leadership and team performance were found (Braun et al., 2013). A meta-analytic review by Judge and Piccolo (2004) revealed that transformational leadership and active traits of transactional leadership (contingent reward and active management-byexception) were significantly and positively related to followers’ satisfaction with the leader, leader job performance, and leader effectiveness. Transformational leadership is further expected to enhance identification with the leader (Bass & Riggio, 2006) acting as role model, providing vision (Michel et al., 2011), and encouraging behaviors that foster creativity (Antonakis et al., 2003). Transformational leaders display a high level of self-efficacy which is in turn known to be associated with higher levels of performance (Cavazotte et al., 2013; Kirkpatrick & Locke, 1996; Walumbwa et al., 2008). Linking transformational leadership to business unit performance, Howell and Avolio (1993) conclude that leaders require a set of transformational leadership traits in order to execute their function successfully. As transformational leaders stimulate intrinsic motivation (Kahai & Avolio, 2008) and empower subordinates through optimism and integrity (Bass & Avolio, 1994), they are expected to generate enhanced follower performance. Team effectiveness was further predicted more strongly by transformational leadership than by transactional leadership (Howell et al., 2005; Lowe et al., 1996). Executing a rational exchange process, transactional leadership is considered effective (Judge & Piccolo, 2004) especially in stable environments (Daft & Lengel, 1998). Encouraging subordinates by emphasizing rewards in return for achievement, transactional leadership was found to result in high degrees of participation (Kahai & Avolio, 2008). Contingent reward leadership is further associated with effective communication (Neufeld et al., 2010), performance (Bass & Avolio, 1990), and subordinates’ satisfaction (Mihalcea, 2014). Contradictory to transformational and transactional leadership, laissez-faire leadership is passive and non-participative (Den Hartog et al., 1997). The laissez-faire leader is best known to avoid making decisions and to shrug responsibility (Antonakis et al., 2003). Followers of these leaders might often feel alone and lack a reliable source of guidance. Predictably, laissez-faire leadership was frequently related to negative and ineffective work-related outcomes (An- tonakis et al., 2003). Passive management-by-exception (MBEp) showed significant negative correlations with follower motivation and leader effectiveness and laissez-faire leadership further displayed significant negative correlations with followers’ satisfaction with the leader, leader job performance, and leader effectiveness. The behavior is viewed as counterproductive and may even result in interpersonal conflict (Skogstad et al., 2007).
Hypothesis 1.2:
Transformational leadership and transactional leadership behavior both predict positive follower performance, whereas passive leadership behavior predicts negative follower performance.
Rooted in self-management, self-leadership emerged in the early 1980s mainly under the influence of work by Manz and Sims. By redesigning work processes, selfleadership strategies potentially shift the focus from unpleasant to pleasant features. Individuals who further devote their mental energy to pleasant tasks stimulate their intrinsic motivation (Manz, 1986). Manz and Neck (2004) identified three major strategies underlying the concept of self-leadership. Behavior-focused strategies emphasize behavioral aspects of the self; i.e., reward is mainly the result of a certain behavior. Natural reward strategies focus on the intrinsic joy of a task; i.e., by adding pleasant tasks or shifting the focal point from unpleasant to pleasant aspects, the nature of the task itself might improve. Constructive thought patterns include self-leadership strategies that are directed toward mental and cognitive actions one can undertake; i.e., imagining a handshake after a successful presentation or selftalk, to name just two examples. Despite the categorization, all self-leadership strategies pursue the same goal: to enhance the motivation and improve the performance of employees (Manz, 1986).
Uhl-Bien and Graen (1998) were among the first to test influences of selfmanagement in the public sector. The researchers discovered self-management to be positively related to employee job satisfaction. Using a sample of 151 students Prussia et al. (1998) confirmed self-leadership to predict perceptions of selfefficacy which in turn led to improved individual performance. Team selfleadership was found to be a predictor of team performance for teams occupied with conceptual tasks, in an investigation by Stewart and Barrick (2000). Furthermore, individuals lacking self-leadership are more suspicious of the world and express fear (Dolbier et al. 2001). The researchers related self-leadership to perceived well-being and discovered negative associations with perceived stress and illness. In general, empirical outcomes of the study confirm the positive relationship be?tween self-leadership and a more satisfying and effective work environment. Study outcomes by Politis (2006) show evidence that certain aspects of self-leadership are indeed related to team member satisfaction. Self-observation, self-goal setting, selfpunishment, and self-reward all positively predicted intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction. Those in turn were positively related to non-financial and overall team performance. Furthermore, self-leadership is expected to promote innovative behavior at the work place (Carmeli et al., 2006).
Using an excerpt from the SLQ (Houghton & Neck, 2002), a study by Konradt et al. (2009) tested for the relationship between self-leadership and performance and retrieved empirical evidence for a positive association. A series of studies in the field of self-leadership was recently undertaken in the German-speaking region by authors Hauschildt and Konradt (2012a; 2012b). Research outcomes showed, among other things, that self-leadership positively predicted task and team member proficiency. Self-leadership also revealed positive effects on adaptivity and proactivity of followers on individual and team level.
Hypothesis 1.3:
Follower self-leadership strategies have a direct positive effect on follower performance.

From the sky, the wastewater treatment plant looks like a flow diagram of filtration- an arrangement of settlers, clarifiers, and aerators. Evaporation Screen was inspired by the function of the Spokane Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant as a screen that attempts to join industry with the natural cycles of lakes, rivers, aquifers and sun.
Evaporation Screen is composed of maps of local lakes, mountains and cloud formations taken from cloud formation images and surrounding G.I.S. topography maps. Part industrial sieve and part natural light, the perforated metal panels filter views of the facility back into the surrounding environment. The sculpture, at times, disappears into its surroundings like a cloud of mist. When illuminated with sunlight, the screen appears solid. Evaporation Screen is a tribute to the ever present and sculptural nature of water, which erodes and forms and sustains our surrounding environment.

Singh urged his telknv American students not to antagonize Muslims or Arabs on the domestic level. He sees this battle as a fight of gmid verses evil, rather than a war over tern tory, like most wars in history, he said. “We have to find out who did this and eliminate them... that’s my feeling,” said Singh Still others felt that, while retribution was in order, it should be done on a smaller level, freshman Amanda Hoyw. also supports military action but with, “the least amount of civilian loss." Sophomore Mellisa Dolinsky found edan organization called Students for a Peaceful Future on Tuesday at 4 p.m., about 7 hours after the attacks. By 6 p.m. she had decided to organize the candlelight vigil that took place last Wednesday, but is now ready for vengeance. “We need to take action against them, but we can’t go in randomly...that’s what they did to us,” said sophomore Melissa Dolinsky. “I’d like to avoid war, but I don’t see any way around it." There were other students who were a little more ruthless. “We should torture bin laden," said Lisa Weiser, a sophomore Even if he wasn’t responsible for the attacks? “Yeah," Weiser said, “because he wants a holy war.” Truth SFTyaS Since 1927 y, September 18,2001 Muslim students speak in defense of their religion By Danielle Scott News Editor Assalama Alaikum—Peace be unto you. This is the way Muslims greet each other Muslim students at the University of Miami urge others to realize that their religion is all about peace—not war, not murder, not suicide bombings. “Take Islam out of this. These terrorists were crazy people. We don’t even know. These acts were not for Islam. They were anti-Islam,” said Najia Hussain, president of the Islamic Society of UM [ISUMJ. There is a dichotomy American Muslims face right now, that the rest of us cannot understand: How can they have time to mourn for their country while they are continuously looking over their shoulders, fearing for their safety? There have been 215 recorded attacks on American Muslims since last Tuesday’s tragedy, according to the Council for American-Islamic Relations. Two Sikh boys were killed in New York because they were thought be Muslim. And it hits closer to home. The first recorded incident since last Tuesday took place at a mosque in Pembroke Pines, reported the Miami Herald. , Harassers telephoned people at the mosque, asking them if they would all like to be tied up and shot one by one. The University of Miami is not sheltered from these hate crimes, and Muslim students are anxious. With Muslim girls being harassed in the University Center, the School of Engineering receiving threatening phone calls about their Muslim and Arab students and any student looking remotely Middle-Eastern or Indian being given dirty looks and side long glances, arguably, they have a right. “We are at the university level. You'd think people would be smarter than that," said Hussain, a junior majoring in film. ISUM, which has about a hundred members, discussed not wearing their traditional Islamic garb so they would be less conspicuous. Hussain said, they decided against it because it would be an affront to Islam. “This is our faith. We want to be proactive, not reactive,” Hussain said “This is not Pearl Harbor. Back then, we put innocent japancse Americans in concentration camps. As Americans we should be beyond that, by now,” she said. RUSSELL WOJTUSIAK / Photo Editor LIVING IN FEAR: Since the attacks on Muslim students following last Tuesday's events, Islamic students are wary to leave the comforts of home. “Timothy McVeigh was Christian. Does that mean we attack all Christians to avenge him? Think iogi cally.” “I just want to emphasize that Islam is about peace. We do not kill innocent people,” Hussain said. Attacking innocent people who happen to be Muslim is just another way of recreating Tuesday’s crimes, Hussain said. Thankfully, the UM administration is willing to do everything they can for our Muslim population, which numbers over 500. Student leaders from internation al, government, and charitable orga mzations showed up at the meeting, last Thursday, that President Shalala organized with the Muslim students on campus, to show their support. Vice President of Student Affairs, Dr. Pal Whitely, was also present. “I was really impressed with the administration. They are really on our side,” Hussain said. Shalala. an Arab-American herself, seemed to understand immediately the anxieties facing Muslims at UM. “I greeted her, Assalama alaikum, and she answered me back in Arabic, "We believe in that which has been bestowed upon us, as well as that which has been bestowed upon you; for our God and your God is one and the same, and it is unto Him that we all surrender ourselves.” The Holy Koran ’Walaikum asalam’—and peace be unto you. That was really nice,” Hussain said. “I felt safe in that room, having the meeting with the administration and the student leaders,” she said. Hussain was one of those who did not attend school on Wednesday out of fear. Islamic organizations around the US are urging Muslims to be cautious. They were also warned not to attract any media attention. Hussain was even scared to talk to the Hurricane. Everyday life has to take on new, more dangerous meanings. Muslims must worry what people are thinking when they are looking at them—is it just because they are dressed differently, or are they plotting some sadis tic revenge for last Tuesday’s terrorist attacks? The security that Americans ail over are fighting to regain since last Tuesday, is not returning anytime soon for Muslim Americans. “I have sometimes felt somewhat apart from the rest of American society because of my religion, but now I feel like that all the time,” Hussain said. She has lived in America most of her life. “Muslims can be Americans, too, you know." “I wish people could talk to us just as regular UM students who just happen to be Muslim," Hussain said. ISUM meetings on campus are no longer being publicized and the administration has provided security for all their events and especially, salat ul juma. their Friday prayers. MSG, the other Muslim student organization on campus, did not reply to an e-mail request for an interview from the Hurricane. A spokesperson from COISO would not provide a contact saying, “I’m sorry, but we’ve been asked not to disclose students' information for their own safety. The individual also asked that her name didn’t get published. A third attempt to obtain input from a Muslim student went unanswered as well. Because erf safety issues, Hussain and other Muslim Americans are limited in the ways they can help their country in this time of tragedy. “1 wanted to go give blood,” Hussain said. “And I feel so selfish because I should be lighting for my country But I have to tight for myntlf, first.” Hussain feels that Islam has been progressing over the years in the US. Americans were more ready to acknowledge and accept the large Muslim presence over here. “Now we are back to step one. I’m tired of fighting, but if I don’t do it, no one’s going to be doing it for me,” she said. “I love my religion. Islam is the ultimate for me—the best thing in mv life" RUSSELL WOJTUSIAK / Photo Editor WELCOME: (-Resident Donna Shalala said that students are tjie ones who mu^t stand up for cff^ersity.

Last Thursday, she met with concerned Muslim students to remind them they are as welcome as they’ve ever been on campus. Students, she said, are the one j who ultimately reach out to ensure the University stands up for diversity. “At the end of the day," Shalala said, “faculty and staff are not enough. Students are the ones who control what type of behavior is not tolerated.” Vigils, maudlin speeches and a rarely resolute e-mail forwarded to the entire student body restated that diversity is at the crux of this university.

Called “Carrier of Choice,” it offers the option of Verizon or T-Mobile, making it relatively easy to add your vehicle to an existing mobile plan.
Starting in September, VW owners in the US will be able to access the subscription plan options on VW’s dedicated website or via its mobile app. From there, you can add an account to your existing mobile wireless provider (assuming it’s Verizon or T-Mobile) and pair it with your existing Volkswagen Car-Net subscription. It will then appear as a new line-item on your existing bill. If you’re not already with those carriers, you can get unlimited 4G data for $20 per month.
Car-Net offers connected car features like remote start, locking and unlocking the vehicle, maintenance, status, teen driver alerts (curfew, boundary, speed) and more. Those features can be accessed remotely from both iPhone and Android smartphones using VW’s updated mobile app. It also offers a WiFi hotspot with “unlimited” 4G connectivity for up to four devices.
On top of those features, VW lets you access iHeart Radio and TIDAL media streaming apps with a paid subscription. It also offers the “Plus Nav” subscription with real-time traffice and route updates for $49 per year, a radio subscription with 30,000 global stations for $8 per year and a natural language speech option for $9 per year. Of course, VW models from 2019 and up come with CarPlay and Android Auto support, giving you many of those options for free. Car-Net comes standard on most 2020 model year and newer Volkswagen vehicles. .

Light wind lottery for Clipper boats in their China Sea race 06/03/2018 The light wind lottery that got Race 8: The Sailing City Qingdao Cup, underway yesterday from Sanya, has continued overnight, with the teams out east taking the early jackpot as they do their best to escape north, knowing that tougher, upwind conditions, await. The previous race winner, PSP Logistics, and Sanya Serenity Coast have been the early wind winners, currently leading the fleet just 0.3 of a nautical mile apart from each other, in the east. Matt Mitchell, Skipper of PSP Logistics, in first place, reports: “The first 24 hours haven't gone too badly at all with a good start seeing us pretty much leading the whole way of the inshore course before heading out to sea. Last night there were very light and fickle winds meaning the light wind lottery was very much back in action. “Thankfully we were one of the boats that fared better as we are now part of the leading pack heading into the South China Sea. We have a mixed bag of weather coming up as over the next 24 hours the wind will change from the nice spinnaker sailing that we have now, to light headwinds, and then build to strong headwinds later in the week. It will be interesting to see how each of the boats handles this first bit of the race as positioning is everything on our way towards Taiwan.” Explaining her decision to play her Joker Card in this particular race, Sanya Serenity Coast Skipper Wendy Tuck says: “We have played our Joker Card in this Leg for a couple of reasons. We usually do well in the shorter races and we usually do well in the upwind stuff, there should be plenty of the upwind stuff in the next couple of days, so fingers cross our Joker doesn't become a bad joke.” At this early stage however, Skippers know that the race is all still to play for and a number of close battles have already started within the fleet, making for intense efforts on board. Ten miles behind the leading two teams, also positioned in the east of the fleet, GREAT Britain is third, with Unicef less than half a mile further apart in fourth, with Liverpool 2018 sitting just over two nautical miles behind in fifth. Unicef Skipper Bob Beggs says: “The race got off to a light wind start, which we thoroughly enjoyed yesterday. We were however treated to an impromptu wind hole overnight, causing the fleet to park up, and we are now crawling away under lightweight (Code 1) spinnaker, hopefully making our escape. “The wind is due to head us shortly and the long beat to Qingdao and winter will begin in earnest. The upright sailing we are enjoying today will soon come to an end as we start to head north. The Unicef crew are ready and looking forward to the challenge.” In sixth place, just over 3nm behind, Visit Seattle is positioned in the centre of the fleet. Feeling a little unlucky following an early tactical decision, Skipper Nikki Henderson explains: “We had a great start – if slightly hair raising on the line – we sailed well and rounded the mark by the statue in second place. The crew worked super well. Definitely a competitive atmosphere onboard for this one. “Unfortunately, things went downhill after that and it's been a frustrating night. We tacked too early and headed north, right into a wind hole. About two hours ago it started to fill in which is a relief – but sadly we have had to watch PSP Logistics and Sanya Serenity Coast sail off into the distance, with Liverpool 2018 and Unicef not far behind them. We are working hard to keep sailing fast – and I'm working on trying not to beat myself up for a poor decision yesterday.” The back half of the fleet is further west with HotelPlanner.com the furthest south of the chasing teams, in seventh. Meanwhile, Dare To Lead (eighth), Qingdao (ninth), Garmin (tenth) and Nasdaq (eleventh) are all within six nautical miles of each other a little further north closer to the rhumb line. Dare To Lead Skipper Dale Smyth is also giving himself a hard time for making the wrong decision early on as he says: “A couple of bad tactical choices on our part has put us right towards the back of the fleet despite a fairly decent start, but anyway we live to fight on.” It's not just the light winds that are causing teams a headache however. Teams have also been on high alert to avoid the local fishing fleets, causing Dale to add: “Last night was painfully windless with hundreds of fishing boats. We went over a buoyed line and managed to pick up a fishing float around our rudders so lookout here is absolutely critical! We are still fighting very little wind and trying to eke as much as we can out of our boat.” The fleet still has over 1,500nm of its journey to Qingdao to go and the teams have covered between 45 – 70 nautical miles in the last twelve hours. Despite the slow speeds due to the light and variable winds which has seen progress at around eight knots, life has been busy on board with many tacks required to navigate around the fishing fleets and wind holes. Teams are also enjoying the warm temperatures and using the flatter conditions as a nice, easy way to settle back into life on board as they know before too long that they'll be heading back to life at an angle when the North Easterly Trade Winds kick in and temperatures on board will plummet as they get closer to Qingdao.

As per Sport, Barcelona’s former technical secretary Ramon Planes made contact with van de Beek regarding a potential move to Camp Nou. Van de Beek was open to a move to Barcelona, but Xavi has rejected the idea because of the midfield options he has at his disposal.
Planes’ contract was terminated around a week ago, so it’s unlikely the club will make an approach for van de Beek as things stand.
Barcelona were linked with a move for van de Beek in the summer of 2020 as well. However, they failed to sign the Dutchman, who moved to Manchester United. Van de Beek played alongside Frenkie de Jong at Ajax, and the duo helped Ajax reach the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League in 2019.
Barcelona’s midfield options under Xavi
New Barcelona boss Xavi has a distinct style that is likely to suit the club’s academy graduates who felt alienated under Ronaldo Koeman. Riqui Puig is one player who is expected to benefit from Xavi’s appointment as the midfielder was heralded as the next big thing a couple of seasons ago.
Puig’s playing time was limited under former manager Koeman. But he is expected to feature more regularly after coming off the bench against Celta de Vigo and Espanyol in back-to-back games. In Pedri, Pablo Gavi and Nico Gonzalez, Xavi has more options up his sleeve so there doesn’t seem to be much of a need to sign another midfielder.
Barcelona could instead focus on signing another striker as Sergio Aguero’s career is now in doubt after a heart issue. Martin Braithwaite is also injured at the moment, while leaves Xavi with only two senior strikers.
As for van de Beek, he might stick around at Manchester United and try to break into the first team under new management. Following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s dismissal, the club are expected to hire an interim boss soon.

The Challenge
A $4b+ corporation that provides consulting and engineering solutions to US-based commercial and governmental clients, hired Speed & Function to redesign their web-based app for hazard mitigation planning.
They already had a solution built and initially approached S&F to scale it. However, due to software architecture issues and technical debt, it was hard to expand the app’s functionality and therefore almost impossible to scale. Speed & Function recommended a complete redesign of the application, rather than attempting to build out problematic architecture.
A strict deadline and limited budget intensified the challenge this project presented. In addition, as S&F learned more about the audience, the business priorities shifted slightly throughout the process of development. Being adaptable in the face of changing needs was important.
The Approach
The client’s assessment tool is aimed at helping communities manage their risk mitigation actions and track the completion of these actions to be better protected from natural disasters. The app has to be flexible enough to comply with each jurisdiction’s mitigation strategy and capture all critical elements that have to be reported.
To ensure alignment with the client’s needs and the nuances of hazard mitigation plans, S&F developed the product by involving the client’s project manager in regular Scrum meetings. The project had to be paused a few times due to budgetary constraints; nevertheless, S&F delivered the product in the way stakeholders from the corporation envisioned it.
To speed up the process of development without compromising on quality and functionality, the S&F team also incorporated many helpful tools with ready-to-use components like the front-end framework Ant D and the back-end tool Sidekiq for event scheduling.
The Outcome
Speed & Function delivered an MVP of the product in less than eight months, with the ability to serve dozens of different jurisdictions and provide different types of access to view and edit mitigation planning information.
The tool provides the following functionality:
- Statistics on completed actions for a given jurisdiction
- Role-based access to data and editing, with read-only users as well as reviewers who can document mitigation actions
- Functionality to search by jurisdiction or specific hazard management plan
- Automatically generated reports for regular plan reviews (weekly, monthly, or annual) adjusted to the jurisdiction of any level (federal, state, county, tribe)
- Report templates with manual editing options
- Email reminders to users and automatic report emails sent to points of contact
- Data backups for future access.
Currently, the team is working on implementing additional features such as additional entry fields or statistics export to .xls.
The Secret Sauce
Digital products such as this – those designed for a very specific and narrow use and which are regulated by different jurisdictions – often have cluttered interfaces and incomprehensible UX. However, it is possible to make them easy-to-use and intuitive.
Thanks to the effective technological decisions made by the Speed & Function team, the web app can now solve the pain points of disaster management for many US communities. The tool is flexible and secure, with role-based access to data and the function to create comprehensible and customizable reports.
The company has since engaged Speed & Function to extend the number of features and make the app even more convenient to end-users.

The Social Struggle in France Is Here to Last
December 17 will see the biggest strikes yet against Emmanuel Macron’s assault on pensions. But with the neoliberal president well aware that this battle will define his presidency, defeating him will take more than single days of action.

Just as the opponents of Emmanuel Macron’s pension reform planned, the actions on December 5 have kick-started the biggest wave of strikes and street mobilization France has seen in more than a decade. Over the last week and a half, railways across the country and public transport in Paris and its environs have remained at a standstill.
Although only these two sectors have gone on indefinite strike, other workers have also taken strike action in significant numbers for one day or more. Education, oil refinery, and energy workers have taken action just like firefighters, dockers, and health workers — on December 5, no less than 3,500 private-sector workplaces were affected by strikes or work stoppages.
Both on that first day of action and on December 10, hundreds of thousands took to the streets (1.5 million on the fifth and 800,000 on the tenth), displaying their strong will to fight. Students also joined the demonstrations, although the mobilization has been uneven and discontinuous across different campuses.
A majority of workers haven’t yet joined the strike movement, especially in the private sector. But a solid majority of public opinion (54 percent to 68 percent, according to opinion polls) does support the strike. Notwithstanding the difficulties entailed by the lack of public transport and the hostility coming from the media, popular support for the movement is still on the rise. But the crucial issue for the days ahead is whether this supportive sentiment can take an active form.
The Government in Trouble
The government’s initial plan was to isolate the strike in the transport sector alone. The idea was to render it unpopular by presenting it as a fight in defense of “corporatist privileges” while talking as little as possible about the actual content of the pension reform. Yet that plan clearly failed — and the government was forced into maneuvers.
One aspect of its approach was simply repressive, as it sent the police to break the picket lines in many bus depots and in the ports. But on December 11, prime minister Édouard Philippe was also sent out to provide a more detailed version of the planned pension reform. While his speech was mellow in tone, the content of the reform was in fact even harsher than expected.
Philippe confirmed that the existing system would be replaced by an allegedly “universal” points-based one, comparable to the Swedish and Italian model, with the consequence that all existing sectoral pension schemes (like those of railway and public transport workers) would be abolished. This change would mean that the current defined benefit pension scheme, based on a redistributive principle among all those who contribute, would be replaced by one depending on individualized contributions. The pension level currently calculated on the average of the twenty-five best years of a career would instead correspond to the average across their entire active period. This would automatically bring down pensions, especially for all those who have been through periods of unemployment and precarious work. Philippe insisted that such a change was non-negotiable.
But he went even further: for although formally the legal retirement age would remain unchanged at sixty-two, to get a full pension, you will now have to work two extra years. He also offered convoluted statements trying to present the reform as advantageous for most categories, particularly for women. Yet undermining his own claim that the new scheme is “universal,” he was also keen to reassure the military and the police that little, if anything, will change for their pensions.
The least that can be said is that Philippe failed to persuade France of the merits of the reform. According to opinion polls, 61 percent of those who saw his intervention found it unconvincing. Even worse, by announcing a two-year extension of the age threshold for a full pension, the government lost its sole lenient interlocutor in the trade-union movement, the “moderate” French Democratic Confederation of Labor (CFDT) that supports the principle of a points-system-based pension reform.
Commenting on Philippe’s announcements, CFDT secretary general Laurent Berger declared that “a red line [had] been crossed” and called for the CFDT to join the day of mobilization for December 17. In other words, Macron and Philippe succeeded in reestablishing the unity of the notoriously fragmented French trade-union movement. Berger did quickly express his good intentions in reaching a compromise and stressed his opposition to rolling strikes like those currently affecting the railways and public transport. Yet he repeated that he wouldn’t accept anything less than the withdrawal of the two-year extension of the age retirement for a full pension.
The bad news for Macron didn’t stop there. An avalanche of media reports revealed that Jean-Paul Delevoye — the minister in charge of the pension reform — had “forgotten” to declare in his statement of interest that he is involved with the think tanks and boards of some eight companies. Many of these latter are direct beneficiaries of the proposed reform, for instance the training institute of the confederation of insurance companies or the national railway company’s foundation. As a consequence, on December 16, Delevoye — a key figure in government policy-making and the entire setup of Macron’s La République En Marche! party — was forced to resign. He thus delivered a serious blow to the French president at the most difficult moment of his term in office.
Organizing the Struggle
The battle is set to continue and even intensify in coming days. Indeed, the trade-union confederations that have initiated the movement — the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), Solidaires Unitaires Démocratiques (SUD), and the teachers’ union, FSU — have called for a one-day, cross-sectoral strike and for mass demonstrations on December 17. With the CFDT joining in, it looks likely that the numbers will be even bigger than on December 5. But significant concessions cannot likely be expected from the government so long as the strike remains limited to the railways and public transport networks in Paris, and only occasionally supported by single days of action at a more generalized level.
In this sense, the key factor for escalating the action lies in the self-organization of the struggle at the grassroots. Many positive experiences have been developing since December 5: daily assemblies at workplaces are held in most sectors on strike and local coordination has brought together the actions in various sectors. Notably, students and teachers have joined picket lines in ports and in the transport sector, while railway workers have come to schools or campuses in order to steer action. In some places, strike committees have been constituted. The Yellow Vests movement has undoubtedly helped in breaking with previous union routine and bringing a more combative style of action. But all this remains uncoordinated and lacks visibility for the general public. More is needed for “the strike to pass into the hands of the strikers” as the general assemblies demand.
On the positive side, the union leadership has turned down the government’s offer to negotiate minor modifications of the reform or to call for a “Christmas truce.” But it has so far failed to put forward a strategy allowing the strike to expand to other sectors and to encourage organization at a grassroots level. To escalate action, union leaders seem to be relying solely on initiatives taken by the few remaining strongholds like dockers or the workers in oil refineries.
The Missing Alternative
The weakness of the political left is also acutely felt here. Everyone appears supportive of the strike, even former president François Hollande’s Socialist Party. But the only concrete initiative has been a rather modest rally called by the Communist Party on December 11, which succeeded in bringing everyone, from Socialists and Greens to the far left, to sit on the same platform. Yet the sole shared message was opposition to Macron’s reform, without any agreement on alternative solutions.
The Left’s weakness has opened up a space for the demagogy of the far right. In line with her previous embrace of the Yellow Vests, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Rally (formerly National Front), has declared her support for the ongoing mobilization.
This is, in fact, the first time that the far right has given its backing to a strike movement. Of course, Le Pen made it clear that this doesn’t mean support for trade-union action or even for an indefinite strike. But some second-line cadres of her party did join the demonstrations of December 5, or at least tried to do so. This is a further confirmation of the far right’s efforts to try to capture popular anger, by any available means. Indeed, this risk needs to be taken seriously by the political left and the trade-union movement.
Everyone engaged in the battle understands that the stakes are very high, for both sides. Macron is aware that, in the battles to come, his position as the leader of the neoliberal bloc is at stake. And it’s clear to all those continuing to strike and take to the streets that they can’t afford another defeat, if the current race into the abyss is to be stopped. It’s now up to mobilization from below to decide the outcome of the movement — and whether it can win.iPad-Pro ~ a 12.9″ iPad ~ Is Really Ready for Prime Time Challenging the 14″ PCs and the Education Market 🍎🍎🍎🍎🌐😎😎😎😎
iPad-Pro ~ a 12.9″ iPad ~ Is Really Ready for Prime Time Challenging the 14″ PCs and the Education Market. iPad Pro is reported to be designed as a 12.9″ iPad “Retina” high resolution display, (recall the traditional iPad 5 with its 9.7″ retina-display, and iPad-mini retina display with its 7.9″ display) iOS system. This Larger sized 12.9″ iPad is directly targeting 13″ 14″ and 15″ PC LapTops, Desk PCs, and Education.
The larger 12.9″ display is perfect for Academic Text Books used in Schools and Universities. Apparently, the iPad Pro “qualifies as a legitimate product rumor” as several others are touting an iPad Pro (just kidding). Must admit, I’m part of the problem; however, must admit that yours truly, standing alone, wrote of this over 2 years ago.
More Industry sources close to the production line and familiar with Apple’s product roadmap say that a 12.9″ display is in the works for a product called the iPad Pro. Apple is reportedly already talking to potential supply-line manufacturers to create this humungous display which is set to be released in 2014.
Apple is reportedly is really.
Chinese Sources said that an iPad build to a 4K resolution would likelt.
Apple will actively target 13” PC ultrabooks and notebooks, with the iPad Pro, or whatever Apple chooses to name it, by providing the device with better portability, better battery life, and comparable screen real estate for productivity applications..
This new iPad Maxi, is a portable or desktop computing “game changer” as it employs the Apple iOS amazingly efficient operating system; that’s right… NOT an OSX laptop, but an iOS6 or iOS7 operating system platform, housed in a “super-charged” iPad-maxi with a huge 12.9″ maxi-display.
Using an exterior similar to the MacBook Air’s foot-print, the iPad Maxi would be “supercharged iPad” with:
Touch-Screen Retina-Display, designed to challenge the Post PC traditional 13″ to 15″ LapTop computers
a 12.9″; iPad optionally housed within the clam-shell lid, by the After Market.
Key Board, using Apple’s world famous bluetooth keyboard, build into the clam-shell’s bottom shell.
360˚ Hinge. A new clam-shell optional design to have a 360˚ hinge. Perhaps Apple will leave the ClamShell feture to the AfterMarketeers.
This would redefine the Laptop, just as the Apple iPad redefined the Tablet..
As the transition from the PC to the iPad becomes more profound, and if the iPad maxi, a super-charged iPad, as outlined below, many more Windows PC’ers would migrate to Apple; Conversly, If you want a more compact device the iPadv4 footprint is perfect, as I presently have with Belkin’s Ultimate Keyboard Case, discussed in another Article. If you want more horsepower, then the iPad-Maxi described below would satisfy this need; want even more power then the MAC Book Air is it… Want even more Power, then the MAC Book Pro answers this need….
November, 2012 Apple met the demand for a more-compact iPad Display, when it released the iPad mini; The iPad-mini’s is having incredible success; The iPadv4 and the iPad-mini combined sales are about 65 million iPads/year.… 2GB,
🔷 more Storage say 64GB base the storage, 128GB add $100, 256GB add $200. Memory is inexpensive, so give the folks a good chunk of it.
🔷 more Connectivity say LTE, 4G and 3G Cellular, optional $130 radio package to the standard WiFi a/b/g/n bands
🔷 faster Processor say 2 similar but improved Mathematics & Calculating capacity to the traditional iPad.
🔷 more Money, say $669 for the Base model, $999 fully loaded LTE version.
🔷 more for Me. I will be saving $999 for sure.
🔷 my plan, I will be selling my iPad 4 to Gazelle soon, to help defray the cost of the iPad-mini Retina. Then I will be positioned to have the very portable iPad mini retina, and the much larger iPad Pro for those intense Video and Photo Editing jobs, or simply a very portable table-top iPad Pro.

As a “Health Nut” for Health & Wellness;.Good Design | Do The Green Thing at The Hospital Club
The Hospital Club, one of London’s trendiest creative hubs (and named one of Britain’s coolest brands), recently hosted their annual Sustainability Week. This was an effort that saw the club bringing members of the creative community together to discuss and share how we can be responsible global citizens and make the world a better place. Bringing their unique and inspiring take on creativity vs climate change to the party, was not-for-profit Do The Green Thing.
Photographer Dean Chalkley’s aim was to get people turning off the heating and pulling on a jumper instead.
Billed as an “advertising agency for the environment” by founder and Pentagram partner Naresh Ramchandani, Do The Green Thing have a mission to “to inspire, seduce, provoke and persuade people to do things that they otherwise would not have considered.” Naresh spoke very eloquently about the power of creativity in the ‘dark arts’ of advertising and marketing to ‘sell more stuff’ and how his experience of working in the industry for many years had led to a frustration with the status quo which then in turn inspired him to set up Do The Green Thing with co-founder Andy Hobsbawm.
Design company Hudson-Powell have created this rather endearing poster, encouraging us to show light bulbs a bit of compassion.
Illustrator Harriet Stansall has created a poster using acrylic and gouache to campaign against fussiness when we are picking fresh produce, which is partially responsible for the astronomical amount of food that goes to waste worldwide.
The second of Do The Green Thing’s 23 Posters in support of WWF’s Earth Hour on March 23rd is by Pentagram designer Marina Willer.
Naresh is absolutely right: creativity in itself is neither good or bad, it is simply a tool or vehicle that is used to convey a message. And the creative industries are extremely talented at using it to fuel consumerism. What Do The Green Thing is trying to do is to harness that talent, time, energy and creativity to produce sustainable advertising of the same calibre but which instead encourages and allows us to live a greener lifestyle.
Their latest campaign features a host of design industry icons using their powers for good, with Naresh calling in favours from his Pentagram pals such as Angus Hyland, Marina Willer, Michael Bierut and Emily Oberman and creative figures like Patrick Cox (designer of the Olymic Logo) and Google’s Tom Uglow.
Pentagram’s Harry Pearce was struck by how many of us seem to have forgotten how to use our feet.
What’s really lovely about the creative output of Do The Green thing is that they are a testament to the staying power of one the oldest mediums of communication, the poster. In an age where the latest advertising campaigns demand fully integrated digital, TV, outdoor and print solutions there is a very powerful statement to be made by communicating everything within the confines of a page. As Naresh himself says “Posters are the most effective way for Do The Green Thing to get out first class creativity consistently”. Paradoxically the poster then manifests itself as its own digital campaign, as the viral nature of the content and creativity share the message far and wide via social media.
To date Do The Green Thing estimate they have reached over 11million people with their ‘advertising campaign for the environment’ and Naresh says he has high hopes for 2014 when they will be partnering again with the wildlife charity WWF, where he has the target of reaching 50 million plus! I for one hope they hit that target and more because the world really needs creativity to engage and inspire people and facilitate more sustainable lifestyles.Go eco-friendly with holiday light displays

**Carl Finley was a soldier genetically enhanced by the United States Government, before the Joker transformed his psychology to make him work for him as Straightman.
History
Carl Finley came from an affluent family and went to a prep school during his younger years. He was a Heisman Trophy winner in college and after graduating, enlisted for military service. Finley was sent to West Point to serve as a cadet and became a special forces operative, eventually achieving the rank of captain. There, the United States Government selected him as a subject for its super-soldier program that would turn a person into the ultimate crimefighter. During his operation, the Joker barged in and forced to doctors to hand the charge to him at gunpoint, before working on his frontal lobes to transform his psychology and make him loyal to him.[1][2]
Finley started working for the Joker under the name "Straightman". Despite his name, he was bad at doing comedy.[2] Some time later at the Amusement Mile, Joker had him attack Jason Todd after spotting him spying on them. Straightman knocked over the Ferris wheel Jason was spying from, and the latter was surprised to find he was impervious to bullets. Straightman then threw a Ferris wheel car at him, before Joker threw a grenade at Jason. Joker then forced his henchman to get in the car, so they could escape.[3]
The Joker later came to the Iceberg Lounge, asking for money, but the Penguin rejected it, stating he knew someone was trying to kill him and he'd like to see how the situation turns out. As the Joker ordered Straightman to threaten him, the Penguin called in Mr. Wing to deal with him. Mr. Wing was however severely outmatched in the fight and knocked out. Jason mounted his attack at the exact moment, firing a hail of darts at Straightman and knocking him onto the iceberg, before throwing a grenade at the heavy chandelier above him, causing it to partly shatter and fall with its jagged edges upon him.[1]
Straightman however survived and went to rescue Joker, who had been kidnapped by Jason, due to a homing device planted in his skull. As Straightman grabbed Jason, Batman attacked him with a crowbar, given to him by Tim Drake who had freed himself of the tank Jason was trying to drown him in. This however proved ineffective and he soon used his own strength against him, dodging his punches which caused him to hit the nearby wall. This caused the old pipes carrying water to explode, washing both Joker and Straightman into the sea.[4]
Joker and Straightman however survived the encounter with Jason, hiding at the Ha-Ha-Hide-Away from Batman. After finding out that his ex-girlfriend Harley Quinn had sent invites for a Christmas party to everyone except him, he decided to take revenge by targeting the now-cured Arnold Wesker, whom he considered a loser and nobody.[5]
Straightman was sent to Arkham Asylum to retrieve the Scarface puppet, which Wesker used to regard as a real person and his boss in the past. The two later went to Harley's party at the Iceberg Lounge, pretending they had brought a present, but Batman under the disguise of "Knute Brody" spoiled Joker's plan by tossing gifts at everyone, which created a ruckus. After he claimed that the cops had surrounded them, Joker and Straightman escaped the club along with other villains. Finley struck Batman from behind after he helped Wesker escape, and Joker initially ordered him to brutally beat him up. They were however forced to spare him after seeing the police come their way and fled.[2]
Finley and Joker later went to Wesker's home, placing Scarface on his chair. Wesker was shocked to discover Scarface there and Joker revealed they had brought the puppet so he could be reunited with him, adding Finley had even shined him up for the occassion. Finley put Scarface back on his hand, causing Wesker to relapse into his Scarface persona. As Scarface tried to attack Wesker for abandoning him, he sensed a pleasant smell. Finley revealed it was due to furniture polish he put on him, which Scarface approved of. Scarface then took Straightman to Santa's Town, where he had hidden the CX-8000 explosive, and which Joker wanted to use. After arriving there, he told Straightman to check the candy canes to find them.[6]
At his hideout, Joker commended Scarface for thinking up about a plan to blow people on New Year's Eve. On the scheduled day, the four reached a subway station via a railcar. As Joker planted the explosives, Finley questioned him why the station was empty, with Joker revealing that it had been shut down to keep out the crowd during the day. Scarface questioned Joker about the ransom money, but he revealed he never demanded it from the police. He then knocked Wesker out, before telling Finley to start the car as they had less than five minutes to flee. Batman and Robin however soon arrived there, having been told by Wesker where they were through a subway ticket. Batman disabled the controls and fought Finley, who was soon tossed onto Joker's railcar. A train soon hit the car from behind, but Finley and Joker survived. Finley fled to Gotham's suburbs in order to escape the police.[6]

FootnotesCuracao Dive
6 Months after my trip to Turks I was diving in Curacao, and this is a trip I was looking forward to for over a decade. By this time I was getting pretty good with my rig and had added a light in excess of $600 dollars. Needless to say I was really looking forward to the images the camera could produce with proper lighting.
Curacao has allot of diving locations all over the island, we rented a car and hit a half dozen or so over the length of the trip. Each evening I would check the shots and was really pleased, they looked great even before post.
Here are a few of the best shots during my diving on Curacao.Whitehaven team resolve customer's challenging sale

Whitehaven team resolve customer's challenging sale
The owners initially chose a different agent to market their property as they had sold some similar properties nearby. They promised excellent communication, regular feedback and marketing meetings – in short, all the things you would expect from an agent.
Dr A recalls, “They were absolutely dreadful. After two months I had to call up the owner of the company to come and see us because we had no communication from them at all, even after viewings. After the contractual tie-in period with them, we went straight away to get our property marketed with PFK”
Our Whitehaven team got everything up and running quickly, matching the property out to potential buyers by making phone calls and sending out emails to generate as much interest as possible in the first few days of marketing. After pro-active marketing online and in the local press the decision was made to reduce the price. A price reduction is always part of a wider discussion with the owners after our team has looked carefully at the market conditions and the likely demand. Unlike many agents, we don’t over-value to gain your business then spend the next 6 weeks asking you for a price reduction. All our valuations are put together by experienced, senior members of staff who use recent comparable sold prices, our internal database of potential buyers and their expert, local knowledge to recommend a sensible asking price.
“All the Whitehaven staff were excellent, however Lisa Murphy stood out. She took our property on and made it her personal mission to get it sold. We were constantly kept in the loop and informed about everything that was going on.”
Despite the complication of the buyer offering through the original estate agent (as they had originally viewed the property through them), Lisa worked incredibly hard to get the sale agreed and negotiated with the owner of the previous agent to reach an agreement where the offer could be accepted and the sale progressed. Unfortunately, on this occasion the progression of the sale was prolonged and difficult, with various issues which had to be resolved along the way. Finally, the buyer pulled out of the sale the day before exchange and completion after the owners had given most of their furniture to charity and arranged a rental property in a different area. In short, everything we don’t want to happen, happened, causing a lot of stress for our clients.
“Luckily this nightmare came to a resolution two weeks after we had moved out when the buyer came through, again helped greatly by Lisa continuing to work on our behalf. We cannot recommend them highly enough both on a personal and professional level and Lisa Murphy was definitely our hero.”
Amy McKinlay, Area Manager, comments, “When the progression of a sale becomes difficult, stress levels and emotions can run high – it’s absolutely crucial to have an agent who can negotiate this potentially rocky path on your behalf to ensure a good outcome. Many agents only offer the bare minimum of a sales progression service; often the ones with a temptingly low upfront fee have very little motivation to resolve issues at this stage as they have already been paid for the sale of your property. At PFK, we believe sales progression is a hugely important part of our service and we have a dedicated sales progression team to ensure your sale is seen through to completion – all included as part of our fee.”
At PFK, we believe in making property simple. Estate Agency is a people business and we put people at the heart of everything we do – not just our clients, but our people as well. We are proud to have people like Lisa, and we know all of our teams strive to go the extra mile for our clients. Buying and selling can be stressful, which is one of the reasons we think it’s important to have a physical office where you can talk to one of our knowledgeable local experts. Our small, friendly teams are made up of people you can get to know, and there’s not a call centre in sight.For more than a decade, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been the gold standard in human and veterinary neurology and neurosurgery. Our experience and the leading research demonstrates that it is a safe, accurate and essential test for neurologic patients. It is often critical in providing a diagnosis and proper treatment, making it an essential diagnostic tool for our patients and clients.
MRI is Non-Invasive, Rapid and Safe
Using onsite MRI allows our team to provide a more accurate diagnosis, to differentiate between the conditions that might be causing your pet’s symptoms and to do so safely and rapidly. MRI also allows us to differentiate conditions that may benefit from surgery from conditions in which surgery may be life threatening while also helping us differentiate between structural, infectious and neoplastic causes of disease. This knowledge shapes the care and treatment your pet will receive and is critical to providing life-saving medicine.
At BVNS, we offer onsite MRI at all of our full-service locations through our imaging partner, Bush Advanced Veterinary Imaging. If your pet may undergo an MRI, please review this important “What You Can Expect” information sheet on this procedure.
MRI and Other Diagnostic Imaging Options
At BVNS, we will consider all diagnostic options that are appropriate for your pet and discuss these options with you. While other options may be considered, it is important to note that in comparison to many of these options, MRI is vastly superior and safer. For these reasons, we will often recommend it over other options.
For important information on why we use MRI and a comparison between MRI and the other available imaging options, please review this important handout or contact us and we’ll be happy to answer your questions!THRIVE IN TODAY’S COMPETITIVE MARKET

Calling the shop and asking: Is my tattoo infected?
We can not tell if you are having an issue healing with your tattoo unless we can visually inspect it. If you are experiencing any concern, please come into the shop so we may assist. Please note that it is very rare that a tattoo gets infected. Many times, it is the person’s skin reacting to the ointment that they are applying. That is why it is imperative that use follow the aftercare instructions.
Can I get a quote over email or the internet/social media?
We can we can give you a very rough estimate as to what you can expect. Please note that we seldom have time in our day to check social media or email so it is always best to come into the shop to discuss ideas and schedule appointments.
Can I make my appointment over the phone?
Unless you are an established recurring customer you may not make an appointment over the phone. We apologize for the inconvenience, but too many times people have just not shown up for their appointment, as you can surmise this can cause a bit of distress for an artist who has scheduled a block of time to create a tattoo and are left with an empty chair for hours. if you are traveling a long distance or from out of the country please call or contact us as we make exceptions for our foreign clients and would be happy to accommodate you and your needs.
Can I get a quote over the phone?
We do not and will never give a price for a tattoo over the phone. We will never give a quote without seeing how big, what colors and what type of detail you are looking to have inked on your body. Please come into the shop to discuss all pricing or a rough estimate of what a particular piece may cost. We mention the term “rough estimate” as there is no solid way to tell if your tattoo price will be what was originally quoted. This is not a bait and switch practice, as there are many factors that go into the final result of your tattoo and many times, designs change, how many breaks you will need and how your skin holds up during the tattoo process will all reflect in your final price at the end of the tattoo session.
Does it really cost the shop that much to do a tattoo?
Here’s a break done of what a tattoo costs our shop: Supplies to do a tattoo: $50.00 plus $100.00 of tattooing with the artist for one hour = $150.00. When the artist goes to get paid the following items are taken into consideration: 50% of all tattoos go to pay for electric, supplies and to the shop. That leaves the artist with $75.00. In addition, the artist will need to factor in the cost of supplies such as paper towels and gloves. This leaves the net profit from the tattoo; $40.00. Not bad by normal work standards but keep in mind that unless we are tattooing we aren’t getting paid. We are not used car salesmen wheeling and dealing with a dickering sales pitch. We use the highest quality products and equipment. We take pride in our consistent and high quality art that we produce in a safe and positive environment.
Do you ever have specials where you will tattoo for a flat fee for as long as I can take?
Under no circumstance will we ever promote or do any special for “all you can sit”. This is a ridiculous idea that often times struggling shops and artist do to get people in their chair. They may need to get some work under their belt or to make money off of uneducated consumers. We make art and have our customer’s best interest at heart as well as their health. Many artists and shops who perpetrate this type of business are using cheap supplies. Being in this industry for many years we have seen a variety of ways that this type of practice has ruined a piece and ended poorly.
How do consultations work?

We provide our customers with a consultation appointment to visually work with you on your tattoo design.

I’ve attempted to make combinations that can be interpreted as expressions of 6 big emotions: anger, disgust, happiness, sadness, surprise and fear. I say attempted, as there is not really a standard for what the different emotions look like. Also, because the illustrations of the AU’s show a strong form of the movements, the full expressions can look a bit extreme and could be much more subtle.
Starting of with anger. Mostly characterized by the brow moving down and in (AU 4). The expression can be accompanied by ‘thinning’ (AU 23) and tightening (AU 24) of the lips, as well as flaring of the nostrils and tightening of the eyelids.
Then there is the expression of disgust. The most important parts of this expression are the pulling up, and wrinkling of the nose (AU 9) and the raising of the upper lip (AU 10) (which does not necessarily part the lips, although it does here, as it makes the expression stronger (or exaggerated)). Here the expression is also accompanied by the eye lid tightener.
Next is happiness. The smile is mainly a combination of the lip corner puller (AU 12) and the cheek raiser (AU 6). Fake smiles often only show the corners of the mouth movement, missing the ‘smiling eyes’ movement (AU 6 is difficult for most people to do voluntarily).
The expression of sadness is made by the raising (AU 1) and tightening (AU 4) of the inner brow, as well as raising the cheeks (AU 6) (which is, interestingly, just as important here as in the smile expression) and, maybe the most recognizable, the corners of the lips pulling down (AU 15).
Next on the list is surprise. The expression of surprise is characterized by an overall lengthening and opening up of the face. Both the inner (AU 1) and outer (AU 2) parts of the brow are raised, the upper eyelid is raised (AU 5), the lips are parted (AU 25) and the jaw drops down (AU 26).
Last on the list is the expression of fear. This expression looks quite tense overall, tightening outward: the inner (AU 1) and outer (AU 2) brow raise and tighten (AU 4), here the eye lids are also raised (AU 5) and tightened (AU 7), then finally there’s the lateral stretching of the lips and the pulling of the platysma (AU 20).sleepingdog

Sometimes, hobbies bring us the greatest dividends. One of the homeless in the US HOS dabbled with a metal detector for 18 years, and one day he found a 1000 gold and silver coins, as well as weapons, all the finds dated to the 7th century. Since the discovery legally belongs to the US, only half gave the lucky. Half of the treasures in terms of dollars, estimated at 1, 6 million dollars.
Normal penny 1974 about a year costs only one cent, but not in this case. Robert Lawrence was the son of the deputy superintendent of the mint in the United States in Denver. After his death, his father left his offspring inherited a coin collection in the lunch box. For a long time she lay useless, but after moving from Denver to San Diego, Robert took them to the expert who evaluated the coin only 300 dollars. But after careful study, he found that one of the coins was completely made of aluminum. According to history, these coins were made of only 10 and it was thought that they were all destroyed, because they do not take a soda vending machines. But it turns out, one survived and she alone is estimated at $ 2 million.
The first number of this comic book series is estimated precisely in such a fabulous sum. The fact that this was released in the 1938th year, a comic for the first time gave the world famous character: Superman. One man from Minnesota bought an old abandoned house for $ 10,100. Renovating one and the walls, he found this valuable comics. On the internet auction this rare comics risen in price to $ 100,000.

That is the Stradivarius violin invented for orchestral performances. Before him to fiddle was heard, musicians with violins located in five different places in different parts of the room.
A striking example of what is always necessary to understand all the intricacies before you do anything. An American made a living in that collected and purified metal objects. One day he bought a rusty metal sphere with pearl inlays for 14,000 dollars. After cleaning, he brought it to the appraiser, who learned in a ball lost Faberge egg, which left 42 out of 50 ever produced.

For the last Forty years Dennis Smith’s work and presence has been a driving force in sculpture in the United States. His representations of Families, Mothers, and Children in sculpture are becoming a national treasure. His work is located in hundreds of public and private collection, in museums and public squares throughout the entire United States, and in many countries of the world. Dennis. Varner has established his studio in Alpine, Utah where he has lived and worked since 1998.
Scott was raised by a family involved with sculpture. His father not only owns a bronze foundry but also manages the work of his uncle’s sculpture career. Visiting the foundry often and attending many arts shows and Museums sparked Scott’s interest in the arts. At a young age Scott showed an aptitude in many artistic avenues: drawing, painting, wood working, photography and sculpture. Scott desired a career in the arts and followed his uncle’s footsteps and studied sculpture as his main artistic interest. Scott received a Bachelor of Arts from Brigham Young University in 2003 and has been part of Main Street Art since graduation. His work has developed rapidly, and he has received many commissions and awards already early in his career.
Steve Streadbeck is a talented figurative sculptor with a love for the human form. He feels that it is the epitome of God’s creations. Steve’s love of history and culture heavily influenced his work.

[Edited 17 November 2018: You can buy the book on Amazon.com, and all proceeds go to charity.]
[Edited 4 July 2021: You can read the full chapter on Medium, with permission from the publisher.]
For context, Melody and other fine women in technology put together a book last year called “Let Her Finish”, with chapters written by women about technology with a focus on the Microsoft data platform. It was a technical book, explicitly apolitical except for the fact that the authors were women.
What made her invitation to me significant is that I’m not a woman. I can talk about my lived experience as a queer person all I like (and boy do I ever), but I’ll never be a woman. That was the first thing. The second is that I don’t think I mentioned one technical thing in my chapter at all.
Even months after writing the chapter I feel like my contribution is out of place. I say that because I got political. I even asked and was granted permission to curse in print. Contextually it makes sense, but it will offend some readers.
The thing about book chapters is that sometimes they come easily, and sometimes they need to be teased out. This chapter was of the latter variety. It required finesse. Unfortunately there was a strict deadline for inclusion, so I was only able to contribute 7,500 words or so.
For comparison, a few weeks ago I banged out 7,000 words over the course of two days for two technical blog posts.
Undoubtedly the book chapter is more important than those blog posts. While my essays about relational databases will gradually become obsolete, writing about human society and the acceptance of LGBTQIA+ people is timeless. After all, despite taking place several decades ago, the civil rights movements in the USA and South Africa respectively are still relevant today.
Writing about important things like human rights is challenging. I benefited from white privilege growing up in Apartheid South Africa, while avoiding what darker-skinned people have dealt with — and continue to deal with — in most countries around the world.
While lately I’ve also taken to rejecting gender labels, I look and sound male, which means I’ve avoided a lot of what women have to deal with. That is male privilege even if I don’t identify as such.
My position in the book chapter is to show that queer rights are human rights, but hopefully in a way that is respectful of the civil rights activists of the past and present. I cited Simon Nkoli, who spoke of being free as a gay man having equal weight to being free as a black man. I wrote about trans rights too, and I recognize that I am not black, nor do I know what it’s like to transition.
Writing about these issues is challenging because I have been given an opportunity to be published, to be listened to, above others who will never have that opportunity.
When the book is launched, I’ll also be publicly outed. Although I’m out to everyone, literally wear a Pride watch band, and correct people who assume I’m married to a woman, it’s very different when (to some people anyway) this is the only way they’ll know my name.
It’s a little scary. It’s almost as scary as walking through Hillbrow holding a Pride flag and risking people throwing rocks at you. At least there you can face the fear. This is more abstract.
You’ll have to buy the book to see how I do identify, but I’d really appreciate it if you don’t refer to me as “he”. You can use “them”, “they”, and “their” as my pronouns. If you can remember the name of your favourite Starbucks drink, you can remember something as simple as a pronoun. If you’re unsure, ask! Yes, this is a strange new world we live in and I get it wrong myself, even when referring to me. I also still use ableist and sexist slurs without thinking.
It’s hard to change how you speak, but it’s for the better. To paraphrase a legendary comment I heard many years ago, I hope my being queer doesn’t get in the way of you being straight and white.
Please buy the book. Please read it with an open mind. Please stop killing us.You Know You're Romanian WhenYou Know You’re Romanian When… …you truly believe that your accent when you speak English is better than my accent when I speak Romanian. 46.777248 23.599890 Cluj-Napoca, Romania Vai, ce bine!TwitterTelegramEmailMoreWhatsAppRedditPinterestPocketLike this:Like Loading...

To keep things organized I will be breaking down my review into sections. Hopefully, this will make it easier to follow, and if you are only curious about a certain topic, it will make it easier to find the answers you are looking for.
Covers
There are eight covers for issue #1. That’s a lot. As a general rule, I don’t love excessive amounts of variant covers, I do give a pass to one-shots and first issues. That being said, my personal trouble with it is that some of the covers are produced in extremely low quantities which makes it difficult for fans to get them. This is not really a critique of M.A.S.K. or even IDW, just a minor commentary on the practices of the comic book industry. I was fortunate enough to obtain all eight of the covers, and you can view them in the Comics section of the site (as with the other IDW releases, I am only hosting the covers, if you want the story please buy the book and support the creators).
Tommy Lee Edwards – This cover was one of the early promoted images for the series and I have loved it since day one. It’s dynamic, vibrant, and brilliantly executed. Tommy is also able to provide an exceptional blend of classic M.A.S.K. and the new modern style. To me it embodies what a new M.A.S.K. series should be and is my favorite of the bunch.
Joe Suitor – Another cover that was teased around the internet prior to release. This cover has a powerful shot of Matt and Miles back to back. While the characters and their masks are rendered with great detail, the background is lacking. And, while I don’t mind the decision, some fans might be disappointed with the lack of any vehicles present on this cover.
Andrew Griffith (colors by Jordi Escuin) – This is a fun cover. It has a brighter feel, thanks to Escuin’s coloring. This version also has Thunderhawk, Shark, Firefly and Condor mixed into the image. My only critique of this cover is that the characters and the vehicles don’t seem to integrate with each other.
Sketch Cover – If you have one of these, find a talented artist to fill it for you, otherwise there is not much to say about it.
Sara Pitre-Durocher – I suspect this cover will be somewhat polarizing for readers. It is certainly the cover that pushes the farthest from the traditional M.A.S.K. look. There is an extremely strong influence of graffiti and street art in the cover. For myself, I love the cover, as a variant cover. It is not an artistic style I ever expected to see juxtaposed with M.A.S.K. However, I am glad it is not the regular cover, as I believe that it does not convey the tone and content of the book as well as some of the other covers. It would certainly make for a fantastic poster though, I hope IDW takes advantage of that.
Sonny Liew – This cover is a close second for my favorite. Sonny does some really great stuff that is sure to play with the nostalgic feelings in any M.A.S.K. fan. Most obviously, he stylizes the background to mimic the packaging from the original 80s M.A.S.K. toys, including adding text such as CHANGES TO FIGHTER JET … AND BACK! The edges of the cover also have faux distressing. Sadly, this is one of the low quantity covers I mentioned at the beginning, and as such may be difficult to find.
Paul Pope (colors by Jordie Bellaire) – Paul does something a bit different with his cover. He features just a single character, and it is neither Matt nor Miles – it is Brad Turner, speeding down the road on Condor. I am a self-confessed Brad Turner enthusiast and as such, this cover really works for me. Both Brad and Condor are drawn with precision and detail. Unfortunately, this cover suffers from the same problem I had with Joe Suitor’s cover – the background is not given the same attention as the character is.
The eighth, and final cover is a pencils version of Andrew Griffith’s cover. While the image is still nice, I believe that the colored version is more successful.
Art
I did not expect to have especially different opinions about the art when compared to the One-Shot from last month. I was wrong. I strongly believe that Tony Vargas was able to exceed himself. His layouts feel stronger, lending to a well-paced story. The art also appears more confident. Tony does not shy away from close-ups on the character, vehicles or their masks. Something I wanted more of in the One-Shot.
All in all, I think the art Tony created for this issue is perfect. He once again pays homage to the original look of M.A.S.K. while still giving a modern update to reflect the current times. If I wanted to be nit picky, I would suggest that I would like to see a little more grit, stylistically, at times. The story of M.A.S.K. has grown up, and while I’m sure that Tony Vargas is trying to walk that fine line between too retro and too modern, I – for one – am ready for more of the serious adult style.
Story
If there was a flaw with M.A.S.K. #1, I think it must be the constraints put on Brandon Easton due to the ending of Revolution. Brandon is forced to transition from the end of Revolution into the ongoing M.A.S.K. series in just a few short pages and that brevity makes for a tough job. Readers who did not follow Revolution might find themselves confused with some of the goings on referenced in the first couple pages. For those who only have the original cartoon as a source, they would not understand why M.A.S.K. would be in conflict with law enforcement.
Given how well structured the rest of the issue is, I believe that this was mostly out of Brandon Easton’s hands. The rest of the issue reads very much how I expected and hoped it would – an adult version of the M.A.S.K. cartoon. In classic fashion, it pits M.A.S.K. against V.E.N.O.M. (although what V.E.N.O.M. stands for in this incarnation has yet to be revealed).
But, unlike in the 80s cartoons, the stakes are higher, Mayhem is meaner, and the risks are much more in your face. Instead of vague plans for power or money, Miles and his team are pursuing a specific goal – acquiring control of Cybertronian technology, with the end goal of using it to increase their power over the planet. And to do this, V.E.N.O.M. has no qualms about stepping on anyone who gets in their way. In one of the final panels, we see just how ruthless and terrifying the V.E.N.O.M. organization is under the writing of Brandon Easton. Sly Rax, uses his mask to slam two projectiles into Brad Turner’s shoulders, leaving him bleeding as the rest of M.A.S.K. tries to save his life.
As I stated before, this is a level of danger and violence never found in the cartoon. While I am sure that some readers will object for the same reason I am praising it, I relish this new, mature, direction for the M.A.S.K. franchise. I expect that issue two will be even stronger, now that Brandon has been able to move past the events of Revolution and be the sole captain of the ship named M.A.S.K.
Other Stuff
Perhaps this is not the most sophisticated of headings, but it is hard to encapsulate the final pages of the issue. In an effort to motivate those reading this to go buy their own copy I will refrain from giving too many details. Suffice it to say, there are some interesting facts and images to be found in the final pages. I will reveal one small piece that is very special to me.
It certainly goes without saying that I am grateful and flattered to have been mentioned in this issue of M.A.S.K., but I would be remiss if I did not also mention all the support that Matt-Trakker.com and Agents of M.A.S.K. provide to the community. All of them are dedicated members of the M.A.S.K. fan community and if you have never visited them before, now is the perfect time to do so.
I’ll wrap things up with one more image from the back of issue #1, once again from Tommy Lee Edwards.
One thought on “M.A.S.K. #1 – IDW”
This is a great review, and I agree with a good bunch of it, for sure. The stakes are definitely higher, and Mayhem much meaner than any ’80s episode could ever have portrayed; this Mayhem, I don’t ever see fleeing the scene in Switchblade once once barely foiled his plans for world domination.
The only issues I have (and I think it’s more an issue with comics in general outside of Image and Dark Horse Comics) is the pacing. Everything seems to move way too fast for my liking. I want more depth (in comics in general, I guess); here, one second we’re in one location, the next we’re in another. I may be a bit more conscientious about this because I write my own comics, but that is my only not-so-positive critique on issue #1, which was also my one critique of the M.A.S.K. one shot that appeared a few months back. Otherwise, I’m stoked about the changes, the characters, and everything else the new M.A.S.K. is all about.Uncategorized

Those with money are often happy to spend it in retirement, whether it’s seeing the world or staying closer to home. It’s such a large market, in fact, that often holidays are aimed specifically at senior citizens.
Active Holidays
Walking is excellent exercise, and many seniors are avoid hikers. The Ramblers’ Association is an excellent resource for walking holidays, both at home and abroad. A number of their groups are aimed at seniors, whether for day walks or longer tours. However, for some of the trips, you need to work up to good condition. Several companies specialise in walking tours overseas for seniors, going as far a field as Australia.
For the more adventurous, there are safari holidays or all manner of exotic destinations, like Mongolia by camel, hike to Patagonia’s Torres Del Paine, navigate the awesome ruins of Angkor Wat or step foot on the Antarctic Peninsula. These are quite specialised, but do good business. Be warned, however, that these trips aren’t cheap.
Home Swap
One cheap way to see foreign places is through home exchange. Essentially you live in someone else’s house for a few weeks and they stay in yours. It’s an excellent way to see a new country properly, rather than in a hotel. Of course, many seniors have special needs, such as problem with stairs, but some companies specialise in property for those with needs.
Package Holidays
The package holiday is by far the most popular form of holidaymaking in Britain. Many of the larger companies offer excellent discounts to seniors. Plus many companies specialising in senior holidays are available and offer a range of special interest packages, covering everything from music to gardens, and archaeology to bridge.
Coach Holidays
For those wanting to travel, but not enamoured of going by sea or air, there are also coach holidays. They’re often cheaper than other forms of travel – the disadvantage is that it takes a lot longer to get there. Many companies specialise in coach travel to Europe, and many local companies do shorter trips within the British Isles, often including bed and breakfast. Operators often advertise in local papers.

These days, two of the most popular holiday spots for seniors are Australia and New Zealand. The pound goes a long way there, and when we have winter, it’s summer in the Southern hemisphere. For some it’s a chance to visit family and friends who’ve emigrated. For others, it’s a chance to take a package tour to places often reminiscent of Britain as it was a few decades ago and see some stunning scenery. Many companies offer packages to the region, some especially aimed at seniors.
Europe, especially the sunnier climates of Spain, Italy and Portugal, remain perennial favourites. The closeness to Britain is a factor, but also the fact that the money goes further in European economies. You’ll also find that many institutions in Europe (including the U.K.) offer senior discounts at museums and attractions. Many hotels and resorts cater to seniors, with lifts to upper floors, or arranging rooms on the ground floor.
Because of the economy, it’s become more commonplace to find seniors owning holiday homes in warmer European climates, where they can migrate for the winter – similar to the American “snowbird” idea. If you spend enough time in one, these can become an economically viable option, allowing extended holidays at a very low cost.
Essentially, these days the only restrictions to your holiday are your mobility and your health. For short breaks there are country cottages for rent that are very senior-friendly, with no stairs and support rails for bath and toilet. Much information about all these holidays can be found online, or you can talk to your travel agent.

Here is the abstract:
Current US immigration policy assigns the government the onus of choosing winners and losers among those seeking to immigrate to the US. This mechanism is inefficient, particularly because it excludes many talented foreign workers from filling jobs in the US technology sector, where there is a shortage of skilled workers. We advocate for a market-based approach to allocating visa slots to high-skilled foreign workers. In our model, aspiring workers can purchase an immigration visa for a sufficiently high price that provides a straightforward pathway to citizenship. This price can be paid off over time, similar to how homeowners pay their mortgage. Using the existing H-1B visa program as a model, we outline how implementing this policy would work.EE UPGRADES - CAN I UPGRADE MY PHONE?

People did not believe, really believe that God loved them. Now at the beginning of the next century a lot of people go to communion on any given Sunday, but I sense that people still do not believe that God really loves them--now they receive Him more out of convention than conviction.
There are some (mostly priests) who have a problem with the Pope naming today the Feast of Mercy. Our pastor, in his homily which featured Tibetian Monks as the real preachers of compassion, said that he felt the Divine Mercy novena interferred with the Easter Triduum (how that is the case I have no idea--could praying the stations of the cross, another devotion, ruin Good Friday?). I have heard others say that it brings back magical notions of easy grace.
Fr. George Kosicki, who has written widely about this devotion, told me that the associations of Mercy with the Octave of Easter can be traced back to St. Augustine, so that should satisfy the liturgical purists to some degree.
But the issue may be why has this devotion become so popular? Here is my simple answer. Even though we hear it time and time again--that God loves us, we have a very hard time believing it. We keep put conditions upon his love. God would love me if I (fill in the blank) or God will love me when I (fill in the blank), etc. Paul tells us that "while we were sinners God loved us." That pretty much goes against everything that most of us believe.
So here at the beginning of the new century we have this feast which is like a clanging cymbal. Hey guys, in case you made it through all of Lent and Holy Week and you still don't get it--I love you!
Remember the story of Hosea. Hosea is told by God to marry a prostitute, she is an apt symbol for Israel, God tells Hosea. I might add she is an apt symbol for our level of faithfulness. Hosea does as God asks and after awhile his prostitute wife goes back into business. God tells Hosea to take her back (perhaps some of us can still feel the horror of what God was asking Hosea to do). God's love is like that. There is nothing you or I will ever be able to do to earn it, anymore than a child needs to earn his parent's love--it just is.
On this Feast of Divine Mercy, open your heart to that Love that God has for you. Let it flood your being, let it change your life!
Every second of the day is an opportunity to receive God's love. Every moment is a choice. When we allow God to love us, we want to pray, we want to learn more about God, and we want others to experience the peace and joy that we feel.
Too often all of this gets muddled by pharisees who are afriad that something is not being done in the correct way, or violating some liturgical principle (it is interesting how the very same pharisees have trouble genuflecting to the Eucharistic Presence of Our Lord at the consecration--not that I'm watching {Lord fill me with your love so I won't notice!}).
Here is the Divine Mercy message in a nutshell from the Marian Helpers Site:.
That is it, ASK, BE, and TRUST.Historically more valuable than gold Frankincense and Myrrh are an ancient combination that has withstood the test of time. Frankincense and Myrrh work together to align the chakras from root to crown while creating a spiritually grounding experience. Frankincense is known to summons the Spirit and Myrrh summons the Ancestors. When burned their smoke can be used toward internal and external illnesses. This combination works to instill spiritual energy that is so powerful it raises the vibration of any space while removing lower vibrations. It clears our lower frequencies so that we always vibrate on a frequency that is our highest good. It brings forth a frequency of love, kindness and compassion that brings us closer to the Divine.

No longer are there neighborhood drug stores wheresomeone can order a milkshake, cream soda or chocolate egg cream. No longer dokids have time to sit and quaff a root beer with their friends at a small-townrestaurant. They can no longer yell "the soda man is here" and watch,overjoyed, as he administers the syrups: cherry, sassafras, vanilla and, the mostimportant, root beer. No longer do children drink old-time root beer; insteadthey consume commercialized and homogenized cans of fizz.
Don't be fooled- root beer and the "new" sodas are polar opposites on the beveragespectrum. Premium root beer has a biting flavor so outstanding and unmatched thatmost candy stores stock root-beer bubble gum, lollipops and hardcandies.
In the mid-1800's, a Philadelphia pharmacist concocted thefirst-ever mug of root beer; since then, breweries have sprung up all over thecountry. Today there are over 200 brands, each with a unique taste. Should youtire of drinking the many marvelous brews (who would, I do not know) you canmarvel at their names: Sea Dog, Old Soaker, MUG, Dad's, Blue Sky, A&W, IBC,Chug-a-lug and, my favorite, Sioux City Root Beer.
All other sodas arepackaged in tiny aluminum cans or one- or two-liter plastic bottles which, whennot closed correctly, transform the bubbly beverage into a lifeless liquid.Sprite doesn't have a distinctive flavor or lingering aftertaste. As Snoopy wouldsay, it's "blah." And try putting a scoop of ice cream in a glass ofMountain Dew. Yuck! (Just put two scoops of vanilla ice cream in a full frostymug of root beer and ascend directly to heaven.) Nearly all of these sodas havebeen around for less than 20 years; every few years we get a new brand with aname as shallow and commercial as our culture. They actually sound likemagazines: Sprite, Self, Vibe, Fresca, Sunkist. Can you tell thedifference?
Unlike other sodas, root beer has a purpose: it gives childrena chance to be adults. Remember when you were seven years old and could drinksomething with the word "beer" in it? Root beer is the drink of theimagination. Imagine yourself as a cowboy drinking at a saloon in the Old West,blowing root beer froth into a bad guy's face. Imagine yourself as a WWI fighterpilot relaxing with a root beer in a French cafe. Imagine yourself acrime-fighting detective, drinking root beer while prying inside info from thebartender. Can you do that with a Coke? I don't think so! Sprite, Fresca, Sunkistand others do not let you fantasize; they tell you what to think. It's MadisonAvenue images of beach-ball bonanza.
In a world of Sprites, Cokes andPepsis, root beer is a David among Goliaths. You never see root beer on themiddle shelf at a supermarket. It is always at either the top where you can'treach it or at the very bottom. So what happens? The supermarket shelves arepacked with prosaic pops, infinitely interchangeable. In restaurants, you ask fora Sprite, you get a 7-Up. You ask for a Pepsi, you get a Coke. Root beer, though,is root beer.
So what does soda pop say about our American culture? Itseems that a society so obsessed with doing as much as possible every day (work,sports, school, music lessons, dancing, drama rehearsals, homework) no longer hastime to sit down and enjoy a good old-fashioned root beer in a frosty mug.Instead we put in three quarters, in three seconds get a drink and in threeminutes choke down a generic can of pop. There's no time for relaxation orimagination.
The decline of traditional soda pop is just another instanceof popular culture usurping our heritage. Our culture has become commercialized,homogenized and McDonaldized. We can change our fate, though. By relishing rootbeer, we can return to our roots. Once people start enjoying root beer again, thepossibilities will be endless: our pop culture may again accept milkshakes, creamsodas and chocolate egg creams into its ranks of trendy beverages.

Life has taken over! As I discussed in the most recent post ‘I’ve been busy…’ I have started working at a health club near where I live as a Fitness Instructor (this means doing gym inductions, teaching classes and being on the gym floor interacting with the members and maintaining the gym). I’ve had the question so much over the past few months of ‘So what’s next’ as I’m sure a lot of other graduates have had and coming from 4 years of professional dance training, I understand it was expected that I’d come out of dance school and fall straight into a dance job.
Whilst this has been the case for a few dancers and graduates, I’m so content with where my life is taking me at the moment. The job I have landed couldn’t have been more perfect for me if I’d have tried, I love being at work so much that I am there on my days off and just in general love being in the club. I am also very grateful for the support network I have there, whilst I am still in training to get my PT qualification so I can take on 1-1 clients, I am studying whilst on shift, sitting downstairs in the lounge studying and getting the most valuable and helpful advice from the PT’s that work there.
With regards to my studying, I am now over half way through my course and this is where things get more exciting but also the hard work gets harder. I personally felt the first few modules of my Level 3 PT course have been more like ‘more in depth recaps’ of the work I did in my Level 2, so now the studying has gone up a level with learning all the new information.
I have also opened up a waiting list for those of you that have expressed an interest in working with me as a client, both online and face to face. Click HERE to be added to the waiting list. It makes me so excited to be able to do this and even more excited that I’ve had interest before even qualifying!
This was a very short, quick update but with good reasoning…I have some studying to get back to!
As always thank you so much for reading, especially those of you that stick by me and my blog whilst life takes off in all different directions. The grind never stops!

“I love to spend spare moments combing areas for inspiration.” – Steve Barton
Steve Barton art embodies several collections of various series depicting coastal landscapes, such as sunsets, tropical evenings, travel, still life, and vintage vehicles. In some pieces, the artist incorporates two to three of these themes. Thus, his Disney Limited Edition set finds itself in great company, with the comic characters effortlessly weaving through each trope. All these spectacular loose impressionistic oil paintings can be found in one place – the Marcus Ashley Fine Art Gallery.
Goofy’s Fishing Hole is one of Barton’s illustrations that unfolds his versatility. The sweet scene involves best friends Mickey and Goofy set to sail in a boat on a fishing adventure. Their old-fashioned red pick-up truck parked on the beige shore and the quaint cottage beside it are undeniably Barton stamps. Both guys appear comfortable and at home in the artist’s signature simple life on the beach setting. And with his trademark swaying palm trees dressed up in brightly colored flowers, Barton fans will be, too.

Today’s New Triple Play (without baseball)
Last week everything was as fancy as an iPhone 11. Being on a business conference call with the sounds of a baby happily chirping in the background was distracting. Those good old days (back in February) when anything less than elegance or perfection was disturbing.
With today’s California lock down order of all citizens, the fifth largest economy in the world has nearly ground to a halt. Things will change.
We are entering a time when businesspeople’s expectations will be lower; people will be more accepting of glitches.
Today, web meeting systems are overloaded, phone lines busy or meetings unable to connect. Anger, no. Understanding and acceptance, yes. Your colleague missed a (web) meeting. Anger, no. Just happy to know they got tied up and are still a healthy contributor, yes. Things will change.
We are also eerily lowering our thresholds for the highest levels of security in exchange for more productivity. Today, it must be “secure enough” but also easy enough to use now. Things will change. (P.S. Hackers are salivating at their newfound work-from-home targets, as inferred by this US Dept. of Homeland Security Alert)
We are entering a time when all businesses may opt for lower cost, perhaps lesser known alternatives, as the future of one’s business opportunities may drastically change. Cost savings are going to be important for the foreseeable future.
But all is better if you can find the best productivity tools that also take security seriously and are low cost. This is today’s “Triple Play”. (Not as fun as peanuts and popcorn at a baseball park on opening day in March.)

5. Core Components
If you know the core components of any machine, it gives you a clear picture of its overall functions.
Following are the core components or parts of a treadmill:
6. Treadmill with Incline Selection

Walking or running on an incline burns your calorie and shreds your fat quickly. Besides, you can get your calves, shins, and quads well worked out.
7. Belt Size
Choose a treadmill that has a belt with the optimum width and length.
In terms of width, a 20" wide belt is proper for the walkers and a 22" is considered the best for tall runners.
As for its length, a 48" belt is a standard size for both walking and running. For a tall user over 6 feet, it is wise to have a 52" and a 54" belt for walking and running respectively.
8. Control Module

Treadmill benefits are many. Keeping one at home and actually exercising on it can prove effective in improving mental and physical health. Treadmill simulates real outdoor running and walking, which lets you enjoy a healthy workout at the comfort of your home.
Among the treadmill benefits and disadvantages, benefits win over. Depending on what variations you are doing on a treadmill, different benefits can be attained. Below are some substantial gains that would help you to compare between the treadmill benefits and disadvantages.
Treadmill is one of the top choices among the exercise machines for enhancing physical agility. In fact, the only stationary workout set that allows you to simulate walking, jogging, and running.
Your whole body will benefit from an effective treadmill workout course. You will see how your cardiovascular system improves, body fats burn, and core muscles strengthen for more rigorous exercises. Moreover, a treadmill workout increases blood flow and circulates fresh oxygen within your body while reenergizing the neural connectivity significantly.
Exercising on a treadmill is to make your legs the pressure point. Your legs take all the stress while walking, jogging, or running on a treadmill.
The primary benefit your legs receive from exercising on a treadmill is losing extra fat from around the leg muscles. This in a way uplifts your legs stamina to build up from the core.
Running on a treadmill is effective in shaping your calves and ankles. Using an incline would tone your legs into a pair of athletic feet.
Being realistic, you have to admit to this that abs do not work out too intensely on a treadmill as they do by some effective abdominal exercises. However, treadmills are beneficial in a way that they at least activate the abdominal muscles of your body.
Running on a treadmill engages your abs more than walking or jogging. Adding an incline to the treadmill would engage your front as well as side oblique to activate the core.
Losing calories is the primary condition behind losing weight. Treadmill avails such exercise courses that would help you in burning calories greatly.
According to many trainers and experts, running on a treadmill for 25-30 minutes daily can burn up to 400 calories. It sounds a fantastic estimate if you happen to be a workaholic person and hardly go out. People who work in long-hour sitting position tend to grow fat sooner. For them, treadmill is a good option for losing weight at the comfort of their home.
Inclining on a treadmill concentrates on your glutes. Fitness lovers focus on inclining in order to shape their butts by intensifying the glutes.
Remember, increasing the incline rate will pressurize your glutes more. Walking on the incline without holding the side handrails is effective in engaging your glutes more. You may try Walking Lungs, which is walking on the incline by setting the speed at 1-2 mile/h. Make sure to set the incline at 10-15% and do it for 20-30 minutes for a robust glutes workout.
Treadmill proves to be effective in burning fat from your body, especially your belly. If you have a round stomach storing fat and lethargy, treadmill would be a great option to lose fat in no time.
Running on a treadmill brings great results as it keeps burning your belly fat over the course of exercises. Exercise on a treadmill burns the stored fat in the body and turn them into energy, hence, fueling the intense running on incline for rigorous workout.
Incline adds a variation to the flat surface walking or running on a treadmill. Below are some benefits achievable by inclining on a treadmill:
Benefits of running on a treadmill are as below:
Benefits of walking on a treadmill are as below:
Benefits of Rowing Machine Vs Treadmill
Knowing what muscles does the treadmill work will add more value to your exercise.
Treadmills aim at the lower part of your body i.e. calves, shins, quads, and feet.
If you are a walker, treadmills will benefit your cardiovascular and stress conditions. Being a jogger or a runner, expect impact on your calves and quads along with shin and foot conditioning.
If you add an incline to your treadmill feats, your intensity of workout will increase and muscles of your lower body will shred the extra fat to bring out the core.
How Much Electricity Does A Treadmill Use
Electricity consumption of a treadmill may come out 300 to 900 watt every month on average.
You can read the manual for checking your machine's wattage rate. If the manual is unavailable, look it up on the internet as per your treadmill model.
Electricity consumption varies depending on your usage style and hours. Exercising on a treadmill for an hour daily may turn in a bigger monthly bill. If you use it for 30 minutes or less on alternative days, your monthly wattage will be much lesser.
Even though a treadmill guarantees many benefits, it turns in many disadvantages too. Let's take a look at those disadvantages:
A $500 treadmill has several faces. If it is a second-hand of an advanced model, it's good. If it is an On Sale purchase of a costlier machine, it's alright. But a new $500 treadmill may not satisfy many of your functional requirements. On the other hand, an entry-level model could be stylish, affordable, and diversely functional too.
A $500 treadmill may not feature functions that an entry-level model can do and vice versa. For instance, a $500 treadmill comes with a bigger belt than an entry-level model whereas a costlier entry-level treadmill (up to $999.00) can give you automated incline for intense exercise. Some $500 treadmills have stronger motors than low-budget entry-level models.
You may not find a reliable warranty on a $500 treadmill, particularly on its frame and motor. Even its other components may falter before warranty period. On the other hand, an entry-level model of a fair price would come with a fair warranty for its parts, labor, and cushioning. Furthermore, it may come with a lifetime warranty for its frame and motor.
If you are lucky, a $500 treadmill may consist of a Bluetooth, safety sensor, and heart-rate monitor, which a low-budget entry-level model lacks.
Study the reviews of various models among $500 treadmills and the entry-levels before buying one. The final choice is yours.
It definitely does. An incline on a treadmill includes a resistance into the exercise, which ultimately results in even more effective muscle workouts. Imagine yourself walking or jogging on a flat surface and suddenly cramming up a hill. Guess the impact difference.
An incline adds variation to the treadmill exercise if you feel monotonous walking and running on a flat moving belt after a while. Inclining focuses on your calves, ankles, and hips as you simulate climbing. Doing this, your calves muscles stretch to a point where it builds lean muscles and strengthens your Achilles tendon.
An incline helps flow more blood and oxygen throughout the body. It conditions your heart rate and benefits your neural state. Having a manual incline can be hectic, as you need to get off the machine to set the incline. Automated incline works smoothly by pressing a button on the control panel. You may prefer to choose between them but here, the budget matters.
They are not the same. You can simply distinguish them by their prices in the first place. A commercial gym-grade treadmill cost would range to more than $10,000.
A gym-grade treadmill is manufactured for high intensity and maximum load capacity workout purposes. Oppositely, a $500 treadmill is the primary level model for home among various greater models.
A $500 model would never give you the professional feel as it lacks many intense features. A gym-grade treadmill can offer you heavy duty motor, up to 15% incline, maintenance-free belt, lengthy deck for long strides, touch screen display, bottle holder, workout fan, and more; which you wouldn't be smart to expect from a $500 treadmill.
A $500 treadmill can avail 10% incline at best and even that may not be automated in every model. It is a best fit for home to serve beginners and non-professional exercisers whereas a gym-grade model is engineered for lenient to high-intensity workouts.
Folding treadmill is a good alternative because you can flip and fold it after your workout session. Besides, you can keep it flat under your bed or couch without any hassle. Depending on your workout requirements and room space, you can choose a folding or conventional treadmill for your home.
Be sure of the following before deciding to buy a foldable treadmill:
Check if the folding task of the treadmill is an easy option. Some models come with an arduous folding process and added stress of moving it to another place.
Check if it has wheels to move around.
See if your folding treadmill is of fair weight so you do not end up with back pain or sore shoulders folding and unfolding it every time.
The budget is important. The lower the cost of the folding treadmill, the flimsier its frame and other components would come.If you are satisfied after checking all these features, it is safe and a win-win deal to buy one.

My “current” vial of insulin gets stored, wrapped in a paper towel, stuffed in a Ziploc snack-sized bag, and tucked in my emergency/all-purpose pencil-case diabetes travel bag.
That way, it’s always with me, my emergency-supply stays current and unexpired, and it doesn’t shatter if the bag gets smacked around a bit (as it’s prone to do.)
On Saturday morning, I did a combo infusion set/sensor change. With all the trash this process generated (incidentally, Enlite and Mio are the #1 and #2 offenders, respectively, when it comes to destroying the planet), I must have swept my one-quarter-full vial of Novolog in the wastebucket along with all of the other stuff..
I just realized this on Sunday night. That vial is probably sitting out in the can by the curb, nestled comfortably between some eggshells, dryer lint, and dirty diapers. And unfortunately, that’s where it will stay.
Hopefully, my insurance company will understand.

Based on the various “Bring your ‘something’ to work days” the concept is to bring your Gaelic to work – and for a whole week till November 12th.
A spokesperson at the station said: This is a serious project though and aims to make the language visible to people who do not necessarily encounter the Gaelic language and for some work places involves signage and use of phrases to promote the language.
“K107fm is conscious of the Gaelic speaking population within Fife, and has previously provided the Gaelic version of The Adventures of Captain Bobo to its Listen Again service alongside the English speaking version on-air.”
Now, the Kirkcaldy-based station is set to share a six part conversation series with masters of their instruments, which celebrates the finest traditional music Scotland has to offer.
The series is presented by Native Gaelic speaker Bekah MacLeod (Bekah NicLeòid).
In each episode Bekah chats in Gaelic to people from the world of Celtic and Gaelic music looking at their instrument of choice and the resulting relationship with the music they love to play. The programmes will be illustrated with examples of their own music and tracks featuring musicians who influenced them.
All 6 episodes are available at k107.co.uk
Each show will concentrate on that musician’s musical journey, why they chose to make it with a certain instrument and the joy it brings to them. Bekah will expand the conversation to cover their whole career.I am a very friendly boi, I get along with just about anyone and I love to make new friends!
Today, my best cat friend and I were outside. We spent the afternoon playing “cats vs dogs” which is our favorite play-fight game.
We also got a ton of snacks to munch on from the plants outside the house. They have super yummy berries on them.
Then, we saw another cat come up! I was so excited about meeting my new friend! My kitty friend told me that his name is Garfield and I wanted to see if he would like to play “cats vs dogs” with us.
Hey there big orange guy! How’s it going? Do you want to play a game with us?
The rules are really simple. I think you’ll like the game. Basically, we pretend to fight each other (but we don’t hurt each other, that’s against the rules). Things like tackling, tripping, or play biting is okay, as long as it isn’t aggressive.
The game is called “cats vs dogs” and the first person to run away loses! Are you ready to play?
Hey! What are you doing?! Help! This is a violation of Title 7, Section 9 in the “cats vs dogs” rule book! Ouch! You hurt me!
Kitty friend, please help! I am going to do me a run away now! Disappearing boi has been activated!
Someone call my mom! Call the cops! Call someone! I have been assaulted by this big orange meany!
I don’t think I’ll ever be able to trust a random cat ever again. I don’t think she was playing! She was just being mean.
My best kitty friend has come to the rescue! Ya! Get her! Am still doin’ me a hide. I am too scared to go out and see this mean old cat.
Be careful! She has very sharp claws! And she bites super hard. I think I’m bleeding.
Oh my goodness, what if mom makes me go to the vet to get shots? What if I bleed to death? This is against the rules. There is not supposed to be any physical injury in this game. I don’t understand why she did that! What did I ever do to her? I am a good boi, I love kitties. And she attacked me!
I think we are going to have to disqualify this kitty. She is just too aggressive to play games with us. What a jerk!About our data
The data on Discover Uni are official statistics created for this purpose. This page explains where that data comes from and the approach we take to publishing it.
The National Student Survey
The National Student Survey (NSS) is an annual survey which allows final year students to provide feedback about their experience at university or college. The results are used by universities and colleges to improve the student experience and can also help applicants to decide between courses.
The survey is run by Ipsos MORI on behalf of the UK higher education funding and regulatory bodies.
Students respond to statements using a five-point scale from 'definitely disagree' to 'definitely agree'. The numbers you see on Discover Uni are the percentage of students who either responded 'definitely agree' or 'agree' to each statement.
Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic?
Some data is from students surveyed during the Covid-19 pandemic, which may have had an effect on their responses. Most institutions, courses and students have needed to change their approach in some way – for example by delivering lectures online instead of in-person. Some courses and institutions have been affected more than others, for example practical or lab-based courses. The NSS survey invites students to reflect on their student experience as a whole – and it may be assumed that many responded on that basis. However, the pandemic was clearly on some students’ minds.
Analysis shows us that there were some variations across the data compared to previous years. The NSS data on Discover Uni is therefore from the 2021 survey only.
Previously, we have shown data taken from the most recent year or combined together over two years when there are not enough students in one year of data for us to publish it. Because of the potential impact of the pandemic on survey responses, this year we are only showing data for the latest survey. You will therefore not see any survey data for two years (it will be one year for a course or one year for a subject).
Before we publish any figures based on the NSS we first ensure that there are at least 10 people who responded for the course or subject being reported and that they make up at least half (50%) of the people who could have responded.
Results from the 2021 NSS show:
- Despite the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, response rates for the core survey questions remained high at 69.3 per cent. We received 332,500 responses.
- The majority of students rated their overall experience of their courses positively. Overall, 75 per cent agreed that they were satisfied with the quality of their course, down from 83 per cent last year.
- That more university and college students had concerns about their educational experience this year compared to last year, the survey highlighting particular issues around the availability of learning resources for students.
Graduate Outcomes survey
The Graduate Outcomes (GO) survey collects information from students 15 months after they finish their course. It asks them what they are currently doing, how much they are earning, and their perceptions of work following their graduation from their course. Our ‘earnings and employment’ page provides more information on how to use the data provided on Discover Uni.
The data we show on Discover Uni is from the most recent Graduate Outcomes survey which covers graduates who finished their higher education courses between August 2018 and July 2019.
We use Graduate Outcomes data to compile the statistics in several sections on our course pages. Before we publish any figures based on the Graduate Outcomes survey, we first ensure that there are at least 10 people who responded for the course or subject being reported and that they make up at least half (50%) of the people who could have responded.
Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic?
While the graduates surveyed were not the students who graduated into the pandemic, the Covid-19 pandemic will, for many graduates, have set the scene for an important early stage of their careers.
The 2018/19 survey was undertaken over four different stages: some were surveyed before the pandemic had been declared, and others when different levels of restrictions were in place. However, it is unclear as to whether the changes to results compared with the 2017/18 survey results are directly attributable to the pandemic.
In the ‘Earnings after the course’ section
In this section, Graduate Outcomes data is used to present the average earnings of graduates 15 months after they finish their course.
You can also use the drop-down menu to view Graduate Outcomes earnings data at UK level or national level (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales). This data has been published to provide context. This means that you can see the average earnings for graduates from all courses in the subject that live or work in the selected location. Because earnings are higher or lower than average in some regions, we also include the percentage of graduates from the institution that are based in the chosen region. This gives an indication of whether the regional figure you have chosen is a good benchmark for the institution.
Please note that we do not include earnings data for those that are self-employed.
You will also find earnings data in this section from the Longitudinal Educational Outcomes (LEO) dataset. We have used LEO data to present the earnings for the same group of students three and five years after their graduation. Please see the LEO section below for more details. All of the earnings information in this section has been treated and summarised in similar ways to make comparisons as meaningful as possible.
In the ‘Employment 15 months after the course’ section
Graduate Outcomes data is used to show the percentages of graduates who are working, studying, working and studying, and unemployed, 15 months after completing their course.
You will also see the type of occupations that these graduates are working in, 15 months after graduating from the course and whether these are considered high-skilled (meaning they are considered to be professional or managerial occupations by the Office for National Statistics). Occupations have been classified using the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) 2020 system.
In the ‘Graduate Perceptions’ section
Here you will find the percentages of graduates who, at 15 months after graduation, agreed that what they learned on their course was useful for what they were currently doing, that they found their work meaningful, and that their work fits with their future plans.
Experimental statistics
The Graduate Outcomes data published on Discover Uni is experimental statistics. This is because the survey and statistics it provides are new. It does not mean that the data is of low quality.
You can find out more about the Graduate Outcomes survey, and how it is used, on the Graduate Outcomes website.
We welcome feedback on how useful the statistics are and what can be done to improve them. You can find out more about how the statistics are produced and provide feedback on the Office for Students website.
Longitudinal Education Outcomes dataset
The Longitudinal Education Outcomes (LEO) dataset uses government tax records to find earnings data for graduates. It does not rely on graduates responding to a survey. Because it is based on PAYE tax records it is more complete than self-reported survey data. We do not publish LEO data for individual courses, this earnings data is always grouped into subject areas for two years’ worth of graduates.
In the ‘Earnings after the course’ section
We use LEO data in this section on the course pages on Discover Uni to show earnings data for the same group of students three and five years after their graduation. The data published is for the subject areas the course covers for all graduates at the institution offering the course, not the specific course itself.
You will also be able to use the drop-down menu to see LEO earnings data at UK level (excluding graduates from Northern Irish institutions); national level (England, Scotland or Wales); regions within England and core cities in Wales and Scotland. Data for Northern Ireland is not included because data from Northern Irish graduates is not included in the LEO dataset.
You can see the average earnings and typical range for graduates from all courses in the subject that live or work in the selected location. This data has been published to let you view how the subject earnings for the institution compare to the earnings of all graduates in that subject for the chosen region. Because earnings can be higher or lower than average in some regions, we also include the percentage of graduates from the chosen institution and subject that are based in the region. This gives an indication of whether the regional figure you have chosen to view is a good benchmark for the institution.
You will also find salary data in this section from the Graduate Outcomes (GO) dataset. Please see the Graduate Outcomes section above for more details. All of the earnings information in this section has been treated and summarised in a similar way to make comparisons as meaningful as possible.
About the LEO data displayed on Discover Uni
There are some things you should be aware of when using the LEO data on Discover Uni:
- We only publish LEO data for courses taught at English, Scottish and Welsh universities and colleges. LEO data is not available for courses in Northern Ireland.
- The LEO data shows how much graduates working in the UK were earning three years and five years after graduating. The data shows these statistics for the same cohort of students.
- The data includes taxable income for those who had tax deducted at source by their employer. It does not include earnings for those who were self-employed.
- The data published is for the subject area of the course over two tax years.
- The data contains earnings for both full time and part time workers, meaning figures may appear lower where more graduates are choosing to work part time.
- As the most recent earnings data we have is from 2017-18 and 2018-19 tax records, the data displayed is for earnings of students who graduated during the 2011-12 and 2012-2013 academic years.
Our ‘employment and earnings’ page provides more information on how to use the earnings data provided on Discover Uni.
Experimental statistics
The LEO figures published on Discover Uni are labelled as experimental statistics. This tells our users that the statistics are new. It does not mean that they are of low quality.
You can find out more about how the statistics are produced and provide feedback on the Office for Students website.
The LEO data used on Discover Uni is owned by the Department for Education (DfE). The DfE do not accept responsibility for any inferences or conclusions derived from the LEO data by third parties.
Data collected from universities and colleges on individual students
The UK higher education funding and regulatory bodies collect data from universities and colleges about all their individual students. We use this data to create some of the statistics we use.
The datasets we use are the:
Individualised Learner Record collected by Education and Skills Funding Agency
and the data we use is for the academic years 2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20 unless otherwise specified.
Continuation
We use this data to tell you what students are doing one year after starting the course. The number of students still studying is called the ‘continuation rate’. These figures are based on the percentage of students starting in 2017-18 and continuing into 2018-19 and from 2018-19 continuing into 2019-20.
It’s not unusual for some students to leave during their first year. While it is good to see higher numbers of students continuing on a course after one year, there can be many reasons for students deciding to take a break or leave the course. It is important to remember this is a snapshot in time – not a trend for a course. If the continuation rate is much lower than other courses this could be a sign that the course is not meeting students’ expectations.
Entry information
This shows the qualifications and tariff point values previous entrants had (it is not the entry requirements for a course). It gives a picture of the range of qualifications held and the ‘grades’ achieved by those starting the course. Remember, decisions by institutions to offer places to applicants are made based on a range of criteria – not just the qualifications or grades achieved.
The data on UCAS Tariff points is the average for qualifications based on entrants in the 2019-20 academic year, and sometimes 2018-19 and 2019-20 entrants combined when the course or subject sizes are too small to publish for a single year.
It is important to know that some universities and colleges accept a wider range of qualifications for entry to their courses, some of which are not accounted for in the UCAS Tariff points. This means that the tariff points data we show for some courses may not reflect the value and grades achieved by some students accepted onto the course. This may affect the majority of courses at some institutions with higher proportions of international or non-UK intake.
For more information about UCAS Tariff and entry requirements, see our Entry requirements page.
Understanding the data
Using data in your decision making
The data that we publish on Discover Uni is from reliable sources and can help you make an informed decision.
It’s important that you don’t make decisions based on small differences between courses. Instead look for large differences, and particularly where figures are much lower than for other courses you are considering. Find out more about comparing courses.
Sample sizes and response rates
On Discover Uni we tell you how many students the data we publish is from and, if it was from a survey, the response rate.
These numbers might be smaller than you expect, as we try to publish data for the course and not all courses have large numbers of students on them.
A high response rate from a large number of students means you can be more confident in the data. With smaller numbers, it is especially important that you don’t make decisions based on small differences.
We only publish data if we have it for more than a certain number of students. This is partly to protect their identity and partly to ensure the reliability of what we publish. For surveys, we also don’t publish data if response rates are low.
For most of the data, we need data from at least 10 students to publish it. For LEO, we need at least 15 students.
Small courses
For many smaller courses, we may not have data from enough students to be able to publish it. So that we can show some data, we group data for courses in the same subject area at that university or college.
We say where we have done this on the course page and course comparison tool.
Joint honours and courses with data for multiple subjects
Some courses cover more than one subject area, sometimes leading to an award known as joint honours (such as “BSc Mathematics and Computer Science”). Where a course has more than one subject, we try to present data items based only on the people studying that course.
Sometimes if there are not enough people studying the course, or not enough of them reply to a survey, we include data for everyone at the institution studying courses that include those subjects. For instance, this means in our example above we would present figures separately for Mathematics and for Computer Science. These are presented as tabs on the course pages. Some very broad courses with open choices between lots of modules can have as many as five subject areas, or even more.
When thinking about a course where multiple subject level figures are presented, it is important to look at all the subjects. You should also think about how these subject figures may reflect the course you are looking at, which perhaps only represent a small number of students within those subject areas.
New courses
Where courses are new or don’t have any students who have finished them yet, we publish data for other courses in that subject area. This is to give you some idea of the student experience and outcomes at that university and college.
Again, we say where we have done this on the course page.
Rounding
We publish National Student Survey data to the nearest percentage point. For other data, if we have data for fewer than 52.5 people, we round the data to the nearest five percentage points. The numbers of people are also always rounded to the nearest five.
This can mean that the figures shown do not always add to 100 percent. The total may instead be 95 percent or 105 percent when you add them together.
Feedback
We would welcome feedback on how useful the statistics are and what can be done to improve them. You can contact us using our contact details on the 'about Discover Uni' page.

Digital Advertising, also known as Internet Advertising, is when businesses deliver promotional messages to consumers on the Internet through the web or email.
This includes video advertisements, banners, and commercials delivered through email, social media networks, messaging platforms, and online advertising on search engines, mobile apps, and websites.
Online advertising efforts are generally used with traditional advertising techniques like radio, television, newspapers, and magazines.
To help advertisers, there are several Internet-based advertising tools to research, create, manage, track, analyze, and improve digital advertising campaigns.
What can I achieve from Digital Advertising?
- Generate leads
- Increase Brand Awareness
- Get more traffic to your website
- Make more sales
- Get customers to spend more
What does digital media offer that TV advertising does not?
Digital Advertising is affordable, specific, and you get to see the results immediately. Due to this, digital advertising is being adopted by more and more SMBs (small-medium businesses).
1. Television ads are intrusive
The main disadvantage of TV advertisements is that they are intrusive. Google conducted a report with Ipsos that concluded that audiences that find active ways to avoid the commercials shown on TV because of their intrusive nature. In fact, only 45% of ads are watched completely on television.
2. Digital ads expand to the whole internet
The main advantage of online advertising is that it has a very wide net. When compared to any other form of advertising, online advertising is known to cover the largest group of audience. In fact, it has the potential to cover the entire world.
3. Television ads are expensive
Another advantage of digital advertising is that it is cost-effective. Online advertising doesn’t require such a heavy expenditure like TV advertising – or any other form of advertising in that case.
You can start Facebook Advertising for as less as $5 per day. Analyze, test, and streamline to maximize your ad ROI. As you grow, increase your bids and budget.
Based on your conversion rates and the bandwidth you have for the number of customers you can handle at any given time, you can scale your advertising efforts.
4. It is easier to measure the performance of Digital Ads
While TV advertising has some reporting and analytics capabilities, online ads can have almost every action tracked and analyzed. Digital advertising allows marketers to get as much information as they want about the ad – the number of times the ad was shown, the number of clicks the ad got, the audience it was shown to, how many took an action after coming to your website, etc.
You can use these analytics to find out how your target market reacts to different approaches, and optimize your digital ad campaigns much more efficiently than TV ad campaigns.
5. Digital ads are heavily targeted
By collecting and analyzing user data, you can reach exactly who you want to reach. You can run 7 different ads targeting 7 different types of customers, and each audience sees the ad are the most relevant to them.
Remember, higher relevance = more clicks = increased revenue.
6. You see immediate results of your Digital Ad campaigns
Unlike long-term strategies of branding, SEO, and content marketing that help you get your acquisition costs down while boosting revenues, digital advertising gives you instant ROI.
7. Digital Ads are flexible
In a matter of minutes, you can make changes to a specific ad campaign’s target audience, ad content and creative, or even adjust the entire marketing campaign.
How does Digital Advertising work?
In order to track and identify individuals, online advertisers use cookies, which are unique signatures of specific computers, to decide which ads to serve. Thanks to this, advertisers can pick the right audience, and consumers see relevant advertisements – it is a win-win for both!
Cookies can also track whether a user left a page without buying anything. This helps advertisers like you retarget the user later on different ad networks.
What is Behavioral Targeting?
As you use cookies to keep collecting data from multiple websites about a user’s online activity, you can combine this information to create a persona of the user and list their interests to deliver even more targeted messages. This is called behavioral targeting.
After you’ve picked a target audience, you need to pick the right ad network, format, and placement.
What is Programmatic Advertising?
The human mind is most efficient when it is not involved in doing mundane, repetitive tasks.
As an advertiser, you need to spend more of your time in planning more sophisticated, customized campaigns, and coming up with personalized retargeting strategies.
Programmatic advertising is the automated buying and selling of online advertising.Acuity Ads
You can streamline your process and bring together all digital advertising efforts in one platform.
This involves:
- Making ad buying, ad placement, and ad optimization processes more efficient,
- Eliminating mundane activities, and
- Helping you go to market faster
There are machine-learning algorithms that analyze campaign inputs and user behavior, so real-time campaign optimizations can be made. This way only those audiences that are most likely to convert are identified and targeted.
Different data types and information is analyzed to increase the probability of a campaign’s success. Few of these data points include:
- Demographics,
- Geography and time,
- Interests,
- Behavior, and
- Type of device
After you’ve identified your target audience, and have found a network where said users often visit, it is time to make ad creatives for each platform.
What is Display Advertising?
Display Advertising is a form of online advertising in which brands use visuals like text, logos, animations, videos, photographs, or other graphics to show customized messages to a specific audience.
How can I make display ads?
Rocketium Campaign enables you to create both image and video ads in multiple formats for different ad networks.
What are the types of Digital Advertising?
1. Search Advertising
Over 50% of all website visits start in a search engine like Google, Yahoo, or Bing. A large percentage of these user searches are highly intentional, meaning that a lot of these searchers are ready to make a purchase.
They’re looking for a specific type of product or service as a solution to their problems – they’re researching options.
The pricing model for search advertisements is generally the CPC (cost per click) bidding system. This means you pay search engines for every click on your ad.
2. Social Media Advertising
Social media is big. Did you know that 31% of social media users say they use social media to discover new brands and shop?
- Facebook influences about 52% of all purchases including both online and brick-and-mortar.
- About 96% of people regularly discuss brands online as part of their social media experience.
- Since 2016, the number of SMBs that advertise on YouTube has increased by 200%
- LinkedIn’s visitor-to-lead ratio is 2.74%. This number is much higher than Facebook and Twitter.
Social media advertising includes boosting posts and showing display ads on different social media networks across different devices. Most social media advertising is based on extensive demographic, interests and behavioral data collected by search engines.
Check out this amazing resource put up by our friends over at Referral Rock on lead generation using social media.
3. Remarketing Advertising
The Internet can be distracting. Let’s say someone is on your website, ready to make a purchase. Then they get a text from their boss, they remember something they needed to do, or maybe their cat demands the food bowl be filled immediately – and they leave.
Unless they’re a loyal customer, they likely are not coming back. Remarketing is an effective way to bring these users back to your website by reminding them of your brand, products, and solutions.
Remarketing ads are known to increase click-through rates by 400%. It makes sense because you are gently reminding users what they wanted to do in the first place.
Display ads are perfect for retargeting. Videos, images, infographics, banners, GIFs – all of these visuals convey more information to viewers than text.
What metrics should I track for my Digital Ad campaigns?
1. Cost per lead
This metric is used to measure if your ad campaigns are cost-efficient. To calculate the cost per lead, you need to know the pricing model of different ad networks:
- CPM (cost-per-thousand impressions): This is is the bid you pay per 1,000 views (impressions) your ad gets.
- CPC (cost-per-click): This is the amount you pay every time a user clicks on your ad.
- Cost-per-view (CPV): This is used to measure how much you spend each time a user engages with your ad on YouTube or views it for at least 30 seconds.
2. Traffic-lead ratio
This is used to measure how many of your website visitors from ads convert to leads. Jot down what defines a lead, and track how many leads you’re getting from your visits.
3. Lead conversion rate
This metric tells you the number of leads that are converted into sales from your ad campaign. It is important because this metric ultimately tells you if your ad campaigns are effective.
4. Bounce rate
This is a measure of the number of visitors that arrive at your site from an ad and leave without navigating to any other page.
5. Average time spent on a page
This metric is used to measure the duration of time a visitor from an ad campaign spends on a page on your website.
6. Click-through rate (CTR)
This metric tells you how many users clicked on your website vs to how many users this ad was shown.
7. Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
This is the total amount of capital it cost you to gain a new customer from an ad. It includes your ad spends, salaries of the personnel involved, and if you’re paying an agency to help you out, then the amount mentioned in their contract.
8. Lifetime value (LTV)
This is the amount of gross profit that is generated from a customer acquired from your ad campaign over the entire time they do business with your company.
Conclusion
When compared to television advertising, digital ads get better results, they’re easier to experiment with, and more importantly, they are considerably less expensive.
Due to this, several SMBs (small-medium businesses) have started experimenting with display advertising. Online ads also enable businesses to reacquire existing users and customers through remarketing campaigns.

Jo Ann Oravec (ed.)
IGI Global (2018)
Abstract
Societal pressures on high tech organizations to define and disseminate their ethical stances are increasing as the influences of the technologies involved expand. Many Internet-based businesses have emerged in the past decades; growing numbers of them have developed some kind of moral declaration in the form of mottos or ethical statements. For example, the corporate motto “don’t be evil” (often linked with Google/Alphabet) has generated considerable controversy about social and cultural impacts of search engines. After addressing the origins of these mottos and statements, this chapter projects the future of such ethical manifestations in the context of critically-important privacy, security, and economic concerns. The chapter analyzes potential influences of the ethical expressions on corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. The chapter analyzes issues of whether “large-grained” corporate mottos can indeed serve to supply social and ethical guidance for organizations as opposed to more complex, detailed codes of ethics or comparable attempts at moral clarification.

Therefore, the first thing you should do is talk to your doctor to know the cause of the swelling and what types of treatments could be best for you. You can use several homemade remedies that don’t have any side-effects, along with your prescribed treatment before the swelling gets out of hand.
This article provides information on the main causes of swollen feet and some remedies that will help you naturally manage the swelling. Continue reading and see for yourself! how the sharp increase in violence in El Salvador is changing the daily lives of residents of the capital.
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — Hundreds of police officers, some wearing masks to protect their identities, sat in the large white church in Zacatecoluca, a short drive from the capital. They were joined by the country’s police chief, government ministers and the U.S. ambassador for what has become a familiar occasion: the funeral of a police officer murdered by gangs.
In 2015 more than 20 police have been killed by the country’s powerful Mara Salvatrucha and 18th Street gangs. At least six soldiers have also been killed this year. Violence is approaching the high levels seen before the criminal groups agreed to a truce three years ago.
During a single weekend in April, at least 34 people were murdered, 22 of them in a single day, April 19, the most violent 24 hours this year, according to official sources. With the truce over, some gang members have been returned to maximum-security prisons, where it’s believed they instructed smaller neighborhood units to kill two police officers apiece. The information regarding the gangs’ strategy was reportedly provided to police intelligence sources by informants.
The people in the Zacatecoluca church were there to mourn the death of Wendy Yamileth Alfaro Mena, 27, the first policewoman to be murdered. She was gunned down on the afternoon of April 20 as she left her home in Zacatecoluca to buy tortillas. Gang members had been watching her, according to police. It’s unclear if they were from the Mara Salvatrucha or the 18th Street gang, which has split into the rival Revolutionarios and Sureños, or Southerners.
At her funeral and again at a private ceremony afterward at which police presented Alfaro’s family with the flag that draped her coffin, her murder was described as a blow against all Salvadoran women and one that must drive the police and all Salvadoran society to continue la lucha, or fight, against the gangs.
“The gangs know that these actions demonstrate their willingness to attack the state, to attack the country and to show how strong they are,” said El Salvador’s Deputy Police Chief Howard Cotto. He said that violence and crime in El Salvador are getting worse and that “force must be met with force.”
As for the truce between the gangs that went into effect March 2012 and led to a marked reduction in murder rates, Cotto said, “We have been very clear that we do not agree with that.”
The truce, apparently brokered by intermediaries in the Catholic Church, had been seen as an example to follow for other countries with similar severe gang problems, like Honduras. Similar efforts championed by the bishop of San Pedro Sula in Honduras failed. The extent of the government’s role in agreeing to the truce remains unclear.
El Salvador’s then-President Mauricio Funes was adamant in March 2012 that “the government did not sit down to negotiate with gangs,” although he admitted it played a part “facilitating” the accord. There was an immediate dramatic drop in the murder rate after the truce. By the end of 2012, the national police had registered a 41 percent reduction in killings from the previous year — 2,576 compared with 4,371.
But it didn’t last.
According to Steven Dudley from Insight Crime, a U.S.-based foundation that tracks organized crime in the Americas, the agreement was “more of a violence interruption project than a truce.”
“It required the participation of police and trusted interlocutors with the gangs,” he said. “It fell apart when the government pulled its support from the project in June 2013 and named a new security minister. It slowly unraveled thereafter.”
Howard Cotto
El Salvador’s deputy police chief
In 2014 murders went up by nearly 60 percent from the year before, to 3,912, according to police figures, and that increase has continued. In March 2015 alone, police registered 481 murders — the most in a single month for 10 years. They say many of the targets were gang members.
El Salvador’s President Salvador Sánchez Cerén, who was vice president when the 2012 truce was brokered, has made clear he believes the truce was a mistake that gave the gangs an opportunity to increase in size. “We will not negotiate with any gang,” he restated in February.
At the police’s emergency call center, a limited staff fields 20,000 calls a day — up in the last few months from 17,000 a day — from all over the country and dispatches officers. Police estimate 1,000 to 1,500 each day are for serious incidents.
“People are feeling insecure and want patrols nearby,” Inspector Juan Bautista Rodriguez explained. “It’s when someone feels something has changed, because of gangs or less safety.”
Upstairs in the police building a special unit monitors 400 surveillance cameras throughout the capital. He said they hope to have 5,000 cameras in five years, along with many more panic buttons for drivers of buses and taxis — regular targets for gangs. In a country where witnesses are often afraid they will be targeted or killed if they come forward, he said, a camera is an increasingly useful tool.
“We catch murders on film,” said Rodolfo Ernesto Campos, another senior officer.
In one recent video shown to Al Jazeera, an 18-year-old is selling strawberries and talking with a young woman on a streetcorner late on a Friday afternoon. Police said it’s likely he was also keeping watch for a gang. Moments after the woman walks away, three young men cross the road toward him, pulling out weapons. They shoot him point blank until he lies dead on the ground. Those nearest to the shooting run when they hear the shots. The three murderers flee. A crowd forms around the dead teenager. Soon the street begins to return to normal.
None of the unit officers there knew if the murderers have been caught. Crime often goes unpunished in El Salvador, a country with an impunity rate of over 94 percent.
Cotto said that more must be done for the country’s most marginalized and that the national police — along with community police, private business and local government — must investigate the underlying causes of violence and crime. Last week a senior official proposed a law for the reintegration of gang members into mainstream society. In exchange for agreeing to abandon criminal activity, they would be offered economic support. However, police officers have been given a clear message: shoot criminals without fear of consequences.
“This institution and the government will protect you,” said Police Chief Mauricio Ramírez Landaverde in January after the killing of seven officers in just over two weeks at the beginning of the year.
In terms of its strategy, the government is creating three new quick-response battalions, made up of 1,200 police officers and 600 soldiers, to counter the rising violence. The battalions are due to take to the streets shortly. As for the country’s 70,000 or more gang members, of whom an estimated 10,000 are in prison, their leaders are reported to have offered a moment of calm in May as a gift to the country during the beatification of Archbishop Oscar Romero, a hero to the country’s poor.
The possibility of extending that respite seems remote.
“Neither the gangs nor the police seem to have complete control of the rank and file where most of the violence is occurring,” said Dudley. “What may be possible is another attempt to implement a violence interrupter program of sorts, i.e., have trusted interlocutors help to stem the violence in some ways. But the acceleration of violence between gangs, amongst the gangs and between the gangs and the security forces is a disturbing trend that is building its own evil momentum.”
While senior police say they must look beyond fighting force with force, they point out that after the failed truce, it must be made clear to the gangs that crime will not be tolerated.
“The state can never renounce its constitutional responsibility to combat crime. That cannot be. This is our job,” said Cotto. “It would be idealistic to think the problem of crime will go away simply if the police stops what it’s doing.”

“ It was a great pleasure working with Reality San Miguel and Charles Thomas to sell my house in San Miguel. I have a vivid imagination but I cannot imagine a better reality experience. From deciding on the price, through the beautiful photos on the website, to the sheer professional expertise that let me know the state of play as my property was shown and the swift and smooth final closing meeting, everything was handled with care, attention to detail and competence. Charles went out of his way to make sure I understood the process every step of the way and responded rapidly to all my questions, including my after hours emails. Perhaps best of all from a seller's point of view, the house sold quickly and to lovely people. ”
- MaryOn her YouTube channel “Serriday”, Dal Shabet‘s Serri spilled disturbing details on how “sponsorships” – or the exchange of financial and materialistic support with sexual favors – work in the world of K-Pop and her personal experience with such “offers”.
After pointing out that everything is based on what she knows and experienced as an idol, Serri dished that there are entertainment agencies who actively connect their managing artists to such “sponsors”.
To be honest, it is a matter of which agency you’re signed to. There are agencies which accept these sponsorship offers and the CEO passes on the suggestion to the agency artists. There are also sponsorship offers that reach the stars individually.
— Serri
Serri clarified that while she was actively promoting as a part of Dal Shabet, she and her group-mates never had to attend any occasions that made them uncomfortable, thanks to their agency’s CEO being against sponsorships.
Personally, my CEO never took the group out to bars or anything like that.
— Serri
Unfortunately, Serri did have experience with receiving sponsorship offers via Instagram. As more K-Pop idols start up their own social media accounts to communicate better with their fans, such platforms have become a way for sponsorship offers to reach them as well.
I’ve gotten a DM before. Everyone gets such DMs. It is up to the person who received the DM to either ignore it or get offended by it and do something about it.
— Serri
The DM that Serri received detailed out the offer by listing the “assets” that the sponsor had and the “benefits” that Serri would reap from the relationship had she agreed to it.
I check all my DMs. So I ended up checking this one too. It listed the person’s name, age, occupation, and other personal information. It also listed how much I’d be paid if I agreed to do this and what kind of advantages I could get out of it.
— Serri
Serri also revealed that facing revengeful disadvantages in the industry for turning down sponsorship offers is an actual possibility. She dished at such “sponsors” for abusing the trainees and artists by threatening to meddle with their careers.
There could be revenge for turning down a sponsorship offer… like getting fired from a role or being excluded from debuts. So it’s a nasty thing for them to do. Not that these artists and trainees wouldn’t be able to survive without the sponsorship money – but for their dreams and goals to be messed with and threatened like such, I think that’s horrible.
— Serri
These unethical “sponsorships” have been a long running problem in the entertainment business. With the rise of platforms like YouTube and Instagram, more celebrities and content creators are being affected by the discreet “sex for money” offers.
This Popular Korean YouTuber Openly Criticized An Instagram DM Offering Him “Sponsorship”
Serri assured the viewers, however, that not everyone in the industry are bad. Like her own CEO, who did not fall to the sponsorship offers, Serri clarified that there are also trustworthy people who will try their best to guide the trainees and artists in the right direction.

Clarion India
THERE have been 77 incidents of hate crimes against religious minorities in India since the beginning of the Covid-19 lockdown on March 24, 2020. This includes 22 incidents of physical assault of a person because of his religious identity, according to DOTO Database, an online platform that maps hate crimes against religious minorities in India.
Other incidents related to hate speech, vandalism of property, attacks on religious infrastructure and social boycott of people belonging to a religious minority. Of these 77 cases 71 were against Muslims.
The above information is based on incidents that took place between March 24 and June 28. All the incidents documented by DOTO Database have been sourced from reports published in media.
This comes in the backdrop of the large-scale Muslim-baiting and religious profiling that attempted to keep attention away from the government’s mismanagement of Covid-19 pandemic by attributing the outbreak to Muslims, according to a report published last month. The report (Hit Job, Using Covid-19 to Deepen Anti-Muslim Bias and Weaken Muslim Voices, May 2020) was published by Citizens Against Hate, a civil society platform that call itself ‘an open collective of individuals and groups committed to a secular, democratic and caring India’.
The report points out that immediately after 29th March, when the government claimed to trace a spike in Covid-19 cases to the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in Delhi, a concerted campaign began to demonise all Indian Muslims, blaming them for the virus. This included sensational prime time TV coverage as well as targeted online misinformation, spread by social media handles using hashtags like #CoronaJihad and #BioJihad, among others.
At the same time important facts – such as India’s overall testing being among the lowest in the world, or reports of Covid-19 outbreak in other places, including religious gatherings – were being ignored. The report concludes that this suggests ‘inherent bias’ at best and a ‘hidden agenda… towards shifting the public gaze to Muslims’ at worst.
It also details how this media and online campaign soon spilled over into the real world, with social boycott, denial of public services and even incidents of direct violence against Muslims. In many places, Muslim vendors and shopkeepers were forced to shut their businesses and Muslim tenants harassed.
The report does not defend the Tablighi Jamaat, but terms the intense scrutiny faced by it ‘biased’. When overall testing and screening was still very low (India continues to have the lowest testing rate in among the top-ten countries with most Covid-19 cases) and under-reporting common across the board, the selective scrutiny of Tablighi Jamaat cases only served to paint them as villains.
On 30th March, BJP MP Gautam Gambhir and BJP national general secretary B.L. Santosh both blamed Jamaat in their tweets about the Makraz gathering in Nizamuddin, calling it “illegal.” It is no surprise that both, in their tweets, failed to mention that the congregation took place on 13-15 March, ending one week before the first lockdown began. Similar tweets and statements were by other BJP leaders like Sambit Patra and Kapil Mishra.
The statements of these BJP leaders were buttressed by a misinformation campaign across media, online portals and social media platforms. Apart from this, the report also mentions how Tablighi Jamaat members were officially criminalised under provisions of the Disaster Management Act and the Indian Penal Code. Invoking of Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) implies that the government will argue in court that Tablighi Jamaat members carried out a deliberate conspiracy to spread Covid-19.
The report also points to targeted witch-hunt of anti-CAA activists during the lockdown. According to the report, Muslims youth leaders of the anti-CAA/NRC protests have been arrested and charged in fabricated cases, including terror-related offences. Besides being in contradiction of Supreme Court guidelines on decongesting prisons during the lockdown, restrictions on movement have meant that lawyers and courts are not readily available to the accused, making them vulnerable to arbitrary actions of the police.
The report concludes that government has sought to deflect attention from their policy and management failures during the pandemic by religious profiling of Covid-19 cases. This has in turn unleashed an Islamophobic hate campaign online and in media with terrifying real world implications.
The cover of Covid-19 has also been used to silence and criminalise the anti-CAA/NRC protests which had been going on since December 2019. The report ends with s series of recommendations to stop religious profiling of Covid-19, control the proliferation of Islamophobic hate messages and misinformation, and ensure equal access to Covid-related relief and services to all.Jonathan Austin Juggling & Magic (Abram Frink Jr. Community Center)

An ambitious restoration project has started this week at Llantysilio Mountain, a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Special Area of Conservation, in order to restore the area following a devastating wildfire in 2018.
The Welsh Government funded project is being led by Natural Resources Wales (NRW), in partnership with Clwydian Range and Dee Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and Denbighshire County Council. The ambition will be to re-invigorate the natural habitat and restore the mountain to its former glory.
The site, which provides grazing areas for local farmers and is popular with walkers, burned for four weeks at the height of a heatwave in 2018. During that time NRW worked with North Wales Fire and Rescue Service (NWFRS) and Denbighshire Countryside Services to cut back vegetation and create fire breaks to try and stop the fire spreading.
The wildfire destroyed up to 250 hectares of land – the equivalent of approximately 247 rugby pitches.
Nick Thomas, Principal Strategic Advisor Natural Resources Wales, said:
“Mynydd Llantysilio is really important to both people and wildlife. Following the wildfire, we have worked closely with Denbighshire Countryside Service, the landowners and graziers to restore the vegetation at the site for wildlife and grazing.
“Since 2018 we have seen most of the site recover naturally, with some heathland plants growing back from roots and seeds. However, there has been a clear need for us to intervene in order to stabilise the soil and create better conditions for moorland plants like heather and bilberry to thrive. “
The project will include harvesting locally sourced heather which will be cut and bagged as part of annual moorland management, then airlifted by helicopter to the fire damaged slopes and spread out over approximately 1 hectare of the most fire damaged parts of the mountain. A further 68 hectares of the mountain will be sown with an upland grass seed to create a nursery crop for moorland plants to recolonise.
Cllr Tony Thomas, Denbighshire County Council’s Lead Member for Housing and Communities, said:
“This is an important restoration project which is being carried out in partnership with Natural Resources Wales and Welsh Government, following recommendations made by independent consultants and specialists at NRW.
“The wildfire in 2018 caused significant damage and this year’s work will cover half of the most damaged part of the mountain with further works planned for the future.”Set of Nine Framed Branch Artwork

Intro
We are presented a machine that seems to run RDP. The description of the challenge stated that there was an admin user with ‘administrator’ as its username.
The description also said ‘you’ had seen the admin entering his password with his left hand only, and so it was known that the password consisted of 4 characters, the first being the lowercase letter ‘p’. It was also given that the administrator would ‘likely not’ use any numbers, special characters or even capitals in his password.
This leaves us with only three letters left to guess, consisting of any of the following set:
Easy, as there are only 153 = 3375 possible combinations. Let’s use crunch create a list with all possible passwords (length 4, starting with lowercase p and consisting of the letters above):
Now that we have a wordlist, let’s use hydra to launch the dictionary attack:
Let’s see!
That worked, we’re in!

Touching Planet Earth : Our Oceanic Heritage
Cynthia Moku: Guest Keynote Speaker
Addressing current issues on the climate changing, with knowledge being offered to the world from both ancestral traditions of Polynesian ocean culture and current science & innovation technologies. How these topics interface with and can inform us through art & meditation practices.
Since late 2019, Cynthia Moku has been fully engaged in creating a 15’ length triptych, which will be installed in Hawaii at the Grace Learning Center for regenerative agriculture and inspired Polynesian culture & sacred arts. The Gestures of Engagement (GET) artwork is based on her past two years of studio creative work including, an artist-residency in Hawaii with research in humanistic & social-scientific disciplines of the Pacific Oceanic Nation, and meditation retreat.
In opening our zoom meet, Cynthia will take us through a visual journey with the GET paintings and the land & ocean environs of Hawaii. Followed by a group conversation during which we can go further into topics presented in the keynote talk, such as; stewardship rather than ownership of land, celestial navigation & voyaging principles, benevolent & sustainable farming practices, plant intelligence & regenerative agricultural techniques, art & ritual that acknowledge magic & mystery, and ardent transformative cultural activism.
At the core of each of these disciplines is an affirmation, encouraging a stable development towards the cultivation of individual awareness coupled equally with purposeful intent for mutual awakening.
Cynthia Moku has a distinguished career painting in contemporary and traditional formats. She has completed large-scale art projects associated with the Himalayan Buddhist tradition for more than forty-five years, including interior mural paintings for the three major public stupas in the United States and in Bodh Gaya, India, the Kalachakra Stupa. In 1973 she met the renowned meditation master, Kyabje Kalu Rinpoche. Under his prompting, Cynthia began a life-long study, meditation training, and practice in the art of the emblematic illustrated dharma, with works including the seminal painting of the Protector Chagdrukpa Mahakala & Entourage, acquired by the Denver Art Museum and consecrated by HH the XIV Dalai Lama. Currently, Cynthia brings her contemporary work into the forefront through the group performance brushwork of “Indelible Presence Brush” and painting sequences such as Turning the Wheel a Travel Game, Pilgrimage Journey: A Dakini Map, Weapons of Massive Compassion, and the Gestures of Engagement Triptych.Raspberry pi dymo print server

Circle of Learning is devised to provide a continuity of learning within and between communities by supporting the transfer of knowledge and learning between established leaders and groups that are less experienced in community development practices.
The programme has been running since 2013 and in what is a slight change to the delivery model, the 2019/20 programme selected three hubs across the region that are tasked with supporting the work of four organisations in their area that require capacity development. The three hubs were:
1. Ards/North Down: Ards Communtiy Network
2. Mid-Ulster: Sperrin Cultural Awareness Association
3. Antrim and Newtownabbey: Impact NI
The 12 groups that benefitted from a local organisation to support their efforts to develop smaller organisations and to provide mentoring support, which facilitated them feeding into the region wide network. The networking programme included regular meetings, residentials, study visits and provided a small budget for social action projects.
Throughout the year, the 12 groups, which included.
Pictures of residentials November 2019 with groups and facilitators
We enjoyed our two residentials (November 2019 & February 2020) and unfortunately due to COVID-19 restrictions two networking events to Àras uí Chonghaile ‘James Connolly House’ and Museum of Orange Heritage ‘Schomberg House’ were cancelled.
COVID-19 adaptions
Due the COVID-19 restrictions the programme adapted by responding to local needs in local areas. The three hubs supported the smaller groups to remain connected and ensured that the most isolated and marginalised had a support network. Thankfully due to the networking and relationship building that occurred between summer 2019 and mid-March 2020 small groups were able to share ideas and access information about support during COVID-19. While physical gatherings were not possible, the groups made use of technology to support those in need particularly those in rural locations.
Evaluations of the 2019/2020 programme showed that small groups and individual participants have gained greater confidence to deliver good relations programmes and increased confidence in visiting new areas. Most importantly, the programme has created a new network of contacts and relationships across three geographical areas.Acute Health Issues

I found that if I my remote command set LANG explicitly, I can build jikesrvm over ssh without the JVMXM008 error.

When I launched the company I was 14, and I was getting on calls with business owners, and as long as I displayed the confidence of knowing my craft, which was Instagram marketing, then they were confident to trust me with their marketing spend. After you have complete confidence in how it works, you can go ahead & hire a digital marketing agency when operations become larger.

For the drying process (moisture extraction), drying units of various designs are used. The most popular ones are fluidized bed drying, rotary plate drying, drum dryer.

It is used in allowance for all animals (pigs, large cattle), chickens and fish, has a lot of micro adding and does not include harm solutions, admixtures.
The content of protein, amino acids, macro- and microelements, that plays a great role in animals metabolism and growth, is much bigger in DDGS than in majority of other feeding products. The product makes possible to cheapen the prime cost of the fodders and reach the economy while fattening up.
DDGS consist around 6-9% of dry solids, depending on quality of the raw, inflowing on the technology. Crude protein, nitrogen-free extracts, suet, cellulose, alkali, vitamins and microelements, consisting in grain raw inflows to DDGS.
To use the DDGS in liquid state is not always rational because of the problems with holding - proteins, consisted of DDGS, become dissolve soon and it’s transportation on the long distances is not economically profitable.
With a purpose of full using of DDGS, as the highly-nutritious fodder, it is proposed the multi-leveled refinery with receiving the line of market products, that are used as the feedstuff for farm animals, and adding it to concentrated feedstuff.

DDGS inflows on the decanter (horizontal centrifuge), where is divided on solids – cake (more than 40 % absolutely dry solutions, nextly – absolutely dry solids) and liquid – centrate (5,1% of absolutely dry solids).
Cake can be turned out as the market product, but its shelf-life is limited by 12 hours. That is why the drying with a purpose of receiving DDGS is more effective. The centrate, for the following utilization and increasing of its quality as the market product, is condensed on the ultra filtration unit for receiving another market product – concentrate (20…30% of absolutely dry solids ). It is possible to outtake the concentrate, as the self-consistent market product, on fodder for animal stock. But with a purpose of improvement of nutritious qualities of protein-vitamin concentrate, it is mixed with cake and then dehydrated.

Going forward, a new episode will come out every weekday morning, starting a week after this intro episode.
Before I get into the show itself, let me address the change in the podcast feed. You may notice that there are older episodes out there of a podcast called Stories of Starters. If you’re new to it, that was my first podcast, where I interviewed people who had taken a vision or passion and turned it into something bigger.
In order to preserve those interviews, which I still think offer a lot of value, I decided to start here where they left off instead of with a totally new feed. But feel free to dig through some of those older episodes and enjoy.
As for the Engineering Your Business podcast, it will be a totally different format and focus. Where Stories of Starters was a semi-weekly show that featured interviews which could be anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour, Engineering Your Business will be a short daily show (I’m thinking five minutes or less) that will focus on helping you optimize the People and Processes that you deal with every day as a business leader. My goal is to provide you with bite sized episodes that you can easily grab and go daily… or even batch on the weekends.
Personally, I have a mix in my own podcast playlist. Some are longer, interview or monologue shows while others are short daily shows like this one. I’ve really taken a liking to the shorter ones as they pack a punch, have a lot of variety and yet are easy to get through even if I’m short on time.
So, back to this podcast, you might ask “why the name Engineering Your Business”? Well, it has sort of a dual meaning. On one hand, I’ve been an engineer working in manufacturing for over 25 years and I’m bringing some of the lessons I’ve picked up over that time to your and your business field. As well, the episodes will help give you tools, encouragement and practical ideas that you can use to engineer your business and get it running at peak efficiency.
Now, about the specific focus, People and Processes? That comes from my wiring and makeup. I’m part engineer (it’s my job and I’m also generally curious about how things work), I’m part human resources (in that I’m relationally wired), I’m part creative (I love to write, create and see things differently) and honestly I’m part comedian (sarcasm is one of favorite languages). Granted, I’m not sure that those four types would often hang out together outside of my head, but somehow they get along in there.
And that all brings us to you, the listener. You are a business leader with a lot on your mind daily and a weight of responsibility for your business or department. You have demands. You have stresses. You have goals. And a lot of the time you might feel stuck. I want to be able to help give you a jolt, a boost, some new insight or even just some encouragement along the way.
Personally, I’ve often found that I can pound my head against a wall over and over trying to solve a problem or how to make something more efficient and then someone will come by, offer a few words and totally change my thinking or perspective. And that’s my goal with this podcast.
That said, I also believe in being yourself and offering the world your own special flavor, so you’ll find plenty of humor and creativity mixed in among the often-stuffy business talk.
I appreciate you taking the time to listen to this intro episode. Your time is valuable and I don’t take that for granted. I mean, you could have been catching up on the latest social media buzz or watching ESPN highlights or organizing your sock drawer, but you chose to spend these few precious minutes with me… while probably also doing those other things… which is why I love podcasts so much.
If you haven’t already, hit subscribe so that the next episode drops right there into your favorite podcast player. And I’d love it if you told a friend or coworker about the podcast as well.
Thanks for listening to today’s episode.

I am 53-years-old and I wouldn't trade what I now know for being young again. There are many areas in which I have gained expertise through life experience, but the one thing I wish I could have been in my younger days was more assertive. I wish I would have opened my mouth more to say what I was really feeling. The reason I didn't was because I didn't want to seem like a whiner or a complainer. A simple example of this: driving in someone's car with the air conditioning blowing arctic air at me. I'd be shivering, but when asked if I was comfortable - I would reply with a smile and a head nod. Or when offered something to eat or drink, I could have been dying of starvation or thirst, but I would have said, "No, thank you." Those are silly examples, but truthfully, there have been so many times, I have always regretted not being able to tell the truth.
I finally realized I have not been true to myself. That I have suffered unnecessarily for the sake of being "polite." I guess this dawned on me when I had children and I coached them to advocate for themselves - of course, in a diplomatic, respectful way. I have learned from my own teachings and now have no problem speaking to people honestly. Whether it's a coworker who is pushy and bossy, or a rude person in line at a store, I have learned the lesson that being honest and forthright is good for communication and leaves speculation out of the human equation. I have heard you say so many times over the years that we need to have conversations with people. We are not mind readers.
Thank you for all of your sage advice. You have been my guiding light.
Sincerely,
Danielle (a listener for over 20 years)Doctor Nzimande, I Presumeby Paul Hjul / Illustration by Alastair Laird / Images by Greg Nicolson / Daily Maverick / 17.01.2012
On Tuesday 10 January 2012, an unplanned sequel to Black Tuesday* rocked our country: a mother died and at least twenty other people were injured in a stampede at the University of Johannesburg. The event, and the response by the Minister charged with responsibility for higher education, has all of the hallmarks of a fire in the Reichstag. It is for this reason that South Africans must fully unpack and consider the various underlying issues in this tragedy. Unfortunately, this is not what Minister Nzimande intends to do.
How, beyond the coincidence of the weekday are the events a sequel to Black Tuesday, you may ask? The opposition to the protection of corruption bill, approved by the National Assembly, is on a fundamental level driven by ordinary South Africans who are recognizing in that legislation the prospects of serious and irreversible erosions of the very core of our progressive constitutional democracy. The terrible state of how South Africa, as a society, and the government in particular, treats matriculants (and moreover the ideals of learning and critical thinking, in general) represents the other side of the coin of the ruling elite’s attempt to maintain absolute control over our society through the assault on the consciousness of the individual human being. After all, thinking is seditious to an authoritarian government, and people participating in such a vice are dangerous to the security and morals of the perfect dystopia envisaged by the visionaries in power. In case you missed the tone, I’m being sarcastic here.
As a people, South Africans are a diverse assortment of humanity thrown together by a history which is as rich as it has been tragic. Out of the travesty of apartheid, we as a people elected to form a constitutional state and our principal instrument of law is an internationally respected constitution. To suggest that the Constitution is perfect is to betray the very essence of the compact which forms the essence of a constitutional society and it is a good thing that South Africans of different walks of life and different political ideologies hold different views about the shortcomings of the Constitution. It is my deep and personal belief that the single greatest shortcoming of our constitution is the fact that the university system is not included in the provisions of Chapter 9 (where the Public Protector, Auditor General and Human Rights Commission are provided for). This chapter is headed “State Institutions Supporting Constitutional Democracy”, and there is no institution which has contributed more to the attainment of constitutional democracies around the world than higher education and well resourced libraries (of course I would advocate the substitution of the term “State” with “Public” as well). The corollary to this belief is the view that our constitutional democracy will not be secure until we have a culture of critical thinking, which is the mark of free societies.
Despite having held power for seventeen years, the ANC has failed to deliver a culture which embraces the ideal, formulated in the Freedom Charter, that the doors to learning shall be open (notwithstanding the caricature that is the cover of the Green Paper released after the tragedy). Instead, it has reinforced barriers and seconded the function of keeping the doors closed to institutional managers who have the difficult task of keeping a dysfunctional system functioning. The multitude of shortcomings in the education system has been the subject of tomes of passionate and dispassionate literature and experimentation. Several attempts at curing ailments in the education system have proved worse than the disease. Additionally it is fundamentally in the interests of the ruling elite to replicate inequalities in our society as an electoral trump card. When the government delivers on any of its promises, it does so under its terms and conditions and in a way that serves the ANC. This has been evidenced in many fields, particularly since 2000. If the ruling cabal is unable to achieve its vision for an institution (the courts, media, legal fraternity, mining sector and the universities) it harries together an attack, frequently by proxy, on the institution with empty rhetoric carrying the favourite term “transformation”. The government has been so busy playing these transformation games that it has dropped every pilot and moral compass in our society, leaving us with an increasingly unequal and less free society.
By 2012 we have a society where tens of thousands of pupils are deprived a good education for the duration of secondary schooling. The end of this schooling process is marked by an examination which most of our society uses as an indicator of the worth of many of these individual human beings. On the basis of their performance in the examination we allocate them to either a bachelor, diploma or certificate stream. Comprehensive institutions (such as the University of Johannesburg) offer programmes in at least two of the streams making the pool of people who find themselves eligible for admission exceptionally high. Further, the matric results are being released later, leaving less time to apply for tertiary education. Added to the pressure cooker is the fact that institutions must also deal with returning students, not to mention that taking up a place requires a big financial commitment.
In essence, Ms Sekwena died because of a system that does not work. If her death is allowed to be used as a pretext to render the system even more dysfunctional we are guilty of two great crimes: dishonouring her death and betraying the conscience of our nation.
In 2009, the Zumastration took the step of splitting the education sector, appointing an ardent Zuma-ite to control higher education. Dr Nzimande’s Mengel-ian register of “medicines” to treat the sector includes the particularly potent drug of government control over the admissions process. That the government should establish a national student admissions support agency which assists (potential) students and educational institutions in better co-ordinating and managing admissions is a separate issue to the (barely masked) centralism which underlies what the good doctor is aiming for. It is further absolutely clear that the current FET College system needs to be revamped, upgraded and used as the primary driver of ‘post-school’ education. However, a brief reading of the Green Paper ,and various literature on the Department of Higher Education and Training’s webportal, reveals a simple reality; it is not the intention of the government to allow these institutions any room to develop outside of its control. That Nzimande’s ministrations are contraindicated by the need for institutional autonomy (as a fundamental component of academic freedom) appears to be ignored in the hope that the public is so petrified in our current situation that we don’t consider the harm of the purported cure.
While the ANC must, as the ruling party (and on the face of its own promises and manifesto), take primary responsibility for the perilous state of education in South Africa, other political organizations (parties, lobby groups etc.) in South Africa must take their fair share of the blame. Not a single Member of Parliament has publically and consistently taken up the cause of the thousands of matriculants in whom so few people show any faith, and it is all too easy to score points on the basis of ANC fault.
The South African use of the term matric has proved to be particularly resilient and it seems that the idea of “matric” has become so powerful that it will not be withdrawn from our national vocabulary. Strictly speaking, in an education context to matriculate has historically referred to the process of entering a university (having your name enrolled on registration). However in several commonwealth countries (such as South Africa) the connection to the final year of school was readily made. Of course, this connection (and with it the idea of bridging secondary and tertiary education) is valuable. Built into the bridging idea is the expectation of guidance as a part of the non-academic activities of our schools – guidance which includes inculcating a capacity for critical thought and a belief in the individual as an autonomous, valued human being.
But unfortunately, this is the fundamental inequality in our education system: certain learners (and most white learners) are exposed to the opportunities and encouraged to choose and match their aptitude and wishes; whilst other learners are simply part of the “masses” maligned by society as a whole – viewed as voting cattle by political parties. A learner attending a functional school will have at least one member of the teaching faculty take an interest in their future. The learner will be provided with the opportunity and guidance to continue their studies. For other learners attending schools failed by the government, this is simply not the case.
Consequently, as a society we only have faith in learners from certain schools. As a society we do not believe in the value of everybody. That is the travesty of post-apartheid South Africa; a place where the “matric” has effectively become a substitute for the pass book system for many black youths. It gives access to the potential for some of the civic privileges assumed to be innately held by white children – regardless of their schooling. The devastating effect of this dangerous tendency is an absolute travesty for the affected individuals. Moreover, it undermines our nation’s soul and detracts from the culture of learning that is so desperately needed. In essence, the queues represent young people striving to matriculate – to enter into higher education – and the lack of order is merely a replication of the fact that post-apartheid South Africa has failed to conceptualise a society free of the servitude notions of Bantu Education.
What South Africa needs, and what we must demand, is a culture of the responsible minister serving the higher education sector, as opposed to the higher education sector serving the interests of the ruling elite. Until this culture is firmly entrenched, people will die in avoidable tragedies and thousands of valuable, meaningful human beings will be deprived of their dignity by a society that purports to hold dignity at its core. As South Africans, we must, in our own minds, unpack the tragedies and contradictions which so pollute our society. We must expose the hypocrisy of those in power. We must act in defiance of the tendencies that seek to undermine our consciousness.

- Vocabulary plays an important role in framing a good grade essay. so to get high grade in essay writing (i.e. task 2) , it is quite essential to focus on vocab as it contributes 25% of your total IELTS essay writing score.
- However, mostly IELTS students have downloaded long lists of words without having seen them used in context and even they do not know how to use in a correct way.
- Vocabulary plays an essential role not only in writing but also in reading; Academic reading has three long passages and in totals 40 questions. Ample words are used in English language and it is important task for everyone to have knowledge about each word.
- Moreover, to get good bands, it is advised to learn proper vocabulary. Basically , it is suggested that besides focusing on grabbing strange and difficult words,IELTS learner must focus on examining the word in context, together with learning word forms ( verbs,Noun,countable,uncountable,…) collections related to these words followed by which adjectives ,verbs or Nouns…).
- During writing, a variety of essays are asked and some questions require you to write a descriptive essay where as others ask to give your opinion.
- Varies types of essay topics are covered from a wide range of subjects like technology,finance,government,tourism and so on. That why your vocabulary ought to be specific and relevant to the provided topic.
Some important points for improving vocabulary in the effective way;
- Practice and practice:
- Important words should be noted during writing, reading, speaking and on daily basis check your vocab and make sure your words stick in your long-term memory. During watching movies or videos, it is important to make concentration on conversations or dialogues and use such vocab on your day to day life.
- When someone get a new word, mention it on his or her notebook with traits or characteristics of that word and even use such vocab in your sentence. Also, find the synonyms and antonyms of that word and make different sentences on it.
- It is often seen that in reading passages synonyms are used that always confuse the IELTS learner to get the correct answers. So if vacab practice is done by students, they can get good score in IELTS easily.
- Maintain notebook:
Using notebook may be a great idea to improve the vocab.It provides systematic approach not only to reviewing but also to recording specific as well as significant words. IELTS learner should be encouraged to keep a vocabulary notebook. If students maintain notebook properly, they might improve their ILETS result easily.
(3)Reading:
- Firstly, students should analyze about their interesting reading material. It could be newspaper, story, novels or other worth stuff. It is often seen that vocab and grammar can be improved if English written text is observed by the students. Think for a while and find the book that you have interest and while reading such book keep eye on important vocab and use such words in your day to day life.
- Moreover, the sentence structure should be observed properly as it improves not only vocab but also grammar part. Mostly student get less score in essay writing due to lack of If such students had focused on vocab,their writing score would have been increased.
- During reading, pay close attention to vocab that you are not familiar and try to find different meaning .Best idea to learn word from context so try to find the interesting reading material and find the vocab .
(4)Be an active listener:
- Similar to reading, listening plays vital role to improve vocab.It is often observed that if important words are pointed out during listening time by students, their vocab may be improved easily.
- So during listening, pay close attention to words and try to find meaning of it. Mostly students improve their vocab if they pay attention on words during listening.
(5)Memory tricks:
- The more a memory is used, the more it will endure. So it is vital to engage in active repetition and usage. This is where you get to play with your new words.
- Cramming a vocab will not help you if you promptly forget it. In recent survey it has found that a word can be part of your vocabulary only if it takes 15-20 times repetitions.
- Based on the spaced repetition, if students want to make good hold on vocab, they can use word on daily basis for couple of weeks.
(6)Beside one word – think collocations and phrases
During IELTS exam, it has seen that those students, who have great hold on group of words and phrases, do not face problem and they easily do the exam with good score, while such students who follow one vocabulary learning tip always face difficulty as lot of synonyms are used in exam. Make sure, student must use groups of words.Description

To support my creativity visitValentino Rossi bids farewell to MotoGP – grazie Vale! – paultan.org
An end of an era in MotoGP as Valentino Rossi, arguably the single person most responsible for making MotoGP and motorcycle racing in general a mainstream sport, made a final appearance in front of Italian race fans. Perhaps this is not quite accurate, as Rossi will still be involved in racing motorcycles through his VR46 academy and his race teams in Moto3, Moto2 and MotoGP.
In way of homage an gratitude, Sky VR46 Avintia and Sky Racing Team VR46 showed a farewell livery on its race bikes draped in the Doctor’s trademark fluorescent yellow. In the MotoGP race, Rossi crossed the finish line in tenth place with two races left in the 2021 MotoGP season – Portugal and Valencia.
In a MotoGP career spanning 21 years from 2000 to 2021, Rossi started racing in the big leagues with his first appearance in the 125 cc Motorcycle Grand Prix class, riding an Aprilia RS125 for Scuderia AGV Aprilia and finishing ninth in the season. The following year, Rossi won the 125 cc championship with Nastro Azzuro Aprilia before moving up to the 250 cc class the following year.
Now riding an Aprilia RS250, Rossi finished second in his debut 250 cc year, before winning the championship next year, in 1999. Moving up to the premier class, at the time still on 500 cc two-stroke race machines, Rossi rode a Honda NSR500 for Nastro Azzuro Honda, winning the last ever 500 cc Grand Prix championship in 2001.
The following year, with the move to four-strokes, Rossi moved to Repsol Honda Team, a move that caused controversy amongst Italian race fans who were not particularly pleased to see their favourite riding for a Spanish team. Handing two world championships to Honda, back-to back, Rossi then began his riding partnership with Yamaha, winning the next two championships and extending his unbroken winning streak to five.
A two-year lull followed, before Rossi returned with back-to-back championship wins, again, in 2008 and 2009 with Fiat Yamaha Team. A decline in Rossi’s racing fortunes followed, before he showed again strongly with three second place championship finishes in a row from 2014 to 2016 and a third place in 2018.
While Rossi has remained fairly tight lipped about his plans after the 2021 MotoGP season, it is reasonably expected that he will be involved with top flight motorcycle racing in one form or another, as hinted at during his retirement announcement in July of this year. In the meantime, motorcycle race fans are wishing Rossi a big “thank you” for his two decades and a bit in MotoGP.

For the complete documentation on the latest stable version of ImageKit, see ImageKit on RTD.
Installation¶
- Install PIL or Pillow. (If you’re using an
ImageFieldin Django, you should have already done this.)
pip install django-imagekit
- Add
'imagekit'to your
INSTALLED_APPSlist¶
Specs¶¶
The easiest way to use define an image spec is by using an ImageSpecField on your model class::
from django.db import models from imagekit.models import ProcessedImageField¶:
source_file = open('/path/to/myimage.jpg'):
dest = open('/path/to/dest.jpg', 'w') dest.write(result.read()) dest.close()
Using Specs In Templates¶
If you have a model with an ImageSpecField or ProcessedImageField, you can easily use those processed image just as you would a normal image field:
¶:
{% load imagekit %} {% generateimage 'myapp:thumbnail' source=source_file %}
This will output the following:
{%¶
Because it’s such a common use case, ImageKit also provides a “thumbnail” template tag:
{% load imagekit %} {% thumbnail '100x50' source_file %}
Like the generateimage tag, the thumbnail tag outputs an <img> tag:
:
{% load imagekit %} {% thumbnail '100x50' source_file -- alt="A picture of Me" id="mypicture" %} {% thumbnail '100x50' source_file as th %}
Using Specs in Forms¶
In addition to the model field above, there’s also a form field version of the
ProcessedImageField class. The functionality is basically the same (it
processes an image once and saves the result), but it’s used in a form class:¶:
class Watermark(object): def process(self, image): # Code for adding the watermark goes here. return image
That’s all there is to it! To use your fancy new custom processor, just include
it in your spec’s
processors list:.
Admin¶)
AdminThumbnail can even use a custom template. For more information, see
imagekit.admin.AdminThumbnail.
Community¶
Please use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs with django-imagekit. A mailing list also exists to discuss the project and ask questions, as well as the official #imagekit channel on Freenode.

Make A Monetary Plan To Settle Your Financial Obligation Quickly
The payment strategy should help you to pay off the concern loans quickly. Once the list has actually been produced you require to list the minimum payments for each debt.
So you have actually reached the point where you understand you need assist with your credit card financial obligations, and you’ve decided it’s time to pay them off with a house equity loan. Wait! There are other alternatives. You do not need to risk the home you’ve worked so hard for, in order to get rid of those charge card balances.
With unSecured Secured Debt, on the other hand, the debts are simply built up and paid according to just how much cash the insolvent person has. Normally very, very little bit. And just at the end of the bankruptcy procedure.
I understand you may be believing, “What does he indicate by ‘advantage’, my debt is eliminating me”. Well the word good is most likely not the very best word but let me describe. , if all your financial obligation were protected (by security) your lenders might easily recover the quantities owed by declaring these items of security..
Oh, oh, that is just what I stated it is coming out of the pockets of the citizen. Who would have thought that the public would be settling the financial obligation of people that they do not even understand? Ouch, that hurt. Do not misery now, everything is going to be all right. Those in charge understand simply what they are doing and they plan to keep right on doing it. They are distributing totally free money to those that they believe deserve it. Complimentary government grants for financial obligation relief are meant to make life much easier for a selected few by providing them a simple way of becoming Debt Free.
So if you desire a high credit report you have to be great at managing financial obligation, and not just one kind of financial obligation (like credit cards/Revolving Debt ) but a variety. To give you a high FICO score the credit system desires to see you dealing with a range of financial obligations responsibly; both Revolving Debt (like charge card, or shop cards) and installment financial obligations (like a cars and truck payment, furniture payment or a mortgage on a home or land). Not only that however you should likewise be responsible with other debts you incur that do not usually appear on your credit report. Things like: mobile phone expenses, medical bills, house phone/internet costs and cable television TV or satellite service costs. If they are overdue for a period of time and will lower your credit rating, these will end up on your credit report.
Analyze the reasons that you utilize your charge card. If you find that you use it only for regular grocery and domestic purchases, embrace a card that uses rewards on these transactions.
The first loan kind is called a safe and secure debt loan. What is secured debt? Secured financial obligation is “that category of debt in which a financial institution is granted a portion with the pack of rights to defined residential or commercial property” (Safe debt, n.d.). So if you got in into a safe and secure financial obligation loan and likewise you defaulted within the home mortgage, the bank would repossess the automobiles. This is recognized as deficiency judgment. Naturally, you likewise had the alternative of an using a surety, co-signer, who will take over the payments for anyone who is unable to. Purchases that will need a safe financial obligation loan may include a boat, vehicle, home, 2nd on a house, land, etc.
For the one regular monthly payment, there is more readily available than just debt consolidation. It would take you 32 YEARS (389 months) to settle the balance. Some individuals however, believe the other method round.

But perhaps the nicest moment in the film comes early on.
A mother with a teenager alongside her speaks of bringing her son to the store when he was little, en route to her monthly visit to the British Library, then situated just above Koshy’s. As they entered Premier the boy asked the mother whether this was the library. When she answered in the negative, he said, but it contains all the books in the world.
Warm and generous
I first visited Premier in 1979, when I was in my twenties. For the next three decades the store and its owner were an indispensable part of my life. My younger friends in Bangalore came to Premier as little children. The activist Achal Prabala’s first memories of Premier are of himself, aged six or seven, being left there by his parents while they had work in the area, and spending time leafing through kids’s books. He first knew it therefore as a de facto reading library, before growing up and having his literary and political education transformed by the books he bought from the store.
Some years after Shanbhag retired, Achal took me to meet him in his home in Basaveshwaranagar, in west Bangalore. It was a wonderful and happy occasion, and we wished to repeat it often. In the event, we did so only once, when Shanbhag came to an event in our part of town, and we spent some time with him. On Tuesday morning, when I heard of Shanbhag’s passing, I called Achal to tell him. He wept, and I began weeping with him too. I gently put down the phone, leaving each of us alone with our memories of the man.
Twenty-four hours later, as I write this piece, in a calmer frame of mind, I think more constructively of Shanbhag and what he gave our city. If, as the novelist Anthony Powell said, books do furnish a room, then perhaps booksellers – the best of them at any rate – do nourish a community. For a full four decades, TS Shanbhag and his Premier Bookshop sustained the interests and obsessions of those who lived in Bangalore and bought and read books in English. But it was not merely the astonishing range of books that he stocked that made him so beloved of his customers. It was also the warmth and generosity of the man.
A bookshop for writers
I have written extensively of my own relationship with Premier and its owner elsewhere, so here let me gather together the memories of others. The Kannada novelist Vivek Shanbhag recalls going there first as a shy 18-year-old, fresh from the Konkan coast. Seeing him lovingly flip through a book, and then set it aside with a sigh, the older Shanbhag (who was unrelated to the younger) would say, sympathetically, take the book with you and bring it back tomorrow.
Later, when Vivek could afford to buy all the books he wanted, he particularly came to value Premier’s Shanbhag for his ability to source books unavailable anywhere else in India. Vivek had developed a fascination for the novels and stories of Isaac Bashevis Singer; of the 30 books by Singer that he now proudly possesses, the bulk were obtained for him by TS Shanbhag, one by one. In those pre-Amazon, pre Abe Books, pre credit card days, this showed an extraordinary concern for the needs of a single customer.
But then Shanbhag was like that with everyone who walked into his store more than just once or twice. As he came to recognise one’s tastes and interests, he developed an uncanny knack for anticipating what one might like to pick from the vast holdings he possessed. Mailing me on hearing of the death of Premier’s owner, the economics writer Rahul Jacob remarked: “Long before the algorithms had decided (wrongly) that I might care to read Bhagwati on globalisation, he seemed to know that I would be interested in the Didion or Ondaatje that was hidden in one corner of the bookshop.”
The biologist Vidyanand Nanjundaiah wrote to me: “The range of his stock was amazing, as was the ever-increasing difficulty of negotiating one’s way through the shop. I bought The Art of India by Sivaramamurti, EO Wilson’s Sociobiology and Smullyan’s Logic Puzzles all from him. He had a shy, diffident smile, and quickly sized up my interests. Whenever I dropped in, he used to pull a book from somewhere inside a huge, almost tottering pile and say, ‘I think you may like this.’ It was almost always true. Others told me their experience was the same.”
When I tweeted about Shanbhag’s passing, others chipped in to share their memories. One person remarked: “This is so tragic, was a regular at his shop till it closed. You could tell him, ‘Uncle, I am broke, will pick the book later’ and he would give a hefty discount and say – take the book, pay when you get your salary. Incredible man.”
A second wrote: “Still remember, he called us telling us that Sunil Gavaskar was coming to autograph his book Sunny Days. I still have the book with the little master’s autograph, thank you Mr Shanbhag.” A third observed: “Fond memories indeed . As a young management student, grew up reading books that Mr Shanbhag recommended. Gentle, friendly and charming, he inspired the habit of reading to all Bangaloreans.”
And a fourth recalled: “Spent many a happy hour browsing through the collections aimlessly, only to buy one impulsively, and head for home. My Dad and I shared the reading habit and when he could no longer travel, I would make the trip on my own, with reduced hours for browsing.”
Literature, science, travel, management, sport, and more – Premier had arguably a wider range of themes and subjects than any other bookstore in India, alongside an owner capable of effortlessly matching individual readers to individual titles. No wonder he inspired such love and regard. As one person remarked on Twitter: “Do you remember when nearly all of Bangalore came together to donate money when Mr Shanbhag announced he was closing Premier as his landlord had increased the rent? He managed to keep it going for a couple of years more, from perhaps being moved by this.”
Among the reasons Shanbhag was so greatly loved was that he was a person of kindliness and compassion. The lawyer Aarti Mundkur grew up with the store, asking her mother to buy books for her before saving up her pocket money to buy some for herself. Aarti went to university in Mumbai; returning some years later, she walked into Premier to be greeted affectionately in Konkani before being told, in English: “The first book you bought from your own money was Daddy Longlegs.”
Many years later still, after having her sociological and legal education substantially shaped by Shanbhag’s offerings, Aarti went to Premier an hour before closing time. As she came out with a bag of books it began to rain. She huddled under an awning, contemplating hours of waiting thus. After he locked the store and came out himself, Shanbhag saw Aaarti looking anxious, not perhaps for herself, but for those waiting for her at home. He came up and asked Aarti where she lived, signalled for her to get into his car, and deposited her safely with her family.
Doing good for the world
After I heard of Shanbhag’s death, I googled for stuff on him online, to find a long interview published in The Bangalore Review. This was conducted in 2014, some years after he retired, and contains a most informative account of his career as a bookseller. Here I found that, while I certainly knew and remembered the many debts I owed Shanbhag, I had forgotten the modest debt he owed me.
Apparently it was I who first persuaded him to get a credit card machine, in view of the fact that other bookstores in the city now had them, and he had to keep up with the competition. Long-time customers like myself, of course, continued to pay by cash, sometimes weeks after we had taken away and read the books we had bought from him.
Shanbhag’s store stocked books only in English, but, as the bilingual writer Sugata Srinivasaraju reminds me, Premier played a critical role in expanding the horizons of many Kannada writers too. Sugata’s own father, the dramatist C Srinivasaraju, assembled a large collection of books on drama theory from Premier, which are now housed with the Indira National Centre for the Arts.
When the great director BV Karanth visited Bangalore, he would ask Srinivasaraju to meet him at Premier where, after an hour of happy and productive browsing, they would walk over to Koshy’s for an hour of intense (and productive) conversation. On my own visits to the store, I often saw the Kannada poet Pratibha Nandakumar and the Kannada critic GK Govinda Rao and the Kannada editor Sudra Srinivas there, as also the Tamil writer G Sivaramakrishnan. Doubtless Shanbhag and his shop stoked the literary and social sensibilities of some Urdu and Marathi and Konkani writers too.
Behind Shanbhag’s shy demeanour lay a mischievous wit – reserved only for people he had known long enough – and a great strength of character. He had an inner contentment, an inner peace, that kept him and his store going while the city and the world changed around him, and that kept him going further when real estate prices forced him to shut stop.
I have never known a man – or woman – to take retirement with such equanimity, with absolutely no bitterness or regrets. When Achal Prabala and I went to see him c 2016, he radiated the same sort of kindness and warmth (and mischief) as he had in the days he ran Premier. Walking around his locality with him, it was clear his neighbours adored Shanbhag just as much as his customers once did.
Among the many comments on Twitter posted after Shanbhag’s death was one which offered this quote from George Ell.” Through the books he selected and sold, through the knowledge he helped convey and the moral compass he himself represented, TS Shanbhag did far more good for the world than some vain and vindictive men who claim to have the force of history behind them.
Ramachandra Guha’s books include Patriots and Partisans, with an essay titled “Turning Crimson at Premier’s”.

Disparate impact and disparate treatment are two legal theories of discrimination, and it’s critically important that you protect yourself and your business from these kinds of actions. Good intentions are not enough to defend yourself in these claims, which are all about results. Take time to go through all your hiring practices and employment procedures to identify any possible vulnerabilities, and think about the way each policy is implemented. If an action of disparate treatment or disparate impact is ever brought against you, get an attorney involved.
Disparate Treatment
Disparate treatment is a claim of intentional employment discrimination based upon an individual’s membership in a protected class. The claim is that a specific employee or candidate belonging to a protected class was singled out and unfairly treated in a job-related action, with “discriminatory intent or motive.” This focus on intent is particular to disparate treatment; the plaintiff must prove, using either direct evidence (such as an admission that the decision was motivated by discrimination), or, more commonly, circumstantial evidence. This might include suspicious behavior toward members of the group, which can be used to build a pattern of discriminatory intent; examples of comparable employees not in the protected class getting better treatment; or evidence that the plaintiff was more qualified than the person who ultimately got the position, who is not a member of the protected class.
Disparate Impact
Unlike disparate treatment, a disparate impact claim of discrimination is not interested in discriminatory intent; it only looks at discriminatory outcomes. The foundation of disparate impact is a policy that is intended to be neutral and non-discriminatory, but when used in practice it disproportionately affects members of a protected class. Disparate impact is usually defined by statistical measurements of how a policy affects members of particular groups at a substantially higher rate than members of other groups. Disparate impact is not illegal on its own; what makes it illegal is when the policy in question is unrelated to success in the position. The classic example is in policies requiring firefighters to meet certain strength requirements. The strength requirements disproportionately affect female applicants. So long as the strength requirement is at a level that measures actual requirements of being a firefighter, though, the policy is not illegal. It only becomes illegal if the requirement is lifted above and beyond the requirements one would need to be an effective firefighter. Be aware, disparate impact requires no intention to discriminate; the same company policies are applied to everyone, but still negatively impact one or more groups unfairly.
Protected Classes
These discrimination claims are based upon membership in a protected class. The following are protected classes covered by these theories, as defined by the Civil Rights Act of 1964:
- Race
- Color
- Religion
- National Origin
- Gender
- Age
- Familial Status
- Disability
- Veteran Status
- Genetic Information
These classes are protected at the federal level, while other classes have protection in certain jurisdictions but not in others. Find out if there are any additional protected classes in your area.The Best E Cig Kit

The Alexandra Wines philosophy is simple…
…tender loving care for the vines to produce consistently premium-quality wines. 130 years after Jean Desire Feraud produced the first grapes in Central Otago, Alexandra Wines (aka The Davishon Vineyard) reflect the heritage and quality that have made this region a must-experience for any Kiwi wine fan.
Peter Bartle, Alexandra Wines’ winemaker today, has established himself as one of Central Otago’s most successful and respected winemakers with his no nonsense approach to winemaking which is backed up by the many medals and awards that his wines have celebrated. He believes most of the work is done before the fruit arrives at the winery and it is his job to coerce the best out of the grapes the vineyard has produced and to make wines with poise, texture and balance.Teton Gravity Research has released the film “Mountain in the Hallway” about two fathers battling cancer and their attempt to climb the Grand Teton in Wyoming.
Life certainly comes with its challenges. But for some, those challenges far outweigh anything else. When Tate MacDowell and Brian McDonnell were diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2016, they came face to face with their greatest challenge. Never ones to back down, they vowed to make the absolute most of it, and set their sights high: to beat cancer and embrace life by climbing the Grand Teton.
Teton Gravity Research (TGR) has tackled the topics of cancer and the mountains in the latest film “Mountain in the Hallway.” Told through the lens of two fathers battling cancer, the movie delves into the desire to live fulfilling mountain lives and the sacred landscape of the Grand Teton. Tate and Brian underwent chemotherapy, surgery, and spent large swaths of time wandering the halls of their respected hospitals and it was during their wanderings and waiting for the nausea to pass, they found themselves entranced by the highest point in the Grand Teton National Park. The Grand Teton, looming 13,775 feet over Jackson’s hole, is the mountain in the hallway.
Through social media and mutual friends, Tate and Brian became compadres as they fought through chemotherapy and multiple surgeries. Ultimately, the mountain in the hallway became a common goal that offered strength, peace and motivation. Tate and Brian decided to meet in-person and attempt to climb the Grand Teton together. With the support and sponsorship from Black Diamond Equipment, Teton Gravity Research and Exum Guides, both men gathered in the shadows of the Tetons to celebrate the mountain, their families, friends and life.
What is colorectal cancer? Colorectal cancer is a disease characterized by the unchecked division and survival of abnormal cells in the colon or rectum. In the United States, colorectal cancer is responsible for the second most cancer deaths, and the key to surviving and beating colorectal cancer is early detection. According to the American Cancer Society, “colorectal cancer is much more common in older men than in younger patients.” Mountain in the Hallway, tells the stark reality that younger men who live healthy and active lives are increasingly at risk of developing tumors in their large intestine and that the US healthcare system needs to adjust the guidelines for preventative screening that is covered by health insurance for adults younger than forty years old.
In 2017 in the US, an estimated 135,430 people will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer and about 50,260 people will die from the disease. Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women. Approximately 4.6% of men (1 in 22) and 4.2% of women (1 in 24) will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in their lifetime.
Teton Gravity Research hopes that this film will educate, shape the future of the preventative healthcare system and remind you to love the ones you’re with.

Our aim is to reduce this stress and make your conveyancing process run as smoothly as possible. In this first time home seller guide, you’ll find out more about the conveyancing process of selling a property.

CONSIDERING AND ACCEPTING OFFERS
COSTS AND FEES OF SELLING YOUR HOUSE
When you sell your house, you’ll need to be prepared for the many costs and fees that come with it. You should factor in these costs early on to avoid any surprises later on. Make a note of these costs before you commit to selling:
Estate agent fees
Estate agent fees include advertising your property on websites and conducting viewings, as well as liaising with other parties involved to complete the sale.
Remortgaging fees
You should check if there are any penalties for exiting your mortgage early. For example, you may have to pay an exit fee or early repayment charges.
Conveyancing fees
Working with a conveyancer or legal solicitor will help with all the legal aspects of selling your property. This is known as ‘conveyancing’. You’ll pay either a fixed fee or a percentage of the value of the property.
A word on covenants
One of the most commonly asked questions is whether you have observed and performed the ‘covenants’ contained in the title documents.
A covenant is a formal agreement between two parties. There are two different types of covenants – positive and restrictive:
- A positive covenant requires some form of action to be taken.
- A restrictive covenant prohibits you from using the land in a specific way.
Your conveyancer will send you the title documents. Make sure that you read them carefully before answering this question. If you discover that one of the covenants has been breached, let your conveyancer know so that they can advise you on how to deal with this.
Energy performance certificate (EPC)
An EPC provides information about the energy efficiency of your home, using a scale from A to G, “A” being the most efficient and “G” being the least. Providing an EPC is essential to encourage prospective buyers.
Before you leave the property, take final meter readings. You may want to take photographs for better record keeping. Contact your service provider and advise them that you are moving. You should also remember to put yourself on the electoral register at your new property and update your ID documents, such as your driving licence.
Removal costs
If you are moving in to a new home, make a list of what you want to transport to the new property and donate any unwanted or unnecessary items. By doing this, you will save yourself money and time. You’ll benefit from a smaller van and your removal team will need less time.
PREPARING YOUR HOUSE TO SELL
When selling your home, you should do everything you can to show buyers your property’s potential. Helping them picture themselves living in your home is likely to sell your home quicker, and you may even get better offers. Here are three ways to spruce up your home in preparation for a sale:
Having a home filled with clutter will sometimes make it difficult for buyers to picture themselves living there. Clean the house thoroughly, including the garden shed and the attic. Put yourself in the buyer’s shoes and do not leave any nasty surprises behind, including unwanted or broken items or rubbish.
Too many personal items or furniture can overpower a room and almost make it appear smaller than it is. Consider moving some items into an external storage space to remove clutter until after your move.
Get painting
Look at your home objectively…does it need some TLC? Selling your house is a priority, so consider if some areas need to be tidied up with a paint job. Don’t go overboard as these costs can mount up – just try to clear up any cracks or dull areas with a dash of colour.
Fix up the little things
When a buyer comes to view your property, the little things that you may ignore daily will stand out. Look around every room in your house, write down any ‘quick fixes’ and get them sorted as soon as possible.
Arrange electrical and gas safety inspection reports. It is not a legal requirement and you do not have to agree to the buyer’s request, but it is a courtesy. The only exception to this is if you’re selling to somebody who will move in renting tenants.
The buyer’s solicitors may also ask for building regulations certificates if the property has had works carried out which required certification. If you don’t have these, don’t panic. Your conveyancer will discuss the issue with the buyer’s solicitors.
The easiest option would be to arrange a ‘Lack of Building Regulation Indemnity Policy’. This will provide cover in the event of the Local Authority taking enforcement action for being in breach of Building Regulations. However, the policy does not provide cover for any defective works. The cost of the insurance is directly linked to the cost of the house, and your conveyancer will arrange this on your behalf.
CHOOSING HOW TO SELL YOUR PROPERTY
Once you’ve decided to sell your property, the first step is to decide how to sell it. You have three options: you can sell your home yourself, use a local estate agent or an online estate agent.
If you use a local estate agent, you will need to do some research into which is the most suitable option for you. Once you have chosen, you can invite an estate agent into your home to value the property. This will give you a clear idea of what you can sell it for in the current local property market and can help you decide which agent you want to work with.
Questions to ask your estate agent
- What are your fees, and are there any other costs?
- How will you market my home?
- How much is my property worth?
- Do you have a list of buyers already interested in property similar to mine?
GET YOUR PAPERWORK IN ORDER
Before you instruct your solicitors, you should have all the required documents ready. It’s a good idea to store all important documents such as title deeds, guarantees, building compliance certificates and any other documentation that can help the buyer, as this will help speed up the transaction. You can also create electronic copies of important documents and save them on your computer.
To save time, send all these documents along with initial forms to your conveyancer. They can then send these to your buyer’s solicitor along with the draft contract pack.
At the beginning of the transaction, your conveyancer will send you the property information form and fixtures and fittings form. Make sure that you answer all the questions truthfully and to the best of your knowledge.
When they receive the draft contract pack, the buyer’s solicitors will raise enquires and your conveyancer will contact you to discuss them. Try to answer all questions as fully as possible. Again, if you are unsure about anything, it is best to contact your conveyancer to check.
ORGANISING YOUR HOME FOR VIEWINGS
When it comes to viewings, don’t make buyers imagine how good it could be – show them! Presentation is crucial as it allows you to showcase the strengths of your property. Buyers are coming to look around your property, so make sure your home is at its best. Whether you are selling or buying a house, presentation matters. Here are some top tips for getting your home ready for viewings.
Garden maintenance
Both front and back gardens are crucial for viewings. Many buyers will make a drive-by visit to your property before arranging an initial viewing. Tidy up the outside of your home regularly. Trim the lawn and hedges, and remove any weeds or overgrown flowers from pathways. For many people, the garden is one of the biggest selling points, so presentation matters.
Living areas and bathrooms
Start by decluttering. Having clutter in your home can make rooms appear and feel smaller than they are. Make sure any distinctive features of your home can be fully showcased. Let in natural daylight by drawing back the curtains or blinds. If you’re selling during the winter, make sure the house is warm. If not, let fresh air in by opening the windows.
Kitchen
Clean and polish all surfaces, handles, cupboard fronts and appliances. Clean inside your oven and any other integrated appliances that will be included in the sale. Make sure your sink and draining areas are spotless and completely clear from clutter. If you have pets, make sure bowls and toys are cleared away, and always open windows slightly to let out any lasting aromas.
Bedrooms
Potential buyers are interested in seeing every room, so make sure every area is tidy. If you have children, tidy away any toys or clothing to ensure viewers have a clear walkway.
CONSIDERING AND ACCEPTING OFFERS
Receiving an offer on your property can be a very exciting time, but it is always a good idea to keep level-headed to make sure you get the best offer for you and your circumstances.
Considering an offer
Many buyers usually offer slightly less than the advertised asking price, so be aware that some initial offers may be lower than expected.
There is no need to accept or reject any offers right away. It is normal to take time to think things over for a few days. If you’re unsure about accepting an offer on your property, you can check local sold house prices to get an overall idea of what other properties in your area have been bought or sold for.
Always ask your conveyance or estate agent what position the buyer is in before you make any decisions. Here are some crucial questions to have in mind:<
- What are the buyer’s financial decisions?
- Does the buyer have all their documents ready?
- What is the buyer’s timeline for moving?
Accepting an offer
If you do accept an offer, it is usually ‘subject to contract’, which means as long as a survey doesn’t add any surprises, the buyer will most likely complete the sale. Remember that accepting an offer is not legally binding until the contracts are exchanged. You can legally change your mind or accept a higher offer later, but this can be quite distressing to the buyer. This means that a buyer can back out of the sale at any given time too.
HOW WE CAN HELP
At Optimal Solicitors, we understand that selling a house is a stressful experience and your conveyancer will do their best to keep you updated throughout the process.
It is common that some transactions do not proceed pre-exchange due to personal circumstances or adverse discoveries in the searches. While this may be discouraging, stay positive. Inform your conveyancer and they will put your file on hold until you find a suitable buyer again. Our ‘no sale, no fee’ agreement means that you will only pay if your transaction completes.

And dinner for me can also be something thats quick and convenient, somewhere to just dash in and out of before a concert/gig or a meal that lasts for hours with wine, chats and of course good food. For me, I think dinner has become quite a social thing - before I may have been happy to go to the pub and scream over all the noise, whereas now I like to ease into the night by going for food, some wine and being able to have a chat and catch up with friends and family (and then heading to the pub for some more drinks - I am Irish after all).
I have listed all the spots that I have visited for dinner below and for convenience I have listed them according to their ranking. For dinner inspiration just click on the link to see what I have said about it. Also whilst I have only visited these places for dinner a lot of them will do a breakfast/brunch/lunch menu so you shouldn't just consider them for dinner. You can find all my brunch reviews by clicking HERE and all my lunch reviews by clicking HERE.
You will see a mixture of restaurants and wonder how maybe a fine dining restaurant and a burger joint have been given the same rating. I rate the restaurant based on what they are offering and whether they live up that offering. For example Bread Meats Bread is claiming to be a burger joint and they do that very well so they got 19 out of 20. However, if they were claiming to be a fine dining restaurant - they wouldn't have gotten the same review. Likewise, if a restaurant is claiming to offer a fine dining experience, my expectations are a lot higher and therefore I rate them accordingly.

Hey!! This dinner is so luscious. It reminded me of my dinner party that I had arranged last week at one of Chicago event space. Hired experienced catering services there that had arranged yummy food. Impressed with their work. Will book them for future parties too.Have you ever received one of those phone calls from someone pretending to be the IRS, threatening to send you to jail if you don’t pay a bill you didn’t even know you had? Or, have you ever had a contractor come to your home trying to sell you repairs that you don’t actually need?
Unfortunately, there are many untrustworthy individuals and companies that try to rip people off. That includes some air duct cleaning companies that give our profession a bad name. If you want to get your air ducts cleaned but you’re worried about getting scammed here are some things you can look for to protect yourself.
Any air duct cleaning company that claims they can do a thorough job in less than two hours is trying to scam you. Likewise, any company that offers a whole house cleaning for $99 or even less is trying to scam you. Air duct cleaning an entire home should take about four hours in most cases. Any company that offers a $99 coupon is probably planning on jacking up the price once they get to your home.
Another common scam is to come to your home and after doing a quick check of your ducts the company will tell you they have found something seriously wrong that will require a lot of money to fix. If your air duct cleaning company does anything like this, they are trying to rip you off. You should turn them away and call Better Air Northwest instead.
If you want to hire a reliable and trustworthy air duct cleaning company then please contact Better Air Northwest today. Call us at 360-852-6212 in Vancouver, or at 503-208-8351 in Portland, or click here to connect with us online.Partner Success Across Every Industry

Source:
An oasis indoors.
A domed paradise.
A forest of trees.
Birds chirping.
Perfect until the snakes.
Slithering from their cages.
Trees uprooting in their haste.
All moving toward us.
Wolf has his surprises.
We won’t wait for any more.
THE DEAD GAME
Trees and bushes fill the conservatory.
Wolf wants to show us what’s hidden inside.
Linda follows him into the bushes.
Her scream curdles my blood.
We run to her to find cages of snakes.
Their tongues slipping in and out of the holes.
Hungry for their next meal.
The trees draw closer to our group.
Lifting up their massive roots to take chase.
Time to leave this sorry example of the macabre.
The Dead like their games a little too much for comfort.
THE DEAD GAME
A path zigzags through the dense foliage
To cages lined up against the back wall.
Wolf takes Linda’s arm to escort her
To the treasure that lies hidden behind.
Snakes slither and hiss in their metal confines,
Reaching through the holes for the unwanted guests.
Linda screams and backs away in horror
Into the safety of Todd’s waiting arms.
Shana stands mesmerized by a tall, tubular flower,
Its mouth straining open wide.
Wolf introduces her to his man-eating plant,
Which leans even closer to take a human bite.
“Are those alligators under the glass floor?”
At Linda’s feet reptiles swim in circles,
Bloody trails of food following in their wake.
Sounds of laughter erupt around them.
Time for them to leave this house of horrors.
OUR GAMES HAVE JUST BEGUN
THE DEAD GAME
THE DEAD GAME — DAY 98
At the back of the room, Shana spotted row after row of cages.“What’s in those cages?”
“Come and look,” said Wolf.
He walked over to Linda, who was cowering in the corner. He bowed to her and gave her a very charming smile. He slipped her arm through his own, to escort her through the overhanging trees and thick greenery. Shana overheard him whispering to Linda, “I’m taking you to my own special place.” Wolf could be very charming and appealing when he wanted to be. And Linda was falling for his ploy; she was following him—as if in a trance.
Wolf leered over his shoulder at Todd, gloating over his ability to lure Linda to his side. Shana noticed that Todd was brimming with anger, but was fighting to hold it in check.
Wolf, still holding Linda’s arm, led them through the tangled trees and shrubbery. The trees seemed to be leaning closer and closer toward them. Shana hurried to follow the others.
The back wall was filled with cages holding large snakes. The snakes coiled and slithered around each other, their tongues slipping in and out while emitting hissing sounds. Shiny heads were slipping through the openings of their cages, attempting to reach the unwelcome intruders. Linda shrieked and backed away in fear. Todd pulled her away from Wolf and told him that they were leaving at once.
They all turned to leave except for Shana—who stood as still as a statue—mesmerized by a huge plant that was bending closer and closer to her. She felt like it was trying to tell her something.
“I would stay away from that plant; it’s a Carnivorous Pitching Plant that will eat anything or anyone within its reach,” said Wolf. He was enjoying her discomfort too much.
Shana backed away…but at the same time couldn’t keep her eyes off the intriguing plant. It was tall with a long, white tube and red spots. It stood watching her. Its large, oval shaped, red-rimmed opening was aimed at her—ready for its next meal.
Wolf continued with his tribute to the man-eating plant. “I have a whole collection of pitching plants that I have imported from South Korea. They keep me safe from intruders. I just have to teach them how to move and attack.”
Shana didn’t know if he was being serious or not. But she believed that he was sick enough to develop his own army of attacking plants.
When she’d jumped back from the plant, she had noticed him smirking at her fear. She hated the man and his know-it-all attitude. She prayed for the day when his plant army learned to hate him and attacked him. Out loud she said, “Let’s visit another room in this fascinating house.” Todd, who was eager to leave the house, shot her an annoyed look. But she just shrugged and turned to follow Wolf to the next room. Todd and Linda had no choice but to tag along behind her.
Wolf said, “I have another surprise waiting for all of you.”

You can thank a childhood knee injury for the rise of Mona Tavakoli and the percussion revolution she helped to ignite. “I used to play a lot of basketball when I was a kid,” the fiery cajonist explains. “Mind you, I’m five-two, so I didn’t get too far in my dream of being the first woman to play in the NBA.”
And here she laughs, the first of many times in our conversation. Chalk it up to the delight she finds in life and channels into her performances with Jason Mraz; her own all-female band, Raining Jane; and other musicians who have fed from the energy she unleashes on what was a novelty instrument not too long ago.
“Anyway,” she continues. “After I enrolled at UCLA, I saw that there was a flamenco dance class on the curriculum. I thought that it would be super cool because the arms and the hands move in a way that was very similar to the Persian dancing I did as a kid. Plus I would be drumming with my feet. It was dancing and drumming, the perfect marriage of my interests.”
Soon, though, that knee she had hurt years ago on the court began to ache again. “All that stomping began to flare it up,” Tavakoli says. “So I told my teacher, Liliana Deleon-Torsiello, ‘I’m having a lot of knee pain but I want to finish the class. I’m a drummer. Is there anything I can do?’”
She smiles as she remembers her teacher’s reply: “I’ll bring you the box.”
From that day, everything in Tavakoli’s life changed — and for the better. Music has benefited, too, as she parlayed her experiences with that box — better known to its adherents as a cajon — into a lifetime passion.
She’s toted it along to duo gigs with Mraz for nearly a decade. Together they’ve delivered high-precision, sizzling sets on countless stages, including the Kennedy Center and venues in Antarctica, to help raise awareness of global warming. They’ve entertained national audiences on The Today Show, The Late Show With David Letterman, Ellen, Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, and Dancing With The Stars. She has delivered a solo recital and partnered with Pat Benatar and her husband Spyder Giraldo on A&E’s Private Sessions. And she, Chaska Potter, and Natalia Zukerman appeared in concerts and conducted workshops throughout Africa as cultural diplomats for the US State Department.
Perhaps her most enduring contribution will be to shine a spotlight as few others have on what was once considered a novelty instrument, and ensure its place in the percussive pantheon. None of this might have happened had she finished that childhood basketball game unscathed. In retrospect, that could be the best thing that ever happened to her — and to those whom she continues to inspire.

The Kit Years
Tavakoli’s path to that day at UCLA began some 20 years earlier in San Jose. Her parents had moved to the States from Iran to pursue their master’s degrees. When the Khomeini regime seized power back home, they settled permanently in the Bay Area, where they raised their son and three daughters in a bilingual household. “The music they played on our record player was all from Iran,” Tavakoli remembers. “They didn’t listen to Western music at all.”
At the same time, they worked to ensure that their children would integrate fully into American society. “One of the things they did was to join this ranch in Red Bluff, California, called Our Ranch,” she says. “They were like, ‘American people ride horses. Let’s learn about that.’ They put my brother into Little League. They were trying to assimilate. It was so sweet.”
They had an especially novel idea for ushering Mona into mainstream culture. “They were like, ‘Americans put their daughters into beauty pageants!’ So that’s what they did,” she says, with another laugh. “My mom thought I was a good dancer, so she got me these little belly-dancing cymbals. That was my talent; I was doing Persian dances. In fact, that was my first percussive performance, at seven years old, competing against other little girls. I never won for beauty but I always won for talent. So I was like, ‘I may not be pretty — but I sure am good at something!’”
Thanks to her brother, Tavakoli’s horizons soon widened beyond her family’s heritage. “When I was in fifth grade, he bought me a cassette of Madonna’s True Blue,” she says. “Soon, at 11 years old, I was drawing fake Madonna moles onto my face and dancing to ‘Like A Virgin.’ Then he turned me on to Rush and Public Enemy and NWA and Megadeth and Metallica. I got into Neil Peart, even though I didn’t know his name until I was in high school. But as an 11-year-old girl I was like, ‘Whoa, what is that drummer doing? This is crazy!’”
Just as important were the discoveries Tavakoli made on her own. “My brother wasn’t listening to . . . thoughtful music,” she says, smiling. “So when I first saw Tori Amos play live, that changed my whole mindset. I saw a really powerful woman in control of two pianos at once, straddling the bench. She was such an expressive being. Whether they’re playing the drums or something else, I’m attracted to artists who express from fully in their body. I mean, people like Neil Peart made me hear drums in a very different way. Is that the kind of musician I became? No. It did inspire me so much, like, ‘That’s one way to do it.’ But with Madonna and Tori Amos, it was about ferocity and confidence. They showed us what we could become in the world.”
Determined to start playing drums herself, Tavakoli enrolled in band classes throughout elementary, junior high, and high school. She credits Mr. Tyler, her teacher from sixth through eighth grades, for encouraging her ambitions. Because trumpet was his instrument, he wasn’t able to give her specifics on drumming technique. Instead, he imparted something more significant.
“In eighth grade we played a concert where I had a big drum solo. Right before we began, Mr. Tyler introduced me as ‘the aggressive Mona Tavakoli.’ I remember at 13 wondering what that meant, so I asked him after the concert. And he said, ‘Mona, you’re so good. If you stay aggressive, you will always succeed.’ That was life advice, not just musical. From that moment, I was like, ‘Okay! If I’m gonna play drums, I’m gonna play with my whole body, with my whole heart.’”

“It’s Your Fault!”
Her parents were at that concert. Apparently, they sensed the electricity that Mona felt in the spotlight and in her resolve to chase her dreams without compromise. “Before that, they had been like, ‘You’ve got to play violin or flute because girls do not play the drums!’ But I convinced them to let me try because it was only a six-dollar investment — they just had to buy sticks, right? But then after that show, my dad was like, ‘Oh, my God! We’ve got to buy you a drum set!’”
She savors the memory before adding, with affection, “To this day my mom blames my dad for my lifestyle — ‘She’s a musician! It’s your fault!’ But that was so open-minded for them both, especially being Iranian parents.”
Tavakoli never did take lessons. Instead, she taught herself to play “on the job” with her high school jazz band, pep band, marching band, and orchestra. She started doing gigs on weekends too, beginning with a guitar/drum duo called Periwinkle. Her drive to perform found outlets as well through acting in school plays and even participating in debates.
After heading south to UCLA to work on her double major in economics and communications, Tavakoli stayed musically active. She spent one year in the marching band, playing cymbals. “That was interesting because I’d been playing tenors in high school. But then you realize that some of the baddest, most awesome players you’ve ever heard are in the drum line. That was such a humbling experience that I began thinking about whether I wanted to keep playing drums or not.”
Characteristically, Tavakoli found an unorthodox way to answer that question. “I auditioned to be the band mascot!” she says, sounding more than a little proud. “I put on the bear suit, set up my drum set, did a dance in the costume, and then ripped a three-minute drum solo — with my four-fingered furry gloves. I mean, come on! They had to give it to me!”
They did, and for two more years that was Tavakoli in Bruin togs, cavorting with the band during half-times and getting her fair share of drumming in as well. She also developed an ability to hear the music more perceptively as it was going on around her, a skill that she counts as essential to what she does today.
“That’s proved so important to me time and again,” she insists. “The drums are so loud, so I taught myself to step back and take the role of listener and contributor very seriously. Instead of trying to drive every moment in a performance, I find what to add to those moments. That’s where my instinct for working with singer/songwriters got sharpened.”

The Magic Box
Important as it was to learn how to play snare in a bear costume, that first encounter with a cajon would have a more lasting impact. Tavakoli knew it the instant her teacher brought it out at that flamenco dance class.
“I said, ‘Oh, my gosh, what is this?’” she recalls. “And Liliana says, ‘They use this in flamenco music in Spain. I want you to take the rhythms you learned in this class — bulerias, alegrías, soleares — from your feet and put them in your hand. I was like, ‘No problem!’
“It was love at first sight, a complete romance,” Tavakoli continues. “I had no rules to follow because I’d never seen anybody play the cajon before. Liliana didn’t know how to play it either, so I felt fully free to be creative. I found where there was a high tone and a low tone. Then it was like, how do I use my fingers? Can I use a brush? Can I use my feet? It was a wide open landscape.”
Starting from scratch, Tavakoli began building a technique based on providing a rhythm bed for the class. She knew nothing about performance practice, and had never seen anyone play the instrument before. It wasn’t clear whether her role would be to replicate, complement, or answer the rhythms articulated by the dancers — or do something completely different.
“My learning came from the flamenco rhythm,” she explains. “But I didn’t have a teacher. I didn’t have any guidance, other than to accompany the dancers, which was again all about listening. Still, after just my first or second time Liliana was like, ‘You really know what you’re doing with this cajon. I would love you to become a part of my dance company.’ The connection was immediate. So Liliana really introduced me to my whole career.”
With little awareness of her new instrument’s tradition, Tavakoli shaped her approach to it on her experience as a traps drummer — specifically, the aesthetic of blending high and low tones, equivalent to snare and kick, into a stream of rhythm. “I didn’t have any string cajons at the time,” she notes. “These were just Peruvian-style empty boxes, so I was just doing a kick-and-snare. That’s where my ear took me. At the same time, I knew that with flamenco music there are lots of palmas, the hand claps. So I began looking into how I could complement those rhythms with bass and snare tones.”
Soon Tavakoli pushed ahead, looking for ways to apply what she was learning to other styles of music. When her bandmates in Raining Jane heard her deliver a recital, they bought her a new cajon for her birthday in 2000 and encouraged her to work it further into their music. Shortly after that, when they started booking their own shows throughout the U.S., they began featuring Tavakoli on three or four cajon numbers each night. Audiences reacted with curiosity, even leaving their seats and pressing closer to the stage to see what was going on.
“The cajon is so accessible. Anybody who’s interested in playing can just sit on it and create a sound. It’s a means of expression. It improves everybody’s feelings about themselves and each other.” — Mona Tavakoli
Gradually, Tavakoli shifted her primary focus from drum set to cajon. By 2012, when she began working with Jason Mraz, she had more or less set the kit aside. Asked to explain why, she thought carefully before making it clear that her trajectory shouldn’t be in any way seen as a rejection of what the traditional drum set has to offer.
“As we all know, the drum set is just such a commitment,” she begins. “I mean, I love the kit..”
This became clearer soon. “I realized that if I used a metal brush in my left hand and played traditional, I could get a nice eighth-note shaker or hi-hat vibe. I’d brush my hand across it, like sandpaper, to create different tones. If I turn it around, especially my signature cajon (LP’s ‘MT Box’), it gives me a woody, hands-on tone, like a bongo. Eventually I found these ghungroos, which are Indian dancing bells that I strap onto my left foot. That adds another bright texture because I like a big bass sound on my cajon. I set up a tambourine for my right foot. That’s pretty much my setup, unless there’s room for cymbal stands so I can bring my tiny DW 6000s and my Sabian El Sabor percussion.”
Crickets And Toms
Maybe her most innovative move came from her attempt to conjure a tom sound, somewhere between the kick and snare ranges. “I started pushing my heel up and down the cajon, which is a move I called the ‘cricket,’” she says. “It looks like the wood on the front of the cajon is dense but it’s actually just a couple of plies, so I’ll dig my heel into it and roll it up and down. A lot of people do it now but I started doing it 20 years ago. And now I feel like I can cricket in my sleep!”
(To hear what two decades of cricketing leads to, check out various YouTube videos of Tavakoli doing “Browntown” as a duo with her Raining Jane colleague Becky Gebhardt on sitar. Toward the end of the track, she emulates a drummer’s run through a sequence of toms with an uncanny panache, using just hands and her “cricket” foot.)
Most recently, Tavakoli credits her association with Jason Mraz for expanding her technical and conceptual horizons on cajon. “I’ve learned so much from him in terms of being really authentic in the moment,” she says. “He truly has no pretense. To be on his left side onstage and pay attention, that gives me permission to really be myself in the moment. It becomes my duty to bring everything I can to the moment. He has made me a better person and a better musician.”
With technique now a secondary concern, Tavakoli gives priority to this notion of playing from the heart. In fact, it is essential to her technically as well as expressively. “Some drummers have a problem with cajon because it’s such a different body language. When you’re behind a kit, you have toms and cymbals and all these things covering you. You use your hips to move up and down as you play. I have good posture. I open my chest really wide. A lot of people are like, ‘How can you sit like that and face an audience?’ But it’s part of my spiritual practice of giving or receiving in concert.”
She pauses and then remembers an incident from a NAMM show several years ago. “A guy came up to me and said, ‘You know, I bought a cajon but it’s hard for me to just go for it.’ And I said, ‘Well, yeah, because you have to open up your heart and your face. It’s a vulnerable position. So, try it alone. Just play songs you really enjoy. Once you feel good about the sounds you’re getting, you won’t have as much of a problem playing to an audience because you’ll have found how to feel good.”
Tavakoli worked with Mraz to design an array of percussion that presents her fully and openly to the audience. Now, when they take to the stage with Raining Jane, or when she gigs with exiled Iranian pop vocal legend Ebi, her arsenal includes djembe, bongos, cymbal, chimes, a Roland SPD-SX, and a Marxophone, a fretless zither that sounds somewhat like a mandolin or hammered dulcimer. “They’re spread apart because I want to connect with the audience and my bandmates,” she explains.
Still, the cajon is and will remain the center of Tavakoli’s universe. She even credits it for her most important project outside of performance — the Rock n’ Roll Camp for Girls Los Angeles. “What we do there is completely in line with my dreams for the cajon,” she says. “The cajon is so accessible. Anybody who’s interested in playing can just sit on it and create a sound. It’s a means of expression. It improves everybody’s feelings about themselves and each other. It’s the same with the Rock n’ Roll Camp: You create a space where people can express themselves.”
As for her own journey, Tavakoli sums it up this way: “Whether I’m playing with orchestras, Japanese koto artists, Jason, or whoever, I begin with this perspective I’ve developed over 20 years and try to figure out how to apply it to something that’s being done by someone else. It’s no longer about just playing a 2 and a 4. It’s about what I can contribute.”

And Andrew's style is to quote his readers' e-mails anonymously, which is just fine. And I will reveal here that the second block quote in this recent piece of his is none other than little old Passionate Moderate Mormon - me. But I think Andrew still doesn't get it.
This last summer, my wife, various relatives and friends, and I (six of us total), had a wonderful trip to Britain. One of the many highlights was an afternoon in the British Museum. (By the way, I recommend a full day or two if you can manage the time - we were a little hurried to see all we could before we got out to the ancestral lands in Wales for the family history purpose of the trip). Just after the Egyptian exhibit with an actual mummy with very interesting markings on its knees, navel, and breasts (but I'll leave the rest of that to Nibley's intellectual heirs), I came across a surprising display of "golden plates." It was shocking to the max!
This is part of the Oxus Treasure from ancient Persia. It dates from the Fifth Century B.C. which would be a few years after Lehi left Jerusalem and then the city was conquered by the Babylonians, right next to Persia and Persia took it all over a little later. In fact this treasure connects up to none other than Cyrus the Great, the one who in the Bible allowed the Jews to return to Jerusalem! The interesting thing is down at the bottom of the museum's explanation it described "votive plaques" which is the same thing as saying "religious plates." They mostly have figures, but also symbols and what looked like some writing to me.
Now, I never meant this blog to be an apologists' blog because picking up little pieces of fact here and there in an attempt to prove a point is the same as anti-Mormon or tea-partier proof-texting which I abhor. But Andrew says "The story of the golden plates is so obviously a fraud it beggars belief." So, I don't get it. Here we have in the Oxus treasure nothing other than religious, gold plates from a time and place not far from where Lehi departed on his journey. So religious gold plates are "obviously a fraud?"
Maybe it's the Angel Andrew is talking about. Granted, we're right back to matters of belief, not proof of similar angels in the British Museum. But how can the Angel be so "obviously a fraud" when Andrew, a believing Catholic, comes from a rich tradition of angels over the past two thousand years? (Well, just since Christ. I guess Catholicism includes angels from the Old Testament days as well.) Maybe Andrew doesn't believe in Catholic Angels (I don't have much reason to doubt them myself). If so, I guess that's fine. But that's his choice.
Maybe it's the whole Book of Mormon history on the plates? While I can't yet prove it through scientific methods, I am not aware of anything to scientifically or rationally establish the definitive proof that the history is a fraud. I've been to the Yucatan. There were various peoples in the Ancient Americas. They had ancient civilizations. Why couldn't there be a divine history of at least a part of them? In fact, if the plates were real and if the Angel were real and Joseph was a prophet of God, how could the history be a fraud? The Angel lied? Well, I guess that's the fundamentalist Christian explanation based again on belief, not exactly rationalism. Even the Izapa Stela No. 5, of which I bought a cheap plaster reproduction at an ancient Mayan ruin, may convey some Meso-American mythological figures and not the literal story of Lehi and Nephi. But nobody can tell me that is not a universally recognized "world tree" or "tree of life" as the central theme of that picture. So, I can't prove or disprove that either. Book of Mormon history may be improbable but that's not the same thing as rationally impossible.
Bottom line, Andrew has done nothing rationally or spiritually to disabuse me of my Faith. And I've had the strongest spiritual witnesses of its truth that Andrew is free to seek, or not, as he chooses.
I'll leave Kolob for another day.

Andrew Sullivan - Almost Fair and Rational!
Very cool pic of the gold plates in England - and the connection to Cyrus. Unfortunately, if even if one of those plates was signed by Nephi, there would still be screams of "fraud". (You see, those ancient Egyptians were probably in on the conspiracy from the beginning)
thanks, MMM! We didn't even get to the Ancient America room in the British Museum. Maybe they have something like the liahona in there and haven't noticed.Contrary to popular belief, sciatica is not a condition in itself, but a set of symptoms that can result from a variety of injuries, biomechanical issues, and imbalances that put pressure on the sciatic nerves in the body. Since it can have different causes, there are several treatment methods that can help sciatica sufferers find relief. One of the most effective options for easing many of the symptoms is massage, which not only relieves the pressure that contributes but can also help prevent the pain from recurring. How can massage help relieve sciatica symptoms?
The Sciatica Story
The sciatic nerves are the largest in the body, leaving each side of the low spine to branch out through the seat and pelvis into the legs and feet. These nerves are responsible for motor function and sensory input, and since they extend down the legs, problems with the sciatic nerve can reach all the way to the feet and toes.
In most cases, the sciatic nerve is irritated or damaged by compression, which can result from spinal misalignment, soft tissue damage or inflammation, and even compression by imbalanced muscles through which the nerves pass. This pressure on the nerves results in symptoms like burning, sharp, shooting, throbbing, or aching pain, tingling, numbness, and even weakness in the legs. How can massage help relieve this discomfort?
Soften the Strain
Most Americans are not as active as they need to be, and our bodies are relatively imbalanced in terms of stabilizing muscle. When someone has a weak core, for example, one muscle group that tends to become overactive to compensate is that around the seat. Tight muscles in the low back and the glutes can pull on the structures of the pelvis, through which the sciatic nerves pass, and smaller muscles like the piriformis can actually grip the nerves, putting intense pressure on them and resulting in pain and dysfunction. Targeted massage can relieve tightness in overactive muscles and their strain on surrounding tissues.
Soothe the Irritation
Tight muscles can also compress the nerves around an injury. This can limit the circulation of healing oxygenated and nutrient-rich blood into the area, prevent the removal of cellular wastes like lactic acid and the inflammatory products that collect after the initial injury. Deep tissue massage increases blood flow and the release of wastes that may be irritating nerves.
Improve your Pain Tolerance
Deep massage also offers the benefit of improving pain tolerance, because this type of tissue manipulation can actually stimulate the release of endorphins into your system, which are the body’s natural “painkillers.” Also, massage can soften connective tissue like fascia, which, when tense, can increase friction and tension between muscles and limit mobility and range of motion.
Is Sciatica Straining your Active Lifestyle?
Symptoms of sciatica can really cramp your activity levels when they’re resulting in chronic pain and discomfort. Fast and effective treatment depends on a comprehensive approach to care that includes spinal alignment to fix the problem at its source, massage to relieve muscle imbalance and create a healing environment in the tissues, and therapy to help the body develop strength and stability for the future.

Hi Teneale
I think you might need your own bodyguard as I’m sure everyone will want one of your swaps – I certainly do, as the sneak peek looks beautiful. I’m so excited about convention if a little panicked as I haven’t started my swaps yet – just have an idea of what I want to do. Wish me luck! Hugs, Di
I was only going to convention to get one of your swaps (thank you Marelle)! I was lucky enough to get one last year. It was a huge highlight of the Canberra convention. I hope I get the chance again this year! Your butterflies look delish and of course looks like a lot of work is going into your swaps again this year. I have made 10 and hope to do another 20! Crossing fingers!!
Kirsty!!
P.S I can be your bodyguard……LMAO
A small word of just France to say to you that what you make is really very beautiful. I even resumed(even took back) the idea of one of your cards(maps) which I found really very attractive.
I’m the one that will need to keep your adoring fans away…I’ve been working on my biceps especially!
I have been privileged to see the completed version in real life and it is STUNNING
14 sleeps to go!!
from your room buddy Swap Bully little Marelle
xoxo
Excuse the profanity….but shit Teneale…I hope you are making thousands of thos swaps….I reckon you both need body guards…I’m your gal…I’ve been doing some boxing classes twice weekly (truly truly I have…I’ll show ya me guns…) to fill the roll…..oh my gosh….thank you for the great award….I’m thrilled….especially to sat Ms Teneale Williams gave ME an award for my bloggo!!!!!!!
Luvs ya all….
Felt like a bit of a stalker last year seeing all the ladies (including yourself) whose blogs I admire, but am going to come and say hello this year. Those butterflies look gorgeous – you’ll have hordes rushing you I bet on Friday morning!! Your ‘express TV’ tale cracked me up! Counting down those sleeps. Cheers, Sue
Teneale, I think it is you that will need a bodyguard! lol I for one would love to meet you as I am a huge fan of your work but I’m sure I will have to get in line if I want to get anywhere near you or one of your swaps.
This will be my first convention and I am so excited! I am coming over from WA and am looking forward to meeting all of my stamping friends from around the country.
Very much looking forward to convention. I’d love one of your swaps.I felt very priveledged to receive one of your swaps last year. I’ve had many customers fall in love with it, if only my work was half as gorgeous as yours, I can dream and practice. See you in 2 weeks…
Genevra
Thanks for this award Teneale. Will catch up with you again at convention (maybe with Miss “M” in tow!). See you soon.
Gorgeous sneak peak, Teneale! As I mentioned in my Christmas Card to you, I’ve been SO looking forward to meeting you at convention this year, so I hope it comes to fruition! I’m counting down the sleeps now, nothing beats catching up with old friends and making some special new ones, does it?
Gorgeous work! So pretty!
I can’t wait for Convention, even moved my annual leave so I could go. So have no idea for swaps & so no time to make them, but so want to so I can swap with you! I received one of your swaps at Regionals & was so excited to get a real-live Teneale original. Might see you there,
Fi x
I see you already have one, but I have an award for you on my blog if you would like it, as I think your work is always packed with beauty and you’re such an inspiration to me! xx Amanda
OOOh an ahhhh from me too Teneale! Those butterflies look gorgeous, but then there isn’t anything on your blog that I don’t totally love! I hope you are making a big box full of swaps because you’ll be ever so popular going by the responses here. I am going to Convention for the first time this year and am quite excited, where are you staying?? would love to try and catch up with you. Hugs Angie xxxx
Hi Teneale
OMG!!! I want one of those butterflies and I agree with the above person, I think you will need a bodyguard to stop everyone rushing at you. I am happy to apply for the position, that way I will get to meet you and Marelle together and I have to say I am pretty good at crash tackling!!!! (LOL) I hope you save one of your swaps for your Mum, maybe it can be a Mother:s Day Card.
This will be my third Convention and I am truly looking forward to meeting you to thankyou in person for your bow tutorial. In my little circle we refer to it as the Teneale bow and has revolutionised my cards.
Linda
I have been on count down to convention now for a few weeks, I can not wait. I was lucky enough to go with a dear friend last year and have a ball, this year I am going with my downline (never thought I would have one of them). Oh how I hope to get to swap with you, my swaps are still in thought mode. They will happen though. If I find your mojo, I too will have a little lend before sending it back. Love your work. See you at convention. Marls 🙂
Ooohh Teneale!!!! These look AMAZING!!!.. I will be one of those crazed stalking type people who will harass you until I get a photo with you AND of course get to SWAP a card with you.. and Marelle too of course!!! This is my FIRST convention.. so I’m a bit scared!! 😀 Where about are you staying? Can’t wait to meet you.
xx Sarah
Teneale!!!
These look AMAZING!!!! Absolutely gorgeous. I must admit that I will be one of those crazed, stalking types who will harass you and Marelle for that matter.. hahaha.. until I get a photo with you both AND of course get to SWAP a card with you. This is my FIRST convention, so I’m a little bit scared.. hahaha. SOOO looking forward to finally meeting you.
Ooohh where abouts are you staying… maybe we are at the same place.. that would make the whole stalking thing SOOOO much easier.. hahaha.
xx Sarah
Thank you gorgeous girl for the blog award. Very honoured. Now, I am not coming to Convention anymore due to “you know what”. But I would love one of those swaps. Gonna put Miss G on that mission!!
PS. I love my iPhone too.
Well, Teneale, I’d just like to add my gushing to all of the above comments from your adoring fans! This will be my first Convention .. totally excited/already a bit overwhelmed! I hope you are making several hundred of those swaps, girl – you’re going to get mobbed! The butterflies look STUNNING. Must stop using exclamation marks in my comments!!!! I’m with you on the whole New York thing; hubby had raved about it after visiting a few years ago, so we went there on a family holiday after Xmas last year. WHAT a city!! It is sooooo beautiful. We’re going back after this Christmas … almost as excited about that, as I am about Convention, LOL. Hope to meet you amidst all the madness in a couple of weeks 🙂
Wow, Teneale! I so wish I was going to covnention to see yoru swaps! Those little teasers look asolutely stunning! Thankyou so much for the award *blush* you are someone that inspires me so much so I am veyr excited! K xx
Oooh, you are mean!! hahaha! I want to see the whole thing!! Hopefully, you can share the whole card after you’re back from convention. I hope you have a blast and I hope those who’ll swap with you appreciate how lucky they are! *wink*

Cindy
Oh my gosh, that is the most beautiful card I have ever seen. Thank you for sharing it with us.
Oh, they look so pretty. I can’t wait to see the whole thing and you better do a swap with Maree so we can see it IRL!
Oh! You really are a brat! To only show us a tiny bit of those gorgeous butterflies and no finished card! I don’t think I can stand it. I won’t be able to make it to convention this year, but I hope you have a grand time. Can’t wait to see what that card looks like completed!
Thank you very much for the award Teneale, I am flattered. Your work is gorgeous and you are an inspiration.
THis is such a tease!!!! i will be in agony until I can see the rest of these cards!!!! And I am off to order that butterfly stamp right now – Idid not realise it could look in any way, shape or form as gorgeous as you have made it look!!!! Stunning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! will be back and back and back until you post the completed production – so excited! xxx
Hi Teneale,
As a regular stalker of your blog I am extremely excited about the possibility of actually holding a piece of your artwork min my hands….I hope you are making LOTS of swaps because I am sure there will be LOTS of people lusting after them. I am soooo looking forward to attending my first convention- maybe I’ll see you there???
Youre swaps look so pretty already and you haven’t even finished yet….hopefully I will be lucky enough to swap one of my little top note bags with you at convention….it’s soo exciting
Seriously Teneale, do you think that if anyone out there found your Mojo, we would give it back??? Here’s a big fat NO from me! What I wouldn’t give to have even just half you Mojo, so if anyone DOES find it, let me know and i’ll go you halves. 🙂 We would all just love to have a teenie bit of your talent, Teneale. And looking at the sneak peek of your Swaps, I am sooo jealous of those thatare going to receive one!!
Teneale, i think you might have to hire a bodyguard for both of you, dont think you will be able to protect Marelle when your getting swamped yourself. I love you beautiful work, was hoping to meet you at convention but unfortuantly this will not be so. Its hard not to go to conventtion this year when it is so close to home oh!… well there is always regionals or next year. Have a ball at convention…….
I think ‘Blushing Butterflies’ would have been a good tital for this post!
Have fun at the convention! Love your work.
These look like they will be nothing short of stunning!!
I’m heading to Convention too – for the first time, so am really excited.
Have fun!
I hope you’re feeling better now Teneale, it seems you’ll need all your strength to guard your swap box at convention! I’m in WA and wont make it this year as I have a little suckling that needs her mummy round the clock, but next year for sure!!! Hopefully I can meet you then 🙂
And just a heads’ up, if Sarah-Jane tries to charm TWO swaps from you, claiming one is for her ‘invisible friend’, that will be me! I can’t make it, but Sarah is being kind enough to take my swaps in lieu.
Have FUN!!!!!
Lee x
Hi Teneale, Oh my it looks like I will have to fight through a lot of your fans to get to one of your beautiful swaps, I tried last year but to no avail and sadly went home without a Teneale original. I am going to try again this year and maybe I’ll be lucky. I have manged to make up 62 swaps so far and mostly 3D items, I look forward to hopefully meeting you soon, lots of inky hugs from Charmaine 🙂What does the Great Commission have to do with mobile devices?

Prada
It’s a heavy season in Milan. With the monumental news of Karl Lagerfeld’s death on Tuesday, fashion descended upon the Italian fashion capital in the wake of accusations made against Gucci and Prada that products of theirs referenced blackface. In Prada’s case it was a keyring in the image of a monkey with red lips. After strongly denying any such intention when the news broke in December, last week the house further announced the creation of a diversity council chaired by Theaster Gates and Ava DuVernay. Going forward, the artist and the film-maker will be in dialogue with Prada, making sure the company’s merchandise never evokes any such reference again. Gucci has taken similar action, but the weight of these incidents has transformed the industry in record time. And while it will unquestionably shape a better future for fashion, it currently leaves a thick cloud of disenchantment around the Milanese shows.
“Fear is around us. Danger and fear,” Miuccia Prada said after her show, which expanded the horror themes she investigated in her menswear collection last month. She continued her studies in interpretations of fear, from the terrifying – unadorned military tunics, combat uniforms and minimalism – to comical graphics like Frankenstein’s monster lifted from what she called “trashy horror movies”. “You have to make light because it’s still a fashion show,” the designer shrugged, also name-checking her fuzzy faux fur neon backpacks on that note. Mrs Prada said she added a sense of romance in all the flowers and lace that prettified an otherwise austere collection, seeking to battle the mood of fear with “a source of good”. “Each girl was a piece of a love story of my vision of love,” she explained.
The good with the evil? Frédéric Sanchez sampled an instrumental version of Lady Gaga’s ‘Bad Romance’ on an exceptionally brilliant soundtrack that deserved its own interpretive thesis. From the thought-provoking titles of songs like Marilyn Manson’s cover of ‘I Put A Spell On You’ and Qual’s ‘Existential Nihilism’, to expressive horror themes like Tales From the Crypt and the opening tune from The X-Files, he very nearly – but not quite – outdid his own soundtrack from January’s Prada men’s show, which featured The Addams Family symphony. Wednesday Addams made several appearances in Thursday’s collection, evoking the familiar idea of nihilistic teenagers – or anti-social adults – who unsubscribe from a world that they fear; in which they feel misinterpreted and mistreated. “Frankenstein’s monster was rejected, but even he was loved,” Mrs Prada reflected, perhaps forgetting how that story ended.
But for all the romance and gallows humour she imbued her collection with in huge flower and monster motifs on silk or knitted dresses and leather skirts – sure to sell up a storm come autumn – the sentiment was undeniably ominous. Asked what it is she fears so much, the designer talked about wars. “Any kind around us. Vile parties and the vile situation in Europe. Strong contrasts growing and growing. In another siècle there would already be a war. I really fear that.” It’s not an uncommon theory: around every turn of the century, a few years before or after the clock strikes twelve, radical revolutions and wars have changed the world with tumultuous impact. What that means in the digital age is anyone’s guess, but the dialogue Mrs Prada has now initiated within her own company is a sensible precaution.
“We work for rich people. We do rich clothes,” she said on the topic of designers and their social conscience. “But somehow fashion is very relevant. There is a request for fashion to talk about political subjects. But to approach political subjects in a world of pleasant things is very difficult. You’ll be criticised. The work is serious but it’s also for pleasure.” Paradoxically – or perhaps not at all – more than her light-hearted horror graphics and romantic floral motifs, it was Prada’s decadent cocktails dresses, glamorous draping and austere tailoring and military garb that felt most desirable for the moment we currently live in.

All members of the NORAH research consortium are experienced and established scientists who can vouch for the quality and neutrality of the results of NORAH.
The scientific approach also requires, however, that methods and results are constantly reviewed by others. This is why, at the start of the NORAH Study, external scientists were commissioned to monitor the quality of the work of the consortium. This groups of scientists form the Wissenschaftlicher Beirat Qualitätssicherung (Scientific Advisory Board for Quality Assurance - WBQ) to ensure the so-called external quality assurance. Parallel to this, the scientists carrying out the study also subjected themselves to internal quality assurance.
External quality assurance (WBQ)
The Scientific Advisory Board for Quality Assurance (WBQ) was made up of international experts on epidemiology, sleep medicine, cardiology, industrial medicine, acoustics, psychology and noise impact research. The WBQ examined the design of the study as far back as November 2010, i.e. even before the scientific consortium had been selected. Since then the quality assurance body had been meeting regularly with the consortium, examining work reports, and advising on the selection of methods. When the individual NORAH sub-studies were concluded, the WBQ also examined the results and – where necessary – suggested further evaluations before the results were published.

The attack happens when the computer of the website owner, developer or server administrator is compromised and used to upload malicious content to his own website hosting server after gaining access to his ftp login credentials. Malicious code is embedded in html, PHP, ASP and Javascript files on the web server. Anyone visiting the website is subjected to the risk of being attacked themsleves just by browsing the site making the spread of GUMBLAR hard to control.
If you thinnk your site has been hacked, you will need to sort your site files by the latest modified date and then open some of the files and see if you can see whether any malicious script has been inserted.
The Gumblar script can be found either at the top of the pages, and may also be at the bottom of the web page. If your file has a closing HTML tag you may find the GUMBLAR code placed just below this eevn if it is in the middle of your file.
You can read more about Gumblar at :
How to fix the hack by Gumblar?
It should be noted that the infection due to Gumblar attack is not because to any web server vulnerability. Most hosting providers enforce stringent security measures to safeguard your data. The attack is perpetrated through stolen FTP login credentials. It transmits FTP information to the hacker's IP address, from an infected machine. This FTP information is then used to log in to the web server and infect the hosted website. So, the infection is not a server-wide exploit. It will only infect sites on the server that it has passwords to.
Below are the steps you can follow to fix your website :
1. Run a full anti virus scan over ALL machines that have FTP access to this site.
You should also run a scan with Malwarebytes Anti-Malware which is a free download.
2. Once the virus has been found please change ALL FTP passwords.
Possibly change them straight away actually and then change them again once the hack is locked down.
3. Open every infected file on your site and delete the hacker script.
Look for all files with the change date of the hacked date.
The script will either be at the top of the file, at the very bottom or it can be hidden in the middle near a closing HTML tag if there is one in the file.
4. Look for any file that should NOT be there. The GUMBLAR trojan also has been known to upload BACKDOOR files which provide access to the entire site even after the FTP details have been changed.Hey there! This post contains affiliate links. Using my links means I earn a commission, which helps me create more rad content. More on affiliates here.
Folks love to debate what “self-care” is, as a lot of companies have turned the term into a “Treat yourself!” party where you blow your 401K on face masks that use gold dust.
That’s a little dramatic, but you get me.
The Proper Care & Keeping of Me, Bri!!
So, instead of getting into a debate about what’s self-care, self-love and spoiling myself – I lump it all under the umbrella called, “The Proper Care and Keeping of Me, Bri.”
I am a high maintenance lady who goes to a spa almost monthly (pre-COVID), and these behaviors and practices help me live my best life!
Let’s get started!
Self-Care Tip #1: I Viciously Curate My Social Media Feeds
There’s a lot of learned victimhood and temper tantrums on the internet, and I don’t engage in any of that. I am here for social justice, but not whining! So, I give myself free reign to curate my online spaces – filling them with actionable knowledge, insightful discussions and ENCOURAGING CONTENT THAT LIGHTS MY SOUL UP.
Read that last part again.
I stay the HECK away from energetic vampires on social media – you know the ones! God invented the “Snooze for 30 Days” and soft-blocking for a reason. I unfollow/mute people who think money is evil, gay people are bad, who use social media as their personal complaint jar, etc.
Self-Care Tip #2: I Make My Bed Every Morning
Growing up, I rarely made my bed (don’t tell my parents I told you that!). It wasn’t until I reached my late twenties that I started making my bed, as a way to have a “Small Victory” at the beginning of the day.
It was hard to get in the habit of doing this (shoutout to the Streaks App for helping), and it makes such a difference!
Self-Care Tip #3: I Drop $$$$ on Skincare and Esthetician Services
I am not shy or embarrassed about this! I drop a GOOD CHUNK OF CHANGE on beautiful skin. From chemical peels and spa treatments to my daily routine, I invest in. myself and I treat myself!
No apologies!
Self-Care Tip #4: No “Guilty” Pleasures
I’m a bit of a hedonist, and I’m definitely a maximalist – and I refuse to feel embarrassed or ashamed about what I love. If I want that eclair, I’m going to buy it and enjoy every bite! If I want to do an outrageous photoshoot with a feather boa, I’m gonna do that!
I celebrate the things that give me pleasure!
I’ve gotten better at this, but I used to carry a whole lot of guilt around (shoutout to my Protestant background) for LOVING things. Silly fun things that make life AWESOME. I ask myself, “Is this really something to feel self-conscious about?”
Nope, it’s usually not!
Self-Care Tip #5: Ask myself, “Is this my problem to solve?”
I have a savior complex like you would NOT BELIEVE, and I often exhaust myself and fail to take care of myself in an effort to “help” others.
When it’s honestly just me avoiding my own crap.
Sound familiar?
When I feel the need to jump in with my super shero (yes, SHERO) cape on, I take a step back and ask, “Is this my problem to solve?” This keeps me from steamrolling people who don’t want the full force of my energy at that moment, and it keeps me in check.
It usually isn’t. <3
Self-Care Tip #6: Ask myself, “Will this matter at my funeral/ What do I want people to say about me at my funeral?”
When I’m feeling really anxious (which is… frequently), I ask myself this question to help add some perspective.
I know what I want people to say about me at my funeral, and I know how I want to make people feel around me. If I’m faced with an ethical dilemma or issue, this question helps me zoom out and stop hyperventilating.
Self-Care Tip #7: High Thread Count Bed Sheets
I discovered this accidentally, after staying in a friend’s guest bedroom. Y’ALL! LUXURY SHEETS ARE WHERE IT IS AT!! THEY WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE AND HAVE SAVED MY SLEEP SCHEDULE.
Love it.
Self-Care Tip #8: Saturday is Adulting Day (UGH)
I find adulting and planning super boring, but I know that until I can hire a personal valet and household manager – that I’m stuck with myself.
To deal with the (sometimes overwhelming) amount of adulting in my life, I’ve shoved it all to Saturday, AKA Adulting Day. This is the day that I clean my car, gas up my car, pay bills, do laundry, bleach my bathtub, call my grandma, call the sprinkler guy to come look at my lawn, and make a list of companies to call the next week.
If it’s boring and unglamorous and HAS to be done, it’s happening on Saturday. (More on my car ritual, here!)
Self-Care Tip #9: White Noise Machine FTW
Y’all, this bad boy CHANGED MY LIFE!! If you live with other people, or you wake up easily at night – THIS IS YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND.
I sleep better, and I work better, thanks to my white noise machine!
Self-Care Tip #10: Sunscreen 3-4X a Day
I keep bottles of sunscreen stashed in various places in my house, car and purse/work bag. I have an alarm on my phone that goes off every 3-4 hours, reminding me to reapply.
I’ve also trained my brain to put on sunscreen when I get in my car and buckle up.
Healthy skin is self-care!!!!
Self-Care Tip #11: Delete Social Media Apps Everyday
I love love LOVE the internet, and I love talking to people all day long. That said, it can get draining.
To get my brain right, I delete all social media apps from my phone at 8PM, and I don’t download them again until 10AM. I usually try to have 1 weekend day without ANY social media, only posting to my IG Story to connect with my readers!
This helps me have a more productive morning (I don’t sit on my phone in bed for an hour), and it helps me start and end my day with intention. I no longer wake up and reach for my phone to scroll through Facebook.
Okay, okay. I still do that – but the app isn’t there! So take THAT!

Since the climate here in Wilmington, North Carolina includes warm, humid weather throughout much of the year, many local residents have swimming pools on their property to cool off and stay comfortable. When you take a dip in a swimming pool after the sun has gone down, it’s important to have proper lighting within the pool to maintain a safe and enjoyable atmosphere. Swimming in a completely dark pool at night can be scary and even pose a safety threat as you won’t be able to see where you’re going or how to get in and out of the water. At Maguire Electric, we offer pool lighting services to brighten up your swimming pool and allow you to enjoy the water whenever the mood strikes, even after the sun goes down for the night.
Our team includes an experienced, licensed electrician who can handle a variety of pool lighting needs. We can add unique lighting elements to help your pool stand out, enhancing the visual appeal of your property. Our technicians also know how to utilize electrical connections and wiring properly when working around water, which is an important safety consideration. Pool lighting is something that should always be handled by an experienced and skilled electrician, as even a minor mistake could create a shock risk that puts anyone using the pool in danger. We’ll make sure that the lighting components in and around your pool are properly sealed for your protection and the longevity of the fixtures and wiring.
We’re available to handle pool lighting and other swimming pool and outdoor electrical needs in the Wilmington area. We can help you transform your existing pool into an oasis that you can use when it’s dark outside.Discovery Communications-owned U.S. net Destination America has set an April 5 premiere date for backwoods security series Prepper Hillbillies, which follows the Moss Group security team as it protects the communities of South Georgia.

New experiences can be scary for our new little patients, and for new parents! Explorer Pediatric Dentistry is welcoming to new patients and committed to providing a pleasant experience.
Baby’s Visit
New experiences can be scary for our new little patients, and for new parents! We are here to help reduce the anxiety of a first dental visit. The AAPD recommends, “The first examination is recommended at the time of the eruption of the first tooth and no later than 12 months of age.” We like to examine the little ones to assure new parents of normal growth and development. We provided a gentle examination of the teeth, jaw, gums and oral tissue often while your baby is still on your lap. We guide you in the best practices for healthy habits at home. Depending on your child’s comfort level and age, we may provide a gentle dental cleaning.
The first visit can help answer any questions you may have regarding your child’s oral health. Sometimes newborns are referred to our office for issues with the oral tissue development, such as tongue ties. We will examine your baby and help you make an informed decision on the best choices for you and your baby. Please fill out the New Patient Form and contact us for an appointment!
Transferring Patients
Explorer Pediatric Dentistry is always welcoming new patients. Please fill out the New Patient Forms. You may also have your previous dentist send any records and x-rays to our offices via Referrals. Please contact us for an appointment!
Special Needs Patients
Dr. Julie is specially trained in meeting the dental needs of children and young adults with special needs. When calling to make your child’s appointment, please let the staff know your child’s needs and any medications. The team at Explorer will help address any concerns and work to meet any arrangements your child may need, such as a room without distractions. You are welcome to schedule a complementary site visit to familiarize your child with the team, sites, and sounds of the office. This can help make the first visit less anxious and happier!
Emergency First Visit
Trauma to the head may need immediate attention. If your child is experiencing a life-threatening emergency, please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room. If your child faces a dental emergency that is not life-threatening, please call us immediately. Dr. Julie is dedicated to helping your child if an emergency should arise. She understands that urgency and efficiency in a traumatic incident can help prevent future problems.
Referral Patients
Sometimes your general or family dentist will refer your child to our office to take care of a certain need or problem. This may be to address cavities, infections, tongue ties or behavior issues. We are happy to help! Dr. Julie has specialized training in working with children, sometimes just being in a child-friendly environment may make the experience easier.. Explorer Pediatric Dentistry also offers nitrous oxide (also known as “laughing gas” or “happy air”) to ease minor anxiety for small procedures. And we offer in-office I.V. sedations with a mobile anesthesiologist for more significant dental fear or problems. After an examination, Dr. Julie and the team at Explorer can work with you to determine the best, safest, most comfortable option for you and your child!A pharmacy-led glycemic control program is linked to improved outcomes for surgical patients with diabetes and those who develop stress-induced hyperglycemia or high blood sugars, Ore.,.
- 69 percent less likely to have hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) in the three days following surgery.

First palm oil extracting plant in Nicaragua
This is the second investment of Palma San José Group in the country. With an investment amount of US$13 million, foreign company Extraceite S.A. inaugurated in 2016 its first palm oil extracting plant in Nicaragua. Located in El Rama, Nicaragua, 292 km east of the capital, Managua, Extraceite supplies both the local market as to other Central American countries, the United States and Mexico.
“Nicaragua is the country with the largest area available for the cultivation of palm oil. It has the most competitive costs in the agricultural sector, a solid legal framework and fiscal incentives for the long term.”
Ab. Rehman Shah
Before Prophet Mohammad (SAW) and Islam, there existed Issa Massaih and his deen Nasraniyat. Prior to Him was Hazrati Mossa and his Deen Yahodiyat. He got a terrible fight against Firown. Firown did not yield neither to Mossa nor even to Haroon Alihisalam. He fought back against the two and tried his best to take them out of their motherland – the people Bani Israyeel known as Sabti against the kabtis.
By the bestowed power of the Almighty and with the yadi baize the powerful stick of Mossa and his illuminated arm i..e Mojiza of Mossa. He got firown utterly defeated. Cruel Firown and his mob got miserably drowned in the river Neel in Egypt.
Firown accepted the powers of the Almighty but it was all in vain. He got sazaye garak in this world in river Neel and Sazai Harak (punishment of Harak – the burning fire in the world after death – jehanum. He will remain burning for ages together in Jehanum. Neither will he die nor will he have a bit of relief in the burning fire of Jehanum. Akhrat – the world after death.
What is the moral demand? It is a distinction between the right and wrong, good and bad – vice and virtue, correct and incorrect. By assuming these faculties we prepare a character. So a word, you reap a habit.
Sow a habit, you rap a character, sow a character, you rap a destiny. Character determines destiny.
What is the moral Demand? It is a distinction between right and wrong. The thought of right and wrong and the firm faith in it is purely the religious ideology or its averse.
In positive ways, it is to practise Islam if otherwise, it is to shun religion.
An enemy of the Almighty, it is said, his Mummy (dead body) will remain safe for the humans to come. It is as such a truth that remains safe. The truth that human life is subject to decay the truth survives – the false goes perished.
Islam teaches respect for all other religions.
What is moral Demand? It is a distinction between right and wrong. The thought of right and the firm faith in it is purely the religious ideology. It is to practise Islam and avoid its opposite side. An enemy of the Almighty as he thinks himself to be that his mummy (dead body) will remain safe for all the humans to come. Any living thing is subject to decay. Again it is obvious and visible that a strong power is behind this all and whole the universe that runs it all. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. All the skies and all the earths are there which are mentioned in the holy Quran. In the skies the angels are so innumerable that even a little space is not available there so as to obey the Almighty. The obedience of humans and P.D. Jins is not required by the Almighty except the fact that there is good to the doers who do it for their own. Do good, you would reap its reward. If you do evil, you would have its punishment.
Let us take a family. Herein father, mother, sons and daughters live. The parents, if belonging to any religion are to no religion at all, are compelled to teach their kids what is right and wrong. For their own safety and that of their own kids, they require to teach them what is good and bad, truth and false, to be careful or careless, beauty or ugliness in character – all such things require to be known and owned their right side instead of a wrong side. By doing so the family would grow peaceful and beneficial for themselves and for that of others – say for their neighbourhood – for the whole village and town in the large sense for the whole nation.
The expression is nothing but a religious one. Humans require religion. The prophets came to the world at different times. When the people found disturbance- the domination of vice wrong, falsehood and carelessness, the Almighty above sent different prophets to the concerned groups of the people. The Nasrani or the English people were provided and gifted with personalities like Hazrati Issa Alihi Salam. The Prophet was a big Mjiza for the people of Nasrani. A person, who took his birth from his sacred mother Hazrati Maryam without a father. As a Mojiza Issa Masaih got his birth from his mother without a father. He talked to the people even when he was in the lap of his mother in the cradle. Hazrati Gibreel Amin inspired Hazrati Maryam Alihi salam into her mouth and she became pregnant. Normally after nine months, Issa Massaih took his birth on the same day of his birth to the most wonder of the whole humanity, he talked to the people when Maryam Alihi salam was carrying her baby Issa Massaih to her concerned people and her family – Hazrati Imran Alihisala. On the same day of his birth Issa Massaih when he was in the cradle – in the lap of his mother Maryam began to talk to his People. He said to them, “ I have been sent as a Prophet to you people. The holy book Injeel Muqadas has been sent to me to give you the teachings of Injeet Muqadas. The people of Nasrani did not accept him as their Prophet. Instead they turned against him. According to Injeel Muqadas Issa Massaih with the help of Almighty gave full Eyesight to the people who were totally blind fifty thousand in a day!
Fifty thousand people got recovery in full by the wonderful treatment of Massaih in a single day, whose skin was deadly infectious. But the people of Nasrani did not accept him. In turn they opposed him. They conspired for his killing. But the Almighty saved him. The people prepared to hang him but could not. The almighty raised him to the skies. He will remain there living till Rozi Jaza. He will accept the Prophet Mohammad (SAW) as the final Prophet, peace be upon Him!
Towrat and Injeel Muqadas are the two holy books before Qurani Majeet. The two holy books Injeel and Towrat can not be practised by Nasrani and Yahoodi people and the people coming after them – the people – the followers of the holy Quran, will go by the blessed teachings from the Almighty Allah that came down on the Prophet Mohammad (SAW) as Wahi in the form of a sacred talk from Allah to Mohammad (SAW).
The Sacred and blessed talk of Allah and Mohammad (SAW) – the holy Quran – The sacred talk – the blessed one revolves around the whole humanity not only the Muslims but the teachings are meant even for the other people religious or not. It is good for good and bad for bad. Almala Walbanoona Zeenatul Hayatud Duniya wal baqyatus salihat.
The wealth, the sons and daughters, the wife all these are the worldly wealth and splendour that keeps shining but are transitory only for a short period of time. Lastly subject to Decay!.
I saw it written in the palms of my hand that flowers that keep shining – but sorry to say that they all go and wither away! Vanish away!
Everyone keeps some virtue or some vice but lastly disappears from the stage. If it is so, why not accept from the core of our hearts.
The dignity of the one, who controls this whole system, this whole universe, the all skies and earths and whatever is found in them. It is obviously obligatory for us all to accept his wonderful powers of governance that govern this whole system.
You will know the wonderful governance of the secret power that works behind this whole machinery – the universe – the Earths – the Skies and whatever is found in them. There is not even a little space available in the skies which is the seat of Angels obeying the Almighty. The humans and all the living beings live on the earth under the supreme authority of the one and one alone who is known to be the Almighty, who runs this whole system!

The mad scientists may have super-computers but as the slogan once went “GIGO” (=Guff in – Guff out). If they fed their computers with duff info they’ll get rubbish out. Christina Speight
Telegraph All those scientists may still be wrong By Martin Livermore Al Gore's film about climate change, An Inconvenient Truth, won two Oscars. Today, the Royal Society starts a two-day event showcasing the science of climate change according to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Both the film and conference are based on an understanding that the science is settled. It isn't. But, in the meantime, the environmental bandwagon rolls on, and no self-respecting politician wants to be left without a seat.
Over the past century, the average global temperature rose by about 0.6C. This doesn't sound a lot, but represents changes noticeable to all of us. At the same time, levels of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) in the atmosphere have also risen, due, almost certainly, to our increasing use of fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas. All else being equal, this would be expected to lead to some moderate warming, as experienced. The mainstream view, promulgated by the IPCC, is that this moderate warming is enhanced by the extra water vapour that higher temperatures put into the atmosphere.
This positive feedback leads, in theory, to a much greater temperature rise and has led to speculation about runaway global warming. But there are good reasons to believe that such a catastrophe is a remote possibility, rather than a near certainty. The rise in temperature has been far from smooth. The early decades of the 20th century showed a distinct warming trend, peaking in the 1930s. However, from the 1940s through to the early 1970s, temperatures fell - sufficiently for commentators to raise the spectre of global cooling as we slid into the next ice age.
A sudden jump in the mid-1970s heralded the return of a warming trend and led to the current concern about global warming. But peak temperatures were recorded in 1998; since then, we have had eight years with no warming. In the meantime, CO2 levels have risen inexorably. Since we cannot experiment to test the effect of this on climate, scientists rely on observation and, in parallel, produce mathematical models of how the climate system operates. These models - fed with a range of assumptions about how population and energy use may change - are run on the world's most powerful supercomputers to give projections for future climate changes. It is these on which tales of future catastrophe are based.
But the climate over the past century has not behaved as simple models predict. Scientists have tweaked the models to reproduce the stop/start pattern, by adding in the effect of volcanic eruptions and man-made sulphate aerosols. Because they can be made to simulate the actual pattern of 20th-century temperature change, the assumption is that they provide a good model of future changes. What the modellers do not explain are documented changes to the climate during recorded history.
During the Roman Warm Period, England was a significant wine producer, a thousand years later Greenland was settled and farmed during the Medieval Warm Period, and harvests failed and ice fairs were held on the frozen Thames in the Little Ice Age of the 17th and 18th centuries. None of it was a result of man-made CO2 emissions. The answer may lie in the ultimate source of warmth and life on Earth: the sun. Solar activity varies in a cyclic way, with sunspots being an obvious sign of changes. The more spots, the more active the sun. On a simple level, we know that the Little Ice Age coincided with a very low level of solar activity. We also know that the sun is currently in a particularly active phase.
The IPCC's view is that these changes are too small to cause the climate changes we have seen. But there is another factor, about which they are equally dismissive: variations in the sun's magnetic field can have a significant effect by influencing cloudiness. It has been suggested that high energy cosmic rays, which arrive at the Earth's surface all the time, could induce cloud formation. Recently, experiments have shown that this can happen. And clouds, as we are all aware, have a major effect on temperatures. The hypothesis is that the more intense magnetic field of an active sun shields the Earth from some of the rays. So, if we have a more active sun, we should have fewer clouds and higher temperatures. This is not fully tested, but seems as plausible a mechanism for climate variation as the greenhouse effect. Knowledge of solar cycles may be a better guide.. ---------------------------------------- € Martin Livermore is author of 'Climate Change: a Guide to the Scientific Uncertainties', published by the Centre for Policy StudiesAbstract.

Unfortunately the club handicappers were a bit shocked at Alan Kelly turning up to race A grade that they missed the burglars, Fergus and Paul Evangelinedes slipping in quietly to C grade. Paul was last spotted having a go off the front of A grade at Lansdowne a week back with the Vets.
Due to the large numbers the grades were split with 2 B grades and 2 C grades, 1 A grade and 1 D grade.
There is a story (substantiated) that Roger Shackleton will run nude down the street if Alan turns up to race. Be warned those who live in Harbord.

Everyone, including the small kids, would love to travel. The mere idea of going out for a picnic or outing and having fun brings excitement into everyone’s mind. People dream of around the world; however, not everyone can afford the world tour’s finances. Some people with the excellent financial condition make their dream come true, but for those who do not have unlimited finances, ‘budget travel’ is the best option. As money is the significant deciding factor while planning the vacations, chalking out your budget and planning according to your finances is the wisest thing to do.
Grab The Best Deals:
Many websites offer various discount coupons on booking air tickets, hotel rooms, etc. Find such websites and get some relief for your pocket. Many hotels give considerable discounts on group bookings. Visit Delta Airlines Reservations to get amazing best deals on vacation packages around the world.
Compare various travel agencies’ prices and offer before booking your vacation. This way, you can stick to the idea of budget travel and save money. Give a thought to the travel insurance so that, unfortunately, if you lose your luggage or any valuables while on vacation, the insurance money can cover up at least some of your loss.
Plan In Advance:
Book your tickets and make hotel reservation two to three months in advance. This way, you can save up some money as most airlines and hotels give enormous discounts for bookings. You can begin saving some components of your monthly income for your holiday. You’re likely in the future to don’t feel the pinch all of a sudden.
Keep Your Eyes Wide Opened:
Keep one thing in mind while shopping once you reach your holiday destination. Many items are available at much cheaper rates in the shops near your home. So do your shopping, keeping your eyes open, and do not shop just for the sake of it. When you are in the market and like something, think twice before buying it, see whether it is necessary and useful, or it will stay at the bottom of the cupboard the moment you reach back home. Please do not buy the things that are too heavy or space-consuming as it will be troublesome for you to carry it back home. Instead, you will unnecessarily spend extra, and your budget might collapse. Stick to your account to avoid financial burden after your vacation.
Traveling on a Budget
Some people think that to travel and see the world; you have to stay in a 5-star hotel every night, eat at the fanciest restaurants, see every attraction that the city offers, and buy a suitcase full of souvenirs to take home. Real travelers know that this is not the case. Sure, traveling can be expensive, but there are quite a few painless ways to make a wonderful, memorable vacation within your reach.
When to go
Travel seasons have a vast range in prices, depending on when you go. If you want to go during peak season, you are going to pay for it. Just remember that “off-season” doesn’t mean that it is a wrong time to go; it usually just means that you will get more value for your money with fewer people thrown in. It may still be a fantastic trip, possibly even better than ordinary, considering you don’t need to worry so much about cash or audiences.
How to get there
It used to be that driving was always the cheapest way to get places, but with rising fuel costs, that isn’t still the case anymore. Be sure to do your research to calculate gas costs before assuming driving would be the most economical. Should you wind up flying, make sure you look around, such as budget airlines, to receive the ideal cost. Consider flying on non-peak days or at non-peak times to get the best price. (Yes, this includes taking the dreaded red-eye!)
Where to stay
When you get to your destination, staying at the Four Seasons isn’t the only option. Think about places where you can stay with friends or family for a few days; that way, you can visit and get a free place to stay. (Always remember to be a good house guest though to ensure you remain friends!) Another option is doing a home exchange where a family would stay in your house while you are in their place. It’s an excellent way to observe the region you’re visiting through a neighborhood’s eye, not pay for resorts in any way.
How to get around
Grabbing a cab each time that you wish to go anyplace can consume your money pretty quickly. If you’re in a city using public transit, look at carrying that as your principal point of transport. Conquering the public transit system in another place gives you a feeling of triumph like no other. If you’ve to lease a car for a holiday, shop around to find the best price and see whether there are some coupons on the market or revenue running in the time before you reserve it.
What to do
Once you are at your destination, don’t think that you have to see every attraction there. Pick and choose based on your family’s wants and needs and remember there are heaps of free or cheap Items in many cities such as museums, churches, and national parks, which may be a wonderful idea to spend the afternoon.I see from a post by dear Fausta that quadriplegic cartoonist John Callahan died on Saturday of complications of quadriplegia and respiratory problems. FYI, most quads can move their arms but lack dexterity in their hands. If you are wondering what kinds of complications quadriplegia has, he could have gotten sepsis from a pressure sore or a urinary tract infection (from his bladder stoma, catheter, tubing or catheter bag). Quadriplegia can make it hard to cough, which you need to do to clear your lungs, so that could have caused respiratory problems. Or the person reporting his death thought he had respiratory problems when really he had the death rattle common at the end of life.
Years ago I read Callahan’s first autobiography, He Won’t Get Far on Foot. He was unsparing of himself in writing about his life. The passages that come to my mind the most often were about the difficulty of getting a quadriplegic person dressed in pants and getting the creases and seams where they belong — I thought of that every time I dressed my late life partner, Margaret Ardussi, who was quadriplegic the last 10 years of her life due to MS — and the foods he could afford with his food stamps — beans were a staple.
If you understand the battle of the severely depressed to live just one more day — day after day — then you will get John’s song about how even the smallest waves of joy, and ordinary beauties, nourish the soul enough to regenerate the resolve to live. It is piercingly beautiful. (If you currently have depression, do NOT listen to this song, instead immediately click the “Humor” category in this blog and get the hell out of this post. Or scroll down to “I don’t know why he swallowed the fly” — FAST! NOW! GO!)
Update, 7/28/2010: I guess it makes sense that dear, irreverent Kathy Shaidle also was a fan of John Callahan’s. Do go to her place and read what she’s got, but also check out a story she links with the great headline, “Tales from the Crip,” especially if you were wondering about who dyed his hair. It’s not the kind of thing you notice unless you’ve lived with quadriplegia, but Callahan did NOT have the most appropriate wheelchair for his mobility, so it’s no wonder the one he had hurt his back and required him to be bedridden most of the time — he should have been in a tilt-in-space/recliner chair with electric leg lifts. Then he could have changed positions for pressure relief.I can order my employees CRB checks online at anytime

2019 BMW 320i xDrive M-Sport Sal BMW 320i xDrive M-Sport Saloon Auto seen in Mineral Grey Metallic with Black Verna Leather featuring Grey contrast stitching.
BMW continue to lead the way in the premium saloon car sector with the New model G20 3 Series saloon. If you close your eyes and think of what a BMW looks like this is the car that would appear in your mind.
It looks elegant and aggressive at the same time. It drives like a sports car but can accommodate 5 adults and all of the luggage with ease. It is finished in typical Germanic fashion with excellent build quality and painted in very traditional Mineral Grey Metallic.
Being an M-Sport Model you get an BMW M developed aerodynamic body styling kit, 18" B-colour M Double Spoke Alloy Wheels and Sports Front Seats.
In the past owning a BMW or any premium saloon car in the winter meant walking when it snowed as a slippery road surface + rear-wheel-drive chassis = not getting anywhere fast very easy.
Not so in this car as it is equipped with BMW's xDrive transmission AKA 4-Wheel Drive. This means that adverse weather or driving across different road surfaces is no problem. An xDrive car also has a slightly elevated ride height which means that it actually feels better to drive on most 'Manx' roads.
This car is presented in great condition and benefits from a full BMW service history and with just 11,670 miles.
The full specification of this car includes:
- LED Headlights
- 18" Bi-Colour M-Double Spoke Alloy Wheels
- Privacy Glass
- Front & Rear Parking Sensors
- Reversing Assist Camera

2021.11.26 23:29 Averted_Vision Alt+Tab out when in orbit can't tab back in bug
Hi I've just updated to windows 11 pro from windows 10 as when i updated my bios it locked me out of my pc by not allowing me to enter my pin at the log on screen, so went ahead and installed windows 11 as I was getting game stutters anyways from using a Radeon 6700xt so thought i may as well go ahead with it. To cut a long story short now my game continues to play in the background when i ALT+TAB out but i cant return to the game. Can hear the game continue and especially know this is fact as i can hear it in crucible when i die LUL. I've tried disabling full screen optimizations in the destiny2.exe, tried without intelligent standby list. Funny thing when i turned that off at first the game allowed me bk into crucible match but now it's not doing that work around anymore. only worked once though.

2021.11.26 23:29 pyl3r Why is English so inconsistent in its written form?
Sorry if this question has been asked before or doesn’t make sense, but I’m trying to sleep and I just can’t get this out of my head, so here goes:
In « how » the « h » is nothing silent, yet in « hour » the « h » is silent, at first I thought that was just because of how the « h » interacts with the « ou »/« ow » diphthongs, yet then there’s « house » on which the « h » isn’t silent, yet has the same diphthong as « hour ».
At the same time, « where » and « whore » start with the same two letters, yet in the former we pronounce the « w » sound while the « h » is silent, and in the latter, we pronounce the opposite. Why is that? What’s wrong with English?
P. S: If i put the wrong flair feel free to correct me so that I can change it. Cheers.

I played back at beta and launch and then for some time thereafter with long breaks here and there. Haven't played for several years though. Back at launch, and for a little bit after, getting skill points from certain delves and bosses were bugged. Sometimes you wouldn't get one, and sometimes you could get as many as you wanted, as from a particular boss. Does anyone know if the characters from that time were ever "fixed"? Are skill points now calculated by an achievement like tracking system, so no matter what happened back then it would be correct now?

Abstract
Introduction: Majority of bilateral shoulder dislocations are posterior. Simultaneous bilateral anterior shoulder dislocations and bilateral anterior fracture-dislocations are rare and mostly of traumatic origin. We present a rare case of bilateral anterior shoulder dislocation with symmetrical greater tuberosity fracture following an episode of seizure with an unusual injury mechanism which was treated conservatively.
Case Report: A 45 year old office worker presented to the Casualty of our hospital with bilateral anterior shoulder dislocations with greater tuberosity fractures following an episode of seizure. Both shoulders were reduced by Kocher manoeuvre using total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) & were strapped to the chest for 6 weeks. At the end of 1 year follow-up, there were no reasonable loss of strength or restriction of motion and the shoulders were defined as stable.
Conclusion: Although bilateral shoulder dislocations are mostly posterior, bilateral anterior dislocations may not be as rare as previously thought and are frequently missed by the orthopaedic residents in the casualty department. Further to the best of our knowledge, our case represents the first case of bilateral anterior shoulder dislocation with symmetrical greater tuberosity fracture with an unusual mechanism of injury following an episode of seizure in a young male patient that was successfully managed by conservative means.

I’ve been clicking around some of the neato felt embroidery I’ve seen pinned lately, and decided to make a fun felt stuffie from a tracing of one of my longboard fins.
Certified DANK
Acrylic felt is pretty cheap, and if you can find the type made from recycled soda bottles, extra eco-hippie-surfer cred points for you. I also used basic embroidery thread and some poly stuffing. All can be found at any local craft store.
My supplies
Tracing the fin template
I went crazy cutting out shapes to sew on
Makin’ flowers
Adding in detail
Chain stitching the vines
I even added beads!
Blanket stitching the two sides together
I didn’t overstuff
I crocheted the edge and added a hang loop
Finished edge
Completed Stuffie!
So this is purely for fun, so I’m going to put it on the cool felt Lei I made for TikiMan a while back. It’s like a funky fresh headpiece:
Can you dig it???
I can see myself making a few of these little felt stuffies for kicks, especially in the afternoons since it’s been so freakin’ hot here. I mean, I did find an image on Pinterest that sums up Florida surfing perfectly…..
Do you think the wax is still good???

According to the German source Sport1, November could be the month in which VW brands Audi and Porsche make the official decision to enter F1 for the new engine era from 2026.
The report claims Red Bull could tie up with Porsche power, with Audi then supporting McLaren.
Red Bull’s Marko doesn’t deny it, even though the energy drink owned camp is pushing ahead with its own engine subsidiary Red Bull Powertrains to handle the post-Honda period.
“First of all, we want to make sure that we can stand on our own two feet with our ambitious project,” said the 78-year-old Austrian.
“Partners are then of course welcome to join us,” he added.Proposed Changes to PIPEDA May Affect Balance between Intellectual Property Owners and Individual Privacy
April 25, 2014
By Jennifer McKenzie and Tamara Céline Winegust
A Bill, short-titled the "Digital Privacy Act", was introduced in the Senate on April 8, 2014. It amends various sections of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), which governs the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by private sector organizations for commercial purposes.
PIPEDA provides that in certain enumerated circumstances, private companies are permitted to disclose personal information without consent. Section 7(3) currently allows non-consented-to disclosure in some limited circumstances, including where the disclosure is required to comply with a court order (subsection 7(3)(c)), and where the disclosurfe is made to an investigative body or to the government under the reasonable belief that the information relates to a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada (subsection 7(3)(d)).
An amendment to subsection 7(3) in the Digital Privacy Act expands the scope of the permitted exceptions, by allowing private sector organizations to disclose personal information to each other without consent if the disclosure is “reasonable for the purposes of investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada” (proposed section 7(3)(d.1)). The proposed section further stipulates that the disclosing organization must reasonably expect that seeking consent to the disclosure would compromise the investigation.
This proposed new exception is interesting given the recent Federal Court decision in Voltage Picture LLC v. John Doe and Jane Doe, 2014 FC 161. In Voltage, a film production company, Voltage, brought a copyright infringement action in Federal Court against internet customers who allegedly copied and distributed Voltage's films without authorization. Voltage did not have contact information for any of the customers (the "Does"), and sought that information from a third-party Internet Service Provider, TekSavvy. TekSavvy refused to disclose the information forcing Voltage to motion the Federal Court for a Norwich Order—a litigation tool compelling a third-party to disclose certain information that only the third-party possesses.
In granting the order, Prothonotary Aalto stressed the need to balance Voltage's rights to enforce their copyright and the privacy rights of the TekSavvy customer:
“ in similar cases, Prothonotary Aalto ordered TekSavvy to disclose personal information but limited it to names and mailing addresses of identified customers and imposed a number of conditions on Voltage’s use of that information to protect against Voltage acting as a "copyright troll" by intimidating customers into settlements through demand letters and litigation threats. One of the conditions required Voltage to first submit any demand letters it plans to send to those customer to the Court for approval.
If it comes into force, the proposed new exception to PIPEDA may have allowed TekSavvy to disclose the information sought by Voltage without judicial intervention and oversight. Further, the proposed exception may have allowed TekSavvy to share more than just the names and addresses of customers. Section 7(3)(d.1) may be a potential benefit to copyright and other intellectual property owners by obviating the need to seek a court order to obtain otherwise protected personal information from a third-party where the prescribed conditions exist.

Shakespeare’s plays are full of battles dominated by men, but one of his most compelling speeches about the life of a soldier comes from a woman: Lady Percy in Henry IV, Part 1, speaking to her husband, Hotspur.
When Hamlet first encounters his father’s ghost, the Danish prince’s reactions reflect Shakespeare’s understanding of the theological differences between early modern Catholics and Protestants regarding the spiritual realm, says David Scott Kastan.
Transparencies, popular in the late 1700s, use back-lighting to reveal a secret image. See one from the Folger collection that reveals Shakespeare’s ghost in Westminster Abbey.
Illustrated editions of the Complete Works would have been the first encounter with Shakespeare that many Victorian readers would have had.Description

From a statement presented to London Yearly Meeting by a committee appointed by young men of enlistment age present at Yearly Meeting 1915:
Christ demands of us that we adhere, without swerving, to the methods of love, and therefore, if a seeming conflict should arise between the claims of His service and those of the State, it is to Christ that our supreme loyalty must be given, whatever the consequences. We should however remember that whatever is our highest loyalty to God and humanity is at the same time the highest loyalty that we can render to our nation.25 June 2019 How Swarm Electrification Can Draw in Swarms of People June 25, 2019 Author: Karishma Fatiha Blogs bottom-up approach microgrid off-grid energy solar energy swarm electrification While Bangladesh has a reputation of one of the fastest growing economies, one of the sectors where the progress is stagnant is the renewable energy industry.<a href="">This</a> is a fantasy baseball preview of the Brewers on ESPN.com.

Announcement: The history of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is often told as one of revolution or turmoil before the market reforms changed the course and the country’s economic rise began. Yet, despite the ruptures, one constant remained: the rule of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The Party transformed itself repeatedly after taking power in 1949, during the socialist phase until the mid-1970s, the intermittent or transitional reform phase until the mid-1990s, and the capitalist phase since. In each phase, the PRC’s development was pushed by a dynamic of social struggles from below followed by countermeasures of the CCP regime—a mix of repression, concession, cooptation, and reform. Eventually, capitalism emerged in the PRC not in spite of or against socialism, but because of (this) socialism.
These arguments are at the core of Ralf Ruckus’s book The Communist Road to Capitalism. How Social Unrest and Containment Have Pushed China’s (R)evolution since 1949. He breaks with orthodoxies about the PRC’s socialist “successes” and myths on its later rise as an economic power. His book combines a historiography of workers’, peasants’, migrants’, and women*’s struggles with a critique of exploitation, authoritarian state power, and gender discrimination under socialism and capitalism.
In this online discussion, Ralf elaborates on the book’s main arguments and discusses what we can learn from the PRC experience for a left-wing strategy that avoids past mistakes.

My upcoming contemporary romance, Memories of You from Lachesis Publishing, has a summer-bar-party theme.
What happens when a big-city Cinderella trades her shattered glass slipper for a pair of FMP stilettos? That’s how Zoe Anderson chooses to cope after her husband’s murder, her brutal rape. But it’s been three years, and her persistent psychotic episodes now threaten her job. Her shrink says to reboot: start over, return to an earlier, happier time. So she’s headed upstate where she spent summers as a kid. Zoe’s inherited her aunt’s lakeside cottage in the mountains—perfect timing—but finds it, like her life, in shambles.
Playboy Jason Rolland appears to have everything—a successful business, his own radio show, and all the beach babes he can handle. His resort has Zoe’s childhood vacation home landlocked, and now he wants the rest—razed. He’s already erased every other trace of his own false-perfect childhood, one that convinced Jason true love doesn’t exist, and that he’s destined to follow in his father’s unfaithful footsteps.
Zoe finds herself a reluctant guest at Lakeview Lodge. She befriends the elegant Jamaican bartender, Jade, and when Jason’s womanizing ways chases off Jade’s summer help, Zoe steps up. She tended bar nights while she was in college, and she can’t think of a better way to keep busy and rewind her life to happier times.
But Jason has his sights set on Zoe, and quickly succumbs to jealousy as he watches her flirt with bar patrons . . .
Excerpt from Memories of You, Book 1 in The Lake George Series:
~~~
Jason drained his glass and slammed it down on the table. He waved at the waitress, who hesitated when she saw him. She cast a worried glance over her shoulder, then disappeared into the bar. A few moments later, it was Jade who rounded the corner and stood there, glaring.
“What the hell is the matter with you, Mon?” Jade’s hands were rolled into tight fists on her hips. Standing over him as she was, Jason could swear she’d grown to nine feet tall. And she seemed to be wavering just a little. Or was that his eyes? Yes, perhaps it was. The flowers on her blouse were…moving. Swaying in the breeze. But there’s no wind in here. Jason chuckled and swiped a hand over his face.
I think four double vodkas might be my limit.
“So how’s Zoe’s real estate negotiations going? You’d think…” he hiccuped, “you’d think as the other interested party in this venture, I’d have been involved, wouldn’t ya?” Jason found it difficult to make the words come out without spitting. His tongue felt lazy, swollen.
Wow, vodka is a wonderful anesthetic. Makes talking a little challenging, though. But it’s a very effective painkiller. I don’t feel nearly as bad now as I did earlier.
Jade was scowling at him, shaking her head. “You’re drunk on your ass.”
“Don’t you look at me like that, big sister. I’m a grown man. I can drink as much as I want.” With his head tipped back, struggling to keep his eyes focused on Jade’s face, he was feeling a little dizzy.
Wow, she’s really tall tonight.
Jason tried to stand up. Jade’s hand came down on his shoulder and slammed him back into his seat.
“No scenes. This is my place of business too. You just keep your sorry ass right there in the chair.” She turned and motioned for one of the waitresses. “Go tell Claude we need some help out here,” she murmured when one drew near.
“I’m not hungry,” Jason sputtered. “What the hell do I need Claude for?”
But there he was, appearing as if out of nowhere right beside Jade. The man, whose mass was always intimidating, looked even bigger to Jason.
It’s like Alice in Wonderland. Everybody is either bigger or taller.
Jason chuckled at the thought, and was struggling to form the words around his lazy tongue when Jade said, “Claude, Mr. Rolland isn’t feeling well tonight. Can you please help him up to his cabin?”
Claude reached to untie his stained, cook’s apron, but Jade laid a hand on his arm.
“Better leave that on. We’ll get you a clean one when you get back,” she murmured.
“I’m not ready to go to my cabin,” Jason began. He planted both hands on the table and tried again to stand. “I need to have some words with our pretty little barmaid.”
But before the words were out of his mouth, he felt Claude’s bulbous arm hook his rib cage and lift him to his feet.
Man, this guy’s strong. And fast. We’re moving way too fast.
The whole room was swaying now, and the movement made Jason’s stomach lurch. He just couldn’t seem to keep his feet moving fast enough to keep up with Claude’s pace. His toes kept scraping along the floor, bumped over the doorstep, and then thumped down the steps to the parking lot.

By Stefano Liessi
Let’s face it, many of us just don’t know what we don’t know. At times this can be a very scary reality in our collision world. We probably are tired of hearing the preaching of OEM procedures and ADAS calibrations etc. Fact is, it is new to us and not going away anytime soon.
So, what can we do about it? Well, if you cannot beat it … join it! Learn it and be the Master of It.
Okay, master may be a stretch, how about we learn to understand it. There has been an onslaught of new technology, some that even affect standard repair methods such as welding and refinish procedures, not to mention management and process advancements. A lot to choose from, with many avenues to get the training from, I-CAR, suppliers, banner representation, and (of course) consulting firms.
“When will I ever find the time?!” you ask. Well, I hope as you read this, by the grace of medical science, that things will be back to normal and this will be a more applicable question, however, I am guessing that due to human nature this will not be the reality and reality will be; we are living on “COVID” time, to paraphrase the great Eric Clapton.
Now the fact is you may be saying that everything is slow or lacking, such as work, finances, and staff. What if I were to suggest that this is the optimum time to implement some training and development into your business—somewhat the approach of a snake oil salesman.
Take a moment and think about this rationally before you scream at the delivery person. Some of the greatest detractors—nicer way of saying excuses—of implementing training is the cost, the time, and the time to implement the said training. We have already addressed the “time” aspect as we have been graced this rare commodity due to COVID, but what about the cost? Well, due to the availability of time, and the human instinct to help each other from finding we on the ledge of a 14-storey building, many opportunities have opened with offerings at reduced and (at times) free courses.
We know this will not last forever—however, let’s look at the possibility you will be faced with the burden of full cost courses. At this moment you have most likely weeded your staff down to a skeletal framework, keeping who you feel are your top players on board as much as you are able to. Ergo a lesser outlay of funding.
This scenario would suggest that these key players are worthy of your sacred training dollars, and if be said, are also worthy of sharing the newfound information with others upon return. It should be acknowledged that good training or education is invaluable to your business, this is a slow, but much needed return on your investment. With the situation being what it is, a focus to the training and learning from your staff should be very achievable, to the point of being virtually uninterrupted, not to mention the ability, sad as it may be, to accomplish this mighty task during work hours on a Monday to Friday availability.
Implementing the newfound knowledge, you have invested in your staff is also one of the detractors I see often when I hold sessions. How on earth am I going to implement this with so much to do in the day? Well once again, now you are reading this there is a good chance that things are not back to normal, and you will still be on COVID time. This is really a bonus in a less than favourable way.
The art of implementing training to get the best return on investment requires three key fundamentals that rely on one sacred ingredient: commitment + dedication + implementation by trial = time. With this time you can roll out new ideas and tweak them to perfection with minimal interference in your day to day business. In doing this, you can ensure your training dollars are not in vain. In retrospect, you should see a return on your investment in one form or another. This would be a win-win for all involved.
I realize that much of this training or upgrading is online and has its limitations, but this is where you need to tweak and tune the material, utilizing the available time. Once you see the effects of your efforts, you will understand the benefits of training.
What about when things turn to normal? I believe we will take something from this less than pleasant experience. We will develop a new appreciation for time and effort. We will develop a stronger appreciation for new knowledge and the art implementing it into our business. We will see that patience is a virtue, and well worth waiting it out. We will also get back to live training and realize the benefits of human interaction versus the virtual world. Webinars are nice and have a place, however, they are limited and have been abused to the point of lacking significance for many. It really is far more productive to learn in a room filled with peers experiencing live interaction and engagement.
In my opinion, and you are entitled to my opinion, things will get back to an even better than normal pace filled with wiser individuals with a new level of appreciation for knowledge.
As a Red Seal technician and the founder of Canadian Collision Specialist, Stefano Liessi enhances his experience with 12 years of I-CAR instructing coupled with high school teaching to bring you training that encompasses all learning types. Having experienced the corporate side of the industry, along with management and ownership, Stefano’s focus is, getting it right the first time with proper repairs, equitably, for all the people involved in the collision industry.

“Why is Christianity growing in some countries but declining in others?” That’s the question Wes and Travis discuss in today’s Bible study. According to an article by Nilya Saiya, the answer is “political privilege.” Saiya argues that it is not governmental persecution, but rather governmental support that is one of the biggest threats to the growth of Christianity in a country. Saiya reports, “As governmental support for Christianity increases, the number of Christians declines significantly.”
In other words, when the government favors Christianity, giving special privileges and protections to Christians, one might think it would cause Christianity to grow. However, the opposite seems to be the case. Christianity almost always declines in such environments.
Saiya outlines three paradoxes: pluralism, privilege, and persecution. In this episode, part one, we discuss pluralism and privilege. In part two, we will discuss persecution. What does the Bible say about these so-called paradoxes? Does the Bible support the idea that political privilege is not something Christians should pursue? Does Christianity really grow best in environments where is it not favored?
We hope you enjoy this Bible study and discussion.

By Ademola Adegbamigbe
Nigerians will mark another June 12 or Democracy Day tomorrow, 12 June 2021.
After Ibrahim Babangida annulled the June 12,1993 presidential election, an Interim Government was set up, headed by Chief Ernest Shonekan. However, on 17 November, 1993, General Sani Abacha overthrew Shonekan.
While some claimed that the former ING President resigned voluntarily, not a few Nigerians are ready to swear by Sango and Amadioha combined that Shonekan threw in the sponge when the cold snout of a gun was pointed at his temple by a soldier with twitching mustache. With knee jack reaction, Shonekan resigned, thinking that his children and wife, Margaret, still needed him badly!
What happened was actually predicted by the late Chief MKO Abiola, winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election.
By the time the late Chief MKO Abiola was fighting to retrieve his electoral mandate, the annulled 12 June, 1993 presidential election, former military President, Ibrahim Babangida IBB left Abacha behind deliberately, for Abacha to take over under what I later believed was called turn-by-turn.”
How did he know that? TheNEWS probed Abiola further and he argued: ...”
Below is the Abiola interview in full, entitled:
Now, I am Ready for The Worst
When the Chief of General Staff, Lt. General OladipoDiya). You see we are in a continuous colonialism, a local imperialism of a cult, a small group, I mean 99 percent of the armed forces have never taken part in politics. Only this small group, who have forced themselves not only to the country but first of all on the armed forces. It’s not because they are very brilliant. I mean Abacha did not pass the staff college. If he did it should have been in front of his name: Psc which means that here is an officer who is not really expected to have been promoted a Lt.Col. He became General and even…..
When I asked him, I said wait, put yourself in my position, Sani, how can I be sleeping and people are waking you up. I was the one voted for, how could you make yourself head of the state. He said you see, I know, but I want to rule. Why wouldn’t he want to rule when he could become a General without passing the staff college. These people…they won’t do anything and I told you that day. It may look that he is doing it, but he will not do it and by the grace of God he won’t do it. You see, Yorubas say if you give a ram to a masquerade, you give the ram together with the rope. NADECO is the body you should talk to about the actualization of the mandate. What is there in stock for the Nigerian people by going for the mandate, I can discuss that the policies and everything is being reviewed from time to time. I did a detailed work on my way to Johannesburg and back. I can make a copy of it available to you. These are things that are mine. I just didn’t wake up one day and say I want to become president of Nigeria. I wrote Farewell to Poverty in my own handwriting, the draft of which is still in this house. I sent it to the party for review. Of course, many of them didn’t even read it. But you see, if I want to do something there has to be a purpose to it. What is the conclusion: We have already seen it. Forty years ago, the vogue was free education, we didn’t have a single drop of oil for export then. Today it is school fees everywhere.
But for scholarship, I wouldn’t have had education. I wouldn’t have been where I am today. So here are people who are blocking the opportunities, the gateway to our future. When they say violence, they are doing violence to everybody – in the markets, the woman selling on the streets or on the road is being waylaid, you know. People are stealing, naked stealing, just because they carry these guns. ‘Ten years ago, Sani Abacha said that hospitals had become consulting rooms, they have now become mortuaries. Thousands of people are dying every day. Nobody wants blood but everybody wants new born baby. So, you see, when he took power, before then I sent him a paper. The Way forward. He said I should give it to Diya. I gave it to Diya. I sent it through Senator Tinubu to Diya. Diya assured me he gave a copy, he gave the thing to him. But after his broadcast when I saw him, he denied Diya ever gave him the thing. Okay anyway, he didn’t give him the thing. But you said you want to form this government, what type of government ? He said he wants a government of big names. I said what does that mean? He said look at Jakande….like Awolowo did, like Awolowo with Gowon. I said there was no election, then. You can’t have Hamlet without the Prince. I was the one elected. There is no big name anymore. Until the next election, the only name is mine….It’s like wanting to be a Christian without believing in Jesus. Oh Paul was his good apostle, he wrote many epistles to the Corinthians , to Galatians to Ephesians and all that. But he’s not Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ did not have to write a single epistle to anybody. Of course, sermon on the mountain: blessed are the peacemakers for they shall see God and all that. He was the apostle of God, He was the prophet of God like Mohammed Sheikh Ibn Ali Abubakar and all that. They are all very important . There is no big name in presidential politics apart from the flagbearer who won the election. But the guy didn’t want to be politically educated. So, I said let me call my people who supported me throughout the country and ask them whether they want me to abandon the mandate. No, he said once the military do a coup, that is the end of the whole thing. Let me find out from the Nigerian people first, if they agree. I don’t know if you were there at that meeting. I asked them and they said no way. Hold on to the mandate. So at that point I would have expected Kingibe to say No, count me out of this mandate Oh! Bla…..Bla….. Bla…. But he got up to make some statements that when it is time for him to make up his mind, he will be accountable to his conscience and his God.
But what he said was that you had previously met Abacha before his (Kingibe’s) appointment.
A: It’s not true. Wait, I met Abacha before the coup and I sent him The Way Forward. A copy of it will be made available to you. Get it from Bola Tinubu. You will see how I itemize how he will call Nwosu, declare the results, reassemble the tribunals and all that. That was the only way forward.
But apparently, you didn’t discuss it with Kingibe and if you did, it wasn’t clear because in the interview we had with him…..
A: Wait, wait, wait. How can I, why will I not discuss with Kingibe? Kingibe knew that our own agenda was to actualize my mandate without bloodshed. And part of the agenda was that this guy will take over the government and finish what is left of the Interim Government by the end of March in the meantime while we form our own government. In fact, that was my own understanding. That was why I wrote to him. You will get a copy of it.
And he made a broadcast which did not reflect that: So I said what is happening? You asked me to bring a proposal. He said it was not given to him. Then I asked Diya, Diya told me it was a lie he gave it to him. I believe Diya. Then later I said wait, how do you now want to form a government after an election has been held and you are not the one elected? He said you see, when coup comes,….. I said well, okay, let me find out from the people who elected me. Their leaders will come and meet me. You said I shouldn’t have meetings, I want permission to hold a meeting, that I was reporting back to him the following day. The meeting took place on Sunday till about one o’clock in the morning. The first question I put to them: Do we surrender our mandate? They said no way. Those in favour of surrendering our mandate should raise their hands. Nobody did. Those who want us to uphold the mandate, everybody did including Kingibe himself. Do we deal with these characters now? Eighty percent said No. they said what do I think? If we cook a pot of soup and said we should all come with our plates, he will give us bit by bit. Where I come from I will not bring any place to the person. That is what these characters want us to go and do. There was a loud ovation for that analogy. But still I said those who say …Then Kingibe said if we don’t follow Yar’aAdura, people will go in and monopolise this again. I said for how long? Shonekan’s one lasted 82 days. This one will probably last 10 days. It’s only if we join them can they last six, seven months. Even those who join will regret doing so. Because you cannot be a democrat and become a servant of a dictator. They said Chief Awolowo did the same thing. I said this is rubbish, it was an emergency situation then. The ship of state was virtually adrift. The only man came in and rescued it. When he saw the army still wanted to stay put, he abandoned it. He abandoned the thing for them. He was doing a national duty. We are not in such situation now.
What explains the mutual distrust between you and Kingibe?
There was no mutual distrust. If I distrusted him, I wouldn’t have picked him as my running mate. I don’t call a dog a monkey. You see, during the primaries, you read it in Sunray, Observer, The Punch, he (KIngibe) said it was not conceivable for a Southerner to become president of Nigeria for a long time to come. But to me that was his view. He’s a politician. But after the primaries he lost. Very narrowly, but he lost. In politics majority of one is enough. That was what Winston Churchill said when he came back after defeating Clement Atlee by a majority of two. One is enough it’s a majority. I won. So I was busy planning my campaign meeting with various bodies – Christians, blacksmiths, transporters, traders all over the place, and that was the priority. I was consulting people about V.P. too. It boiled down to: Is it Kingibe, is it Atiku, is it Paschal Bafyau or Bala Takaya and so on? That is my duty to do. To pick my running mate. Everything considered, I picked Kingibe. At that time, he was an ordinary member of the party. He had already lost. Again, that is politics. He was not the flagbearer. Although he produced the horse, I was the one who rode that horse in Jos. That is the winner. In politics, the winner is the winner. But I picked him and I offered him. He accepted the offer. Most of you are students of law. A contract is formed when an offer means unqualified acceptance. That’s what they call consensus addidem. There was no problem, he accepted the offer, so obviously he must have eaten his words about election of no Southerner bla….bla….bla…because I didn’t win the nomination to lose the election. I fought every ine of the way. I have never lost before in my life. And I have never failed to achieve my objective too before. If you know where I was coming from, it’s like somebody coming from 24,000 miles below sea level and flying now at 60,000 feet in a Concorde. That is what God has done with my life. So when Kingibe came on board, I took him up, I gave him a copy of Farewell To Poverty. Any criticisms? He said No. any input? He now called his own team to join my team. It was obvious who the candidate was. You’ve worked with me before. I work with everybody I respect – everybody but there will be no doubt as to who the boss was. Absolutely no doubt. We went into a campaign. I financed the entire campaign. All the resources I made available. I have a purpose. I want to alleviate suffering and poverty in this land forever and set us on a permanent course for progress.
I did that with my life. I can do it for the entire country. You cannot have progress without accountability. What the army has really is power without responsibility. You see, I can’t blame a butcher for not being a good surgeon. He doesn’t touch the animal until the animal is dead anyway. It’s like a Pathologist or what they call morbid anatomist. By the time he sees the patient, he (the patient) is dead. So he would just tear the parts apart. That is what soldiers are like. Soldiers are not meant to rule. To them opposition is not only meant to be defeated but destroyed. Because it is treason. If there is no opposition in government, you have a megalomaniac in your hands.
But it does not appear as if you carried your running mate with you all the time?
Do I have to carry him on my back? He’s in the aircraft with me every time. When we change into Rivers State dress they will change him and change me too. Look, there was an election to win. We are not husband and wife for God’s sake. Carry running mate along?
Don’t you see it rather metaphorically? That there was crisis of confidence….
Did we……Did he ever express a disagreement of policy during the campaigns that you heard of?
Well not in that sense. But when the coup came which was much later…
A: Listen, what created the katakata (crisis) was the annulment. Everything was singing and dancing. If we were sworn in and I am glad we were not sworn in, I must tell you. I am very very glad I did not become president on 27th August,
I wouldn’t have known the country enough not really the way that I know it now.
Do you want to illustrate your new realization?
There are a lot of things… You see, if I had gone back to university for the last forty years I wouldn’t have learnt what I learnt in the last eleven months.
Do you feel betrayed when Kingibe took up appointment under Abacha administration?
I said he shouldn’t have done that. I don’t feel personally betrayed. I felt the people were betrayed. You see, he had an opportunity at the meeting I called that Sunday to come out openly and say for personal reasons which he told me later in this room after his appointment has been announced. I’m coming back to the issue of Abacha mentioning it to me. You see, he could have told those who supported us as part of respect for them. But he didn’t. And I went to Abacha’s house on the day before the announcement of the appointment after we’ve discussed and he (Abacha) was still adamant on going ahead with cabinet of big names. I tried to persuade him, you see, I went to his house the following Monday and I was ambushed by television cameras. I am a big boy. I couldn’t cover my head, because it didn’t change my protocol at all.
A few weeks of cheap popularity at my expense. I am a big boy. Big boys don’t cry, my friend. So I smiled at him. I mean if rape were inevitable, a wise woman would lie down and enjoy it, unless the rape were being perpetrated by a eunuch then it becomes a burden. But I know the whole thing is a waste of time. You only fool all the people some of the time or some of the people all the time. You can’t fool all the people all the time. He asked me to come nearer him, I went nearer him and we talked. But what I said was not relayed on television. It was just the picture and people started to imagine all sorts of things. I’m a big boy, I walked into it. That’s part of politics. He thought he could achieve something. When stories were then being circulated that I gave list of ministers, that I was settled, I phoned him: Sani, tell your press secretary to tell the world that I was not settled, that I did not give you any list of ministers. He said, yes , oh yes, it would be done. Six days, seven days, no statement came, since I did not sell my mouth to the washman I had to tell the world what really happened. And they did not again say it. So, Chikena!
So, you see, I went to see him about this cabinet of big names. He was still going on that if Gowon could succeed, he should be able to do it. He would just sit down there and they will be doing all the work . I want to rule and all that. As I was going on then, he said I might consider giving your V.P. a job in that government . I laughed. I thought it was a joke. My V.P. is elected. No 2. Citizen of Nigeria, who the hell are you? He has no number, Abacha! I mean in the real order of president, who appointed him judge over us? I thought it was a joke. Walahi! Talahi!! How can anybody, you see, you build a house roofed with zinc in my village and naming ceremony is to be performed in a thatched house. Is that progress? How can somebody, having been elected, having been elected No 2 become whatever he is under a military. I thought it was a joke. Until I heard the announcement…..I heard it, when Baba himself, look, that morning of the announcement, Sam Mbakwe was here talking about the mandate. I said I couldn’t believe that. Did he tell you? No! why would he tell me such a thing. He won’t do it. He has already accepted. But they said they thought this man was only joking yesterday. He was not joking they said. He eventually told me that you know, some of them are finding it difficult to maintain their families bla…bla….bla…and so on…
Can the 12 June mandate be realized without the vice president elect?
Well, eh! eh! There is nothing that God cannot do. If the vice president-elect decides not to be available, that is too bad. You see, if you look at the results of the elections, look at it, the election was one of a national reconciliation and really, it was national reconciliation day: 12 June. Look into Kaduna state, SDP controlled only four out of 18 local government but NRC hardly had their own third on 12 June. And in front of Tofa’s house I beat him. I mean the polling station there. In his ward, his local government, everything. Even in Tofa village, I beat him. You see, that is God’s work. It was God that did that God did not require the permission of Kingibe or anybody. For as long as I am alive, the ticket is well. Okay, if Kingibe was so essential to the ticket, why didn’t it I die since he left. So you see, let us be very clear. You see, the vice president is my running mate. He kept saying the mandate belongs to the two of us. It’s a lie. The mandate is mine. He was my running mate. Read your constitution well and see the practice. You see, a president tells the vice president what he wants him to do period! It’s not a joint presidency. Is anybody in doubt about that? So, you see, at the appropriate time I have a very large heart. I have nothing against anybody. So, you see, this is a time for reconciliation. Most of those who want 12 June are not SDP, they did not even vote for me on 12 June. They are ordinary Nigerians and of both political persuasions. That is why my government will be government of National Reconciliation. Everybody who is competent and capable and is able to assist in bringing about a new nation that will smile to the world for the world to smile back at us with their investments which will employ our people to make life better for all Nigerians, give substantial employment to everybody and give us the future that we need to be able to walk proudly into the new century, will be welcome.
When is this government coming up?
It will be coming up very very soon indeed.
How soon?
It will be coming up very, very soon. I think these are questions you should ask NADECO. You see, eh, eh like I told you, you must work within a team. I have answered quite a lot of your questions which are within my personal jurisdiction to answer. I know the answer to the question you’ve asked, but I’m not privileged to let you know. Because you see, if you knew too much in advance about NADECO, although you tried to scoop it, but you see, but if you knew too much in advance about it – and you didn’t have too much advance notice about it – it didn’t just appear suddenly like that, it was worked upon….
Yes…..but the week before NADECO issued its ultimatum calling on the government to leave and give the mandate to you by the end of this month, you were going to address the nation, the people to form a government. This never came….
Listen! Listen!! It was a draft. It was not signed, you see, if the bucket is full of water, a single hand cannot carry it to the head. Nigeria is a big country not a banana republic. I think quite a lot, which I commit a lot of things into writing and I circulate to people to comment upon. I don’t know which of the copies you picked up. I haven’t even had time to read what your expose was. Exclusive, as you call it. But you see, you just got one of the drafts. I kept improving on it. The 38-page one which I wrote before going to Johannesburg and back. I had about 22 hours in the aircraft. So what should I be doing? I left home with my wife so I can’t be discussing with her on such a long journey. You see, I like writing. I wrote the thing, faxed it to people. It’s in the context of what they say, will there be a release. Then they said, ain’t you the one who has been doing this and that, let us do this for you.
Some Nigerians felt you developed cold feet.
You see, my feet are not cold. Nigeria does not belong to me alone. Nigeria belonigs to all of us. There are many elderly people in Nigeria who seriously mean well for this country. And you know, as a man who believes in God, you are forced to seek advice or even pay for it. That is the purpose of faxing people, having messages hand delivered to Kano, to Sokoto – everywhere, copies of these things for their comments. They are exposure drafts. What they call green papers abroad. You see, we are so used to military where everything is done in secrecy.
When you were abroad – after the purported annulment of the mandate, you kept saying you were in contact with a General, I guess it’s Abacha….
I don’t want to discuss about the General I was talking about.
The question I want to ask is whether the General gave the impression he was not part of the annulment?
I had the impression that he was not happy about the annulment. The statements made by some of them before was distancing them from the continuity of military regimes. You read some of them. And even when I was about to come back, they said, well , let us deal with the Babangida boys first, they can cause trouble for you. We don’t want that bla…bla….bla… And when I arrived, they brought my AirFrance plane to the presidential lounge to off-load me. I was given the impression that everything was…..a read carpet was on. What else do you want? I got the impression this is really – a pro-democracy element within the regime. Anyway, maybe they changed their minds. But the people have rejected them. And there is no hiding place now. They have overstayed their welcome.
You once told us in an earlier interview we had with you, that you’re not ready to die for…..
Wait….Wait….Wait…. Don’t ….Don’t…..Don’t start to talk about death. It’s because…..
I’m saying…..
I say wait. Don’t….i don’t want to flog that anymore. If you ‘re dead you would not be here now.
Okay, you believe in procedures..
I believe in due procedures…
In due process, okay. You don’t like shedding of blood and you won’t like to rupture Nigeria’s sovereignty. But as the same time, in a week’s time there might be two symbols of authority and the second one will be organized by you. How do you reconcile that?
It will be reconciled. Look, it’s not organized by me. Again, you seem to like the politics of personalization. It will be headed by me all right. Yes. But not organized by me. It is organized by the Nigerian people. Those people who boycotted the yeye election of last Monday and those who will boycott the one on Saturday by which time there will be a coherent political voice in this country. I can assure you of that.
How many ministers in Abacha’s government have started walking back or are trying to walk back to you?
I will not discuss that. I will not discuss that. It’s not fair.
Have you been in contact with the NRC the SDP and members of the ..?
I’m in contact with every Nigerian including yourself. You know I don’t turn anybody back in this house. My house is like a polling station. We never lock the door.
Given the fact that you were elected on the platform of the Social Democratic Party, this party has been banned, all democratic structures dissolved, don’t you see that as eroding the manadate?
Now way, the mandate is of the people. The people have not been banned in which case there will be no Nigeria. In any case, if the mandate has been eroded, why has there been no peace in Nigeria since the annulment?
The people reject the annulment. The people reject those who announced the annulment. It’s like Nigeria since then, has been like a beautiful girl who was married by a foolish father to a eunuch. Because that eunuch would wash her in the morning, wash her dress, cook for her. What type of husband would that be?
You promised about two weeks ago when you went to Ibadan that after forming your own government, you are going to convoke a Sovereign National conference (SNC). What if that SNC decides that maybe Nigeria should no longer exist in which case you would no longer be able to exercise your mandate?
No, listen! An SNC is called by a Sovereign nation. No nation has the right to decree itself out of existence in international law. There are certain limitations. It is clear most Nigerians do not have a sense in the present arrangement. There is no doubt at all about that. How do we live together so that we can be happy to be able to realize our full potentials as a people? How will the constitution be? The social contract between the nation and the individuals with the union groups that make our great country in such a way that everybody could be able to hold his head high as we used to be able to do and say: I am a Nigerian. Most people cannot say that now. And there has to be justice. A system where some people are destined to be hewers of wood and carriers of water is not a just system. You see, our national motto does not contain the word justice. It’s Unity and Faith, Peace and Progress. You see, you cannot have peace without justice. All those are the things that are to be restructured.
Don’t you think former president Babangida has a role to play in all this?
I don’t know? What role will he want to play?
There was a time you wrote a letter to him….?
Yes, you see, I believed and still believe that he left Abacha behind deliberately. For Abacha to take over under what I later believed was called turn-by-turn.
How did you know that?.
How soon?
Well, I don’t know how much time I will have in the next few years. I have a daily diary which I’ve been keeping in the past eleven months.
But if you’re going to rule Nigeria for four years, you still have a hell of a job to do.
You will be part of the rulership. You’re joking if you think I’ll put all the load on my head alone. Do I look like an over-burdened person? I have so many companies, but I still have people running them.
Recently, you wrote some letters to General Babangida. Why did you have to write him?
That is like asking me that recently I went to see Nzeribe, I went to see Ojukwu.
Yes, these questions are important..
The Eastern Mandate Union has come out to say that the military government should quit. But it gives 30 June at least 30 days after 30 May which NADECO has given. This has kind of reinforced your position although there’s a slight confusion.
As far as I’m concerned, these are questions you should ask from NADECO. I’m ready and willing all this time, but you know, there are so many ways of handling things. 30 June, 12 June, it’s not something that we should really bother too much about really. I shouldn’t lose any sleep about that. I’ve been ready from day one. If I weren’t ready I wouldn’t have gone all this way. Some people were saying that the mandate was dead. I laughed. I kept assuring you when last you spoke to me. There is no way you can kill the mandate without killing Nigeria. And you see, I can understand from looking at your experience of life-because you are in the media which is considerable, compared with the people of your age group. But which is still a little behind ours. There are some areas in which you are better than I am. You may have more clothes than I have but I have more rags than you have.
It appears that you will agree that there is a new Abiola now with his own hidden agenda?
No! No! No! What Abiola has been is the same Abiola. Wait, let me tell you this. I am a very pragmatic person. I do not go around knocking my head against a brick wall. If I had been doing that, I wouldn’t have arrived up till now. In three months time, by the Grace of God, I would be 57. I have some pretty good ideas of how to get things done in the best way possible. But you see, you cannot clap with one hand. I’ve always told you that during the campaigns.
In a retrospective sense, what do you think has accounted for your new resolve?
It took time to get people together. In an atmosphere where all parties have been banned and SSS people are doing what they are doing, it takes time. Give Jack time. You see, the mandate won’t run away. And that was the point I was trying to relay to you last time. You see, what will normally take ten days, if you want to do it in one day you won’t survive till the next day. Some things are simply impossible.
If you want a live baby and you want to be sure of it – even if the lady co-operated from the moment you set your eyes on her – it would take at least nine months. Some things just can’t be rushed. Human beings, we are very responsible people, you must weigh the options and so on. It’s the first time in the history of any African country that responsible, accredited, highly praised political groups come out and say: you are soldiers, go back, enough. Ah Ah! It’s not something people like Papa Ajasin people, like Chief Bola Ige, people like Chief Anthony Enahoro. I mean people like Professor Anya Anya, people like Commodore Ebitu Ukiwe whow as a number two man in this country before, Ndubuisi Kanu was in the SMC for a long time, they know how vicious this military government can be. People like Balarabe Musa. People like General Adebayo. These are very senior Nigerians. For them to be convinced that wait, this is important, it takes time. They say a man convinced against his wish is of the same opinion still. We are all ready now, worst, I am ready like the Ever-Ready battery.

Infinix Zero 8 vs Redmi Note 9s: We have sure seen lots if interesting budget mid-range smartphone this year. Infinix Note 7, Tecno Camon 15 Premier, Redmi Note 9s just to name a few.
Yes, Redmi Note 9s was the better phone among all the phones above. It was even better than the more expensive Galaxy A51 released by Samsung. But, what happens with the release of the Infinix Zero 8? Let’s find out.
Read Also: Infinix Zero 8 Price in Nigeria and Specs: 90Hz Refresh Rate, 960fps Slow Mo and More
This post is about comparing the newly released Infinix Zero 8 and Redmi Note 9s. We’ll be comparing the specifications of both phones side by side. Then you’ll see which one is actually best for buying.
Phone comparisons are not always easy. This is true considering that people use phones for different reasons. But, what we’ll focus on here is overall user experience and value for money. It’s good you buy a phone that is actually worth the money right?
To get this comparison started, it’s good you know that Redmi Note 9s is currently the best budget mid-range phone. Prior to the release of the Infinix Zero 8, no other mid-range smartphone offer so much value for such a small money.
Infinix Note 7, Tecno Camon 15, Galaxy A51 were/are good phones but Redmi Note 9s, was/is in a league of it’s own.
Read Also: Infinix Hot 10 Specs Preview, Price And Release Date
With the above out of the way, let’s see if this new mid-range device can outdo the Redmi Note 9s and possibly steal it’s shine.
Before we move one, you can Join Us on YouTube and get, unboxing, live reviews and comparisons of phones.
We’ll now kick things off with comparing the features of these phones.
Infinix Zero 8 vs Redmi Note 9s
Infinix Zero 8 is produced by Infinix Mobile while the Redmi Note 9s is produced by Xiaomi. This is the very first difference between these two phones.
This comparison is going to be based strictly on the paper specifications of both phones. At the end, you’ll get to decide which is better between the Infinix Zero 8 and Redmi Note 9s.
Now its time for us to start the comparison proper. And we are starting from the network connectivity of both phones.
Infinix Zero 8 vs Redmi Note 9s: Network Connectivity
There is no 5G connectivity for both phones and given the market where Infinix and Redmi phones are mostly sold, there is no need for this features. Most countries where these phones are sold are yet to have working 5G network.
Read Also: Infinix Zero 8 vs Infinix Note 7: Which is Better?
Which means having a 5G phone in these regions will be useless. Plus that technology would have increased the prices of these smartphones.
Infinix Zero 8 vs Redmi Note 9s: Build, Design and Display
Both phone were built with same material (front glass, plastic back and plastic frame). The punch hole of the Redmi Note 9s is placed at the middle while that of the Infinix Zero 8 is placed at the top left side.
Although both phones comes with an IPS LCD display type, the Infinix Zero 8 has a bigger 6.9 inch display while the Redmi Note 9s has a smaller 6.67 inch.
You can see the difference of both phones at first sight. Zero 8 comes with a diamond shaped rear camera set up which is very different from the square like rear camera set up of the Note 9s.
Read Also: Redmi Note 9s Vs Tecno Camon 15 Premier: Which is Better
Another first difference you’ll notice is the bigger punch hole of the Zero 8 which houses a dual selfie camera.
The dual selfie camera and diamond shaped rear camera of the Zero 8 is something you can’t simply ignore. But, the single punch hole beauty of the Note 9s can’t be underrated.
One reason why you might want to buy the Zero 8 is that it’s display comes with 90Hz smooth refresh rate. This is a huge jump over the Redmi Note 9s in the display category.
Infinix Zero 8 vs Redmi Note 9s:, things get a little bit shaken up here. For starters, both phones use chipsets from different companies.
Redmi Note 9s uses the Qualcomm SM7125 Snapdragon 720G while the Infinix Zero 8 uses MediaTek Helio G90T. Both chipset are very good gaming chipset from Qualcomm and MediaTek respectively.
We’ll have to wait to see the live tests to see which one has better heat management and smooth gaming experience.
To be fair, MediaTek gaming chipset in mid-range smartphones have always been great but lags behind when it comes to heat management. An area were Qualcomm mid-range chipset have always come on top.
For now, we are calling this a tie breaker until we see reasons to update this post in coming weeks. With that said, let’s turn our attention to the storage of both phones.
Infinix Zero 8 vs Redmi Note 9s: Internal Storage and RAM
The Redmi Note 9s comes with 6GB RAM and 64/128GB Internal Storage which is good. Infinix Zero 8 comes with 6/8GB RAM and 128/256GB Internal Storage. Both phones have options for external storage which is very good.
A 6GB RAM is more than you will get in most premium mid-range smartphones. You remember the iPhone SE 2020 that costs about $400? Yes, that phone comes with a smaller RAM.
Infinix Zero 8 vs Redmi Note 9s: Camera
The Infinix Zero 8 comes with a 64MP main camera while the Redmi Note 9s comes with a 48MP main camera (Redmi Note 9 Pro and Pro Max comes with 64MP). Both phones have decent camera but given that the camera of the Zero 8 will use a more recent software, we expect it to perform better.
Both phones comes with a quad camera set up. As stated earlier, the diamond shaped for Zero 8 and the somewhat squared shape for Note 9s.
Upfront, the Zero 8 comes with a 48 + 8MP dual selfie camera while the Redmi Note 9s comes with a single 16MP camera. Both phones can record 4K videos, have gyro-EIS features enabled.
But, the Zero 8 comes with 960fps slow mo feature which is not available in the Redmi Note 9s. If you like taking slow mo videos, then the Zero 8 is your choice of phone here.
Infinix Zero 8 vs Redmi Note 9s: Battery
Infinix Zero 8 has a 4500 mAh battery with 33W fast charge which is below the 5020 mAh battery found in the Redmi Note 9s. The battery of the Note 9s will last longer than that of the Zero 8.
Infinix Zero 8 vs Redmi Note 9s: Prices
The expected starting price of the Infinix Zero 8 is $300, 117,000 Naira while the starting price of the Redmi Note 9s is $250, 97,000 Naira.
As you can see, the Redmi Note 9s is the more affordable phone between these two. Well, its decision time and its time for you to make a pick between these two phones. But below is our conclusion about these phones.
Given the value it brings, the Infinix Zero 8 is the better phone to buy from this comparison. It offers everything that the Redmi Note 9s offers and more. It brings some extra things to the table.
Buying the Infinix Zero 8 instead of the Redmi Note 9s means you have to spend extra money but it’ll be worth it.
This is not to say in anyway that the Redmi Note 9s is a bad phone. Infact, the price attached with the Note 9s is enough to ditch other phones for it. But when placed with the Zero 8, it falls a little behind.
When you get the Infinix Zero 8, you’ll see the difference of the extra cash right from the display. A full HD resolution, a dual selfie camera, decent chipset, 90Hz refresh rate, more camera quality and features.

He first planted pineapples….but gradually converted the plantation into a citrus grove. By 1918, Hallstrom had completed his brick house.”
The marker goes on to relate how he became a local banker along with being rewarded for his work in supporting Swedish-American relations. Then there is some history of his daughter and how she left the house to the Indian River Historical Society upon her death.
Categories: Night Gallery[imagebrowser id=480].Until last night, the most nauseous I’ve felt in my life was after eating a vegan sausage roll live on air, a reckless decision that prompted me to instantly hurl into a large bucket.
But that sickening ordeal paled into vomit-inducing insignificance compared to the comically cringe-worthy collision between the world’s two most narcissistic, fake and irritating female celebrities, Meghan Markle and Ellen DeGeneres.
Watching them giggle and preen away during their lengthy cheese-fest, stroking each other’s egos and dishing out cash to charity, you’d think they are the kindest, sweetest human beings to ever bestride the globe.
But it’s worth reminding ourselves that they both stand accused of being nasty little bullies who, when the cameras aren’t around, terrorize their staff.
Unsurprisingly, bullying in the workplace didn’t come up as a topic of discussion last night.
Nor did Princess Pinocchio’s trashing of the Royal Family and Monarchy, the institutions she professes to detest but milks like a greedy dairy farmer.

Number 3: Cartilage Carnage
April, 1988. With a leg full of hardware, I followed the doctor’s orders and waited patiently before I started riding again. Finally it healed, and I went to Kansas City to ride with Dennis and Rick. We celebrated with an all-night street session. I was careful not to thrash my leg too hard. The next day I woke up and my knee was swollen, super-sized. It wouldn’t move either. I went home and I got a MRI. The internal images revealed that I’d totally ripped both my medial and lateral meniscus in half when I’d broken my leg. The meniscus is a shock-absorbing cartilage in the middle of your knee. When Dr. Yates had put the plate in, he’d never thought to check it for other damage, and I had no idea my knee was jacked. My street session with the Kansas City BMX Brigade had aggravated the meniscus more and more until it was wrecked. Dr. Yates sewed it back together from the inside. Arthoscopic meniscus repair is considered a less invasive surgical procedure than using the knife. Dr. Yates drilled pencil-sized holes and slid all the tools inside my knee, doing the operation using a tiny video camera. Tech.
Number 4: Ted Nugent Tumor Trauma
December, 1990. I don’t know how it happened, but a tumor grew in my right leg. I was diagnosed with Cat Scratch Fever, a shocking prognosis. My entire life, I thought Cat Scratch Fever was a just a cheesy fictitious disease, invented by the Motor City Madman, Ted Nugent. But it was real, and residing in my groin. The viral infection caused a growth to form under my skin. It was about the size and shape of a bar of soap, and it hurt to do can-cans. I had to get the lump removed, and this was right after my mom had died of cancer, so I was sweating it. The growth turned out to be benign. The day after the surgery I went to Austin with Spike Jonze for a road trip. I had to ride with a drainage tube sticking out of my leg, leaking excess puss. I came up with a few tube variations on vert.
My recovery was also aided by Spike, a guy who won’t let a tumor get in the way of mayhem. We hooked up with a posse of Austin legends, Dave Parrick, James “Sheps” Shepard, and Ruben “The Cuban” Castillo. Rick Thorne was with us too. That night Spike climbed a rain gutter up to the roof of a nightclub and infiltrated the interior, saving himself the three dollar cover charge. Within fifteen minutes of entering, Spike’s personality was infecting the dance floor, causing an adverse reaction from some phony Euro-snob wearing a ponytail and a white turtleneck in the ninety degree heat. Euro was highly annoyed that Spike was having fun too near him, which made Spike even more pleased to cramp the guy’s style. Before long, Euro erupted, challenging Spike to a two-fisted throwdown. Spike tried to diffuse the human stress bomb by giving the guy a bear hug, then licked his face from chin to forehead in one quick motion. The instant before Euro decked Spike, out of the darkness came the rescue squad—Rick, Ruben, Dave, and James. They each clocked the guy in the head with a rapid fire punch, perfectly timed to the electronic beats pounding from the sound system. We were thrown out.
Number 5: Rotator Cuff Rip Off
January, 1991. I hadn’t done a one-footed 540 in weeks, when I tried spinning one. I held back a little and did it low. I crashed and landed with my right arm fully extended to break my fall. The impact ripped my rotator cuff, the group of four muscles that lay over your shoulder socket, which keep your arm in place and help it rotate. Mine was wrecked.
The irony was I’d hurt myself because I was holding back, to avoid hurting myself. My whole arm stung with electrified hellfire, but it stayed in its socket and didn’t feel like I’d broken anything. The day after the slam, I was scheduled to do some demos in Australia with Mark “Gator” Anthony, Brian Blyther, and Chris Miller. My shoulder ached super bad, but I iced it every night. From Australia I flew directly to the King of Vert contest at Thrasherland in Arizona. During the pro finals, I got a flat at the end of my second run. I borrowed the nearest bike I could find, and dropped in. I had to literally hold on and hoped it responded to what I wanted it to do, which was a flip fakie. I almost pulled it, but the bike felt alien, and the seat post was so low, I had to stand up on the roll back. I bit off a little more than I could chew, and paid for it with another slam. My rotator cuff tore some more. But, I won the comp and the 1990 Pro of the Year title.
I got home from the Arizona contest and had to get the hardware (ten screws and a plate) removed from my leg because the bone had grown over it. I was still growing and it was going to affect the growth of my leg, so they had to go back in and chisel it out. The upside was, I would only have to take about a week or two off before I could ride again. I asked Dr. Yates if he could take a look at my shoulder during the operation because it had been aching. I woke up with a big puffy incision on my right arm and a shoulder immobilizer on it. Dr. Yates came in and said I had immensely torn my rotator cuff, and I was looking at four-month recovery. Shit! I didn’t expect that.
That one-footed 540 injury made me realize my pain tolerance was getting pretty strong, and even if I could handle the pain it didn’t mean something wasn’t seriously wrong. It was also the gateway to serious rotator cuff problems, which plague me to this day. Every time I put my arm out when I slam, it tears my rotator cuff. All because I held back on that trick.
The incident convinced me to never try anything half-assed again.
Number 6: Arm Harm
October, 1992. During the summer I took a bad slam on my elbow. I never got it checked, and didn’t know I’d chipped off part of the bone. The bone spur healed in the joint, and before long I couldn’t bend my elbow enough to brush my teeth, brush my hair, or shave. I’m right handed, and had to learn all those tasks using my left arm. It sounds simple, but it’s not. That was my mentality at the time—I’d modify my life around injuries, as long as it didn’t interfere with my riding. I was getting accustomed to my unbendable elbow by the time I went to the Rider Cup in England, in October. A good day of riding came to a halt when I hung up doing a flair. I stiff-armed into the flat bottom with my right arm extended and hit my head on the top of my arm so hard I knocked myself out, ripping my rotator cuff again and worse. The slam put me in so much pain so fast that I knew I’d done something very bad to my body. It was a long, sore flight home. When I got back to the United States I immediately went to Dr. Yates for surgery. I asked him to check out my elbow while he was in my shoulder—two birds, one stone. I woke up with an immobilized elbow that hurt worst then my shoulder. It was a tough surgery. In the video of the arthroscopic portion of the surgery, there are a bunch of tools stuck deep into my arm and Dr. Yates says, “I’ll be filleting your elbow now.” I didn’t expect it, but it took a lot of therapy and time before my elbow would bend again.
It works fine now, and I’m back to shaving right-handed.
Number 7: Air to Spleen
April, 1993. It started when I built a 21 foot tall quarterpipe (about twice the height of a normal vert ramp) and convinced my partner Steve to tow me at 50mph on a motorcycle down a plywood runway. I’d let go of the tow rope, grab my handlebars, and shoot out of the ramp 18, 19, 20 feet and more. Within the first session, I’d broken the world record (my own), easy. The ramp was taller than a telephone pole, so add the aerial height, and I was about four stories off the ground during my peak. The power of the forces at work made themselves apparent one day when I hung up my back wheel on re-entry from 21 feet out. I was going so fast when I clipped the coping, it ripped the tire off my wheel and wrecked my rim. I didn’t get hurt, but it opened my eyes up to the speed we were dealing with. Eventually it became such an ordeal to use the motorcycle tow rope to ride the big ramp that I converted the giant quarterpipe into a giant halfpipe—with two transitions, my plan was to pump it under my own power. I built a 46 foot tall roll-in off the top of our warehouse to send me into the ramp. But the giant trannies proved to be too much to maintain speed, and my airs would start at 19 feet and get lower and lower with each wall.
I wanted to ride the halfpipe and sky out of it. I reverse-engineered a weedeater engine and rigged it to my bike. I duct taped on a gas tank, and used a 122-tooth sprocket to drive my rear wheel. Then I’d rev the tiny engine full throttle, drop into the ramp and start pulling airs. It was just powerful enough to maintain my speed, and just light enough so I could get about 23 feet out of the halfpipe—44 feet off the ground. But the bike felt super weird. It was heavy, the engine made the weight offset, and if my timing was off and I missed my pump, I’d fall from the sky like a rock.
One day MTV Sports called to see if I had any new projects I was working on. I invited them out to Oklahoma to check out the giant halfpipe. It was windy, but we were on a tight timeline, so I rode anyway. On one of my airs I came in sideways and spanked the ramp with my torso.
We watched the crash on video and it didn’t look that bad. We were still talking about filming more high airs when I noticed my collar bones began to ache. I hadn’t taken much of the fall on my arms or shoulders, so I couldn’t figure out why they were throbbing. It was pressure from blood hemorrhaging inside my abdominal cavity. Before long I began to get dizzy. On the way to the water cooler, I leaned against a wall for balance, and the floor rushed up to greet me. A few minutes later, the ambulance arrived.
As I lay flat on my back, the medic tried his blood pressure cuff and got a weak pulse. I didn’t have five hundred dollars for the ride to the hospital and my health insurance was a shake of the dice, regarding what they’d cover and what they wouldn’t. We told the ambulance to go away, and Steve and my girlfriend Jaci brought me in.
The ER doctor examined me and told Steve I’d need an emergency spleenectomy to save my life. I had about twenty minutes to live, he said. Inside my ruined spleen was leaking massive amounts of blood—I had lost four pints.
A spleenectomy is one of the crazier abdominal surgical procedures. The doctors remove all thirty-something feet of your intestines and put them in a bowl next to you while they mop up the blood and remove chunks of broken spleen floating around inside you. After the ruptured spleen is cleaned out, the doctors check your intestines for holes by hand, like looking for a flat tire in a bike inner tube.
The first thing I saw when I woke up in the recovery room was the MTV producer. I’d just had my colon fondled from the inside, could barely open my eyes, my brain was spaced out on anesthesia, and my whole torso was throbbing from the trauma. “Hey, Mat. I know this is a bad time, but, could you sign this, ah, liability release form for us?”
Number 8: Supersplinter
August, 1993. There’s nothing like the feel of having stiff wood rammed into your ass. I’m talking, of course, about splinters. I was having a mellow session on the Ninja Ramp and the plywood surface was in tatters. I didn’t really think too much about it. I started working on a few new tricks and crashed, sliding sideways down the tranny. On the way down, a piece of plywood peeled up and was driven through the right side of my butt. I got to the bottom and jumped up like my pants were on fire—a quick inspection revealed a wedge-shaped splinter with a tip thicker than a pencil. It had pierced my right cheek on one side, and come out the other. Deep. It was one of those laughing on the outside, crying on the inside moments. I got out a pair of vise grips, clamped onto the wood near the entry wound, took a deep breath, and pulled. It broke off inside. The tip was sticking out on the other side, so I pressed my luck and tried to pull the fat end through the exit hole. I broke off that end too. By that time, the acute pain had subsided. I went back to riding.
We were holding a contest at the Hoffman Bikes compound in less than two weeks, and there was a lot of work to do fixing up the street park course. The day after my splinter, I was outside pounding nails with Steve, team manager Kim Boyle, and Jamie Mosberg, a cinematographer Airwalk had hired to shoot a promo with me riding my twenty-one foot quarter pipe. Somehow, the subject of who had the hairiest ass came up. Jamie, whose nickname is Mouse, claimed he did, and threw down the challenge. I started laughing that the first contest on the new Hoffman Bikes park was going to be a hair ass contest. I dropped my pants and heard gasps. Mouse technically won, as we discovered his ass is carpeted in brown fur. But my bruised and inflamed splinter tipped the scales in my favor and I was declared the champion. I hadn’t told anyone about my splinter, and after the laughter died down, Steve and Kim began to get concerned. I was forced to go to the hospital and have it surgically removed. Mouse brought his camera and documented it, and said he’d edit it to General Hospital music. The next day we shot the Airwalk promo, and I couldn’t sit down.
Number 9: Shouldering the Pain
September, 1993. We were holding a Bicycle Stunt comp at the Hoffman Bikes park over Labor Day weekend. My rotator cuff had been torn for a while, and I was scheduled to get surgery on it the Thursday before the comp. I told Dr. Yates we’d need to postpone the surgery so I could ride the contest. I was also intent on riding the twenty-one foot quarter-pipe, for the skeptics in attendance. I did a few airs more than twenty feet high, and on my last aerial my arm gave up the ghost. I totally ripped my rotator cuff off the humerus head. That is a very bad thing. Dr. Yates had his work cut out for him. His surgical notes start with a right shoulder diagnostic arthroscopy, followed by open repair of massive rotator cuff avulsion with bicipital tenodesis and subscapularis tendon. Translation? Yates told me my rotator cuff muscles were like a thin piece of fatiguing metal. They could snap anytime, and I didn’t have any control over it with my arm raised above my head. I could literally rip my arm off if I crashed bad enough. From that day forward, I had to use a shoulder brace with a string attaching the underside of my arm to my ribs, to keep my arm from extending too far up. I lost all movement and strength in my shoulder. After not having a haircut for six years, I shaved my head because I couldn’t raise my arm high enough to brush the dreads out. My arm even dislocates in bed sometimes, and it won’t go back in. Once I rolled over and my arm fell out of socket. I had Jaci trying to yank it back in, but no go. Finally I had to call Steve at about 6:30 in the morning to help me get it back in. That’s the sign of a true friend.
Despite the best medical treatment I could find, my arm has never healed.
Number 10: Weak in the Knees
July, 1995. My meniscus tore in half again over the course of many slams. In the 1990s, street riding was the fastest growing facet of bike riding, and there were many opportunities to see where the limits could be pushed even further. Riding was getting progressive more technical, and really burly. It sucked me in and I found myself riding more street and less vert. Street riding can be like therapy. I’d throw a Suicidal Tendencies tape in the Walkman and set out to unveil what the street had to offer. After a good session I’d come back relaxed and cured. It wasn’t uncommon for people to jump off buildings, or if you messed up on a handrail, to tumble down long flights of concrete stairs at full speed. Whenever you crash riding street, your knees usually suffer the most because you try to abandon the bike and run out of the crash. During this era I tore my meniscus, my PCL, and a bunch of other cartilage in my knee. Sometimes the flapping meniscus would get caught up in between my femur and tibia, and lock up my knee. Dr. Yates did another arthroscopic surgery on my right knee and roto-rootered it out. He had to remove my meniscus. I had no shock-absorbing cartilage in the middle of my knee. Yum.
Number 11: Rotator Cuff Rebuild
March, 1996. My shoulder injury put a limit on my riding. Dr. Yates said that there was nothing left to do; my shoulder was fucked. I think he was sick of spending hours putting it back together only to have me rip it right up again. Basically it had come to the point where I had to decide: If I chose to ride and challenge myself more, then I could lose my arm. I decided I wasn’t done yet.
Yates suggested I see what the Stedman-Hawkins Clinic could do for me. It was located in Vail, Colorado, and I scheduled a stay, right after my first B.A.S.E. jump in New Orleans. Dr. Hawkins was the shoulder specialist and Dr. Steadman, the knee guy. They are a world-renowned surgery group and the team doctors for the Denver Broncos, Colorado Rockies, and the U.S. Ski Team. I flew into Denver and took a bus to Vail. This was my first solo mission to try and find a procedure that would get my body working again. My plan was to get Dr. Steadman to check out my knee and fix my PCL, which I’d torn a couple years earlier. At the same time I was there to have Dr. Hawkins double up the surgeries, with a rotator cuff overhaul. That way I could stack the recovery times together and be out for the least amount of time. However, after I arrived I found out the knee would take too long to recuperate, and I was scheduled to do the closing ceremonies of the Olympics. I decided to just get my shoulder fixed. I could still ride without a PCL, and live without one. During the surgery on my rotator cuff, I got a nerve block that made my arm completely numb. It was freaky to get a preview of what it would be like to totally lose arm function.
The surgery went well, and after it healed, my shoulder stayed in its socket better. But Dr. Hawkins didn’t have much faith that it would withstand the rigors of riding.
Number 12: The Battle of Wounded Knee
When I wrecked my ACL and PCL at the Shultz Show in June of 1998, I knew what had happened held grave consequences for my riding. ACL’s can probably be repaired a hundred times and still get decent results—their job is to keep your tibia and fibula from sliding up your femur and dislocating. PCL’s are much harder to repair, and can only be fixed two or three times before they’re toast. I’d just wrecked both the ACL and PCL in one shot. I would have little to no chance of ever riding like I wanted to again, and was looking at a lot of months of pain just to recover. I was twenty-six years old, and had planned on building myself a twenty-six foot ramp for a belated twenty-sixth birthday. My life had just completely changed. Bike riding, as I knew it, was over and I would have to accept it.
I went home and Dr. Yates scheduled me for an operation. I had to wait for a cadaver ligament to be “available.” Soon thereafter, I got the call that someone’s Achilles was packed in ice, on its way to meet me. The surgery was a real challenge. Since I’d torn both my ACL and PCL, there wasn’t any accurate way to ensure a tight, centered implementation of both ligaments. I wasn’t encouraged that the outcome would be successful. But I had a very skilled master surgeon on my side, and the winds of fortune blowing my way the day of the operation. It took months, but my knee healed nicely with even tension from both the front and back ligaments.
The next time I got on my bike, I had to struggle to clear five feet of air. I was being mellow, trying to get acclimated to the feel of my bike moving underneath me. It was so foreign. It gave me a whole new respect for bikers. I couldn’t believe how much I’d taken my skills for granted when I was at the top of my game. Now those skills were gone. I played around, sticking to lip tricks until my brakes slipped on a Canadian nosepick. I dropped to the bottom like a dot com stock. When my leg hit the ramp, my lower leg sheared off and rode up my femur, completely tearing my ACL. I couldn’t believe it. I wondered, again, if this was it for my days as a biker.
Number 13: The Synthetic Solution
February, 1999. I decided I wasn’t ready to give up yet. After crashing the Canadian pick and trashing my cadaver components, I became desperate for a way to fix my knee. I’d need another operation just to walk, so I figured I might as well research every alternative treatment done on ACL/PCL replacement. Thank God for the Internet. I found hope in the form of synthetic ligament replacement procedures. Just as quickly, I ran into a brick wall in the U.S., because the FDA refused to sanction synthetics, citing it wasn’t a long-term option. By even giving me advice on how to get the procedure done elsewhere, a doctor practicing in the U.S. would put their medical license in jeopardy. It’s funny how you think you own your body, yet the government really has control over us in so many ways. Dr. Yates knew the deal, though, and was very helpful in steering me in the right direction for plastic parts: France. Their top orthopedic doctors had been successfully doing ACL repair on rugby players using a thing called the LARS ligament. These guys were back on the field after only four weeks—my previous surgery took me out for six months.
I started sending faxes and emails to French doctors with unpronounceable names.
I narrowed it down to two options. I could go to France to have the surgery done, or go to the French province of Montreal, in Canada. I chose Canada for its socialized medicine. The prices were right, only about five thousand dollars for the entire operation. It ended up going down like a drug deal on Miami Vice. I had to go alone, and bring cash, and pay the doctor in my hotel room the day before. The downside was, they wanted me to be a human guinea pig. They were doing research on the operation and wanted to prove it could be done without extensive anesthetics, which are the most dangerous part of any surgery. By proving it was possible to do the surgery without anesthetics, they could promote it as a safe alternative to ACL reconstruction, increasing their odds of being sanctioned by the FDA.
The procedure called for them to open up my knee and drill a six-millimeter hole down the length of my femur. The drill bit was fifteen inches long. I would be fully conscious and have no pain medication for the surgery. In fact, I could watch close on three TV monitors in the room.
It was kind of like an interactive horror movie. My skin was numbed with a local anesthesia, and then the doctors brought out the drill. “We haven’t figured out a way to numb the inside of the bone, so this will hurt,” my doctor said to me. It hit bone and the room filled with a smell that, well, I don’t think you ever want to get a whiff of your own bones smoking. The drill surged and grunted onward, the tiny motor straining as the pain began to increase. Then the tip broke though into the marrow. My heart rate was supposed to stay below eighty beats per minute, and it shot through the roof when I felt the hot drill strike the soft marrow inside my femur. It was pain taken to a new level. The knobs turned to an eleven-kind of painful. It didn’t help matters to actually see what bone marrow looks like; spongy red and yellowish pulp, like corned beef hash. I had to struggle and concentrate on my breathing to get my heart rate down, while squeezing the steel rails of the bed with my hands as tightly as I could. Every once in a while the nurse would lean over and say in broken Franglish, “You doing real well, Mot.” This went on for the longest thirty minutes of my life. Once there were holes in my femur and tibia, the doctors threaded a polyester ligament through the bony tunnels. Basically, they put a ski rope where my ACL once was.
Afterward I was sewn up and I sat up on the table. There was an awkward pause as the doctor snapped off his latex gloves. I’d just had major surgery, without drugs. “Am I free to go?” I asked, my mind reeling and unsure of what to do. “Yep,” said the doctor. We shook hands and I limped from the surgical table to go outside and flag down a cab.
I finally got a cab and crumpled into the back seat, marveling at the incredible strangeness of life. Ten minutes ago there were six hands shoving tools and titanium screws inside my knee, and suddenly I was in some dirty shoebox of a taxi, hustling back to my hotel. I kept thinking I was doing something wrong; there was very little post-operative pampering and nurturing going on. At the hotel, I fell in bed and flipped on the TV. I settled in for what would become a forty-eight hour pay-per-view marathon, starting with the buddy cop comedy Rush Hour, subtitled in French. Before long I had to use the bathroom, and faced my first crisis; I couldn’t walk, and had no crutches. I got two chairs under my arms and used them to slowly crab across the room to the beckoning toilet. It was a painful, sluggish struggle.
On the third day I got in a cab to the airport, boarded my flight, and went home a new man, with new knees, and a new lease on life.
Number 14: Snapping the Ski Rope
May, 1999. The LARS ligament healed up clean and quick, and I was back on my bike in a month. I rode and grew stronger, clearing my brain of business troubles by carving around on the half-pipe. Before long I was eyeing a line which had been calling me for over a year: a big transfer from the vert ramp to the street course. It was during a casual session at the Hoffman Bikes Christmas party, when I decided to give myself a present: the gap. I launched and pulled the highest back flip I could over it, and in my enthusiasm, over rotated. I was wearing a knee brace and still managed to dislocate my knee on impact. The synthetic ligament was ripped out of my femur, and I was back to square one. I didn’t know what to do, and felt totally defeated. It was another black day at Hoffman Bikes.
I sent a letter to the doctor in Canada that did the LARS surgery and he said it would have been really hard to break the synthetic ligament, they were supposed to last at least five years. Dr. Yates did an exploratory surgery and found the ligament wasn’t broken, I’d just yanked it out where it was anchored into my femur. He reattached it with a better procedure, implanting a little more titanium into my body. Two weeks later I had a fully functioning right knee again.
But I didn’t hop back on my bike immediately. I’d just been through a frightening two years, plagued by knee problems, and I wanted to be mentally ready for what came next. I didn’t want to rush out and push myself in a race to get back my chops. It was also a tough time to make this decision. The sport was bigger than it had ever been, and it was the most lucrative time to compete in the pro vert class. You could make ten thousand dollars for a flawless two minutes on the ramp. I was staging events, running a company to pay back my debts, and watching everyone prosper.
I’d pushed the boundaries throughout my career, and knew there were other things I still wanted to do on my bike. But I couldn’t expect my body to keep up with my mind, without ending back up in the hospital. I wanted to go in a new direction entirely—one that was a challenge, but also without expectations. I took my brakes off, to rediscover my bike under the new terms I was dealt. I didn’t know what was possible on a bike without brakes, and it was like a new sport. At one point I stripped my bike down to just the essentials: a frame, fork, bars, crankset, and wheels. Just too see what I could do with that. I was in my own world. I went back to the beginning, to the rewards that got me interested in the first place. Just riding. Not competing, not endorsing, nothing else but discovering what I could do with my bike and my body. I wasn’t in a class any more.
People ask me if all this trauma and suffering was worth it. I’ve invented over one hundred original ramp tricks. I can roll in and catch fifteen feet of air without pedaling. I’ve felt the rush of taking off my hands during 540s spun eleven feet out. I’ve jumped my bike off the edge of a thirty two-hundred-foot cliff. I’ve shot up a ramp to see what the ground looks like from fifty feet above it and rode away from peril. I’ve ridden for crowds of screaming people, eighty thousand strong. And I’ve ridden by myself, where the only sound was my breath and my tires singing on plywood for hours on end, when there was no else left to ride with.
None of it would have ever happened if I thought the pain and suffering it would take to ride my bike and follow my heart wasn’t worth it. If you want to experience life’s pleasures, you have to be willing to take all the pain and failures.
I love what I do. No regrets.Abstract
Cluster size distribution and collision‐induced dissociation (CID) studies of protonated methanol and protonated methanol—water clusters yield information on the structure and energetics of such ions. Ions were formed at atmospheric pressure in a corona discharge source, and were subjected to CID in the center quadrupole of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Cluster ions containing up to 13 molecules of methanol and/or water were observed and examined using CID experiments. The CID of all (CH3OH)n · H2O · H+ clusters, where n ⩽ 8, showed that water loss was statistically favored over methanol loss and that the preferred dissociation channel involved loss of water with methanol molecules. These results support a model employing a chain of hydrogen‐bonded solvent molecules rather than one in which fused rings of ligands surround a central hydronium ion. However, CID of larger clusters, where n ⩾ 9, showed that loss of one methanol was equal to or less than loss of water, reflecting a change in structure.

With calcium, this component provides mineralization and strength of the skeleton, maturation and hardness of tooth enamel. Which foods contain fluorine the most is described in the article.The component is necessary for the normal growth of hair and nails. Fluoride is involved in important physiological cycles, strengthens the immune system, removes heavy metals, toxins. With the help of a microelement, the vital activity of acid-forming bacteria is suppressed. Fluoride provides a suspension of caries.What is the best way to consume?Many experts recommend drinking green tea and get this microelement with it, but it has many contraindications. In addition, it is a dehydrating drink.Thermal treatment is harmful to volatile fluorine, and tea that is brewed with boiling water is not a living product. You should consider this feature of the component of interest when cooking.It is advisable to use the sources in their original form - raw. Do not put them in aluminum dishes, which leads to the loss of fluoride. In addition, a large amount of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium complicates the absorption of fluoride.Where is present?One third of the component comes with food, so foods containing fluoride are good for your health. But most come with water. Since the natural trace element is present in a bound state, its concentration in living organisms is very small. An exception is tea and sea fish.Most of the component is lost during cooking. If dishes are cooked in aluminum dishes, it reacts with the material and is removed from the food. It will not be possible to compensate for the lack of fluoride with the help of a uniform diet, therefore, doctors prescribe not fluids, but fluorinated drugs. And which foods contain fluorine the most will be discussed later.Plant productsWith a lack of component, it is important to eat foods rich in fluoride. This component is a lot:in cereals - bran, rice, buckwheat;vegetables - pumpkin, potato, onion;fruittea;wine, grape, tomato, orange juice;honey;prunes, almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds;spices and herbs;pickles.The source of fluoride in wine is a chemical sprayed onto a vine. Its concentration may be high.Fluoride ions have the ability to move from leaves to solution, so when tea and broths are infused, 70-90% of it “migrates” to water. Little “gives” the mineral chamomile - 5%, while rosehip - 20%, mint - 30%.In tea (100 ml), 10,000 micrograms of fluorine are present, and in mineral water - 800. Walnut contains 865 micrograms of the component. The daily micronutrient rate will provide 300 g of walnuts. Products containing fluorine are saturated with this component when used in moderation.Animal productsThere are animal products that contain large amounts of fluoride. He is present:in meat;liverbones on bones, poultry, canned fish;milk;fishseafood, shellfish.Salmon (700 g) covers the daily need for fluoride. It is advisable to cook fish with bones, as this saturates the body with a large amount of trace elements than fillets.Mackerel (100 g) contains 1400 micrograms of fluorine, and 1000 in its tuna. These are products containing fluorine and calcium. In cod, blue whiting, pollock, hake of this component 700 mcg, in haddock - 500. Products containing fluorine must be present in the human diet.Daily rateIt is difficult to establish the boundary between excess and lack of component. Fluoride in products is very small, so an overdose is not terrible.An adult's body weighing up to 70 kg contains about 2-3 g of fluoride. Its norm per day is 0.5-4 mg and depends on age, weight, energy consumption, region, nutrition. For example, children 6–9 years old require 1.1 mg, adolescents 14–18 require 1.5 mg, and after 18 years, 1.7–4.Pregnant women and people with physical labor need 2 mg of mineral every day. With osteoporosis, the norm rises.a lack ofFoods containing fluorine are important in sufficient quantities. Deficiency does not lead to severe symptoms, so people usually do not go to the doctor. The disadvantage is:to the destruction of bone tissue;high sensitivity of teeth;fragility, fragility of nails;hair loss, section of the ends;anemia;osteoporosis;curvature of the spine;periodontal disease;caries;visual impairment.Therefore, measures should be followed. If there is a lack of component, the doctor may prescribe medication. It is important to complete the entire course of treatment.ExcessFluoride in food is able to make up the deficit only with moderate consumption. But the component is poisonous if it comes in more than 20 mg. An overdose is considered dangerous. Excess leads to:to slow growth, cessation of cell division;general weakness;drowsinessnauseaskin rash;complete loss of voice;crampstrembling fingers;bleeding gums;inhibition of the kidneys, liver, thyroid gland.Also, difficulty breathing, lowering pressure. The bones will be rough, leading to muscle and joint pain. When fluoride poisoning appears conjunctivitis, lacrimation, pneumonia, irritation of the bronchi, skin, severe abdominal pain, diarrhea.With excess fluoride, fluorosis can occur - a disease in which gray-brown spots, deformation of joints, destruction of bone tissue occur on enamel. Wrinkles and white hard patches form on the skin. Fluorosis appears in the presence of 0.5 mg of fluorine per 1 kg of mass.Signs of an overdose occur gradually, so with a slight ailment you need to visit a doctor. If medical care is not timely, treatment is delayed for a long time.To eliminate excess fluoride ions, you should eat foods rich in calcium, as well as take drugs (calcium gluconate), laxatives (sodium sulfate). Means with magnesium do not allow the absorption of the mineral.If there is poisoning with this component, you should induce vomiting and wash the stomach.Best Sources for KidsA growing body definitely needs this component, since it is involved in the formation of healthy bones and teeth, strengthening enamel and preventing dental ailments. Lack of component leads to developmental disorders.But this does not mean that from an early age children should be stuffed with bioadditives with F. It is necessary to feed them with natural products. Excess component also negatively affects health. For children, the best sources of fluoride are:Tea. It should be administered from an early age.Pickles. Cucumbers added to the salad are well saturated with fluoride.The grape juice. This favorite drink enriches with a microelement. Only it should be natural juice, without preservatives and chemicals.Spinach. This vegetable, like the other green leafy vegetables, gives strength and serves as a source of valuable vitamins.Tomatoes All dishes with tomatoes are rich in fluoride. Useful and juice from tomatoes.Carrot. Made without salt, but with some added vegetable oil is a nutritious side dish.Orange juice. If there is no allergy to such a drink, then at least once a week you can give your child fresh citrus.Asparagus. It is served whole or mashed.Beet. From vegetables you can cook borsch, salads, juices.Prunes It is added to compotes, desserts.Children under 2 years old are prone to food allergies. Therefore, these products must be administered carefully, slowly. Only after getting used can the dose be increased.Gastronomic tipsTo come up with a fluorine-rich menu is easy. You just need to know what products it is in. Soups made on bones, poultry broths are considered a hearty dish, concentrated source F. You only need to check the quality of the meat.Freshly prepared food is the best. But canned food is also suitable. For example, fish are recognized as the best sources of fluoride. In this case, you need to check the quality and freshness of the product. In addition to canned food, fresh fish is suitable. The main thing is that it needs to be boiled, stewed or baked with bones.Toxic sourcesProbably everyone knows about fluorinated water that enters homes through public water supplies. In the tap fluid there is an inorganic form of fluorine. And this, according to doctors, is not the safest method of replenishing mineral reserves. Do not use this water for cooking for children.An increased concentration of fluoride is in wine. But to attribute this drink to useful is difficult, because the source of the component is the pesticide that was used to process the plant. Cryolite is used, which is considered a harmful agent from insect pests. The concentration of the component in a glass of wine is greater than in 1 liter of fluorinated water. You should choose quality products to maintain vitamin and mineral balance.Where else is fluoride?In addition to products, there are drugs with this component:"ACT" - is used to prevent the occurrence of caries. This is a gel applied to teeth. A film is formed with it, which saturates the enamel with fluorine."Koreberon" - a means of having anti-caries, anti-rachitic, trophic effects. It is prescribed for osteoporosis. The drug has many side effects and contraindications.Sodium fluoride. It is used as a prevention of caries in children and adults. It is used after consultation with a specialist.You should consult your doctor about the use of fluoride medications. They should not be taken arbitrarily because of the likelihood of causing great harm to health. Usually, a doctor prescribes medicines only when absolutely necessary, and in most cases the component can be obtained from products.Fluorine is indispensable for the formation of bone tissue and teeth, but a slight excess causes serious irreversible effects. Lack of component causes less harm, therefore, the content of micronutrient coming from food should not be controlled.Stacey is a NZIPP Accredited Professional Photographer based in the Wellington region of New Zealand’s North Island.
Hi Stacey can you please tell us about yourself?
I was born and raised in South Africa and have been living in New Zealand for the past ten years. I have two beautiful teenage children and have been married for 15 years. We added a new baby to the family when we moved to New Zealand, you will see her featured a lot in my social media…her name is Opal and she is the sweetest Cavalier King Charles Spaniel you will ever meet. I am based in Wainuiomata, Lower Hutt and just love the Wellington region.
Why did you choose to pursue a career in photography?
I always loved taking photos. I am a strong believer in capturing moments in life that would otherwise be lost in time. When I had my daughter I realized very quickly how important it was to capture her every milestone. It was not until we moved to New Zealand that I was able to focus on my passion for photography full time. Capturing the true essence of who we truly are makes me happy, and nothing inspires me more than seeing the joy on families faces when they see their beautiful portraits for the first time, it’s a special moment!
What makes shooting children and babies so special?
Our babies grow up so quickly, and documenting their milestones is so incredibly important! I have always loved babies and children, there is something magical about them. It was a no-brainer that this would be the field that I would specialize in.
Working with newborns takes a lot of patience and there is a lot more to consider when working with these new babies. Safety is a big priority for me in the studio, and ensuring that they are in a safe and warm environment is key. This is also a time where most new parents leave the house with their new baby for the very first time, and what a privilege it is to know that they are entrusting me with their precious new baby! The best part is having my newborns back as they reach their milestones, being able to document those gorgeous baby rolls, those little giggles, those first steps and seeing their personalities come through.
What has been your biggest challenge so far?
My biggest challenge so far would have to be my self confidence. We are sometimes so quick to compare ourselves to others but we forget that we are all on completely different journeys of life. It has taken me ten years to finally realize that there will be many trends in this industry, but keeping true to my own style and doing what I love most is what is most important for my own business. I also worked out of my home for most of the ten years which I found incredibly challenging, and have only recently purposely built my studio. This has been a life changer for me and the studio is my dream come true. I have created a warm and cosy space for my clients to relax in whilst I work my magic. The studio is my new happy place, and you will often find me in there pottering around, tidying up and admiring all the beautiful props that I have collected over the years.
What compliment has touched you the most or what do you think is your biggest accomplishment?
I would say that my biggest accomplishment is the build of my studio. It was a dream of mine for as long as I can remember, and with a lot of tears along the way my dream was finally realized at the end of last year. Everyone that comes into the studio always compliments me on the space and that really means the world to me. I want every family to enjoy the space, I want them to feel relaxed and at home and to love it as much as I do.
What 3 words describe your photography style?
My photography style would be described as natural, timeless and moody.
What makes the good picture stand out from the average?
Anyone can pick up a camera and take a photo, the ability to take a good photograph is when you can convey emotion, and when you can tell a story through the image that you’ve captured.
How do you practice and improve your client base?
Most of my client base comes from word of mouth. Every client means so much to me and I treat them like I would my closest friends. They trust me and the service I provide and happily refer me to others.
Do you have a funny story from a shoot you would like to share?
I am known to be the “baby whisperer”, and often have parents joking around and saying that they will have me added to their speed dial.
Why did you join NZIPP, and start on the path of becoming Accredited?
Being a self taught photographer I wanted to ensure that I pushed my boundaries and wanted to continue to grow as a photographer. NZIPP is the perfect place for this. I finally took the leap and became an Accredited member in 2018.

Keywords:anti-bacterial agents, antimicrobial stewardship, pharmacy service, hospital
Abstract
Objective: To identify the frequency of pharmaceutical interventions performed and accepted by the physicians and the cost savings generated by the switch therapy of the association of ampicillin and sulbactam to the association of amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate in adult patients in a hospital complex. Methods: Observational cross-sectional study, based on the assessment of adult patients in intravenous use of the association of ampicillin and sulbactam for more than three days, from April to June 2021. Sampling was done for convenience. Interventions suggesting the change to the tablet of the association of amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate were performed through standard alert and evolution in the electronic health record of eligible patients. Acceptance was verified by followup of the new prescription. If not accepted, a new intervention was performed in 48 hours. Cost savings were calculated based on the average cost of medicines and medical supplies, available on the institution’s computerized system. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: A total of 322 patients were evaluable, of which 174 (54,0%) were considered eligible for the switch therapy. A total of 226 pharmaceutical interventions were performed, in which 14 (6,2%) were accepted by the physicians, generating savings of US$912,56. Conclusions: Pharmaceutical interventions recommending the switch therapy of the association of ampicillin and sulbactam had low adherence by the physicians, but, despite this, they presented a significant potential for cost savings. To obtain better results, it is necessary to promote the education of the clinical staff and improve communication between pharmacists and physicians..With the advancement of the technology, we are left with no-guessing-thing at all on the water to locate where the fishes are pooling around, and this makes possible with owning the high-end best fish finder under $200 to hook one up before seating into your favorite kayak. Back in the time, instincts were the only way […]Scientific Method Vocabulary Scientific Method- a thoughtful process of steps for solving a problem. It uses experimentation to explore ideas and answer questions. Experiment- a series of steps designed to answer a question Data- information collected from the experiment Problem- the question to be answered Hypothesis an educated guess it answers the problem question it must be testable created before the experiment is done Example: The bowling ball will roll down the hill the fastest. **you do not need to say because** Procedure- the steps in the experiment Independent Variable- the part of the experiment that you control (ex: the type of ball or hill used) Dependent Variable- the part of the experiment that you observe or measure (ex: how fast the ball is rolling, the time it took the ball to roll, etc.) Constant- things in the experiment that stay the same (ex: the hill, where on the hill you let the ball go) Control- the part of the experiment that you do not test (ex: which fruit juice lets plants grow better?- control would be the plant that you just give water so that you have something to compare to because you are not testing it with juice) Calculations- math that is done in the lab Analysis-where calculations are done and the data is reviewed Conclusions Accept or reject the hypothesis Summarize the results of the lab Decide if the experiment is over or if a new experiment should begin Example: I accept the hypothesis that the bowling ball will roll down the hill the fastest. The bowling ball rolled down the hill in 2 seconds, the baseball in 5 seconds, and the ping pong ball in 8 seconds, therefore the bowling ball was the ball to have rolled down the hill the fastest. I believe the experiment is over and I do not need to do another because my question was answered. Vocabulary Practice ActivityNoah is interested in figuring out if ice melts at different speeds depending on the color of block he sets the ice on. Noah has five wood blocks. Four are painted: green, red, blue and white. What is Noah’s problem? Write a hypothesis for Noah’s problem. Create a procedure to test the hypothesis. Create a control for the experiment. Create a constant for the experiment. Identify the independent variable. Identify the dependant variable. What sort of data should he observe and record? Create a sample conclusion. Problem- What color of wood will melt ice the fastest? Sample Hypothesis- The ice will melt fastest on the wooden block painted blue. Control- Melting the ice cube on the unpainted block. Constant- size of wood block, size of ice cube, room temperature, type of paint Procedure- 1. Place ice on blocks. 2. Start stopwatch. 3. Wait for ice cubes to melt. 4. Note the time it took each ice cube to melt. Independent Variable-The color of wooden blocks Dependent Variable-melting time Observable Data-time it takes for the ice to melt Sample Conclusion- My hypothesis was accepted. The ice on the blue block melted in 1 min. The ice on the green block melted in 1 min. and 30 seconds. The ice on the red block melted in 2 min. The white block melted in 3 min. The experiment does not need to be done again because the problem was completely answered. The Scientific Method 1. Problem a. Asks a question 2. Hypothesis a. Do some research b.

Scheduled interview dates this year are Monday, December 13, 2021 for the Clinical Assessment and Interventions Custer, Friday, December 17,2021 for the Public Service and Minority Cluster and a combined Cluster interview date on Friday, January 7, 2022
The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Clinical Psychology Training Program in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences offers a two-year fellowship opportunity within the scientist-practitioner model. The Predoctoral Fellowship consists of an APA-accredited clinical internship followed by a one-year postdoctoral clinical and clinical research fellowship. Our Fellows are selected from applicants whose achievements reflect a strong commitment to pursue careers emphasizing research and training in academic/research settings, including those affiliated with health and mental health service systems. Over the last ten years, 93% of our graduates have obtained research or academic positions upon leaving our program. Increasing the number of women and minorities in academic and research positions is one of our goals. During the last ten years, 79% of our Fellows have been women, and 44% have been minorities.
The program offers training in health service delivery in a wide variety of clinical settings. The predoctoral year provides general internship training in clinical psychology. Selected involvement in clinical work continues through the second, postdoctoral year, in which there is an emphasis on clinical research within the area of specialization. The amount and distribution of clinical hours in the program meet APA internship accreditation standards as well as general licensure requirements.The program provides specialized research training with a faculty mentor in areas including ADHD/behavior disorders, eating disorders, juvenile justice and behavioral health, neuropsychology, substance use treatment research and research-practice linkages, and violence and trauma in adults and children.
The program is designed to train clinical psychologists who are committed to an academic and/or research career, have a strong record of both clinical and research experience, and want to work sensitively and competently with underserved and vulnerable populations.
In addition to our standard full-time two year pre/postdoctoral fellowship, we have added a half-time two year internship track through a partial affiliation with the Clinical Science Program in the Dept. of Psychology at the University of California Berkeley (UCB) as described in our brochure. PLEASE NOTE: Only UCB applicants are elegible for this internship-only two-year half-time.Free Download MOD APK Android Immortal Rogue

Formally announced following the kick-off meeting which took place last November (2018), the librehosters network carries core values similar to those of CHATONS.
The biggest difference is that, while CHATONS is not strictly restricted to France (as we can attest), it is a French collective, engaging and debating in French language.
Librehosters has been conceived from the start as an international network of online service providers (hosters) aiming at gathering entities of all kind around common values. The librehosters charter is still a work in progress, however the defining values can be summarised as:
- Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS)
- Decentralisation for a healthier Internet
- Full disclosure and transparency
- Public sharing of knowledge
- Diversity: each hoster comes with his/her own solution
- No data monetisation (Your life, Your data)
- Solidarity
Needless to say, we see nothing wrong with those values!
Keep on rocking in a free world
Nomagic is thrilled to join the librehosters network. I hope we will find the time and opportunity to take part and provide meaningful contributions to this great endeavour.
If you are curious or/and are yourself a service hosting provider that would like to know more, feel free to visit the librehosters forum, which already contains a lot of resources and discussions about the project.

Did you ever think of giving up your car?
When I posed this question to my wife several years ago, she rolled her eyes and the bubbles above her head flashed the words “Ridiculous!” “Impossible!” “Recycling and composting are fine, dear,” I heard her thoughts missile toward me, “but this is going way too far.”
I felt like Galileo proposing a heliocentric universe to Pope Urban VIII. Suddenly, I was questioning a sacred tradition. After all, this was the way the world had been since the ancient Greeks. Wasn’t it Heraclitus who said that to be fully human one needed locomotion, preferably in a Lexus? I suddenly was asking with Prufrock, “Do I dare disturb the Universe?”
After a cup of tea, though, some calmness settled onto the conversation. She and I were able to discuss pros and cons of not renewing the lease on our car now that we were living in the city. On the plus side, we knew that we would save some money—some estimates claim an annual savings of $7000—and it would be environmentally beneficial. According to Pollution Probe, an average lightweight car in Canada annually spews 4480 kilograms of carbon monoxide, 200 kilograms of carbon dioxide, and a noxious soup of other gases.
On the downside, we knew that it would be an inconvenience. We would be dependent on public transit, shopping would be more labour intensive, and if we had an emergency with our young son, we would have to rely on friends, cab, or ambulance.
After several months and many tea-ridden colloquies, however, my wife joined me in the heliocentric universe. We gave up the car. (During our first “car-less” weekend, my wife rented a car. It sat in the driveway.)
Interestingly, we both viewed the prospect as primarily a sacrifice. But a funny thing happened on the way to a car-challenged lifestyle. We gradually became aware of unforeseen benefits, silver linings that “came dropping slow” into our horizon of awareness.
First, we noticed less stress in our lives. Instead of waiting till the last minute to get somewhere, plopping in the car, snaking our way through traffic snarls and snarling motorists, and bickering about what would have been the best route to take, we found our travel was more relaxed on public transit. I also wasn’t burdened with a low-grade anxiety about getting a ticket, or being towed, or changing the oil, or driving through lousy weather.
Secondly, we found on the streetcar or subway that we could talk together as a family. Our streetcar time became a family story time. After dropping off our son, my wife and I would then often walk downtown to work together. Car-less living had led to enhanced family bonding. Thirdly, we noticed a marked decrease in impulse buying. We were much less likely to go out in -20 degree weather or a rain-soaked evening to get a video or a dessert or some other non-essential without a car. Also, we were reluctant to buy anything larger than a loaf of bread without serious strategizing.
Less stress. Increased family bonding. Diminished consumerism. We had not counted on these when we decided to relinquish our vehicle. These were for us spiritual as well as material benefits. As Canada ponders the sacrifices and costs of a Kyoto accord, perhaps we might view striving for societal sustainability as not just a matter of sacrifice. This isn’t about everyone giving up one’s car; it’s about discerning how we are to relate to this new ecological moment. Sometimes fundamental changes make room in your life for new and fine things to happen. It’s not just about sacrifice, but about making a space for a novel and possibly enhanced way of life. It may also hold hidden harvests for the spiritual and material well-being, not only of our families and nation, but of our larger household, the Earth.

I’m impressed, I must say. Rarely do I encounter a blog that’s both equally
educative and amusing, and let me tell you,
you have hit the nail on the head. The problem is something that too few folks are speaking intelligently about.
Now i’m very happy I found this during my hunt for something relating to this.
Transit, bikes, walking, and rentals if and when they’re needed! I’m a believer. Thank you for listing several concrete spiritual goodies that came your way as a result of walking away from the car. As usual, your thoughts are inspiring! Thank you./cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52101669/594344698.0.jpeg)
Having bagged a goal for Reading, Dom Samuel is now being touted for a transfer to Hull City or Sunderland. Yes, you read that right. Having barely made enough Championship appearances to count on two hands, the forward is considered by some as the man who could be called upon to fire a top-flight club to safety.
The news comes via Daily Mirror, who believe that the Tigers and Black Cats are taking an interest in Samuel, having recently bagged against the mighty Burton Albion.
Of course, don't take our dismissive tone as a sign that the Englishman isn't doing well. He's doing fine. Not Premier League fine, but fine nonetheless. Perhaps his all round game needs some work but for the moment the best place for him is in amongst the Reading squad, fighting for starts and making the most of what opportunities are bestowed upon him.
Would you sell Samuel to Sunderland? Is he ready for the step up? Comment below.620 F.2d 47
Carl McCULLOCH and Nora Dell McCulloch,
Plaintiffs-Appellees, Cross-Appellants,
v.
Thomas GLASGOW et al., Defendants-Appellants, Cross-Appellees.
No. 78-1732.
United States Court of Appeals,
Fifth Circuit.
June 23, 1980.
Carl F. Andre, Jackson, Miss., for defendants-appellants, cross-appellees.
James D. Waide, III, West Point, Miss., for plaintiffs-appellees, cross-appellants.
Appeals from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi.
Before GODBOLD, GARZA and RANDALL, Circuit Judges.
GODBOLD, Circuit Judge:
This suit arises out of efforts of the town of Ackerman, Mississippi, to build a street on a strip of land of disputed ownership. The town claims to have acquired by prescription an easement for a public street along the strip, which is located across the front of the lot on which the home of plaintiffs is located. The plaintiffs, Carl and Nora Dell McCulloch, have no record title to the strip, but claim that by adverse possession they have acquired title in fee simple to the strip, unencumbered by the town's alleged prescriptive easement.
With knowledge of plaintiffs' claim of title and without taking action to determine or settle the competing claims between it and plaintiffs, the town knocked down plaintiffs' fences, bulldozed the strip, and built a street on it.
Plaintiffs sued the town and Mayor Thomas Glasgow, asserting a federal claim (under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983) for damages for taking of property without due process and a state claim for damages for taking property without just compensation in violation of Mississippi Constitution § 17.
In answer to Rule 49(a) interrogatories the jury made these critical findings: plaintiff Carl McCulloch acquired ownership of the strip of land by adverse possession; the strip was taken by the town without payment of just compensation; whether or not Carl McCulloch had title to the strip of land he had a legitimate or bona fide claim of entitlement to it and the town intruded upon this claim without due process; Mayor Glasgow authorized the intrusion upon the land with malicious intent to deprive Carl McCulloch of his constitutional rights or cause other injuries to him. Judgment was entered for $20,000 actual damages against the town and Mayor Glasgow and $5,000 punitive damages against Glasgow alone.
Defendants appeal. We reverse.I. The state and federal claims
Award of damages based on the state claim for taking without just compensation cannot stand. The court did not instruct the jury that the plaintiffs could not claim rights in the contested strip of land based upon holding adversely against the town, and the defendants properly objected. Defendants are correct that under Mississippi law one may not hold adversely against a municipality. Bright v. Michel, 242 Miss. 738, 137 So.2d 155, 158 (1962); Grayson v. Robinson, 240 Miss. 59, 126 So.2d 247, 249 (1961); Melvin v. Parker, 223 Miss. 430, 78 So.2d 477 (1955); City of Ellisville v. Webb, 151 Miss. 302, 117 So. 836, 838 (1928); Witherspoon v. City of Meridian, 69 Miss. 288, 13 So. 843 (1891); see also Miss.Const. art. 4, § 104. If the town had acquired an easement by prescription and had not abandoned it, plaintiffs could not by adverse possession acquire title free and clear of the town's easement. The jury instructions thus permitted a finding inconsistent with Mississippi law. Plaintiffs contend that adverse possession against the town is practically the same as abandonment by the town and that the jury was properly instructed on abandonment. The argument has no merit. Adverse possession and abandonment are different concepts and are governed by different bodies of law. Because of this error in the instructions the jury's findings on the state claim cannot stand, and to the extent the judgment is based on these findings it must be reversed.
Next we turn to the federal due process claim. The plaintiffs possessed a sufficient property interest in the land to entitle them to a due process hearing. In order to trigger the requirement of a hearing, title to the property need not be undisputed. Plaintiffs need allege only a "significant property interest." Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 266, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 1053, 55 L.Ed.2d 252, 266 (1978). Regardless of the ultimate success of plaintiffs' claim of title to the property, the conflict between their arguable unencumbered title and the town's arguable easement was sufficient to create a significant property interest entitling plaintiffs to a due process hearing. Denial of such hearing was an actionable wrong independent of the uncompensated taking. Carey v. Piphus, supra; Fuentes v. Shevin, 404 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972). Thus an award of some damages was appropriate under the jury's findings. But the substantial amount awarded cannot stand. It is not possible to tell whether the jury based damages on actual injury suffered as a result of the taking, actual injury suffered as a result of the denial of a hearing, or injury presumed from the denial of a hearing. Carey v. Piphus, supra, prohibits any but nominal damages for presumed but unproven injury that arises solely from the denial of a hearing.1 Thus, to the extent the judgment is based upon the federal claim, it must be reversed. Smalling v. Epperson, 435 U.S. 948, 98 S.Ct. 1572, 55 L.Ed.2d 797 (1978); Newman v. Board of Education of City School Dist. of N. Y., 594 F.2d 299, 306 & n. 5 (2d Cir. 1979); Burt v. Abel, 585 F.2d 613, 616 (4th Cir. 1978); see also, Halperin v. Kissinger, 606 F.2d 1192, 1207 n. 100 (D.C.Cir.), pet. for cert. filed, --- U.S. ----, 100 S.Ct. 1308, 63 L.Ed.2d 757, (1979); Skehan v. Board of Trustees of Bloomsburg State College, 590 F.2d 470, 493 n. 3 (3d Cir. 1978), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 100 S.Ct. 61, 62 L.Ed.2d 41 (1979); Hernandez del Valle v. Aponte, 575 F.2d 321, 324 (1st Cir. 1978).
II. Joinder
Defendants contend that the heirs of the original owners, against whom the plaintiffs claim adversely, should have been joined as indispensable parties under F.R.Civ.P. 19. They did not, however, raise this issue by proper motion before the trial court.
Defendants correctly argue that the interests of the unjoined parties must be considered in a Rule 19 motion. Schutten v. Shell Oil Co., 421 F.2d 869 (5th Cir. 1970); Broussard v. Columbia Gulf Transmission Co., 398 F.2d 885 (5th Cir. 1968). However, a district court judgment that plaintiffs were entitled to a due process hearing would not adversely affect the heirs. As we noted earlier, plaintiffs need only show a "significant property interest" in order to compel the town to afford them a hearing. Such an interest is not necessarily incompatible with claims of property rights by heirs of the former owner. Moreover, the heirs would not be bound by the court's decision under either federal or Mississippi law. See U. S. v. Maine, 420 U.S. 515, 95 S.Ct. 1155, 43 L.Ed.2d 363 (1975); Drier v. Tarpon Oil Co., 522 F.2d 199, 200 (5th Cir. 1975); Dudley v. Smith, 504 F.2d 979, 982 (5th Cir. 1974); Southern Naval Stores Co. v. Price, 202 Miss. 116, 32 So.2d 575 (1947); Skrmetta v. Moore, 202 Miss. 585, 30 So.2d 53 (1947).
Thus, although the defendants' failure to raise the issue in the district court does not constitute a waiver, Kimball v. Florida Bar, 537 F.2d 1305, 1307 (5th Cir. 1976), we find that no purpose would be served by requiring joinder under the circumstances presented here. See Sierra Club v. Hathaway, 579 F.2d 1162, 1166 (9th Cir. 1978) ("when the judgment appealed from does not in a practical sense prejudicially affect the interests of the absent parties, and those who are parties have failed to object to non-joinder in the trial court, the reviewing court will not dismiss an otherwise valid judgment").2
III. Other issues
The jury found that plaintiffs were not afforded due process. The defendants' contention that this finding was not supported by sufficient evidence is frivolous.
In support of the claim for damages, plaintiffs submitted evidence that as a consequence of the taking Carl McCulloch suffered a heart attack. Defendants incorrectly assert that unless there is a physical impact damages for mental or emotional suffering are not recoverable in Mississippi. See First National Bank v. Langley, 314 So.2d 324 (Miss.1975).3
Defendants also argue that because the heart attack was not foreseeable, plaintiffs may not recover damages. This argument fails on two grounds. Foreseeability applies only in negligence cases. An intentional tortfeasor is held to a higher standard in Mississippi. State ex rel. Richardson v. Edgeworth, 214 So.2d 579 (Miss.1968). The jury found that Mayor Glasgow acted with malicious intent. Moreover, even if defendants' liability is predicated solely on negligence, under Mississippi law the particular harm to plaintiff need not be foreseeable. "The gist of the action (is) the unreasonable exposure of the (plaintiff) to a foreseeable risk of some harm." Billups Petroleum Co. v. Entrekin, 209 Miss. 302, 46 So.2d 781, 784 (1950); see also Marshall Durbin, Inc. v. Tew, 362 So.2d 601, 603 (Miss.1978); Griffin v. Harkey, 215 So.2d 866, 868-69 (Miss.1968); Nobles v. Unruh, 198 So.2d 245, 248 (Miss.1967); Brewer v. Town of Lucedale, 189 Miss. 374, 198 So. 42, 45 (1940); Magers v. Okolona, Houston & Calhoun City R. Co., 174 Miss. 860, 165 So. 416 (1936). The heart attack itself need not have been foreseeable if defendants reasonably should have foreseen that their actions would expose plaintiffs to risk of some otherwise compensable injury.
Punitive damages may also be awarded in a § 1983 action even without actual loss, despite local law to the contrary. See, e. g., Silver v. Cormier, 529 F.2d 161, 163 (10th Cir. 1976); Spence v. Staras, 507 F.2d 554, 558 (7th Cir. 1974); Stolberg v. Board of Trustees, 474 F.2d 485, 489 (2d Cir. 1973); Mansell v. Saunders, 372 F.2d 573, 576 (5th Cir. 1967).
Defendants also challenge the district court's jurisdiction over the town. The action against the town was originally brought under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 for claims allegedly arising directly under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Supreme Court has recently upheld such a direct cause of action in the context of due process violations. Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 99 S.Ct. 2264, 60 L.Ed.2d 846 (1979). Moreover, while only Mayor Glasgow was amenable to suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 at the time the suit was first brought, Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), jurisdiction under § 1983 now extends to both the mayor and the town. Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). There are therefore no remaining jurisdictional barriers to the suit against the town. See Kingsville Independent School District v. Cooper, 611 F.2d 1109 (5th Cir. 1980). Finally, defendants' objection that they were erroneously deprived of a good faith defense is patently without merit, as an instruction on good faith, patterned on Wood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975), was given by the trial judge.
Other issues raised by defendants are not likely to occur in a retrial.
V. Attorneys' fees
Should plaintiffs prevail on retrial they are entitled to attorneys' fees against both defendants under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust. Concerned Democrats of Florida v. Reno, 601 F.2d 891 (5th Cir. 1979); Morrow v. Dillard, 580 F.2d 1284 (5th Cir. 1978). Any award should include fees for services rendered on this appeal and remand therefrom. Kingsville Independent School District v. Cooper, 611 F.2d 1109 (5th Cir. 1980); Johnson v. Mississippi, 606 F.2d 635 (5th Cir. 1979).
REVERSED.
If the jury found, as it could have, that plaintiffs suffered no actual injury from the denial of a hearing, any award based upon taking of their land without due process would arguably suffer the same defect as the award under the state claim for taking without compensation. Possibly the error in instruction was so placed in the overall jury instructions that it related to only the state claim. Since our decision on the federal claim is based on other grounds, we need not decide this point
However, there is no jurisdictional barrier to joinder should the trial court determine on retrial that joinder is advisable and feasible. We merely decline to require joinderCum on face Kiev

As we meet and greet our relatives and friends, we end up gorging on some heavy food too. We tend to overeat and treat our tastebuds with all things decadent, calorie-laden and deep-fried. As a result, not only do our diets go for a toss but this also causes an impact on digestive health. Many people complain of digestive issues during the festive season such as acidity, bloating and constipation. However, it is definitely possible to eat tasty food without having digestive issues during festive season. Wondering how? Celebrity Nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar shared some quick tips in her latest IGTV video. Take a look:

Celebrity Nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar revealed five simple tips to tackle ABC issues, aka Acidity, Bloating, and Constipation. She said these issues were common during the festive season when we end up bingeing late at night and face trouble the next morning. Celebrity Nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar recommended a mixture of Gulkand and water first thing in the morning to soothe the stomach and cool it from within. In case Gulkand is not available, a few crushed rose petals could be used. This will ensure zero bloating and also ease constipation.
Next, Diwekar suggested eating half a banana with the regular lunch meal. This would make all the digestive issues disappear and smoothen out the bowel movement. She further also recommended trying rice pej or kanji in the evening to curb sugar cravings and keep the digestive system healthy at all times.
Apart from these tips, celebrity nutritionist Diwekar also suggested a 15-minute nap in mid-morning and Yoga in the evening to further reduce bloating and all the other digestive ailments.

Topic: METABOLIC SYNDROME
In the UK, researchers compared exercise habits of 1500 middle-aged dog owners and gym goers. They found the average dog owner walked approximately 676 miles a year while gym goers clock up 216 miles less on exercise machines. In addition, 92% of dog owners stayed with their exercise routine through the years while only 52% of gym members continued to workout regularly after two or three months.
Are You At Risk?
• How much do you know about your health?
• What are the 5 indicators of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes risk?
• Exactly what is Metabolic Syndrome and do you have it?
Look inside and learn how you can lower your risk – beginning right now….
Are You at Risk?.
In their online Patient Page, the editors of the Journal of the American Medical Association describe the five indicators:
• Waist circumference greater than 40 inches for men or 35 inches for women
• High serum triglycerides (blood fat)
• High blood pressure
• Low levels of high-density lipoprotein, known as HDL or “good cholesterol”
• Fasting blood sugar more than 110 mg/dL (hyperglycemia)2
Metabolic Syndrome was originally called Syndrome X, a name coined by Gerald Reaven, MD, Professor Emeritus of the Standford University School of Medicine. A world-renowned endocrinologist, Reaven uncovered the syndrome through his research. It results from metabolic changes that tend to occur in individuals who are insulin resistant. (See sidebar.) Noting that people with a family member who has had a heart attack are more likely to experience CVD, Reaven and others suggest there may also be a genetic component to Metabolic Syndrome (Syndrome X). Reaven discusses the syndrome in detail in Syndrome X: Overcoming the Silent Killer that Can Give You a Heart Attack. (See “Resources” on the back page.)
Another book titled Syndrome X: The Complete Nutritional Program to Prevent and Reverse Insulin Resistance was written by Jack Challem, well known nutrition author, with Burton Berkson, MD, and Melissa Diane Smith. These authors take the view that, “Syndrome X is a nutritional disease — caused primarily by the over- consumption of refined sugars and other carbohydrates.” They point out the negative influences of both the modern “fast food” diet and the sedentary lifestyle, and provide a set of recommendations for healthier living.
The inspiration for this newsletter came from Marcia Zimmerman, CN, another nutrition expert, and her book, 7-Syndrome Healing (Nutrition Solution Publications). Co-authored by Jayson Kroner, CSN, this book re-emphasized the importance of recognizing and healing this dangerous syndrome within a context of total health. Zimmerman and Kroner discuss the importance of using a nutritional supplement program.
Each of the indicators of Metabolic Syndrome is unhealthy in and of itself, and requires healing. It is important to acknowledge that having any one of these indicators can be quite serious. Plus, there may be interactions between some supplements and prescription medications. Therefore, we advise that people with these indicators (particularly those experiencing all of them) work with a qualified health care professional.
1 Triglycerides are the chemical form in which most fat exists in food as well as in the body. Most triglycerides are stored as fat tissue (adipose). Some triglycerides circulate in the blood to provide fuel for muscles to work. However, when circulating levels chronically exceed what can be used as fuel, they become a health concern.
2 These criteria were originally set by the National Cholesterol Education’s Adult Treatment Program (ATPIII). The exact measures are available at.
3 Zimmerman’s dietary recommendations can be found in her book, 7-Color Cuisine.
Diet & Exercise!!!
Yes, here it is again. We can’t avoid it. The combination of healthy diet and regular exercise is the foundation of good health and the prevention of disease. Specifically, we use this recommendation to reduce the risk of Metabolic Syndrome.
A Therapeutic Diet
What kind of diet is recommended? Gerald Reaven, MD, who uncovered the syndrome, is our authority when it comes to dietary recommendations. In his book, Reaven recommends carefully balanced proportions of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. He cautions that some popular diets keep insulin under control, but may raise the person’s LDL levels (low-density lipoprotein or “bad” cholesterol). He adds that other diets can lower LDL levels while sending the dieter’s insulin soaring. (Similar cautions hold true for managing blood sugar levels.)
Reaven acknowledges that his dietary recommendations are controversial: consuming 45 percent of daily calories as carbohydrate, 40 percent as fat, and 15 percent, protein. Beyond this balanced intake, Reaven stresses reducing total calories and increasing exercise as the key to weight loss. In his book, there are 30-day specific meal suggestions for a daily calorie count of both 1200 and 1800 calories. There are also 100, 200, and 300 calorie snacks for modifying daily calorie intake. Each suggested menu item includes calories, fats, carbs, and cholesterol.
Zimmerman writes that there is little doubt that the obesity epidemic is behind the increase in the occurrence of Metabolic Syndrome. In 7-Syndrome Healing, Zimmerman does not detail a particular diet for those needing to lose weight and combat the syndrome. She focuses instead on the need for quality foods and supplements, recommending specific nutrients for addressing each facet of the syndrome.3
See the sidebar on the back page for the nine excellent principles created by Challem and co-writers for helping you develop a diet to combat Metabolic Syndrome.
Speaking of diet, let’s discuss triglycerides. These are naturally occurring esters of fatty acids and glycerol. The molecules compose the common fat found in food and in our bodies. There, they are involved in the transport and storage of fat. Fat is necessary to health and acts as the body’s most efficient fuel. Too much fat is the problem.
Together with high cholesterol, high triglycerides are one of the warning signs of CVD, cardiovascular disease. Unfortunately, high triglycerides can be the result of the impact that insulin resistance has on the liver. Insulin resistance leaves the liver unable to function properly; thus, there is more fat in the blood. In addition to the other recommendations for diet, exercise, and supplements, here are two healthy habits for controlling triglyceride levels: Stop smoking and limit alcohol consumption.
Get A Move On
Challem et al. state, “Moderate physical activity is vital for both preventing and reversing insulin resistance, Syndrome X, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.” At Nutrition News, we recommend walking as a perfect way to start moving. A sturdy pair of shoes is all you need. And, walking does far more than help you burn more calories.
Walking increases …
• your energy, stamina, and metabolism
• your sound restful sleep
• your muscle tone and bone density
• your HDL — the “good” cholesterol
• your blood plasma (This, in tern, brings thinner blood, reducing the risk of clotting.)
• immune response
• your wellness, fitness, and happiness!
Walking decreases …
• your risk of heart disease, some cancers, osteoporosis, and other diseases.
• your risk of diabetes by lowering blood sugars and body fat levels
• your number of sick days from work and school
• your symptoms of PMS, back pain, arthritis
• your number of colds
• your blood pressure and LDL — the “bad” cholesterol
• your negative moods
• your stress!!!
In the end, it’s not so important what type of activity you choose. The key is becoming more active and staying with it on a regular basis.
Supplements to the Rescue
By combining diet and exercise with the selective use of nutritional supplements, there is the possibility of reversing insulin resistance. The list of supplements that can be supportive to those at risk is a long one. We have chosen the nutrients we believe to be the most effective.
A multivitamin-mineral preparation is a good place to start. Vitamins A, B-6, B-12, C, D, E, and folic acid, plus the minerals zinc, magnesium, manganese, selenium, and vanadium all have helpful roles in reversing and preventing Metabolic Syndrome. Except for vanadium (as vanadyl sulphate), all these nutrients are commonly found in any vitamin-mineral formula. At Nutrition News, we recommend additional vitamins C, E, and D; additional calcium and magnesium, and an omega-3 fatty acid supplement.
The drive is on to encourage people to eat more omega-3 fatty acids (the type found in deep water fish and wild game) or take supplements. Experiments have shown that eating lots of saturated fats (from meats and dairy products) or omega-6 fats (predominate in most vegetable oils) has a high association with insulin resistance. Although many Americans have reduced their intake of saturated fats, they have increased omega-6 intake way beyond recommendations.
Challem, et al and others suggest a balanced fatty acid ratio of approximately 4 to 1 omega-6 to omega-3 fats. Depending on individual preferences fish, game, fish oils and flax seed oil can be good sources of omega-3. Zimmerman recommends that we also add CLA (conjugated linoleic acid). Because CLA is an omega-6 fatty acid, this recommendation may seem paradoxical. However, both wild and domestic animals grazed on pasture previously provided us with this fatty acid. Research at the University of Wisconsin (Madison) has shown that CLA is an aid to weight reduction, cardiovascular health, and immune system support.
Our next recommendation is chromium. One time deficient in 95 percent of the population, chromium is now the top selling mineral supplement after calcium. It aids in metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, and it also facilitates insulin functioning. In fact, chromium is one of the best natural ways to help decrease insulin resistance.
Chromium comes in various forms, and is sometimes included in multivitamin-mineral preparations. Although both chromium picolinate and polynicotinate are frequently suggested, Zimmerman recommends GTF (glucose tolerance factor) chromium specifically for blood sugar management. The recommendation for prevention is 200 mcg daily. Higher doses of 400-1,000 mcg are recommended for people who already have some symptoms. Because of its influence on lowering blood sugar levels, Zimmerman suggests that anyone with diabetes consult with their physician before supplementing with chromium.

INSULIN RESISTANCE
According to experts, the cornerstone of Metabolic Syndrome is insulin resistance. In 7-Syndrome Healing, author and nutritionist Marcia Zimmerman writes, “Insulin resistance and its related deviations in glucose metabolism have reached pandemic proportions.” She reports that worldwide 150 million people currently have type 2 diabetes, the ultimate result of this dysfunction.
What is “insulin resistance”? Insulin is a hormone secreted by the pancreas gland. It attaches to receptors on cell membranes and helps blood sugar (glucose) move into the cells. When a person is insulin resistant, the receptors don’t work properly. Insulin can’t “dock” on the membranes, and glucose doesn’t pass into the cells as it should. This means that it stays in the circulatory system. The result is high blood sugar and a multitude of health problems.
Things become even more complicated because the pancreas senses too high glucose levels and continues secreting insulin to normalize them. Thus, the body is running with both too much glucose and too much insulin. Among other effects, syrupy blood can result in premature aging, inflammation, and abnormalities in fat and protein metabolism and in immune system function. Insulin levels can be increased further by the hormone cortisol, the stress hormone.
Add Antioxidants
Nutrition News has long encouraged the use of antioxidants, both as they occur naturally in whole foods and as various supplements. In fact, we have recently written about two of the most powerful antioxidants known: PCOs (currently in print) and astaxanthin (to be published in future). They are important in combatting Metabolic Syndrome. Virtually all of them have some positive influence on glucose and insulin. Many also have anti-inflammatory properties.4
Challem cites studies in which people with diets rich in fruits and vegetables (high in antioxidants) showed a relatively low risk of heart disease, stroke, and cancer. On the other hand, Zimmerman reports a study involving 8,808 adults in which those with Metabolic Syndrome had lower levels of antioxidants (except lycopene — found in cooked tomatoes, think pizza). They also had low levels of vitamins C and E, two vitamins known for their antioxidant capacity. Zimmerman recommends a daily natural multi-carotene formula, in addition to a multivitamin-mineral formula.
Alpha lipoic acid is the most frequently recommended antioxidant for those with or at risk for diabetes. It is produced in our bodies but supplements are necessary for therapeutic results. In Germany, lipoic acid is approved for the prevention and treatment of diabetic neuropathy. Lipoic lowers blood glucose and insulin levels, reduces insulin resistance, and improves insulin sensitivity. It has been shown to deliver glucose into the cells independent of insulin. Although 250-500 mg per day are adequate, people with diabetes may need more. Amounts over 100 mg should be taken with biotin (a B vitamin found in most vitamin-mineral formulas).
PCOs (proanthocyanidins) as grape seed and pine bark extracts are very powerful antioxidants and have been shown to be effective in fighting free radicals and supporting vascular health in people with both heart disease and diabetes. Research has also shown both substances to be effective anti-inflammatories. (Most studies with pine bark extract have been conducted using Pycnogenol.) For general prevention, take 50 mg daily. Therapeutic dosages range from 150 to 300 mg per day.
Silymarin, the active ingredient in milk thistle extract (Silybum marianum) is an antioxidant worthy of special note. Historically, this herb has been associated with liver health. Air quality in particular makes liver support important to most of us. However, because liver function can be compromised by insulin resistance, this supplement is especially helpful to those at risk for Metabolic Syndrome. Silymarin is effective in helping the body break down fats, eliminate toxins, and absorb nutrients. It has also been shown to reduce insulin resistance and other symptoms of diabetes. Purchase milk thistle extract that has been standardized to 80 percent silymarin. Studies have used 200-800 mg of the herb.
Coenzyme Q10, also called CoQ10, is a vitamin-like compound produced naturally in the body. CoQ10 helps cells produce energy and acts as an antioxidant. It has been shown to stimulate the immune system, enhance gum health, and strengthen the heart. It also protects the heart from certain drug side effects, particularly from the effects of the cholesterol lowering -statins. For addressing Metabolic Syndrome, CoQ10’s potentially beneficial actions include eliminating free-radicals, lowering blood pressure, lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol, and normalizing the insulin response to glucose. For people with heart disease, CoQ10 is not a substitute for medical supervision. The body slows down on its production of this metabolite after age 40.

I’m taking over from Colin this month to discuss the insurance needs of individuals, rather than businesses. I started working in insurance nearly 10 years ago, and starting on this journey at the same time was a certain meerkat. Little did I know what an impact this furry friend and others like it would have on the way customers buy insurance.
The idea was excellent; you went on an online comparison site, punched in some very basic details about yourself and your house online, you received back an array of quotes and whichever one you chose, you also received a fluffy toy. People were going mad for it! Until they needed to make a claim, that is.
I speak to new clients regularly and have often found that when they previously used a comparison site, they were left out of pocket if their claim was rejected. One example is a client who suffered a break-in. The insurance company declined to pay the claim on the basis that she did not disclose the fact she had a lodger. She, like many clients, was not aware that non-disclosures such as this would lead to her claim not being paid.
The sad fact of the matter is that people who feel they have saved a few hundred pounds at inception are possibly going to have to put their hand in their pocket again at claim stage as the policy has not covered them sufficiently, or in some cases covered them at all.
We understand that customers are price-sensitive and try to save money by buying the cheapest insurance policies available. But unlike changing gas tariffs, each insurance policy is different. Each home and person demand a unique insurance policy to fit them. This is where an insurance broker can help. Brokers aim to source the most cost-effective, appropriate policy tailored to your needs and requirements. They can also provide advice on risk management and in the event of a claim.
By speaking to an insurance broker, you are also passing the burden of looking around each year to a professional in the field and who, after taking some details down about you and your home, is looking to match you with the correct insurance policy and provide advice on conditions to look out for, such as leaving your home unoccupied for more than 30 days or not double-locking your front door.
Insurance brokers are here to help. I am not doubting that the meerkat and his friends have helped people save money over these last 10 years; it is simply worth considering who would be the most helpful in explaining the ins and outs of your insurance policy.
Please get in touch with me to discuss your home insurance on 020 3846 5269 or email nick.beckingham@astonlark.com

Uche-Mefor exclusively told NewBand that he is fine and there was never a time he traveled to Dubai much less of slumping and dying thereafter in the hospital
He further described the rumour as one of the legacy of lies and deception that the detained leader of IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu bequeathed to his gang of gullible rascals
Mefor said, “I am fine. There was and there is nothing like that. Never travelled to Dubai, did not slump let alone going to the hospital.
“The legacy of lies, sophistry/deception handed down by Nnamdi Kanu to his gang of unconscionable, gullible, rascals will take generations to undue.
“They are trying to divert attention from the calamitous and disastrous consequences of their actions..Dark Hampton The O’Brien ScarfRegular price $109.00 Save $-109.00

The U.S. Navy on Friday refuted bold claims from the Russia’s Ministry of Defense earlier in the day that its maritime forces had “thwarted” the destroyer USS Chafee from “violating” Russian territory in the Sea of Japan, a move Moscow called a “gross violation.”
“The statement from the Russian Defense Ministry about the interaction between our two Navy ships is false,” a spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Fleet tells U.S. News in an emailed statement. “The interaction was safe and professional.”
The heated exchange comes at a time of raised tensions in the region, following heightened Chinese military provocations against U.S. and allied forces. China – a military partner of Russia’s – flew an unprecedented number of warplanes over Taiwan in response to large-scale U.S.-led marine exercises last week. Reports that U.S. forces are operating in Taiwan further inflamed tensions with Beijing.
Russia’s military claimed earlier on Friday that the Chafee, based out of Hawaii, had been operating in the Sea of Japan for several days and tracked it on a course to enter Russian maritime territory. It also claimed it had previously closed off the area in which the Chafee was operating for ongoing live-fire military drills Russia is currently conducting with China.
The Russian navy ship Admiral Tributs intercepted the Chafee at roughly 5 p.m. local time to force it to change course. The Chafee then raised signal flags to indicate it was about to launch a helicopter, which would require it to remain on its established course. Russia claimed the Chafee came within 200 feet of the Tributs, contributing to what its state news service called “a gross violation of the International Rules for Preventing Collisions at Sea,” as well as other maritime agreements between Russia and the U.S.
The Ministry of Defense summoned the U.S. military attache assigned to Moscow to raise its concerns about the incident.
The U.S. Pacific Fleet spokesman confirmed many of the details but said the closest distance the two vessels reached from one another was closer to 215 feet. It confirmed Russia issued a notice to close off the area for the drills – known in military parlance as a Notice to Airmen and Mariners, or NOTAM/NOTMAR – but that it did so for later in the day, not at the time of the encounter.
“At all times, USS Chafee conducted operations in accordance with international law and custom,” the spokesman says. “The United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate where international law allows.”A global Leader

Myself, Neil and Andrew headed out for the evening rise last night to do some filming and had a ball swinging wee wets with a few different rod set ups. I have attached the video in the link above so check it out, gives you a good taste of the action that has been happening over the past few days!
I have included a photo below of the top performers fly wise for us lately, with the mayfly patterns doing well early evening then when the caddis start really kicking off once the light starts dropping the small wee wets have come into their own and worked a treat. The action has continued till well after dark, and once the rise died off last night we changed over to the heavier swinging set ups and swung some big tube flies and streamers through the deeper parts of the river looking for a big brown which I hooked and lost on the last cast of the night unfortunately, that’s the way it goes sometimes though and it keeps us coming back for more!
The Christmas specials are continuing with the latest addition being the Airflo Sixth Sense lake lines on special for $99.99. These lines cast like a dream and with all the different sink rates available they are perfect for fishing the numerous stillwater fisheries we have in NZ so get in quick before they’re all gone! If you’re looking to have a crack at the evening rise and swinging wets but you’re not too sure about techniques etc. come into the shop for a chat and we can show you what we use and how we do it so you can get out there and experience the Tongariro at its best, we are certainly very privileged to have such an amazing fishery on our doorstep.

But in a short time in the late 1970’s Sammy Terry was off TV and another host rose in his absence from TV lasting only a few months. But while very short lived, he left an impact on viewers and fans as he was unique and classy with fantastic effects and top notch side characters, and I am of course talking about the werewolf Baron Von Wolfstein and his show Saturday Night With The Monsters! This proper speaking werewolf is even one of the major inspirations of A. Ghastlee Ghoul, the Horror Host I covered here in 2020 who is also a major icon in Hosting. So it’s with great honor that I bring to you Horror Host Icon: Baron Von Wolfstein, an update that I have been looking forward to doing for many years now. So sit back, relax, and le’ts chat about this amazing Host and his legacy.
Baron Von Wolfstein is a werewolf who lives in a castle that is surrounded by woods as well as a large cemetery. He is very soft spoken and proper and is by no means evil or sinister. He sits in his castle and reads from his books about the night’s film to entertain his viewers, who are looked at very much as his friends and houseguests. Baron Von Wolfstein loves to show the films as he enjoys the tales of classic monsters like The Blob, Frankenstein’s Monster and Count Dracula. By all accounts Baron is a gentleman and enjoys sharing the horrors of the cinema as well as facts about those who make them. Baron Von Wolfstein loved also getting letters from his viewers as well as getting artwork drawn by them that he would show off on the show. Baron was also always so nice to his friends that lived in and around the manor, but while super nice and friendly, one could also pick up that Baron Von Wolfstein also had a darker side, a little beast to his gentleman. After Saturday Night With The Monsters went off the air Baron Von Wolfstein vanished and fans were upset and wondering what happened to him! But in around the early 2000’s Baron showed back up in the world of hosting as he had cameos on such shows as “The Ghastlee Movie Show” and “Monster Madhouse”! Even in modern times Baron is still gracing fans with his presence as he is showcased on The Late Night Eerie Radio Show giving his insight on not just Horror Hosting but also films and history. Who knows when Baron Von Wolfstein will appear again and if he will have his own show or cameo on others…only Baron for sure knows!
Saturday Night With The Monsters started on April 1, 1978 on WTTV Channel 4 in Indiana and was a show that was a way to fill the void of Sammy Terry who at the time was off the air. And viewers in Indiana and parts of Ohio were happy as they had a new show to watch Horror Movies on and a new Host to guide them along the spooky journey of the film. The show would only run for 8 months before being canceled and would go head to head with Saturday Night Live, and in his market out draw it for viewers. The station’s biggest mistake is when they wanted to move the show to a different time slot and later in the night, and this was the downfall that lead to the show’s end. While Saturday Night With The Monsters was very short lived, its mark was made on the Horror Hosting world as its fans remember it very fondly and spoke of it throughout the years. I know I would love to see new episodes of Saturday Night With The Monsters as the world needs more Baron Von Wolfstein and his amazing sophisticated and calming way of hosting. I know there have been some rumors of new episodes, but only time will tell if this iconic Indiana Horror Host shows returns.
The side characters of this show are fantastic and each brought their own touch and style to the show. First we had Robin Graves, the British kindhearted gravedigger who is close friends with The Baron and tells cheesy jokes and ushers in the commercials. The Vampire Cousin is a bloodsucker that is related to Baron Von Wolfstein and is very sinister and uses his evil powers to take over the Wolfstein Manor and wants to fill it with pure evil. And my favorite is Carlyle The Invisible Wizard, a ghostly wizard who watches out for the Manor as well as his friends The Baron and Robin. The thing about the co-hosts and sidekicks of this show is they are very much a major part of the show’s atmosphere and lore making each and everyone of them very important. And each had their own fan base and my favorite of the trio is Carlyle The Invisible Wizard as he is awesome and I need to say it again.
I first truly found out about Baron Von Wolfstein thanks to my friend A. Ghastlee Ghoul who would talk about how he was one of the Horror Hosts that helped make him want to become one himself along with Dr. Creep and The Cool Ghoul. Then I was lucky to get to meet the man himself at several Horror Conventions like Cinema Wasteland and Scary Camp, as well he moved to Dayton, Ohio for some years and was a staple on The Ghastlee Movie Show as well as just the gatherings of the areas Horror Community. And after a few meetings, I no longer just saw him as Horror Host Baron Von Wolfstein but as Tim Herron, a friend who would take his time to chat with me about goofy shot on video films I was making as well as always told silly and cheesy jokes to get a laugh. Watching fans interact with Baron Von Wolfstein was always something to behold as he was so great with them and you could see the respect and love his fans have for him. He would be around as well in other Horror Media like the films “Abe’s Tomb” and “Joe Nosferatu: Homeless Vampire,” both shot in Ohio. And at several points during the years I have spoken to Baron Von Wolfstein about a return to Horror Hosting with new episodes of Saturday Night With The Monsters as I think his fans and a new generation of fans would love to see it. The good Baron also in 2020 became one of the co-host on the Eerie Late Night Radio Show alongside Halloween Jack and The Bone Jangler, two iconic hosts in their own right. Who knows what the future has in store for Baron Von Wolfstein, but one thing that is for sure, he made a major mark on the art of Horror Hosting and had a loyal fan base as well as inspired many.
On March 21, 2015 at Horrorhound Weekend for the Horror Host Hall Of Fame Baron Von Wolfstein took his place of honor among many of his peers, and he 100% deserved to be inducted in my opinion as his look, show and storylines were unlike any other before him. While A. Ghastlee Ghoul was supposed to induct him, he sadly could not make it and Captain Crypt of the Horror Dungeon, a fellow Indiana Horror Host, stepped up and did so with honor and much respect. It was great to be there and watch Baron Von Wolfstein get this honor as he is a true legend and such a wonderful person. In the 2015 Class he was joined by other inductees like Dr. Gangrene, Rhonda Shear, Gilbert Gottfried, Joel Robinson, Sir Cecil Creape, Superhost and Misty Brew to name a few. A great class of names to be inducted with, don’t you think! Plus at this Hall Of Fame, Baron Von Porkchop got to meet Baron Von Wolfstein and that was something very cool to see.
Baron Von Wolfstein was a Horror Host who made his mark with his own show, but as you can see went on to guest star and even co-host along side other Horror Hosts from all over making his mark on the history of this genre and locking his place in the hearts of fans. So sadly besides some raw footage of the segments, no full episodes have survived and the episodes I will be covering are Fan Reproductions done by myself, and yep I even added some classic commercials. As always I will not be giving these episodes a star rating and the movie write up will be coming from our pals at IMDB and the Host segment parts will be written by me. So let’s spend some time with the Monsters and The Baron himself.
Saturday Night With The Monsters: Dracula (1931)
Starring – Bela Lugosi & Helen Chandler Not Rated 1931
Host: We open up at Wolfstein Manor and Carlyle The Invisible Wizard welcomes us and says that The Baron will be with us very shortly. And we see Baron Von Wolfstein in his chair writing the monster family history, and then he notices the viewers and welcomes us to take a seat as he introduces himself as well as talks about Vampires as well as Dracula who is the topic of the night’s movie and then takes us to the first part of the night’s film. We next see Baron as he invites us to come closer to him, and as he holds a film strip in his hands, he asks a number of questions and then snaps the film and to a commercial we go. He next greets us from the commercial break and then back to the film. Baron then talks to us mentally and then sends us to more commercials. Once back he phases in holding his Dracula book and tells a Dracula spoiler joke and sends us back to the film. After the movie is over, Baron chats about Dracula and the film and mostly about blood and wooden stakes and then wishes us a good night after telling us next weeks film will be Universal’s Frankenstein!.
Note From Matt: This episode is a fan reproduction done by myself, in order to showcase the feel of the episode as I even added commercials from 1978.
Baron Von Wolfstein is one of those classic Horror Hosts whose show was not aired on TV for very long but had made a big mark on the lives of those who watched him in 1978. And Hosts like Baron Von Wolfstein also shows just how important Horror Hosts are to the local culture of the states they air in as because of him we also got the likes of A. Ghastlee Ghoul and his The Ghastlee Movie Show as well as other creative minds that he helped inspire. For me personally he also shows that in my opinion Indiana has some of the best and most interesting Hosts, only outdone by my own home state of Ohio. I also have so much respect for Baron Von Wolfstein and the man behind the fur Tim Herron as he really is a one of a kind Host who has such an original and awesome characters. Plus the shows use of chrome key effects is amazing and really does add to the spooky nature of the show. Well our time at Wolfstein Manor has came to an end and it’s time for me turn over Rotten Ink to Juliet again as this time she is going to cover our America Hero July 4th update, a man who knows what it means to make that perfect hamburger, a man who works hard for his family and a man who talks to his food…that hero is Bob Belcher from the cartoon series Bob’s Burgers that airs on Fox. So until next time, read a Horror Comic or three, watch a Horror Movie or two and as always support your local Horror Host. See you next time as I saved us all a booth at Bob’s Burgers for the 4th!

We need to overhaul the legal system - OyebodeIt's official, at least it is to you. In order to get housing on the agenda this election cycle, we have to demand our candidates to take a stand.
It's not hard—in fact, it's quite easy—to share Rooflines blogger Greg Rosenberg's incredulity at how housing is not part of the political narrative, or that there's nary a mention of housing in the “issues” areas of both the Obama and Romney campaign Web sites. After all, for most Americans, housing is a marquee issue all of the time, let alone during an election cycle.
On top of the millions of Americans who are underwater, foreclosed upon, homeless, or are acutely aware of the very real threat of these things, housing is in the news constantly. We had the $25 billion attorneys general foreclosure settlement that seeks to right wrongful foreclosures; we have, according to Nancy Wilberg of the National Council of La Raza, 3.4 million borrowers 90 days or more late on their mortgage payments or are in foreclosure—that's 8 percent of all borrowers. More, 10.7 million homeowners, roughly 22 percent of all mortgages, are underwater.
We have the long, loud drumbeat of respected voices in the housing, community development, and economic fields decrying the FHFA's continually brushing off principal reduction.
/>So, the results from last week's Shelterforce survey, Can housing advocates get the housing crisis on the radar screen this election cycle?, only offer further proof that “market forces” in political campaigns often don't reflect the demand of the constiuency. In order to get housing on the political agenda in 2012, you said, we're going to have to work for it.
Fortunately, this is something you all know how to do.
In response to our question, you said:
“We have to demand it in every way we can think of! Remind them of what should be painfully obvious: that housing is inextricably linked to the entire fabric of the economy, and as the housing market strengthens again, so will the jobs market.” —Bethany, Milwaukee
“It will be easy to get homeownership on the political agenda. Not so for rental housing.” —Michael, Washington, DC
“Housing advocates need to put housing crisis on their own radar screen first, stay focused, demand and make housing crisis to be the campaign platform every day until the election day. Call for criminal prosecution. The only way and potential chance to reset the system is demanding and actually putting bank top executives in jail.”
“We have to start local/regional, build the grassroots base to put the pressure on.”
As Rosenberg noted in his post:
Is there something—anything—that affordable housing advocates can do to put the housing crisis on the radar screen for this campaign season? Because if we don’t make it happen, housing is going to be a non-issue in this campaign.

I think I speak for all the staff and volunteers at the kennels that if we had one wish for Christmas, much as we love him, it would be for Archie to not spend it with us at kennels but with a new family. Well yesterday 648 days after coming into kennels our Archie finally got his new home. He is such a loyal and loving boy that is anyone’s for a cuddle and beams his staffie smile at everybody. He is going to be a huge miss at the kennels from his waggy bum on our walks to getting everyone he met to give him a good scratch. He’s not moved far so we really hope he will visit us regularly just to help us.
Why did it take so long for Archie to find a new home? Three reasons, one he was a staffie, two he was ‘old’ and three he was brindle. Harsh though that may appear that is the reality of it. It didn’t help that he couldn’t go to a home with another dog but that had a minimal affect compared to the other three “No” If we had a pound for every time someone said “I don’t like staffies” or “that’s too old” or “I don’t like brindles” we could have built Archie his own house and then he could have adopted a family to live with him. Admittedly if Archie had remained the cute puppy in the box he wouldn’t have been here long.
For now though, until the next old, brindle staffie comes in, we’re all just delighted that Archie is safe, warm and loved and we have no doubt that his owners will be rewarded many times by Archies little ways.And they said it's a "personal" wasteland.

On Friday, July 10, 2015, David Boyd <[log in to unmask]');" target="_blank">.”The Clinton administration has asked Congress to permanently fund a governmentwide
study of federal information technology workers' pay and positions to serve
as a reference for future initiatives.
The Office of Personnel Management plans to complete its first IT occupational
study this year to determine the differences between pay scales for federal
IT workers and their counterparts in the private sector.
OPM will use the study to validate the IT job profile model that describes
specific qualifications of the GS-334 computer specialist and GS-391 telecommunications
series of jobs.
The study data can support many projects, including the president's
Federal Cyber Services initiative, which aims to expand the number of information
security professionals in government, said Mark Montgomery, director of
trans-national threats at the National Security Council.
The Clinton administration wants to provide OPM with $1 million annually
to conduct the study every two years. The study is time-consuming, and the
IT arena changes so fast that OPM should continually work on the study instead
of waiting several years before starting a new one, Montgomery said.
Any move that strengthens OPM's ability to keep up-to-date information
on the IT job market helps, but it's just a start, said Ira Hobbs, Agriculture
CIO and co-chairman of the CIO Council's Federal IT Workforce Committee.
"The question is: Based on [OPM] getting the data, how fast can we make
changes? The bottom line is speed to seat," Hobbs said.
Colleen O'Hara contributed to thisRecently on Twitter, Tea with BVP caller extraordinaire, Longinus, as well as some Inclusive Latin Classroom folks, got me thinking about the definition of communication. What follows are terms I’ve been using for a while (almost entirely unoriginal), clarified by Bill VanPatten on Episode 68 of Tea with BVP.
Communication isn’t only speaking:
Communication is the interpretation, negotiation, and expression of meaning. We interpret when we read, and express when we write; no speaking necessary.
Two people are usually involved, but not required:
If I write a note (expression), and place it in a drawer, but then the apt. catches fire (yes, we have renters insurance), there’s no possible way for anyone to read it (interpretation), or ask me about it (negotiation), even if that was my intent. I most certainly expressed my ideas, there just wasn’t anyone around to interpret them.
In Latin, reading—though not to be confused with translating—is the primary form of communication. ACTFL modes of communication are helpful, here. Reading is one-way, and Interpretive (i.e. interpretation), but someone had to write what we read…at some point (i.e. two people involved). That person who wrote what we read is also one-way, and Presentational (i.e. expression). Neither of these become Interpersonal (i.e. negotiation) unless there is interaction between two people, and this interaction doesn’t have to take place in person. This is why Bill VanPatten refers to communication as “expression, interpretation, and sometimes negotiation of meaning.” Both the writer and reader engage in acts of communication, it’s just that their role is different.
Timing (i.e. real, or asynchronous) & Perspective:
Ovid wrote something (expression) a couple thousand years ago that I can try to read today (interpretation). There has been no interaction between us, eliminating the possibility of negotiation. However, if I write an adaptation of Ovid (expression), and then send it to John Bracey, a couple things could happen. John could star the email, forget, and never end up reading it (no interpretation, just my expression). Or, John could read it (interpretation), and send back some notes or questions (negotiation). This interaction between us would be delayed, but still the same process communication-wise as if we were in person. Now, if I also star and forget about that latest correspondence from John, however, neither negotiation nor interpretation occur. This doesn’t change the fact that John expressed ideas and attempted to negotiate with me. That is to say, from John’s perspective, he still engaged in communication, but it was only one-way without my involvement.
Communication as a concept, not as verb “communicate:”
Although I’m engaging in the act of communication by trying to read Ovid (interpretation), one could hardly say that I’m “communicating with” Ovid anymore than Ovid is “communicating with” me, or us as a society. Ovid certainly expressed meaning, itself communication by definition, but in the absence of real time interaction and negotiation, or even delayed negotiation of meaning over letters, we are not “communicating with” each other.
Someone correctly brought up the fact that the idea of “communicating with the ancient world” isn’t possible. Classicists use this phrase, referring to relating to [certain] ancient people’s ideas (expression) by learning more (interpreting) about the past, and making connections to our own lives, but this ends there as far as communication goes. There is no possibility of interaction (negotiating) with ancient authors. When we read about the past, communication is one-way.
Partially- or fully-communicative:
Things get more complicated from here, but the definition of communication still holds up. An activity lacking a purpose yet focusing on meaning is partially-communicative. Most teachers spend their time doing partially-communicative activities in preparation of a few fully-communicative tasks along the way. Personally, I don’t bother with tasks/Tasks, and find them awfully close to performance-based assessments, the juice of which tends not to be worth the squeeze.
3 thoughts on “Communication: Definition & Clarification”
I’d suggest that some degree of negotiation is possible with ancient authors, namely reading more of what they wrote with my question in mind. So, if I’m unsure about a line or passage in Ovid, I need to read more Ovid with my question in mind to find out which interpretation of that line or passage most fits with what he says elsewhere. Or, I could search for other uses of the same term or phrase, or treatment of the same story (e.g., in Metamorphoses and Heroides). My question is still the negotiation question: “What do you mean here?” It’s just that my mode of negotiating is different, being more indirect and limited.
I would disagree that what you’re doing is “negotiating” in the SLA communicative sense, and instead something more like “searching for meaning,” even if you use the verb “negotiate,” just like how Longinus referred to “negotiating a left turn” on a vehicle.
Yeah, “negotiating meaning” uses “negotiating” in the business sense, where two parties are trying to come to a mutual consensus. Even if you are reading a commentary or discussing a passage with someone, it’s still not really negotiating because the sender of the information is not present at the table.Annual Newsletter

Budget proposal prioritizes learners, stays under tax levy limit
The.
“Once again, Washingtonville district leaders were committed to proposing a budget that advances our mission to prepare our students for their futures, while protecting the community’s investment in our schools, and honoring our fiscal responsibility to taxpayers,” said Superintendent of Schools Dr. Larry Washington.
Voters will also elect three members to the board of education. Polls will be open from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Budget priorities and highlights
During the budget development process, the district carefully reviews its expenditures to see where savings and increased operational efficiencies might be realized, with no impact on instruction. This includes savings through attrition for salaries and benefits due to staff retirements.
Highlights of the proposed spending plan reflect the district’s educational vision for its students and schools and a prudent, strategic approach to fiscal governance:
- Supports the continuous development of rigorous and comprehensive curriculum, aligned with
- standards of excellence and assessment practices
- Maintains a safe and developmentally appropriate student-centered learning environment
- Promotes collaboration among all district personnel
- Protects district from data and network breaches through technology security upgrades
- Increases equity in student access to technology
- Maintains safety and security of students and staff with continued police and security protection
- Replaces eight buses without borrowing
- Includes an energy performance contract to upgrade LED lighting; replaces unit ventilators in the middle school; replaces the roof at Little Britain Elementary School; includes solar energy panels that will yield long-term energy savings
- Includes a capital outlay project to replace exterior doors and sidewalks at the high school
State aid and one-time federal relief funding
The 2021-22 New York state budget increases education aid overall, including needs-based Foundation Aid, the primary source of general purpose operating aid for schools.
Additionally, the state budget is allocating federal relief funds to schools. Washingtonville is prioritizing the use of these funds to support students’ academic, social and emotional needs. The balance of these funds will be used to enhance learning, increase technology hardware, software and connectivity, and in building upgrades for a safer learning environment.
Federal aid appropriations can be used over a multiyear period, but they must be tracked and accounted for separately from the district’s general fund budget.
Committed to fiscally prudent practices that protect local taxpayers and their long-term investment in Washingtonville schools, district leaders plan to allocate these funds over the allowed two-year period.

YEAR IN REVIEW:
A message from Superintendent Dr. Larry Washington
We are so proud of being Washingtonville! Since reopening school in September of 2020, district and building administrators, faculty and staff persevered in their educational mission through relentless new challenges and enduring restrictions. Students pressed on with their learning regardless of instructional environments, and families took on unprecedented responsibility in their children’s education.
Through it all, we worked together, supported and uplifted each other, and we all have abundant reason to feel proud of our school community. Most of all, we all celebrate our students’ return to their classrooms for more in-person learning. The daily interactions they have missed for too long are integral to the education of the whole child and the promise of a public education. Go Wizards!
Program Highlights
High School: Aspire program connects students with workplaces
The learning of employable skills in Aspire classes is paired with an exposure to careers and jobs available to students in the Washingtonville community. Local business owners visit Aspire classrooms to discuss job opportunities, employer expectations, and to offer interview tips. Corrine Courtney, owner of Nailed It Hardware, was a recent guest. Aspire teachers collaborate with a work-based coordinator for the high school to find student internships. Currently, students are interning in the district’s central supply office and at the Felt Factory in New Windsor.
Middle School Student Council: Making a positive difference
A student-run government body, the middle school Student Council engages and collaborates with the school community to address school issues with creative solutions and improve student life. Ongoing school-wide activities include the Door Decorating Contest, a fun, self-expression opportunity implemented
during lunch. Council members also take on service projects to give back to their community,
such as the recent “Cards for Seniors” project.
Little Britain Elementary: Literacy for all learners
LB is committed to fostering an inclusive environment that affirms and celebrates the school’s diverse families. To better engage and represent all learners, the school is steadily integrating diversity into its literacy program through weekly read-alouds of culturally authentic books. The Mystery Reader program has also featured pre-recorded readings by members of the WHS National English Honor Society. March’s readings focused on biographies of women, and April’s exposed students to diverse
musical traditions.
Taft Elementary: #BetterTogether
Before moving on to middle school, Taft fifth graders reflect on their elementary journey by working on a legacy project with the help of a professional muralist. Together with art teacher Jennifer Czumak, students created drawings around this year’s theme, “Better Together.” Muralist Joe Pimental arranged the drawings and assisted students through the painting process. Located outside the art room, facing the school gym, their work will go on to inspire a positive school climate at Taft.
Round Hill Elementary: Focus on SEL
RH’s Social Emotional Learning (SEL) Committee is engaging the school community to help foster and support safe and positive learning experiences. The traits of the “Choose Love” curriculum (courage, gratitude, forgiveness, compassion) and the topics of diversity, equity and inclusivity are consistently affirmed through Student of the Month recognitions and read-alouds by the school psychologist and social worker. The committee also undertook the creation of a book room to support SEL instruction. With overall student wellbeing in mind, the committee launched the Round Hill Cooking Club, open to all students via Google classroom, and complete with a monthly newsletter for families. Emphasizing the social in SEL, the committee hosted a school-wide cultural show and tell.
Wizards return to Athletics
On Jan. 19 the state’s Department of Health and the New York State Public High School Athletic Association granted permission to resume high school athletics. Currently, Washingtonville has
41 varsity and junior varsity teams and over 900 student athletes participating in one or more of
three athletic seasons. Winter and Fall 2 season highlights include the boys swim team capturing
the Section 9 championship, a first in the history of the program; the girls swim team finishing second
in the section; and the girls soccer team making it to the Section 9 final four.In 2020, UK workforce productivity fell by 2.5% due to the tumultuous, uncertain and worrying effects of the global Coronavirus pandemic.
Across the pond, in the United States, a further study led by healthcare conglomerate Ginger revealed that 70% of workers admitted they were significantly less productive due to the anxieties and stresses surrounding the pandemic. An additional 62% went so far as to say they had lost at least an hour a day of productivity due to pandemic related stresses.
These statements are not isolated to the United States. These will be sentiments echoed by workforces across the globe.
So, as the dawn breaks across a brand new year, employers are faced with a challenge: How to improve team productivity in the wake of one of the most stressful years on record, without furthering the aggrievances and stresses their workforce are already experiencing.
Thankfully, we can help. Below we’ve listed 5 methods that use awareness and communication to not only improve your team’s productivity, but that will improve their efficiency and teamwork throughout the year too.
1. Prioritise employee mental health
With the increased anxieties and stresses of the pandemic, employee mental health should be an issue prioritised by employers throughout 2021.
Ensure that your business is equipped to maintain good mental health resources by enrolling in a mental health first aid course, and where possible, expanding your team’s knowledge of the businesses health benefits.
Health benefits could include offering mental health days, incorporating flexible working hours, and encouraging a good work/life balance by asking employees to be unresponsive to emails or work calls after a certain hour.
If you meet the needs of your employees, they will feel understood and appreciated, resulting in them feeling more committed to your business and more focused and positive about their work.
Clearly communicate the business’s mental health resources and policies with your team, and then offer encouragement to take advantage of what is on offer.
2. Create a healthy workplace culture
Healthy workplaces are fast becoming the norm as employers resolve to place more emphasis on the wellbeing of their employees.
A healthy workplace is one that is open, communicative, and provides regular opportunities for employee check-ins as well as feedback.
Cultivating a healthy workplace becomes even more crucial in a time where employees are mostly unable to be physically present in their offices. Feelings of disconnect could isolate and demotivate employees, so holding regular meetings to check on their wellbeing becomes doubly important.
Employee surveys can also be used to encourage employee feedback which can be used to thoughtfully address and resolve any issues your team feels they are struggling with.
3. Communicate Frequently
The need for communication is exemplified as remote working becomes the temporary norm.
Employees will have faced changes not only in their professional lives but in their personal ones too. Ensure you acknowledge these changes by reestablishing your employees’ needs and expectations throughout the new year.
Speak with each individual and try to look for factors that drive employees. This could help to identify commonly shared themes that your organisation can use to modify its practices and boost employee morale, which naturally impacts and increases productivity.

4. Recognise your employee wins
In times of decreased productivity, it’s even more vital to find and use employee wins.
Positive feedback and recognition can help give employees a much-needed boost, increasing their confidence and reminding them of the role they play in helping the business. This helps employees stay motivated and productive.
Reinforcing positive affirmations about the value of their work, i.e, how much it helps a client, can also kickstart employee productivity.
5. Be open to understanding.
Personal and professional lives have been turned upside down across the past year, which can result in employees feeling overwhelmed and burned out.
If your business has changed, either through things such as layoffs or furlough, or remote working or other new work practices, it’s important to explain these changes to your employees and show them the positives of each change.

Feelings of burnout can fester and lead to reduced work productivity, as well as higher levels of stress and mental ill-health.
Addressing burnout openly, without judgement and suggesting actionable resolutions to be followed through on can reinvigorate an employee’s confidence in your business, boosting their focus.
Throughout 2021 you can improve your team’s productivity just through creating an environment of open communication, prioritising employee well being and ensuring changing employee needs are being met.
At Growth Idea, we can assist you in implementing these initiatives throughout your business. Get in touch with us today to find out how.Description

Introduction
The following texts are intended to function as short insights on what one might encounter when handling a digital archive, especially without having the opportunity to interact with the original physical material. It might (since in my case at least it involved sensitive, sometimes explicit material) lead to a disconnected feeling towards the content; a disconnect that I could not quite put into words. To face this complex relationship, I started to research the following notions:
1. Handling archival material – original v.s. digital reproduction:
- dealing with archival material when it's impossible to interact with the original
2. Re-opening the boxes – echoing subversive thoughts:
- the redistribution of sensitive, underground or non-commercial archival material
3. Recipes for a 'post-digital cookbook':
- exploring collaborative forms of publishing subversive content today
1. Handling archival material: original v.s. digital reproduction
Dealing with archival material when its impossible to interact with the original.

1.2 The repeatability of print (and why we trust it)
1.3 The human relation to the physical copy
1.4 The materiality of paper
1.5 The ambiguous state of scanned documents
1.6 The aura of the original
1.7 The 'clumsiness' of scanned material
1.8 How format and layout create memories
1.9 Activating archival material
1.10 Scanning as an act of resistance
Key questions in this section:
- What is the message of a simulated medium?
- How does scanned material relate to experiencing emotional and physical distance of content?
1.1 Paper as a medium
Even before the Gutenberg* press changed the world, publishing on paper already had a huge impact on the way that knowledge and information was spread. With the current advent of digital publishing possibilities, the meaning of paper as a medium has changed. Since it has become normal to read digital and volatile screen-based content, questions that arise are the following: How does this affect our relation to the physical material that is still everywhere around us? How does it shape the collective memory? What is its importance in publishing subversive (activist) content?
In The Myth of the Paperless Office (MIT Press 2001), Abigail J. Sellen and Richard H. R. Harperin refer to the paper medium as a 'physical conductor': "Through the gestural act of passing the printed product from one person to the next, paper may be seen as a conceptual ‘conductor’: able to transfer the metaphorical ‘energy’ it contains." What does this mean in the case of handling and distributing scanned (archival) material? What is 'the message' of a digital representation of a medium? Does it reduce this so-called metaphorical ‘energy’?
Gutenberg press revolution: "In the mid-15th century, Johannes Gutenberg of Germany introduced a new concept that would make the process of printing books more efficient. With his invention of the printing press, which utilized movable text, thousands of pages per day could be printed. This process increased development in science, art and religion, increasing the amount of shareable knowledge and decreasing costs so more people had access to it." (source:)
1.2 The repeatability of print (and why we trust it)
The human attachment to the tangible is nested in our habits of consuming information by reading. Print on paper has a history of significantly contributing to spreading knowledge, opinions, news reports, counter-arguments, and therefore creating collective memories, a trace of time captured within the material. As Marshall McLuhan noted in Understanding Media: “Repeatability is the core of the mechanical principle that has dominated our world, especially since the Gutenberg technology. The message of the print and of typography is primarily that of repeatability.” The first book that Gutenberg printed was, in fact, the Bible. Here, technology made a significant contribution to the spread of religion across the world.
And in spite of its fragile material characteristics, paper can be around for a very long time. When information is printed, the content never changes. Only our interpretations do. Comparing it to digital media that can be found on the web, print is much more stable and static and faithful. But if influential technologies change our habits, let's assume this sense of stability and faithfulness is currently changing since screen-reading is already the standard for many.
1.3 The human relation to the physical copy
So, why are we, in a society which is almost entirely networked and screen-based, still printing and transforming digital text into physical copies? Print has some unique characteristics that are still not overthrown by any other format or medium. The space that printed documents, books, archival material, etc. takes is real. It has mass and a certain weight. The more you store, the less physical space you have available.
This is in fact fundamentally different than the materiality of the text that appears on your screen or a file of a document that is stored on your hard drive. The sensory perception, intrinsic to human beings, is not something that is simply going to disappear. This feeling of disconnect, caused by a distorted sensory perception, is what I encountered while handling the digital scans of archival material. (In my case, the contents of the archival material was often explicit, graphic, politically sensitive and sometimes highly personal in nature, which most likely made this relationship even more complex.)
1.4 The materiality of paper
There is still no electronic device that fully closed the gap to paper. Paper is foldable and can quickly adjust to different reading methods and activities. It's easy to share it in person which creates human encounters. It's very flexible for note-taking and juxtaposing to other material.
No matter how high the quality of the reproduction is, some essential questions can be hard to answer when the physical original is absent. For example, what type of paper, printing techniques, ink, etc. were used? All these properties can give much more detailed information on the time in which the original was produced, what the political state was back then, who produced it, etc. Material such as paper has significant 'flaws': it's very much prone to decay, amongst other weathering risks. When archiving, conditions such as temperature, humidity, and fire safety should be optimal for the preservation of the material.
Scanning seems to be the most preservable option available now. While the physical conductor is dematerialized or lost, the message and the information that the material holds are preserved. What does this mean for the metaphorical ‘energy’? Does this get lost as well? Or will this be saved and therefore stored into the digital reproductions?
1.5 The ambiguous state of scanned documents
In a way, the image of a scan is ambiguous; a scan is a representation of the original, tangible material. A scan finds itself somehow trapped in between the physical and the digital space. It may nonetheless reveal something about its age, the interactions it had with humans over time. A scan is something that you cannot touch, smell, fold or burn. But the mere presence of a scan proves that the original material exists, or existed. It is a carrier that enables information to be made visible, which in turn activates a feeling of trust.
When we face the material by only seeing these scans on our screens, a desire for space emerges. We wish to experience a situation of using an actual magnifying glass instead of a zoom function on your computer to enlarge a certain part of the material, ending up seeing fibers instead of pixels. The physical act of going to the material allows different ways of intuitively interacting with the material, instead of having to use a digital interface full of symbols of tools to explore and navigate through the material. Digital spaces leave less room for a messy, intuitive approach that would, in turn, bring different results to the process.
1.6 The aura of the original
Because print as a carrier for text has been around for so long, it 'has always been perceived as a stable extension of human memory', we are used to the fact of believing that once a text is printed, its content is fixed forever. We interpret it as 'being real and permanent'. It somehow obtains an 'aura'. The reproduction is like a ghost of the aura; trapped somewhere in between the physical and the intangible world.
On Wikipedia, it is stated that "when the word 'aura' was used by the cultural philosopher Walter Benjamin to compare an original artwork to the reproduction, he said that "even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: Its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be"; and that the "sphere of authenticity is outside the technical [sphere]" of the reproduction of artworks. Therefore, the original work of art is an objet d'art independent of the copy; yet, by changing the cultural context of where the art happens to be, the mechanical copy diminishes the aesthetic value of the original work of art."
1.7 The 'clumsiness' of scanned material
In terms of quality, usability, and readability, a scan can be perceived as 'clumsy'. When a document is scanned to retrieve only its textual content, present visual information can be redundant, disruptive and highly impractical for processing. However, these additional visual presences can in fact be perceived as its strength. An image of a scan usually testifies to the manual act that was performed in the creation of the image - it can reveal extra visual traces such as folds, crooked frames, and even hands trying to keep the pages flat while pressing the material against the glass surface of the scanner. Compared to the plain (or OCR-ed) text, it reinforces the fact of the physical existence of the original.
Scans, compared to plain text, also add episodical data such as folds, pencil underlines, marginal notes, censorings, spills, signatures, stamps, stains to the original content. This uncovers an intimate history of the material, its life from before it was scanned. It is a narration that tells us about everything the material had to go through to be preserved - or: not to be destroyed.
1.8 How format and layout create memories
To some extent, our visual memory can be used to retrieve information from a document. We can remember a certain layout, a typeface, color use and type of paper, which connects the specific document to episodic data, related documents, a time in history, etc. A certain format or layout can tell us a lot about the content. Some documents can be visually distinguished from others, based on our knowledge of a tradition of a specific (historical) expression within a text, a poem, an article, a letter, a report, an academic paper, etc.
This can also be applied to digital publications and media. Websites, email conversations, blogs also have certain recognizable visual characteristics that can be stored as well. This also provides more context on how the information was produced and what the intention was. (As well the source code can reveal a lot of information.)
When classified digital documents were released during events that took place around Wikileaks, VAULT7, etc., most of the content that was published was embedded (showed) in its original format. Even though it had all the advantages of digital processing options, the plain content was not simply extracted from the source material. Layout, headings, layout, typographic elements were left to add a layer of trust to the textual content. Sometimes, even information such as document numbers or black blocks that censored information contains was added. Also, a lot of emails were in fact printed and scanned. When converting digital text into a physical medium and back it almost creates some kind of hyperrealism: something that is more real than the original. (Is there, in the case of documents that were originally created digitally, an actual difference between the original and a reproduction? Can a digital file even have an 'aura'?)
1.9 Activating archival material
Often, out-of-print material and limited small press editions are somehow hidden in small institutions and private collections. These places have a lot of specialized knowledge about the contextual, historical and other substantive information of their material. Besides that, it is also important for their local cultural environment that the physical material is located in the place or region where it was originally produced and spread. Yet these collections are mostly unavailable online and therefore cannot be used as public sources of knowledge, they are unavailable to the public or hard to access. Often, the reason for that is the absence of a suitable platform for their dissemination or the limited financial resources available. In some cases, owners don't know how to handle material that is sensitive due to a political climate or censorship.
1.10 Scanning as an act of resistance
As we can learn from history, in times of political change the freedom of the press can be under pressure and can even lead to censorship. In these circumstances, scanning and (anonymous) publishing can be an act of resistance. Digital scans of physical documents can be used as a legit source for articles to prevent whitewashing, which Wikipedia describes as "to gloss over or cover up vices, crimes or scandals or to exonerate by means of a perfunctory investigation or through biased presentation of data". Archives that contain marginal (forgotten) documents are essential to keep a collective (cultural) memory alive. There should be no threat to them being erased from history.
Here is why the availability of a (preferably) high-quality digital reproduction is important. It greatly increases the accessibility and reduces the need to visit the location where the physical original material is kept. This is also beneficial for the preservation of the material since physical handling can be risky: documents can get lost or destroyed. Intentionally or not. Although not entirely safe - scanning and storing digitally also reduces the dangers of a collection being endangered/threatened by the forces of nature.

Key questions in this section:
- What if you can't publish because of political change & censorship?
- What if you are not allowed to publish today what you wrote yesterday?
- What are the possibilities of speeding up the printing and publishing process?
- How can you re-enact(ing) the initial publishing gesture, especially from the importance of underground publishing)?
2.1 Activating archival material and re-spreading ideas: echoes and activation
Audiences emerge –or are being created– when things are being shared. In the act of connecting like-minded individuals lies a possibility for building communities to share ideas. This is easily prone to dishonest capitalist systems and (extractive) business models. Appropriating printed material that was meant to mass-inform a large public should not be kept behind paywalls managed by self-proclaimed owners of the knowledge and the material that transmits it. As a matter of fact, this also goes against the nature of the original purpose of independent and underground publishing.
The technological advantages of today can be used to reconsider and improve underground publishing workflows. For example, the digital state allows easy multiplication of material, networking tools allow real-time and remote collaboration, and all kinds of anonymous distribution and file-sharing possibilities are around before possibly converting it into a physical document. Just like the underground press used to function, but make clever use of the benefits and speed of the digital.
Examples on the impact of alternative press:
(Both excerpts are taken from Post-Digital Print: The Mutation of Publishing since 1894 by Alessandro Ludovico) André Breton, one of the founders of the 1920s Surrealist art movement, famously declared: “One publishes to find comrades!” This short statement brilliantly embodies the spirit of early avant-garde publishing, as well as that of independent publishing later in the 20th century. Strictly speaking, the main concern here is neither commercial success, nor the aesthetic purity of the printed experiment, nor even the archiving of works (at least not yet). Rather, this kind of publishing is all about fostering and spreading ideas among like-minded people, through the ‘viral’ communication model so often applied by the alternative press.
Another case in point is the body of work of the Ranters, a radical group which flourished during the second half of the 17th century, with heretical views on religion (if Jesus is in everyone, who needs the Church?), politics (expropriation of the rich and collective ownership of property) and sex (preaching an ideal of free love). Such an extremist rebel group (which counted a few thousand followers in London alone) could easily self-publish and distribute its pamphlets. Though such publications were banned and burned, it was much more difficult to destroy an entire printed edition than had been the case with manuscripts, because of the sheer number of copies as well as their widespread distribution – and so some copies survived, a few even to this day.38 The two major political revolutions of the 18th century were both preceded by a frenzy of intellectual self-publishing activity, including a few ‘underground’ bestsellers. In the case of the French Revolution, many of the countless pamphlets produced were sponsored by printers, based on their potential commercial success.
2.2 Restabilizing unpublished and forgotten material
The networking advantage of digital documents allows it to (re)print unpublished and possibly forgotten material and turn it into physical stable objects. In that way, printing on demand is similar to photocopying and mimeography (stencil printing) from the '80s and '90s. Because these methods were relatively cheap and easy to distribute content, alternative presses, underground and self-publishing flourished and became a popular way to target audiences and sub-cultures.
The fact that many people still choose to own a printed object tells us that a physical copy is still an essential experience to consume information. Paper has some specific qualities and characteristics that are not yet defeated by the benefits of the digital. Print-on-demand services and being able to print documents yourself at home perfectly illustrate our resistance to an all-digital world. We can fold it, cut it up for clippings, draw on it and re-use it for other types of usage. Again, this shows that our entanglement to the physical object can't be put aside just like that.
2.3 Physical Distributing of digital data
While the internet can be used to easily transfer and share data, physical exchanges of digital data are used for all kinds of reasons. Methods such as 'sneakernets' create a direct relationship between the users, creating an interpersonal human interaction. They are still being used today because of various security considerations that people face. Depending on the underlying purpose, distributing online or via physical storage media, both have advantages and disadvantages.
Sneakernet is an informal term for the transfer of electronic information by physically moving media such as magnetic tape, floppy disks, optical discs, USB flash drives or external hard drives between computers, rather than transmitting it over a computer network. (source:)
2.4 Digital Networking advantages
Because of the advantages of publishing online, lots of publishers still only sell hard copies of releases due to reasons such as nostalgic motives, political statements against the 'everywhere always online' omnipresence of our current society, or because they want to control the appearance of their product. In addition to satisfying our reading habits, editions can be collectible because of their physical characteristics such as printing techniques, book design, layout, binding, choice of paper, special finishing, etc.
These choices affect how we read, receive the message and value it. Although the possibilities of professional printing and finishing techniques are getting more accessible due to technological development, they are often limited in customization and design options as they are marketed as practical solutions for the office environment.

Key questions in this section:
- What collaborative formats can be used to embrace a variety of content?
- What are the benefits of digital publishing combined with printing?
- What are the options for customization of content?
- How to collaborate and publish with others?
- What if this content won't ever be accessible again from tomorrow?
3.1 Collaborative publishing formats
When exploring all kinds of publishing formats and frameworks that embrace various types, styles of content and voices, one inevitably encounters the so-called 'zine' and 'cookbook'. Even though they come in various shapes, both have been used and proven to be a successful form for activating, creating communities, and spreading non-commercial ideas. Ever present as a hearable voice that flows in counter-current to popular opinions and media.
A Cookbook is some kind of handbook with 'recipes' used for DIY and subversive practices with the aim of getting people involved by handing them tools and techniques to use themselves, often within activist and political groups. A Zine is a small-circulation self-published work of original or appropriated texts and images, usually reproduced via a photocopy machine. Zines are the product of either a single person or of a very small group and are popularly photocopied into physical prints for circulation.
3.2 Providing 'tools' for activation
A publication that was, and is still influential today was The Whole Earth Catalog. Published by Stewart Brand regularly between 1968 and 1972, all kinds of informative tools, how-to's, maps, journals, courses, equipment, computers, and even synthesizers, etc. were provided. Brand had a strong ideological motive making all kinds of knowledge accessible. The idea of the publication was focussed on how to guide the reader to become self-reliant. Rather than selling, a large number of products which (were tested and therefore) proved to be qualitative and sustainable were recommended. While the book was strictly speaking confined to being a catalog, it also consisted of experiences, suggestions of readers/users as well as the Catalog's staff. This interaction between publishers and users sharing information made the format of the Whole Earth Catalog a network by itself.
3.3 The influence of design
One notable aspect of alternative press material such as zines and cookbooks is how the design can add a striking 'voice' to a publication. When thinking about old activist documents, a mental image pops up in our heads immediately. Besides the use of illustrations and photography, the design and layout can strongly affect how information is perceived. A layout gives a certain expression to a page; it can emphasize or even contradict the content.
In the current state of home-printing, standardized paper sizes, limited binding options. Home-printing documents are visually often indistinguishable from each other. Same paper color, texts in black ink. The same can be said for digital libraries and how texts are often being displayed on e-readers.
3.4 Content and personality
In the pre-internet world, zines were self-published and distributed publications to target small (obscure) audiences and create a network to like-minded people. To reduce costs, they were often photocopied and distributed physical prints for circulation in sections of Libraries and by mail or alternative bookshops, listed in Zines about zines like Factsheet Five*. The content of zines, sometimes provocative and subversive in nature, are often not found in the mass media. (This culture is pretty much alive today in independent publications from marginal communities of artists, poets, (political) activists, feminists, queers, music genre-specific, etc.)
In 'Perzines' or personal zines, the content was created from intimate stories, anecdotes, comics, photos, and stories about the authors written by others. Often giving the user the feeling to be part of an intimate conversation between close friends. Often designed by using cut-outs and original letters and typewritten documents which added an extra personal layer to the content.
* Factsheet Five was a periodical mostly consisting of short reviews culture. (source: Wikipedia)
3.5 Digital zines
A Zine can be described as a way of thinking. It is a more or less abstract framework that can hold together all kinds of content from different voices and collaborators. It's flexible, adaptive and, curated or not, assembled based on the content. The role the creators and the readers are diffused and interchangeable as interested people are invited to contribute, distribute and make zines themselves. If a zine has many owners, distribution, in both - digital and analog formats, can be un/decentralized, so takedown is less likely to happen and the content manages to live on.
In the early days of online publishing, electronic zines (a well-known one was called 'PDF-Mags') were created by an underground scene of designers to share free content and showcase creative skills. The main purpose of the downloadable PDF's was to share aesthetic experiments and to create be a platform to publish non-commercial content. Although these zines were not interactive at all, they had a networked function: connecting like-minded creatives. In a much quicker way than the traditional printed zines ever allowed, constrained by their physical medium.
3.6 Collaborative publishing tools
Collaborative digital publishing makes use of the possibility of content being continuously updated and added by its numerous creators. Coming from the ideology and culture that believes that software should be open and accessible, free and open-source software (FLOSS) makes possible the creation of custom workflows that enable people to collaborate on writing, designing and publishing. Here, the role of the writer, reader, and publisher becomes even more diffused.
Networked capabilities such as remote printing, anonymous sharing, peer-to-peer distribution, personal customization can have a huge social and political impact as they can reshape the act of publishing subversive content. For example, new workflows can be used for speeding up a process when there is a need for urgent publishing. A real-time peer-reviewed content editing process and co-authorship can 'single-author-knows-it-all-ideology'. And finally, it can be used to target a certain audience for getting a publication into the right hands.
3.7 Creating hard copies: customising content
Another possibility that web-to-print provides is that it allows the user to select, add and modify content to create a personalized printed copy. In the process of printing a selection of the content that fits your interest, assembling and binding a document can result in adding another personal value to the self-printed material. By these means, one can feel more strongly connected to the physical object. as they have directly participated in its creation.
In ‘The Art of Zines’ (Factsheet Five #63, 1998) C. Becker gives examples on how collective binding methods could function: “The publisher invites contributions and from a few people and each of them sends multiple copies of their work to cover the number of copies in that edition. Each zine copy is then collated and bound making (it) unique, and personalized.”
3.8 On distributing physical documents
One may wonder if the more we are getting used to reading digital and volatile screen-based content, the more we have the urge for tactile physical formats. Not only to cater to our reading habits, but also for human connection and interaction it creates. The original gestural act of spreading printed content as a conductor of ideas and information*, using the possibilities of collaboration and distribution that the digital realm provides.
“In this context, we view the act of publishing as a gesture that accommodates the political, the artistic, and in some cases, the defiant… A gesture is something preceding the action, and therefore signifies motion and agency of the most expressive and potent kind, precisely because it is so wrought with intentionality.” (Muller, N. and Ludovico, A. (2008) ‘Of Process and Gestures: A Publishing Act’ in The Mag.net reader 3 - Processual Publishing. Actual Gestures, OpenMute)
While our trust in print is still pretty much present after all these years of screen reading, we start to experience printed media as slow compared to the online media environment where everything is unsteady and can be constantly updated. As we can see in the changing ways of how we consume news over the past years; with decreasing newspaper sales and the rise of distrust in news.
I personally believe there is a lot to explore in the field of collaborative publishing and what the role of print can be in this. I am in particular curious to what extent or in what situation it is preferable to create physical copies. For me, the methods and tools we used for making this publication gave a whole new insight on how to shape collaborative publishing processes and change more traditional roles for production and distribution. Opening up the process to the extend so that it becomes customizable for a certain intention, means or strategy to target or create a specific public.

This is one of the most frequently asked questions received by early intervention providers.
As with many skills and milestones, the age when children learn language and begin speaking can vary considerably from child to child. Knowing a bit about speech and language development among children, especially young children, can help parents figure out what to look for and when to seek help.
As a general guideline, speech and language experts recommend following the concept of “2 by 2.” What that means is by 2 years old, we like to see these milestones met in order to provide a strong foundation for future language skills.
A more in-depth list of milestones for toddlers can be found on our developmental page.
What are some ways you can help?
- Read to your child. Talk about the pictures, be animated, and point to objects on the page.
- Ask Questions. When your child is first developing receptive language, it’s good to ask simple questions like, “Where’s the dog?” As he ages, you can move onto more open-ended questions to develop expressive language skills.
- TALK. Model speech by talking about the activities you’re doing. The more they are exposed to correct modeling of language, the more likely they will be to copy it.
- Seek Outside Help. The best way to understand your child’s development is a conversation with professionals because of multiple factors.
As with all milestones, keep in mind that speech is not a race or a prize to be won. Take the proper steps to help your child and seek input if needed. But remember to give your child and their speech development the time they need to grow.
If you are concerned about your child’s speech and language development, contact us at info@mtskids.com or make a parent referral to Babynet.

CIIE | Shandong Provincial Party Committee Secretary Liu Jiayi Visits Weichai Overseas Brands2019.11.06
At 9:30 am on November 5, 2019, the 2nd China International Import Expo was grandly opened in Shanghai. President Xi Jinping attended the opening ceremony and delivered a keynote speech.
"The Chinese market is rather big, so I’d like to welcome everyone to take a look."
"China's economic development prospects will certainly be brighter and more bound to be brighter."
The CIIE is not only a grand event for international trade exchanges, but also allows the world to see a more open Chinese market. This time, Weichai brought its six overseas brands, including Ferretti, Linde Hydraulics, Linde Forklift, Dematic, PSI and Baudouin to particapte and fully demonstrate their firm confidence in the Chinese economy and the Chinese market.
Liu Jiayi stopped to watch Weichai's overseas exhibits
At 14:20 in the afternoon, Liu Jiayi, secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, led a team to visit the Weichai overseas brand exhibition area. As the first exhibit of this year's CIIE, the Ferretti 195 official affairs ship is particularly "eye-catching". Liu Jiayi inquired in detail about the ship's performance, technology and market applications, and proposed to speed up the localization of Ferretti in Shandong.

Tan Xuguang said that Weichai is not only a leading enterprise in China's equipment manufacturing, but also a powerful multinational enterprise. It must actively participate in international competition, and also join hands with overseas brands to accelerate the localization of products and technologies in China to better serve the Chinese market and seize the new opportunity of China opening up, thus to achieve a balanced and rapid development of the domestic and international markets.For grandparents, retirement is not all about the money. They equate joy in retirement with time spent with loved ones.
Many of us, perhaps inspired by the financial media, see successful retirement as a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. Fill the pot to a certain level and happiness follows.
But actual experience suggests otherwise. Post-work contentment doesn’t necessarily depend on how much green you can pile up. Spending time with loved ones—grandchildren in particular—may bring the most joy, and as the old song goes, that’s something money just can’t buy.
A recent TD Ameritrade survey found that 30% of current grandparents say they’ll experience the most joy in retirement through spending time with grandchildren, and another 30% said they’d find the most joy in spending time with a spouse.
Travel—something so many people dream about before they retire—came in a distant third, with 21% of grandparents saying that was what would bring them the most happiness after work ended.
“For grandparents, retirement isn’t all about the money,” said Dara Luber, senior manager, retirement, TD Ameritrade. “They equate retirement joy with spending time with their grandchildren and spouse. This shows the importance of determining your wants, needs, and wishes. What are your wishes for retirement?”
In other words, if you’re someone who’s determined to save a certain amount—say $1 million—to fund your retirement dreams of traveling the world, it’s worth taking another look. Perhaps once you reach retirement age, domestic pursuits may seem more important than exploring the Amazon or taking a safari through Africa.
What does that mean from a fundamental standpoint? Well, some retirees find that they’d rather save their resources to help adult children put kids through college, give to charity, or find a way to bequest funds to their families rather than build a vacation home or buy an RV. Some retirees realize once they’re done working that their priorities have changed.
That’s why it can be helpful, even many years before retirement, to sit down with a spouse, significant other, or adult children and discuss your retirement goals and wishes. Once you have the basic needs taken care of, think about what those wishes might be and how you can fit them into your post-work lifestyle. Try to think with your future self, not just your current one. And remember to keep possible changing physical abilities in mind. One retiree may think he’ll spend 20 years playing golf and buy an expensive country club membership, only to find that after 10 years, health doesn’t permit this pursuit any longer.
If the lifestyle you might seek requires lots of travel to visit adult children and grandchildren, it’s not too soon to start thinking about how that might work for your finances. Perhaps it’s cheaper in the long run to consider a move rather than frequent cross-country travel. Or you might cut back spending on things that you may want but not really need, such as restaurants, club dues, or even premium cable service.
Nearly 40% of grandparents surveyed said they don’t feel too confident they could reach their retirement savings goals, but more than half would be willing to lead a simpler lifestyle to help make their retirement savings last longer. Many said they’re willing to spend less money on themselves, cut back on eating out and entertainment, retire later, or buy a used car instead of a new one.
“Retirees are making trade-offs in their golden years,” Luber said.

Initially, I had planned to compose a blog post structured by hashtags and infused with tweet-able moments about how and why I use social media in the literature classroom. But after careful consideration of recent current events, I have changed my mind—an often frustrating decision that is indicative of a life-long penchant for revision, to be sure.
Because I am teaching my core literature courses around “the dangers of the single story” and “why narrative matters” this semester, I feel compelled to join creative acts of cultural production, intellectual pursuits, and acts of political resistance with the following post.
Last week, North Carolina lighted social media on fire and ignited activist passions for social justice by calling an emergency special session and by hurrying a significant anti-LGBT piece of legislation through both the House and the Senate. Among the many disheartening components of the North Carolina House Bill 2 (known mostly as HB2) is a stipulation that bans transgender individuals from using restrooms and other public facilities that match their gender identities unless they have successfully changed their birth certificates—despite the difficult barriers that prevent them from doing so, if they choose to in the first place.
If you might be thinking that North Carolina’s legislation is an isolated attempt to police gender and rob trans folks of their safety and the dignity to relief themselves in peace, I would encourage you to familiarize yourself with similarly problematic bills circulating in or threatening to emerge from the following states: Kansas, Minnesota, Tennessee, Michigan, and Georgia.
In and out of a variety of states, a troubling tendency persists that captures the attention of an English professor. Not only are trans folks suffering unthinkable levels of everyday discrimination, but they are also subjected to everyone else’s narrativization of their identities and their lived experiences. Throughout media coverage, in legislative halls, and during everyday conversations, trans folks remain subjected to unsubstantiated claims of predatory behavior, pedophilic inclinations, and overall perverse dispositions. Under the guise of a rhetoric of privacy, fueled by steadfast “protection” of the heteronormative/cisnormative nuclear family, and shaped by rigid, binary understandings of gender identity and its relation to an interpretation of genitalia at birth, non-trans individuals regularly direct inaccurate, incomplete, and oppressive narratives of trans identities and experiences.
As a corrective to a host of cisnormative constructions of transgender people, I would like to use this blog space to offer narratives and resources to our readers that self-identified transgender cultural producers shape themselves. In so doing, I encourage you to ask what else comes into view when trans folks become the content creators of their own stories—or at least become key players. How do the very questions that underpin these narratives shift dramatically? Because these severely marginalized individuals rarely have access to mainstream cultural production venues, readers have to search harder to discover their voices, especially the voices of those who reside at the complicated nexus of race, gender, sexuality, and class in America. Below, our blog readers will find a starting point for reorienting themselves or for at least hearing divergent voices often suppressed in favor of intensely dispossessing accounts.
Aspiring cryptologists out there in the blogosphere might quickly notice that my list of 6281969 is a nod to the historic Stonewall riots in our neighboring New York City on June 28, 1969—an act of everyday resistance that is often credited with helping ignite the modern-day LGBT liberation movement. What you might not realize, however, is that narrativizations of this paramount act of issuing a resounding NO! to routine discrimination, disempowerment, and perverse use of authority started when trans women of color, homeless queers, sex workers, and other gender non-conforming people fought back.
Unfortunately, though, with the normalization of the LGBT movement—massaged by a politics of respectability—the contributions and voices of these community icons fade into the background or disappear all together. For a recent concrete example, look no further than the boycotted film Stonewall (2015) directed by Roland Emmerich.
Taking my cue from the soon-to-be-released short film Happy Birthday, Marsha (centering the life of Marsha “Pay It No Mind” Johnson and her contributions to the Stonewall Riots), I am offering a list of 6/2/8/1/9/6/9 to share transgender women of color content creators that you should know in a variety of creative and political circles.

We can tell that you’re the kind of person who looks for the best—best in products and the best solutions available. The kind of products that fix your problems are readily available, and take your wellbeing and the planet’s health seriously. That’s why you’re here. You require the best solution out there, and Lion Energy is here to help you find exactly what you’re looking for.
That little extra boost of power can make all the difference, for everyday use or during emergencies. And there has always been that great debate regarding Gas-Based Generators versus Lithium-ion batteries. For some, gas-based has been the go-to despite some of the stigma attached to them. However, a growing, greener trend has emerged in the form of lithium-ion that is safe, silent and renewable.
Why People Still Use Gas-based Generators
The fact is, they work. Gas-based generators provide people the power they need to backup what’s most important to them, from their homes to their RVs and beyond. And, despite their flaws, they continue to remain a contender in this game of power.
Companies progress all the time to improve gas-based generators to make them safer. While they work, and aren’t a bad option—are they the best one available? By switching over to natural gas, that’s only benefiting a portion. However, not much is done to actually change the overall risk that surrounds gas. Here are the problems with choosing gas-based generators.
The Problems Regarding Gas-based Generators
Not Environmentally Friendly
The use of gas can be harmful to the environment. When burned, it creates fumes that leave pollution lingering in the atmosphere, damaging both the earth and our bodies. Using them indoors is not an option, either. Fuel is also a limited source, especially when it comes to natural gas. It is not renewable. There is an increasing concern of sapping the earth’s natural gas reserve, especially if we don’t start making changes. Also, in times of crisis, finding available gas for the generators is difficult.
Potentially Dangerous
Gas is a flammable substance. Its flammability is both desirable and concerning. We use the fuel to create energy to power the device. However, if an incident should ever occur, the gas from the generator could cause a fire or explosion. Burned fuel also releases carbon monoxide into the air, which hurts both the environment and people (especially if too much is inhaled). And you don’t want to use it indoors.
Maintenance
While gas-based generators can be functional and useful, they can also be just as inconvenient. Gas-based generators require a lot of upkeep in order to remain functional and appealing. When preparing for a storm, for example, fuel must be on your checklist. Otherwise, your generator will not run without its fuel source. They need tune-ups and replacement parts. And they can get messy.
Noisy
This may not apply as much if you’re using it for your home because they have to be used outside. However, this may be a problem if you’re camping. Your neighbors may not appreciate the noise, or there may be a time constraint.
There’s a Better Way
Lithium-ion Batteries
When you look at the broader picture, you may question what’s really the difference between finding fuel and charging a battery when it runs out.
The real difference resides in: solar power, silence, and safety.
These batteries are reliable, renewable, can be powered by either the sun or just plug it in as you would your cellphone. It’s that easy. No more worrying about fighting people at the gas station for fuel or worrying about whether there will be gas by the time you get there.
The Benefits of Lithium-Ion Batteries
Portability
Lion Energy has a variety of sizes for you to choose from, so you can take power anywhere and at any time. Lithium-ion batteries and generators exist to be portable sources of power for your convenience. They also can lower the cost of utility bills depending on how you use them.
Lithium-ion batteries and generators have the ability to charge many appliances and devices around your home. Its energy can come from the sun, as well as the battery. Your house would not be affected unless you so choose to use the wall outlet, thus saving you money.
Environmentally Friendly
A solar power charge eliminates the need to rely on limited resources. Lithium-ion batteries also don’t release any toxic fumes into the air, so they can be used indoors, and can be recharged repeatedly over the years. A single charge on its own, if not used, can hold for upwards to a year or more.
Silent
Lithium-ion batteries do not make noise. They also do not require a lot of maintenance outside of charging from regular use. And while they cost more than a gas-based generator, negating the need for fuel or repeated maintenance lowers the cost overall.
Lithium-ion is a more reliable source for many, but keep in mind that the type of power supply you purchase will determine how your devices are charged.
Your Decision
If you decide that lithium-ion is the best fit for you, Lion Energy has a wide variety of top-quality products for you to choose from. Check them out before they’re gone at! And always remember, Lion Energy is here for you and your needs.- Your Government

Description
The Official, Authorized Version of Stephen Covey's Habit 5: Emphatic Listening In "Habit 5: Empathic Listening: The Key To Communication," Stephen R. Covey explores the idea of communication as mutual understanding. Using what Covey calls Empathic Listening, he instructs us on how to reflect what a person says in our own words and in this way gain a deeper understanding of that person's perspective and feelings. To truly listen is NOT to advise, counsel, probe, judge, question or analyze. It is listening with the intent to understand. “Empathic Listening is to the heart what air is to the body.” – Stephen R. Covey

Dots And Boxes Small Reinforcements Game Team Reinforcements Reinforcements Line Big Reinforcements Bridge Outnumbered fight bridgehead Tunnel Spearcoast Runnerstorm Lonely wolves Border Guard You shall not pass! Formations Moving around in a group, staying in formation. Teams-Circle with Runners Teams-Circle with Allies The Tower Game (Das Turmspiel) All fighters inside a circle (the tower) fight everyone else. The aim is to be the only one on top of the tower. If you are hit, you leave the tower, queue up, count to ten and step inside the tower again. There are two or more opposing entry-points (ladders). People on the ladders don't participate in fights. If you step outside the circle, you fall from the tower and have to climb up again. What is trained: defending in multiple directions simultaneously quick movement and reaction in a confined area Fighters: 7-17 (4 on each ladder and 3 on the tower) A Small Barroom Brawl (Kleine Kneipenschlägerei) Everyone fights everyone else in a small rectangle. Acces to the rectangle ist via to opposing corners. When entering the barroom, announce yourself by saying „knock knock!“. Only close combat weapons such as sax, dagger, sword should be used. No shields. What is trained: Fighting with just the weapon, movin in close quarters, single combat techniques Fighters: 6-12 (Or as much as you like when using multiple instances of the same game. Move on to the next game after defeat.) warm up with obstacles (Aufwärmen mit Hindernissen) The playing field is provided with obstacles and indentations by poles & cones, which must neither be fought over nor run over. Entrance to the field is at two diagonally opposite corners. Fighting will be Dishonour with one hand weapon + buckler, two weapons or long weapon. Those eliminated may re-enter the game at the appropriate points after being announced („In!“). What is trained: Overview and tactics in chaos, stamina and speed. Persons: 5< couple therapy (Paartherapie) The fighters face each other in two lines. Within the lines, two fighters are always a pair, preferably a longsword and a shield bearer. If one of the partners dies, the other is eliminated directly with it. What is trained: Communication in small teams, looking out for each other, defending teammates. Persons: 12< Circle Of Honour (Jeder gegen jeden „fair“) All fighters position in a big circle. Everyone who is ready to fight lifts his weapon. If a fighter does not lift his weapon, he is not playing. Upon beginning everyone engages an opponent. Others may not interrupt the duels. The winner waits for another duel to finish and fights the winner. The last one left may start the next circle. What is trained: This game is for training the classic duel situation. Fighters: 4-16 Circle Of Dishonour (Jeder gegen jeden „unfair“) All fighters position in a big circle. Everyone who is ready to fight lifts his weapon. If a fighter does not lift his weapon, he is not playing. In this game, everyone fights everyone else. Sneak attacking someone from behind is part of the game. Two or more players can create a spontaneous alliance that can most easily be ended by one partner killing the other. The last one alive may start the next circle. What is trained: This game practices to keep a good view on the battlefield while fighting. You should learn how close other players can get before becoming a threat to you. Avoiding contact, realising and taking advantage of the unawareness of other fighters is also trained. Look out! Fighters: 4-20 Circle Fighting (Jeder gegen jeden „Kreiskampf“) Form a circle. One person is inside the circle fighting short duels against everyone in turn. After he completed the round its the next fighters turn to be in the circle. If the circle is big enough, you can have more than one person inside at a time. What is trained: You practise to adjust to different levels and styles of fighting. Duels all around… Fighters: 8-14 Hunting Groups (Gruppenkampf) Two to three fighters team up. It's a good idea to have a polearm (spear or daneaxe) or a marksman in the team. Those groups fight each other in a similar way the circle of dishonour works. If a fighter is hit, the remaining part of the team proceeds. The last group left wins. Or maybe only the last one left of this group. Variation: Have a respawn area for dead fighters. If there's enough of them to form a new team, they may start again. What is trained: Coordination within the team. Try assigning a commander. Fighters: 8-45 Teams (Teamkampf) This game is a variation on Hunting Groups. This time, when a fighter dies, the whole team leaves the battle. Teams can work together for some time, but in the end only one team can win. Variation: Have a respawn area for dead fighters. If there's enough of them to form a new team, they may start again. What is trained: Coordination within the team. Not getting hit. Fighters: 8-27 Start Game (Start Spiel) The game is a good introduction to group training, as everyone can warm up well. The game has several phases. In the first phase, everyone looks for a duel partner with whom they would like to train. In the second phase, everyone joins forces with their duel partner and looks for an opponent team. In all subsequent phases, the process is repeated: the groups join up with their previous opponents and look for a new group as an opponent.\ In all fights, everyone tries to determine and correct the mistakes of their own group and the opposing group. In order to get balanced groups, the groups should strive for the average strength when choosing opponents. This means that if one of the groups has started to like to find a particularly good opponent, in the following phases the group should look for opponents with whom they can get closer to the average fighting strength on the battlefield. If necessary, someone will coordinate this. What is trained: Fighting in small groups, spotting and correcting mistakes, Coordination in different group configurations Fighters: 12-600 Catch the Runner (Fangen den Läufer) Two fight defensively and line up opposite each other at a distance of about 15 m. Three fight offensively and stand between the defensive fighters so that there are two people on one side and one on the other and they are about 7 metres apart. On a common signal, it is the task of the offensive fighters to defeat the defensive fighters in 5 seconds. If they succeed within the time, they have won, otherwise the defenders have won. The time can also be increased to 7 seconds, depending on experience and distance, and all positions can be doubled. The time is counted loudly and audibly for all by the offensive player who is in the offensive 2-person team. What is trained: Acting quickly together in space and running over opponents. Fighting opponents together. Defensive holding. Speaking loudly enough during fighting for all to hear. Persons: 5 or 10 or any number of instances. Accumulation (Das große Fressen) In this game, players form groups of two and spread out on the playing field. Each group gives itself a short name. Then all groups fight against each other. Whenever a hit is placed, the name of the group should be called out and the person who was hit switches to the opposing group that placed the hit. This leads to the fact that in the end there is only one large group. What is trained: Any form of coordination in groups, backing up, moving in groups, appropriate retreat, reaction skills. People: 14< Brigde (Auf der Brücke) Two teams fight on a bridge. One team tries to defend while the other tries to cross the bridge. If you fall from the bridge, you are dead. You don't need to take a real bridge, a small path or two lines on the ground will do. What is trained: Tactical positioning with regard to a bottleneck. Defining the place and way of a fight by ones positioning. A bridge is a classical bottleneck, but it could as well be a hole in a fence or a doorway (only then you can't see the other team). Additionally the teams train fighting in confined areas as evading is not possible. some pictures Fighters: 10-40 (depends on the width of the bridge) Frontiergame (Zaunkampf / Grenzkampf) One group defends an obstacle (fence, trench, a line drawn in the ground) the other group tries to pass the obstacle and overcome all defenders. Depending on the obstacle the defenders can be short-handed. What is trained: What position to take in relation to an obstacle. Dealing with obstacles: How to use an obstacle and hinder the attacker How to cross an obstacle safely Fighters: 8-24 The Boat Game (Das Bootspiel) Similar to „Capture The Flag“ the goal is to reach a certain place. In this game, the place is confined by a rope on the ground which has the shape of a boat. If you leave the area inside the rope, you fall from the boat and are dead. One member has to reach the opposite side of the boat to make his team win. What is trained: Keeping a formation in confined space Breaking through a line Fighters: 10-22 Triangel Bridge (Dreieckige Brücke) This game is similar to „Capture The Flag“ and „The Boat Game“ in that you have to get to another groups base while defending your own. Only this time it's three groups. The area is divided into the central triangle and the three areas belonging to the groups. The groups areas are devided by walls, you must pass through the central triangle to get to another area. The walls are flexible though i.e. if you are fighting someone who is in the same area they don't matter. You can't fight people in another area. You win by killing both other teams. If a base is taken, the whole team dies. What is trained: tactics, movement and positions with regard to several other groups breaking through a line Fighters: 12-33 Bottleneck (Engpass) Similar to the Bridge a confined area is drawn on the ground or otherwise marked. This time the field is asymmetrical. Playing the game works like with the bridge. What is trained: Moving in a confined area. Varying the width of a line to adjust to an asymmetrical field. This will produce chaos and holes in the line until the fighters get used to it. Fighters: 9-50 (depends on the area) Two Brigdes (Zwei Brücken) Both groups try to use the bottlenecks to their advantage and defeat the other group. If you fall into the water, you are dead (grey rectangle in the middle and outer border). What is trained: Similar to the bridge game, tactical positioning with regard to a bottleneck, regrouping with longer distances to run. Fighters: 12-40 Fight Around the tower (Kampf um den Turm) A square playing field is needed with an equally square field in the middle, which may not be entered or fought over. There should be space for 3 fighters side by side between the inner and outer squares. The fighters are divided into two equal teams. The winner is the remaining group. Variation: Tower with center aisle; in the middle of the inner square there is a wide passage for a maximum of one person. What is trained: Communication, division, use reserve, put focus offensively. People: 10< tower capture (Turm Eroberung) The board is similar to tower, only round or oblong-oval (can be left the same). There is an opening at the tops of each, through which two people can just about fit at the same time. The teams start about 10 meters outside the playing field. On command, the teams start and occupy as much space as possible inside the playing field. The remaining group wins. What is trained: Gaining space in the team, quickly taking positions, communication in the team, dynamic fighting in the team. Persons: 8< Swedish Brigde Bro (Schwedische Brücke) Two groups face each other on a bridge (or otherwise confined field). In the middle of the bridge are two lines, 1 to 2 meters apart. The first clash has to be between these lines. One group will push back the other, until they cross the far line. Now the stronger group has to move backwards, behind their own line. Only then can they attack and finish the other group to win. What is trained: Keeping formation even when the others push. Moving while fighting. Killing while retreating. Moving backwards when winning. Staying aware of the whole situation while fighting. Fighters: 16-60 The "Dress Left" Game (Das „Links fällt“-Spiel) Two equal groups fight on a bridge. A fighter who gets hit rejoins the same group on the rightmost position. To do that, he will have to talk to the other fighters so they make space for him. This results in the whole group „dressing left“ every so often. Fighters with long weapons (spears and daneaxes) face the decision either to dress left with the group or switch position to the right, effectivly staying where they started. No group is supposed to go forward. It will still happen though. If the other group is not regaining the bridge in an adequate time, the first group should back off a bit. This is an endless game. What is trained: communication when joining a line, listening to commands while fighting, monouvering while fighting, individual compensation of gaps in the line. Long weapon fighters practice to switch positions (without getting in conflict with other long weapons who might want the same spot) and coordinating fighters in front of them. Fighters: 10-60 Kill The King (Töte den König) Two groups select a king each. A fighter who got hit can return to the game after reaching a special area (resurrection area). The teams have separate resurrection areas. When the king is killed, he has to go to his teams resurrection area immediately. He does not get resurrected, instead his fighters can not resurrect either after his death, but stay in the resurrection area when killed. When all fighters of one group are dead, the other group wins. What is trained: To guard a person (moving object). Reforming in different situations, reintegrating in a fighting group after resurrection. Variations: Unknown King: Don't tell the other group who's your king. Kingslayer: To begin, place a special weapon in the middle of the field. Only this weapon can kill a king. If the fighter carrying the kingslayer dies, he has to drop the weapon and go to his resurrection area. Someone else can take up the kingslayer. Hardest part is to get the weapon safely. Personen: 12-40 Small kings (Kleine Könige) The fighters face each other in two lines. In each line there are two fighters who have only a small shield and are otherwise unarmed (small kings). The kings must be in the first line. If both small kings of a line are hit, the group has lost. What is trained: Offensive: forming focus (long arms), communication; \\. Defensive: defending teammates, communication (announcing long weapons,…). Persons: 16< Capture The Flag (Kampf um die Flagge) You need two teams, two flags and two positions to put the flags on. The teams try to capture the enemy flag by getting to its position. If a member of the team takes the flag and shouts (whatever you agreed on) his team wins. What is trained: Reaching and defending a position. Dividing your forces the best way to match both tasks simultaneously. Fighters: 16-40 Treacherous Transport (Transport mit Verrat) One group hides (best if you have some forest), the other group has to pass the area where the first group is hidden. The second group has to carry some load (a chest). Some additional fun: Allot a traitor in one of the groups. What is trained: Using the advantages the training ground has to offer. Looking out for the other group, a good sense of what might happen next. Paying attention to what your teammates do (mind the traitor!) You practice to keep in mind what the others of your group should do, so you can fill in for the traitor once he's revealed and dealt with. The traitor learns to watch for the weak spots in his own team, so he can be most efficient. Fighters: 14-40 Four Kings (Vier Könige) Plce four pins in a big square. Each pin belongs to a group which has to defend it. The square should be big enough so the groups can't attack other groups without leaving their pin. If a pin is kncked down, all remaining players of that group have to leave the game. The winner is the last group remaining. What is trained: Moving in an open field, defendig a position, redirecting opponents, overview and group coordination Fighters: 20-100 Skirmisher Line (Plänkler Linie) Two groups are formed. The two groups line up, with a large distance between them, on a limited field. When both groups are ready, both groups send out their skirmishers on a signal and the lines/formations go off. The task of the skirmishers is to take up as much space as possible and allow the group to manoeuvre. The task of the group is to use the opportunities created by the skirmishers and either integrate the skirmishers or let them through to the rear to form a reserve. As an alternative to defeat, it is also possible for a group that is in danger of collapsing to attempt to retreat to its baseline, thus creating a stalemate. This requires more than 1 person to reach the baseline with in an orderly fight back. The task of the opposing group in such a case is to knock down this attempt quickly and in a controlled manner without losing their own consistency. What is trained: suitable skirmishing and corresponding counter-tactics. Use of the situations created by the skirmishers. Controlled retreat instead of collapse. Controlled defection of a nearly defeated group. Persons: 10-40 Card Game (Kartenspiel) Two groups of equal size are formed and two persons made gamemasters, accepted by both groups. Both groups get cards with maneuvers and tactics written on them. Both groups chose one manouver that they want to use in the next fight. The according cards are handed over to the game masters. Then the fight takes place. Both groups try to follow their tactic and simultaneously try to disrupt the other groups tactic. One of the groups wins the fight. If the chosen tactic was used successfully, the group gets one point. When a tactic was used successfully, the card is taken off the game. This is repeated till all cards have been played or a set score has been reached or a set time is reached. Card game cards PDF: Card Game Karts Cards Ribe 2014 What is trained: Using different tactics, deception to prepare tactics. Observing the opponent, recognition of tactics, flexible line-up and flexible reaction to tactics Persons: 20-300 Linefight Without Runners (Linienkampf ohne Umlaufen) Two equal groups fight one another by forming two lines. If one group is reduced to two fighters these to may give up the line and start running around the other group. The groups form two lines No one is allowed to run around the edge of the other line to get in their back Breaking through the line (in the middle) is ok If one group is reduced to two or less fighters the two start running to produce chaos. The situation turns into the game „Funny Rabbit“. What is trained: Working as a team without other tactical movements. Fighters: 9-30 Linefight With Runners (Linienkampf mit Umlaufen) Two „equal“ groups fight each other in line formation, it is allowed to leave formation at any time (runners etc). What is trained: This is the actual game. Fighters: 12-60 Linefight Without Formation (Linienkampf ohne Formation) Two equal groups fight each other. What is trained: The other actual game. Coordination between fighters, taking initiative. Fighters: 6-60 Linefight With Formation (Linienkampf mit Formation) Two equal groups fight each other. What is trained: The other actual game. Coordination between fighters, taking initiative (groups aswell as single fighters). Fighters: 60-400 Dots And Boxes (Käsekästchen) One group forms a triangle with the spears and daneaxes in the middle. The fighters at the corners are supposed to defend their positions. The triangle is not supposed to move around. The spears and daneaxes fight from the middle of the triangle. The other group are all runners, trying to destroy the triangle formation. What is trained: The triangle practices to stay in formation and defend a position. The runners learn to attack edges and distract a group. Fighters: 7-30 Small Reinforcements Game (Kleines Nachschub Spiel) Split up into two equal groups. Two fighters from each group start the game with a small line (2 vs 2). The rest waits in a reasonable distance behind their respective groups. The moment one fighter dies, he is immediately replaced with one fighter from the reinforcements. The dead fighter joins his waiting group. From time to time the lines get one person larger, until everyone is fighting or you get enough of it. What is trained: Working in a group with changing partners. Defending the line with inferior numbers. Gaining ground with a superior / equal group. The reinforcements learn to watch the line and to integrate quickly and efficiently if needed. Fighters: 10-30 Team Reinforcements (Team Nachschub) The players are divided into two lines of equal strength. The playing field is rectangular and elongated. Behind each baseline, each team has a respawn point to which the „dead“ must run. If there are two (or more, depending on the number of fighters) „dead“ there, they can directly re-enter the game together. The winner is the team that first pushes the other back across the baseline. What is trained: Overview, communication, incorporation of reserves, pressure build-up, pressure acceptance, endurance. Persons: 12< Reinforcements Line (Nachschub Linie) Divide into attackers and defenders. The defenders seperate again, so they form a weak group and the reinforcements. Attackers and the weak group of the defenders oppose each other in a linefight. The reinforcements starts 15 m behind the defending line. 10 to 15 seconds after the main fight started the reinforcements joins with the remaining defenders. The attackers should try to finish the weak group fast and without losses, so they are still in advantage when the reinforcements arrives. The defenders try to hold the line without losses untill reinforcements arrives. If this works out, they are the stronger group in the second stage of battle and should be able to overcome the attacking group. What is trained: The attackers train to finish of remaining fighters of a already beaten line and keeping track of possible reinforcements. It's usefull to coordinate the attacks of diffrent fighters to kill an opponent in the first attempt. The defenders practice to hold the line against a superiority. The reinforcements practise how to join with a group in a fight. Fighters: 16-100 Big Reinforcements Bridge (Große Nachschub Brücke) Two groups are formed. Each group chooses a commander. The goal of the two groups is to completely defeat the opposing group. The battle starts in a bridge situation. Those eliminated gather and form a reserve of their own group. The commander may call the reserve three times (bring the eliminated back into the game). When the commander is eliminated, the reserves can no longer be called, but the game is not yet over. For the commanders, the later the reserves are called, the bigger they are. But too late is too late. What is trained: Replenishment and targeted breakthrough. calling in the reserves at the right time.\ Persons: 20-300 Outnumbered fight (Unterzahlkampf) The fighters are divided into three equal groups. One team consists of one group and the other team consists of two groups. The playing field is a very long bridge. The large team wins when it has completely defeated the smaller team. The smaller team wins when it reaches the back line fighting, generating more casualties than it has suffered. What is trained: For the outnumbered group: establishing and maintaining controlled pressure with superior numbers, quickly defeating outnumbered groups, maintaining consistency in superior numbers, good reserve management. For the outnumbered group: retreat and evasion while maintaining pressure (slow yielding in combat), consistency preservation in pressure situations, breakthrough avoidance in outnumbered situations, initiative from outnumbered situations (taking advantage of opportunities to breakthrough), exploiting inconsistencies from advancers. (It is helpful in the beginning to always have one combatant not participating in the game and constantly giving the command to retreat). Persons: 9< bridgehead (Brückenkopf) The playing field is rectangular with an opening (about 2 people wide) on each of the short sides. The teams start about 10 m outside the playing field. Before each round, each team designates 1-2 skirmishers. On a first command, the skirmishers start into the playing field. Shortly after the two skirmishers (groups) make contact with their weapons, the teams start on a second command („And go!“) and run into the playing field. The remaining group wins. What is trained: Speed, skirmishing, gaining space, organization & communication. People: 10< Tunnel (Tunnel) You need a line and a punshing group. Both groups should be about equal in strength. The punshing group tries to break the line getting at least 1/3 of their fighters through. The line tries to evade the punsh, preferably by forming a tunnel. What is trained: Punshing and tunneling Fighters: 28-80 Spearcoast (Speerküste) You need one spears-only group and one group with one hand weapons and shields. That's it, fight! What is trained: The spears practice to open the shields and to keep the right distance as well as slowing down the assault of the other group. The other group practices to get past the spears. This works best in close order. Fighters: 7-50 Runnerstorm (Läufersturm) You need two teams, one approximately twice the size of the other. The bigger group decides on a commander. The commander does not fight, his task is commanding only. The smaller group is made out of runners who should cooperate but act on their own. What is trained: The bigger group practices to get rid of the last opposing survivors after the main battle, the commander has to react to diffrent situations and guide his team, the runners learn to fight in a short-handed situation. Fighters: 7-25 Lonely wolves (Einsame Wölfe) There is one lone wolf for every 2-3 players. To establish them in the game, everyone lines up in a circle facing outward. A game leader then goes around the inside of the circle and selects the appropriate number of wolves from the circle. On the „Go!“ from the game leader, everyone then calls out their task (wolves or hunters) and the battle begins. Usual values 3vs1, 4vs2, 5vs2. What is trained: Organization in chaos situation, Communication in chaos, Dynamic fighting in uncertain situations. Persons: Game Master + 4< Border Guard (Grenzwache) First you need two groups: The border guard and the runners. The Guards are one fighter short of twice as much as the runners (G=R*2-1). The guards have to defend a line and are not supposed to leave the line by more than 2 m. The runners win if one of them manages to cross the border. What is trained: The guards practice to guard a certain area (rear guard), the runners train to break through. Fighters: 5-14 You shall not pass! (Du kommst nicht vorbei!) Variant of the Border Guard game (different division of groups and no line binding, so more chaos and therefore easier for the attacking team). Fighters are divided into three equal groups. One team consists of one group and the other team consists of two groups. The playing field is rectangular and quite large. The teams each start at their back baseline. The goal of the smaller team is to have one fighter reach the opponent's baseline. The larger team has won when the small group is completely defeated. What is trained: Dynamics & speed as a runner, coordination of defense & runner-. Catching, communication of the teams People: 6-12 Teams-Circle with Runners (Formationszirkel mit Läufern) This game is a circle of dishonor with three teams fighting each other. The teams should be about equal in strength. To make things more interesseting add some runners who belong to no team. The last surviving team wins. Whether the runners survive or not does not matter. The runners win if the last team is smaller than the remaining runners. What is trained: tactic movement with regard to the other groups (like in the triangle), having a rearguard Variations: 4 or 5 equal groups no runners Fighters: 27-150 Teams-Circle with Allies (Formationszirkel mit festen Bündnissen) Basically this is a circle of dishonor, only instead of single fighters you got teams fighting each other. First, divide into six groups of equal strength and form a circle. Your group and the one directly across are allied. At the start of the game, try to get your team together without loosing fighters. In the end, the remaining team wins. Variations: divide into 8 or 10 groups, so you get 4 or 5 teams respectively try 9 or 12 groups, with 3 groups beeing in one team add runners What is trained: Staying together, coordination, moving the whole groupe at once keeping track of the enemy teams integration of groups into one team maneuvering a big group Fighters: 36-200 en/theoretisches/uebungen_spiele.txt Zuletzt geändert: 2021-10-14 13:59von FalkeHow to professionally manage people more passive than you
In meetings and during a conversation, we all tend to sit on a continuum between passive to aggressive. Depending on where we sit, we will find ourselves having to manage those who are more unassertive than we are.
Many of us find it challenging to manage very passive people in meetings and conversations effectively. We have this issue because we don’t want to be…THE CLOSING DOOR
TRANSLATION ALERT #63
The Closing Door | Neal Frisby’s Sermon CD #148
God bless your hearts. It’s good to be here. Any day in the house of God is a good one. Isn’t it? If faith could just rise as strong as the latter-day apostles’ and as powerful as Jesus’s, what a wonderful thing! Lord, all this people that are here today, with an open heart—now, we are coming to you, and we believe that you are going to touch them—the new ones and the ones that are here, Lord, taking away the tension of this world. The old flesh, Lord, binds them up and tightens them up from their jobs in different ways—the anxieties that get hold of them. I believe that you are going to move and release them, and let them feel free, Lord. The restoration—surely, we are in the bible days of restoration—restore thy people to the original power. And the original power shall be restored, saith the Lord. It will come; I believe it. Like rain on a thirsty land, it will pour forth over my people. Touch them, Lord. Touch their bodies. Take away their pain and sicknesses. Meet every need and supply their needs that they may help you and work for you, Lord. Touch all of them together in great power and faith. We command it. Give the Lord a handclap! Thank you, Jesus. Praise God. [Bro. Frisby made some comments about current conditions in the world and the problem/danger of drug addiction among young people. He read an article about the damaging effect of heroin on a young fashion model].
Now, listen real close as I wrote this here: A Definite Belief. Do you know that people today do not have it even in Pentecostal circles? Sometimes, the fundamentalists do not have a definite stand. They have a cause. They have some kind of a belief, a little bit, but no definite stand. God is looking for a definite stand. That is what He told me. You must have a definite stand and most of them do not have a definite stand at all. Many of the movements and systems, no real stand. It is wishy washy, you know, from one time to the next. About healing? “Yes, you know, I don’t know.” They talk about the healing power and they talk about this and that—from the lukewarm to the apostates, and even Pentecostals–but they don’t have any click to it. They believe in full salvation, some of them, in baptism and in healing, but there is no stability. They’ve got to be definite. How many of you believe that? If you are not definite, then you are wishy washy. “Well, I don’t know. Does it really matter?” It sure does, saith the Lord. When the disciples and the apostles, and those in Old Testament gave their lives for the Word of God, the blood ran, the fire burned, and the torture came, but the Word of God came forth. It does count, and it is going to mean something too.
In 2 Timothy 1: 12 Paul said, “I know in whom I have believed…” Now, 50% to 75% of the people in the movements do not know in whom they believe; the Holy Spirit, Jesus or God, who to go to…. Not only did he [Paul] say “I know in whom I have believed,” but that He is able to keep what He has given him until that day—no matter what He has given me. How many of you believe that? He is able to keep it. We did a lot of prophecy last week and a lot of people come to hear about prophecy and so forth. But today, it is more of a down-to-heart message that you should be definite. Don’t be wishy washy. Make a stand. You know some people are kind of born [that way] that once they make a stand—and it is a good one, too–especially if they’ve got the right belief in this bible and they are really stubborn about it and believe it in their hearts. Not to the point that they are going to hurt themselves or somebody, but they really believe it and then have a definite stand, hold to that stand and never give up ground. Paul didn’t. “I am persuaded. I know in whom I have believed.” He was not wishy washy. He stood before Agrippa. He stood before kings. He stood before Nero. He stood before all of them that were officials. “I know in whom I have believed. You can’t move me.” He stayed right with the One in whom he believed, not matter what. That is what is going to count and the Lord saith so. I believe it and I know because we are coming down to a time when people are going to have a level of lukewarmness; “It doesn’t matter.” It matters a lot to the Lord.
So, we find out in here: I know in whom I have believed, and He is able to keep me unto that day. And he said whether it be angels, hunger, cold, nakedness, prison, beatings, demons, man or whatsoever—we have read about those fourteen tribulations. What shall keep me from the love of God? Shall the prison, shall the beatings, shall hunger, shall cold, shall fasting often…the night watches, perilous places? What shall keep me from the love of God? Shall angels or principalities? No. Nothing shall separate me from the love of God…. He pinned it down for each one of us. I know in whom I have believed. Paul was traveling on the road. He persecuted the Lord. He became ashamed of himself afterwards. The light struck. He quivered. He went into blindness. He said, “Who art thou, Lord?” He said, “I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.” “Who art thou, Lord?” “I am Jesus.” That was enough for him. So, Paul said, “I know in whom I have believed.” He trembled. Paul did. Knowing the very God who had promised to come–that he had made the same mistake as the Pharisees—but he made up for it. “For in nothing am I behind the chiefest apostles, though I be nothing” (2 Corinthians 12: 11). “I am the least of all saints because I had persecuted the church.” That’s what he said even though his position that God has given him is incredible. God is honest. He will be where God is going to put him. Amen?
Now, people, this is what is happening: if they don’t have a definite stand and things are not definite…. In the beginning, there was nothing here in this galaxy at that point. It was an open door God made. He just opened up nothing from nothing, and He created where we are now, this galaxy and other solar systems, and planets through an open door. He walked in time door and created it [time] from eternity where there is no time. When He created matter, force, time began for this planet. He brought it. So, there is a door. We are in a door. This galaxy and the Milky way is a door. If you want to go on to the next galaxy, you go through another one [door]. They call them black holes sometimes, and different things, but this is the place that God made right here among millions and trillions of places that the scientists never had it so wonderful to see such glory and wonders of beauty…. Their eyes cannot behold such a Majestic God out there. But this place, He opens the door and the door closes too when He want it to close. Now, listen to this right here: it will close if you don’t have a definite stand. It is going to close. Satan—God had a door opened in heaven for him. Satan just kept on. Pretty soon, he knew more than the Lord did [so he thought]. “After all, how do I know how He got here.” He wasn’t a real angel. See; he was an imitator. And you know what? It wasn’t very long until the Lord kicked him out of that door and he crashed somewhere down here on this planet. As lightning would fall, satan went down through the door that God had.
Now, in Eden, a little later on after the pre-Adamic kingdom of satan that he tried to set up…. We come to the Garden of Eden…. In Eden, God gave His Word and talked to them [Adam and Eve]. Then sin came. They didn’t stay with a definite stand. Eve wandered from the plan. Adam was not as watchful as he should have been. But she wandered from the plan. By the way, this has two titles. The subtitle of it is A definite stand. The name of it is The Door is Closing. Satan can’t get back through that door anymore unless God allows him to, but for eternity, No. And he doesn’t want anything to do with it because his mind is deranged. That’s what happens when people go so far, you know. So, after the fall—they didn’t stay definite and after the fall—that was the first church, Adam and Eve—they lost that nature of divinity, but still they lived on for a long time. God would come and talk to them and He did talk to them. God forgave them, but you know what? He closed the door to Eden and the door was shut. He drove them out of the Garden and He put at the front entrance of the gate a flaming sword, a sharp wheel that they might not enter back in there. And the door, saith the Lord, was closed and they wandered out across the land. It was closed at that time.
We come on down right after, and the doors were closing, one right after the other. The Mesopotamians, not too long after that, the Mesopotamian civilization sprang forth, the Great Pyramid was built. The door was shut. It wasn’t opened until the 1800s—all of its secrets. He sealed it away in the great flood. And then, the ark—the people didn’t take a definite stand. Noah did. God had given the Word and He gave him [Noah] a definite stand. He took that stand. He built that ark. And as God revealed it to me, and as I know what He showed me, the door of this church age is closing. It won’t be long, it will close right out into the great tribulation. Noah, pleading with the people, but all they would do was laugh, mock. They had a better way. They went out of their way to do things that would irritate him. They even became wicked on purpose. They did things you wouldn’t believe to taunt Noah. “But I am persuaded, and I know who I talked to,” Noah said. I know in whom I believed. Finally, the people would not listen, and Jesus said that at the end of the age that we live in, it will be the same way. The animals came in…. They had been driven out by house building and industries, and pollutions… and different things…highways built, and trees cut down—something was up…. The same as in Noah’s day the animals knew by instinct that they better find a place. They could feel the rumble. They could sense something in the heavens, something in the earth, and by the reaction of the people that something was wrong; they better get to that ark. When they got in and God had got His children in there, the closing of the door took place. God closed the door. You know what? No one else got in there. The door was closed. How many of you believe that?
We find out; you say “Doors, where did you get all these doors?” He’s had them in every church age. Ephesus, Paul said with tears, “After I am gone, they are going to come in here like wolves and they are going to try to overthrow what I have built.” Jesus threatened to remove that candlestick because they had lost their first love for souls. The first love for God, they did not have it anymore…. Abraham was standing by the tent door and the Lord moved in such a way that He startled Abraham, but there was a door. He told Abraham, “I am going to close door to Sodom. After the four got out, God closed the door. Like atomic energy of some sort, the city went up in flames like a burnt furnace the next day. God practically predicted the time. Many times, in the bible, He predicted the comings and goings of different events. The [time of the] translation has already been kept, but He predicted it too by signs. If you tie the symbols together, the signs and the numerology—not the kind they have in the world—but the numerical values in the bible, if you tie them together, and the prophecies, and you have them together, you will come up with a close period of the translation because in many places [in the bible] He would tell what He was going to do. He told Abraham…. All of a sudden, the door was closed to Sodom. God had given a warning. He told them all about it, but they went on with their…laughing, their drinking and all that they could do, and what they imagined to do. Today, we have reached the portals of where they were, and surpassed it in some cities. From the gutters and the skylines of Manhattan, they do the same things. From the rich and famous to the ones on the street that look homeless and on drugs, they are all in the same boat nearly; one glamorizes and covers it up. Finally, some of those on the street because they are busted, their lives are torn, their families are broken, and their door is closed. So, God closed the door on Sodom, and fire came upon it.
Matthew 25: 1-10: He told them the parable of the wise and the foolish virgins. He told them about the midnight cry. The midnight cry, the silence. After the silence and the trumpet, the fire falls, one third of the trees are burnt; the bride is gone! We are getting closer and closer; in symbolism and signs we are getting nearer and nearer. The door is getting closer to being closed in the bible there. In Matthew 25, the foolish were asleep. They had the Word of God, but they had lost their first love. They were foolish and stable. They were not certain. They didn’t have a definite stand on all the Word of God. They had a stand on part of the Word of God, enough to get salvation, but they didn’t have a definite stand like Paul “I know in whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that He will keep it until that day.” Paul, God has kept it…. And after the midnight cry, the bride warned the foolish, warned the wise, and woke them up just in time. Then all of a sudden, in a moment…it’s all over with. It’s gone in a twinkling of an eye. What a God that we have! The bible said they went to those that sold, but they weren’t there. They are no more; they are with Jesus! And the bible said in Matthew 25, the door was closed. They knocked, but they couldn’t get in. The closing of the door—in this twentieth into the twenty-first century, the millennium door—and it was closed. He [Christ] didn’t know them [the foolish] at that time. There will be a great tribulation that pours out upon the world.
The bible says in Revelation 3: 20, “Behold, I stand at the door….” Jesus was standing at the door and He was knocking. He was standing outside the church that He had one time given an outpouring to, Laodicea. If any man has ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. There was Jesus, knocking at the door, but finally, the door was closed to the Laodiceans. He gave them a chance. “I will cast her in bed” and they will go through the great tribulation. The door is [still] open. Behold, I stand at the door. But I saw God, and the way that He moves, the door is closing like the ark. He is gradually closing out this century. I would say He would finish closing the door earlier probably but closing the door will go up as far as the tribulation saints too, closing them out. And He closed the door.
Moses was at the Ark and there was a door in the Veil. They went behind there and closed the door. He went in there for God and prayed for the people. Elijah, the prophet, preached, was turned down and rejected. The lukewarm rejected him…. “I and only I am alone,” it looked like. But he had given a witness to that generation. Finally… he crossed Jordan supernaturally. The waters just obeyed, by the Word. See; no matter what is, the Word backs him up, knocks them out of the way. By the Word, the waters obeyed, they opened up and the door of Jordan was closed. Here is another door: and he got to the chariot. When he got to the chariot, God got him in the chariot–and that is symbolic of the translation–and the door of the chariot was closed. The spinning wheels, like whirlwind, went up and he went up into the heavens, and shut things out. The closing of the door. How many of you believe that?
The Philadelphian Church age has a door no man can open. That’s your age that you are living now, off of Laodicea. No man can open it. No man can shut it. “I leave an open door. I can shut it when I want to, and I can open it when I want to.” That’s exactly right. He opened up revival in the 1900s and closed it down. He opened it up in 1946, closed it down again and separation came. He opened it again and it is fixing to close. A quick short revival and the Philadelphian age will be closed out. He closed out Smyrna. He closed the door. He closed out the Ephesian church age. He closed out Sardis. He closed out Thyatira. He closed out each door and the seven doors were closed and sealed. No more [people] can get in; they are sealed away for the saints of those ages. Now, Laodicea, the door is going to be closed. He was knocking at the door. Philadelphia is an open door. He can open it and shut it when He wants to….
Revelation 10: out of a time door from eternity came an Angel. He came down, wrapped in rainbow and a cloud, and fire on His feet—beautiful and powerful. He had a message, little roll in His hand, came on down. He set one foot on the sea and with one hand there and from eternity, He declared that time shall be no more. And from that time, we are nearing the translation. That is the first time capsule. And then it would be the next chapter [Revelation 11], the tribulation temple, time capsule. The next one, the beast power over there—time capsule at the end as we go on out and blend into eternity…. He is at the door. There is, saith the Lord, the gates and the door to hell, and I burst asunder the gates of hell. And Jesus tore down the gates and walked into hell itself at the door. There is a doorway to hell…. There is a road that leads to hell and that door is always open. Like Sodom, it is open until God closes it and casts it [hell] into the lake of fire. That door is open; the doorway that goes into hell. You have a door, the gates into heaven. There is a doorway into heaven. That door is open. God has got the Holy City coming, one of these days. But before that, the great atomic war will wipe out millions of people, nearly this earth, nearly—through hunger and starvation…. If He didn’t intervene there would be no flesh saved, but what is left is not very many and I tell about how Zechariah described the weapons. They melted while on their feet, millions, hundreds of thousands in the cities and wherever people are.
The door: it’s coming. After the atomic war, there is a door into the millennium. And the door on this old world, the one that we know and the one that we live in…. You know way back before Eden even before the pre-Adamic Kingdom in there, He closed the door on the Dinosaur age. There was an Ice age; it was closed. It came into age of Adam, 6000 years ago…. God has these doors. You get through some of these time doors that go through this universe; before you get into eternity, you would think you are in eternity. There is no end to God. And I’ll tell you one thing…He’s got a door that will never be closed for us. That door is open, and you will never find the end of it, saith the Lord. That’s right. The door into the millennium and after the millennium; the books are opened for all of the judgments. The sea and everything gave up the dead, and they were judged by the books that were written. Daniel saw it [the judgment] too. And then the books were closed like a door. It’s over, and the Holy City came down. The door of the saints: no one could get in there except the ones that God predestinated to go in and out—the ones that are supposed to be there. They have an effectual door to go in there.
God gives us a door of faith. Each of you is given a measure of faith, and it’s your door of faith. The bible calls it a door of faith. You enter into that door with God and you begin to use that measure [of faith]. Like anything that you plant, you get more seeds from it and you plant more seeds. Finally, you get a whole bunch of fields of wheat and you keep using that [measure of faith] there. But the door is closing. The Veil door opened in heaven… and the Ark was seen. So, we see, in the last age, God is lifting the veil now. His people are coming home. During that time, there is going to be foolishness, there is going to be scoffers, and there will be people that have plenty of time—ignorant, people that are careless. They have no stability. There is no definite plan. They are just kind of wishy washy. They are on sand. They are not on the Rock, and they are going to sink…. The door will be closed. It is closing now. How many of you believe that? If you don’t have a definite stand, the door will close. You must remember; He is at the door. But as I have said by the Holy Spirit, we are that close. “Behold, I stand at the door,” and He is closing it out at the end of the age there. Jesus said, “I am the Door of the sheep” meaning that at night, He would lay across the doorway in the little place where they had them [the sheep]. He has become the Door, so that nothing can go through the Door; it has to come through Him first. Jesus has got us in a little corral-like, in a little place. Wherever it is, Jesus is laying across the door. He is there at the door. “I am the Door of the sheep. They go in and out, and I watch them.” He’s got the door for us. I believe this: we are going to get to water. We are going to find pasture, aren’t we? We are going to get all that we need there. He leads me besides still waters, green pastures, and all of this, the Word of God.
In the fast-paced age that we live in, hectic movement, the nervousness, the age of no patience—run over them, don’t go around them is the name of the game, the mob scene—wherever the mob is, that is God? Well, wherever the mob is, generally, God is somewhere else. How many of you believe that? Not that you can’t have large crowds, but [when] you go pulling millions of systems together and mingle and mix them with all kinds of things that are going to come into one, you’ve got a mob. You have the underworld, you have Babylon; treacherous, dangerous, murderous…deceivable, delusive, full of it, imitator, glamorous, greedy, growing, seducing…. She [has] fornicated with the nations, all the nations, Mystery Babylon, controlling finally the economic Babylon…it’s coming, and it’s here now. The closing of the door and the opening to heaven is coming. We don’t have long….
God closed the door. At the beginning, He shut out satan, and at the end, He is going to let the saints in through the door that He shut for satan. We are coming. But now, as the age begins to end, it’s the closing of the door. Right now, there is still time to get in. There is still time to do something for the Lord, and believe me; it’s not going to always be [time do something for the Lord]. It’s going to finally shut and then those that are sealed in—we which are alive and remain shall not prevent them—the graves will be opened. They will walk about. May be in a moment’s time, though, we don’t know how long, then we will be caught up together. My, what a beautiful picture! Possibly, at that time, somebody may have died that you knew, and it hurt you so bad. The next day, translation took place and they walked up and said, “I am Ok.” May be, you lost somebody two or three months or a year ago. If translation takes place—at the time of translation—and they say, “I feel fine. Here I am. Look at me now.” Isn’t that wonderful? Sure, you are never going to find anything like that. That’s my message. I tried to make it to where it is like, it is because if you don’t have a definite plan, the door will close on you.
So, the Closing of the Door is the title name of it [the sermon], but the subtitle is A Definite Plan. If they don’t have one [a definite plan], the door will close. “I am persuaded. I know in whom I have believed. Neither angels nor principalities, nor devils, nor demons, nor hunger, nor death itself, nor any beating, nor jail…their threats should keep me from the love of God.” Oh, walk on, Paul. Walk on them streets of gold! Amen. How great it is! What we need is a new wave of revival and that is coming. The door is in motion. It’s finally coming to an end. But explosive events will be on every side in the 90s…. We are in the last round up, folks. So, what you want to do is: listen to me; you get it in your heart. I know in whom I believe, and I am persuaded, no matter what—sickness, death or what would strike—I know in whom I believe, and I am persuaded in whom I believe, the Lord Jesus. Put it in your heart. Don’t wander about, “Do I really believe?” Get strong, and definitely you know in whom you believe, and you always keep it like that in your heart; you have a definite plan. Hold to that plan and believe that way. He will keep you until that day. The Lord will keep your faith.
When you enter here, you are entering into the door of faith. I believe God is going to bless your heart. I want you to stand to your feet this morning. Don’t follow the crowd and the mob. Follow the Lord Jesus. Be with the Lord Jesus and know who you are with. Know at all times that you believe in Him. If you need Jesus this morning, all you have to do is say—there is only one name, the Lord Jesus—I accept you in my heart and I know in whom I believe too. If you are definite, boy, you are going to get answers from Him. He is faithful. But if you are not faithful, see; He just stands there, waiting. But if you are faithful to confess, He is faithful to forgive. So, you say, “I am going to confess.” He’s [already] forgiven. That’s how faithful He is. You say, “When did he forgive me?” He forgave you at the cross, if you have enough sense to know how God works in faith. He’s all power. Can you say, Amen?
I want you to lift up your hands in the air. Let’s praise Him in the door of praise. Amen? Lift up your hands. As He is closing the door, let’s get more in. Let’s get a few more prayers in. Let’s stand by in the Lord. Be behind the Lord. Let’s stand up. Let’s have a definite plan…. We are going to be definite about the Lord Jesus. We are going to stabilize with the Lord Jesus. We are going to be part of the Lord Jesus. In fact, we are going to be so glued to the Lord Jesus that we are going away with Him. Now, shout the victory!
The Closing Door | Neal Frisby’s Sermon CD #148Education.”
Umeå University in Sweden last year awarded Wineburg an honorary doctorate, and he was there Oct. 20 to give a talk see video below to acknowledge the honor. What he chose to discuss reached beyond his research as a scholar in historical pedagogy — how we teach history — to a very different subject: How can faculty in schools of education actually influence the way history is taught.
And for Wineburg, it involves taking a critical step. He no longer focuses solely on producing articles for academic journals. He has embraced using the Internet to deliver his lessons directly to school districts, teachers and students.
About 19 months ago, Wineburg’s Stanford History Education Group's posted a free curriculum on its website, and since then it has received more than 600,000 downloads. In his talk at Umeå, he projected that the total number of downloads could hit 1 million in the next few months.
The lecture see video below underscored what Wineburg sees as a fundamental problem in measuring success for an academic navigating how to impart knowledge in the digital age. Wineburg described a fundamental disconnect. The criteria universities use to define success don't adequately consider the type of digital work that can most directly benefit practitioners outside of academia.
Wineburg likened the situation to being "responsible to two different masters." He noted that the academic world holds journal articles to be the key measure of a researcher's contributions to a field. Yet in an applied discipline such as education, there is also a duty to serve a much broader audience. Considering his responsibilities to teachers and students, he said, "What does it mean to change that field?"
Wineburg’s scholarship certainly has had an impact. In selecting him for the honorary doctorate, officials at Umeå wrote that he has “contributed more than any other individual researcher to changing the understanding of the teaching and learning of history.” They called his prize-winning book Historical Thinking and Other Unnatural Acts a modern classic within its field.
But in his lecture [see video below] Wineburg traced his effort to take his work to a broader audience — and how it was not an easy road. In 1999, with colleagues in the School of Education and others at George Mason University, he built a Web resource, "Historical Thinking Matters." The ambitious effort to deliver high-quality material to underserved students had an unexpected outcome.
"We'd created a resource that was so difficult to use that only the best-trained history teachers used it," Wineburg said. In attempting to close an educational gap, he noted, the project may have inadvertently widened it. "This was my first lesson in ... creating materials and dispensing them on the Internet, my first lesson in learning how to tweet, even though this was done before Twitter came into being."
Wineburg regrouped. He wanted to put original source material on the Web so that students of varying academic abilities could interpret them and learn to think like historians. Working with graduate students Abby Reisman and Bradley Fogo, Wineburg worked to make the material more accessible. And four years ago, his Stanford History Education Group teamed with the San Francisco Unified School District to implement the team's "Reading Like a Historian" curriculum in the city's secondary schools.
There were concerns that the program, which emphasizes original source documents as an alternative to textbooks, would be stiff work for the students, many of whom were English-language learners from low-income families. Yet a dissertation completed by Reisman showed that the students who engaged with the primary source documents improved their overall reading ability, increased their retention of historical knowledge, and displayed a greater appreciation for history.
Reisman published the findings of her dissertation in two leading academic journals. Their combined circulation? About 30,000 readers. Wineburg marveled at how many more people had learned about the curriculum through his group’s website. And he expressed concern that academics may not be fully grasping the extent of the change.
“Our worry is that as we continue to produce ... journal articles we are not [missing] the profound changes in how information is disseminated in modern society,” he said. “The university — particularly professional schools that are supposed to be producing knowledge for practitioners — is being left behind. We are becoming less and less relevant to the people who most need our knowledge."
Wineburg has established a robust website. Next on his agenda: Figuring out how to best leverage Twitter.

Incendiary posturing can set off those that carry matches.
We’ve now seen this play out dramatically in Michigan.
Final week, six males, members of a right-wing militia group calling themselves the Wolverine Watchmen, had been arrested and charged with plotting to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan earlier than the November elections. Seven others had been charged underneath Michigan’s anti-terrorism legislation for allegedly in search of to recruit a military of 200 to storm the Michigan Capitol and ignite a “civil war.”
The plot went far past the Fb bluster. The defendants, in line with the criticism, held “field training exercises,” bought a taser to be used within the kidnapping, examined an explosive gadget, possessed and educated with firearms, and performed surveillance of Whitmer’s trip house, and of a bridge that could be blown as much as impede police response.
One argued that they need to put the governor on trial for treason. One other allegedly urged: “Snatch and grab man. Grab the f**** governor. Just grab the b****. Because at that point … it’s over.” One other steered, “Have one person go to her house. Knock on the door and when she answers it just cap her.”
This right-wing home terrorism doesn’t fester in a vacuum. Confronted with the pandemic, Gov. Whitmer acted to guard the residents of her state, closing down personal services, requiring the carrying of masks and social distancing. She pushed publicly for wanted protecting tools within the face of the federal authorities’s disarray.
Donald Trump, who appears to be threatened by robust ladies leaders, repeatedly referred to as her out personally. Republicans within the state legislature referred to as her a “tyrant” and railed in opposition to her actions, although most Michigan residents supported her efforts to battle the unfold of the coronavirus.
The festering anger broke out in a shocking demonstration in April when a big rally, that includes Trump posters, swastikas, Accomplice flags, Hawaiian shirts (image of the anti-government “boogaloo” motion) surrounded the capitol. Males in fatigues carrying assault rifles crammed the galleries of the Capitol yelling threats on the legislators under. In response to police, NRA-promoted “open carry” legal guidelines left them powerless to cease them.
The Republican speaker of the Home stated, “There’s nothing more American than people coming together to ensure their voices are being heard.” Trump responded not by criticizing the demonstrators, however by tweeting “LIBERATE MICHIGAN.”
Although Trump selected to not create nationwide requirements and left the states to function on their very own, he continued to criticize Whitmer and others for not opening their economies quicker. He spewed out tweets as if he was an adolescent taking pictures spitballs when the instructor’s again is turned.
Solely he isn’t an adolescent; he’s president of the US. And his incendiary phrases incite.
Republican legislators within the state took up Trump’s follies, becoming a member of in scorning masks as oppressive, and denouncing the governor in harsh phrases, calling her actions to cease the unfold of the pandemic “tyrannical,” evaluating them to the Japanese assault on Pearl Harbor, labeling her a dictator. Indicators like “tyrants get the rope,” “Ditch the Witch” and “Heil Whitler” started to appear alongside Accomplice flags and calls to “Let us free from tyranny.”
A Republican chief within the Senate joined with the armed demonstrators in a rally. A kind of on the stage was later indicted as a part of the plot in opposition to the governor.
Requested to denounce white supremacy and the right-wing militia Proud Boys within the first presidential debate, Trump memorably referred to as on them to “stand back and stand by.” The Proud Boys took that as a mandate and a slogan. The plotters had been emboldened.
When the plot got here out, Whitmer drew the inescapable connections: “When our leaders meet with, encourage, or fraternize with domestic terrorists, they legitimize their actions and they are complicit. When they stoke and contribute to hate speech, they are complicit.”
“Just last week, the president of the United States stood before the American people and refused to condemn white supremacists and hate groups like these two Michigan militia groups,” Whitmer stated, noting that those that had been plotting to kidnap her had “heard the president’s words not as a rebuke but as a rallying cry — as a call to action.”
Reasonably than apologize, the pinnacle of the state Republican Celebration launched a letter criticizing Whitmer for not warning legislators in regards to the plot. Trump complained that she hadn’t thanked him for the work of the FBI, and sniped as soon as extra at her, “Gov. Whitmer of Michigan has done a terrible job. She locked down her state for everyone, except her husband’s boating activities.”
As a former Trump Homeland Safety official, Miles Taylor, has argued, “[T]he president’s rhetoric has served as a loaded gun for those groups who have since taken his words as sort of permission to do what they’re doing.”
American politics is usually bare-fisted. Within the warmth of a marketing campaign, rhetoric can get overheated. When the nation is as polarized as this one, the rhetoric can go excessive. However accountable leaders search to convey us collectively, not drive us aside; they enchantment to the higher angels of our character, not our worst fears or prejudices. They attempt to discover methods to succeed in out to those that are alienated or fearful.
What a pacesetter can not do is fan their hatred or seem to offer them permission for violence.

God’s Plan for Humanity is for all of Us to have a Mother AND Father. Unfortunately Our fallen nature has caused tremendous damage and corrupted what it means to be a Mother. Many children are left without mothers and many women have rejected the responsibility of Motherhood, either through Abortion or other selfish reasons.
In many countries, the title of “Mother” (and Father) has been replaced by generic, lesser titles like “Caregiver”, “Guardian”, “Parent1” or “Parent2”. This has added to the confusion and continues to lead to the destruction of Families.
“Seeing his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing near her, Jesus said to his mother, ‘Woman, this is your son.'”John 19:26 – New Jerusalem Bible
As Catholics we have Our Blessed Mother in Heaven. We Believe that Jesus gives His Mother to Us through John. We know this is what the passage in the bible means as this is an ancient teaching that has been passed down in the Church through tradition. Jesus knew that We would need to have a mother when our own mothers fail Us. He knew that Women also need an example of motherhood to emulate and to strive for.
Many people have been brought to the Catholic Faith thanks to Our Blessed Mother.
St Joseph Terror of Demons, Thank You for Protecting Your Spouse, the Mother of God and Our Mother as well throughout Her time here on Earth. We Pray that through your intercession, Jesus helps to Protect, Bless and Guide all Mothers in their Vocation.Today around noon…I went for a run. It’s been a couple of weeks since I’ve been able to…struggling with an injury to my calf sustained…not by running, dancing, playing or anything wild and crazy like that.. No! I got a strained calf from…of all things…wearing high heels.
The sun was bright and the humidity of summer that had gone on vacation for a few days was boldy shouting out another “I’m here” as the door slammed behind me on my way out.
I love to run. The solace. The quiet. The offering of myself to the movement, the air around me and the path ahead. Somewhere on that run today I tossed up a request…send me something today. I’m having a tough go of it lately and could use some comfort…send me a little something that will say “I’m here” and I will know why and breathe it in.
About four this afternoon, I received a phone call from a friend…someone who doesn’t typically land on the W&F side…that would be warm and fuzzy…someone who has actually described himself as steely and stubborn. “I wanted to read this to you, because it reminded me of you.” I prepared for some launch into the more classic “you can do this” or “get up and get going” kind of diatribe…when he started into this.
“It doesn’t interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for, and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart’s longing.”
It took only these first few words to reveal the “I’m here”…the words I had asked for during my run were coming in through the front door, carried in by the least likely of messengers.
He continued.

Wonder if maybe you…yep the one who made it to the very end of this essay and is grateful you did, might have asked for an unlikely messenger to bring this message in from the heat and humidity to refresh, invigorate and remind…because you, needed it, requested it. You opened the door and let it in.

Molly,
I read the entire “Be Careful What You Ask For” message with an open mind.
At the risk of sharing an answer that might seem simplified…
Simply put, “I am grateful for YOU!”
Greg
I love that piece – a friend of mine gave me a notebook with that inscribed in it!! 🙂 I so needed to read this today. I’m in NY for grad school, not sure I really want to be here, although it’s something I’ve worked so hard for. Be careful what you wish for, indeed.
I have always found this reading/meditation a powerful ‘stop me in my tracks/mind’ piece. I’ve shared it often in the retreats I facilitate and with those who come to sit with me to share the movement of Spirit in their lives and how the Mystery I call God might be nudging them forward to a door waiting for them to step through into something or some way of being that is new and life-giving. Thanks for this, Molly.
This is amazing, Molly! This is exactly what I needed right now. Thanks!
I look forward to connecting with you once you are out in the big world!!!Gastroenterology

Coming into the D.C. City Title Game between Theodoore Roosevelt and DeMatha at the Verizon Center last night, everyone thought DeMatha would have a decided advantage. The WCAC has proven over the last few City Title games to be superior to the DCIAA, and DeMatha is the posterboy for the conference's excellence.
On paper, DeMatha is a vastly superior team. As I wrote yesterday, they had a significant size advantage at every single position, and most of their players will play basketball at the next level. This might not be one of the best DeMatha teams in recent memory, but it is still a team that would have dominated the DCIAA.
But once the game started, all of that was thrown out the window. What Roosevelt lacked in size, they made up for in physicality and perseverance. They picked up DeMatha full court on every possession, making things difficult for point guard James Robinson as soon as he got the ball.They fouled Mikael Hopkins and Beejay Anya instead of letting them use their size to bully them in the post. And when a DeMatha player dove on the ball for a loose ball, it seemed like he was always fighting three or four Roosevelt players for posession. It was the exact type of scrappy performance that they needed to stay competitive in this game.
In the final few minutes, the game was a lot closer than anyone would have guessed. The two teams traded buckets for a couple minutes, and after Roosevelt scored with 1:05, the game was tied at 50. Then, the greatest disrepancy between the two conferences came into play. The WCAC plays with a shot clock, but the DCIAA does not. So these title games are played without one. DeMatha coach Mike Jones instructed Robinson to run the least exciting play in basketball, the 65 second hold for one.
Robinson dribbled the ball at half court for a little while, passed a few times, took the ball to the hoop and got fouled with four seconds left, and made both free throws. Roosevelt's inbound pass on a potential game-tying possession went array, and DeMatha escaped with a 52-50 win.
I thought this game would be a showcase for DeMatha, an opportunity to show just how far apart the have's were from the have not's. But that didn't turn out to be the case. Roosevelt played with a lot of pride, and most importantly, they played like they deserved to be on the same court as the mighty DeMatha Stags. When somebody plays like that, it doesn't matter what their resume says. And maybe that is the kind of basketball game we can expect from the City Title game in the future.This week the most prevalent butterfly in my garden was the Silver-spotted Skipper (Epargyreus clarus) of which I counted 5 on 4 different days throughout the week (06/06/2021 – 06/11/2021).
Aside from the easily recognizable Silver-spotted Skipper, identifying most of the skippers is a challenge. iNaturalist suggests possibilities and I am tentatively calling this Southern Broken-Dash (Wallengrenia otho), hoping for a confirmation. I saw a similar one the next day, but couldn’t get close enough for a photo. There usually are many skippers but I’ve never recorded this kind before, so am skeptical. [UPDATE: 6-17-2021 ID from Carolina Leps confirms as Southern Broken-Dash, a first for me.]
On June 8 and 11 I encountered the first Duskywings of the year. iNaturalist has not been much help so far in identifying these either. I tentatively listed one as Zarucco Duskywing (Erynnis zarucco) and the second as Horace’s Duskywing -(E. horatius), but my photographs are not very clear. I thinks it’s possible they could be the same individual. [UPDATE: 6-17-2021 ID from Carolina Leps suggest this is probably Horace’s Duskywing (Erynnis horatius).]
On each of 3 days I encountered a Common Buckeye (Junonia coenia). This little butterfly flits all over the garden and has been difficult to photograph. In the shortest amount of time it lands briefly on clover or grass, mulch, iris and penstemon leaves, not caring it could have a lovely portrait made if it would just be still! One finally slowed down a fraction to nectar on the butterfly bush.
While fretting around the butterfly bush trying to photograph the buckeye I enjoyed the happenstance of a cool moth sighting. I managed a few images of a Hummingbird Clearwing (Hemaris thysbe) (June 11, 2021). Gotta love those wings!
My favorite butterfly visitor this week was on 6/9/2021, another Pipevine Swallowtail (Battus philenor), the third in the garden this year. Its colors were so rich as if it were freshly inked!
There were flowers happening throughout the garden too which I will share another time. Off to attend the Plant Symposium. Enjoy your weekend!Desert Green
I've always been a city girl with wanderlust for the desert. I love the landscape, the flora, the color palette, and the feeling of wide open space. Naturally, when it came time to make a move to Phoenix in fall 2019, I was all in.
As I set out to style our new home, I wanted to bring some of my favorite things about the outdoors, inside. I quickly discovered, however, just how difficult it was to find beautiful foliage AND design-forward pots/hangers all in one place. There were very few resources, and most of what was available didn't fit with my purchasing values or personal aesthetic. I knew there had to be many others out there experiencing the same thing.
So, with a background in marketing and small business, I decided to offer a solution. Enter Desert Green - a shop that marries the best parts of decorating your interior space with plants and flowers along with containers and vessels to display them. I have carefully created each product to uphold the ideals that make Desert Green unique: PHX grown and nurtured; goods hand-crafted in the US; dedicated support of other female-owned businesses.
Be sure to look for us around Phoenix at various makers markets and follow along on social media.
Thank you for shopping. I'll see you in the desert!

Other types of interventions, such as physical exercise, are arguably useful if they’re not complemented with a diet treatment. In any case, exercise is an important measure to follow in any weight loss program.
Also, various medications such as orlistat, sibutramine, and rimonabant have proven effective in reducing weight in recent years. Overall, scientists confirmed their positive results in clinical trials in patients with a hypocaloric diet. However, keep in mind that most of these drugs have an anorexigenic effect. So, ultimately, facilitating the monitoring of a diet is the basis of their effectiveness.
It’s important to also mention that even the surgical treatment of obesity can fail in the long term. This is especially true if the obese person doesn’t change their eating habits.
However, despite this key role, traditional dietary treatments, even if carried out correctly, don’t lead to entirely satisfactory results in a sustained way. This is because most obese people who begin a dietary treatment abandon it. Also, many of those who continue it don’t lose weight. Plus, when they do lose it, many are bound to gain it back. Undoubtedly, the biggest problem with dietary treatments is the lack of follow-up.

You must follow a balanced diet and a regular exercise plan to prevent obesity. A specialist must supervise them both.
It’s important to keep in mind that highly restrictive diets are never healthy. This is because they lead to a significant loss of lean muscle and promote eating disorders. It’s for this reason that you must follow a Normocaloric diet plan designed for your specific needs. Most food recommendations are the same as for people with normal weight, mainly limiting the intake of saturated fats.
Also, we can find a series of foods that help prevent obesity:
A very important factor in the prevention of obesity is knowing how to choose filling types of food. As a rule, these are rich in fiber. This phenomenon is because fiber absorbs water. Thus, it’s volume doubles in the stomach. So, it leads to a feeling of fullness. When you feel full, then your desire to eat uncontrollably and continuously diminishes.
Some foods with these properties are:

Hypocaloric foods are those that offer low levels of energy. The idea of consuming them is for the body to intake fewer calories than it needs to burn any accumulated fat. Low-calorie foods can help prevent obesity as long as you consume them as part of a balanced diet.
Some examples are:
It’s crucial to follow a diet plan that’s been approved by a specialist to lose weight. That is one that allows you to feel full, so you won’t give up. It’s also very important to remain active and do some form of exercise. Overall, the most important thing in the prevention and treatment of obesity is discipline and motivation to achieve your goals.

Judith Kirscht tells the story of how the awkward girl who grew up on the Minnesota Prairie faces a life and family that has fallen apart. Having discovered her husband’s infidelity, she decides that she will stick it out until her oldest son has gone on to college and her daughter is adjusting better to school. Things take a turn when her husband carries things into deeper issues and she has some difficult decisions to make. While facing down the Benning family’s string of issues that have been passed down from father to sons, she refuses to turn a blind eye and faces the situation head on. Though she takes the hard road, it is the beginning of healing, but will it be enough to get her life back on track again?
Judith Kirscht has brilliantly chronicled the deep emotions and struggles that go along with infidelity and the way it ruins families in Home Fires. As she develops the emotions of the characters and unravels the plot, the added touch of her “venting” comic strip provides a unique twist to the telling of the story. I found myself deeply wrapped up in the emotions and struggles and had a tendency to wander off and explore issues from my own experience. Honest, real and profound, Home Fires will challenge you on a very deep level and open your heart on another.Bridal Veil Falls in March 2009

Where in the World is Bridal Veil Falls?Speaker
Dr Christopher Monahan (University of Washington)
Description
First principles calculations of the Bjorken-x dependence of hadron structure have been a long-standing challenge for lattice QCD. This year marks a significant milestone: the first determinations of parton distribution functions, which capture the longitudinal momentum structure of fast-moving hadrons, at physical pion masses. Moreover, there has been significant progress in our understanding of the theoretical frameworks underpinning these calculations, although not all sources of systematic uncertainty have been fully explored. I review the various approaches to extracting x-dependent hadron structure from lattice QCD and highlight recent results in both the meson and baryon sectors.

A SLIPPERY SLOPE INDEED…

It's not uncommon. I remember seeing babies in jars in college and wondering where the professor got them.

And then there was the abortionist in California who kept over 16,000 dead unborn children in his backyard in a mobile storage unit. And when efforts were made to provide them with a "Christian burial," the pro-aborts went to court to stop it.
Evil raising its head – mocking those who do nothing to stop it.
September 6, 2010 at 7:30 pm
Hunters mount deer heads on the wall. Anglers mount stuffed fish. Now we know what abortionists do once they're fully convinced of the nonhuman status of their victims.
I think I'm gonna hurl.

Steinbeck mentions babies in jars in Cannery Row…
September 7, 2010 at 5:03 am
I'm at the point now where I don't ask God to have mercy anymore, but to come swiftly and deal harshly with the proponents of this insanity.
The mind reels, and the stomach churns. I cannot fathom this kind of …vileness, depravity, I cannot even find the right word to describe this.
May the Lord come swiftly.
September 7, 2010 at 10:17 am
The Culture of Death is a concept that will lead us places far beyond abortion. We shall land in discussions about our fascination with "diseased" creation stories – like Frankenstein – and "diseased" resurrection stories – like teenage vampires in Twilight.
Our fascination with Death goes far beyond abortion. Even if we were to end the evil tomorrow, we would still be infected and would find another outlet for our "diseased" desires… maybe another war somewhere.
September 7, 2010 at 2:55 pm
I commented on NC Register site about this article and received a response, according to my e-mail. I could never get the sight with the article and comments to come up again.
Anyways, The NC replied on my e-mail that their position was that if the Government took taxes for abortion it was unacceptable; however, if not, then the mother had free choice and this was acceptable. God's Word does not support this as acceptable at all. I agree she has a choice but let her make it outside of the law, because it is against the law according to God.
Man made laws for convenience are plainly made for man.
I hope I misunderstood this response. Does having this hideous procedure (murder) legalized make it any less murder?
If your position is that the woman is protected under the law and you agree with it, according to the Bible you are in for a sad shock neighbor.

Victor sat down with a heavy sigh, letting his hands dangle between his knees. Slowly, he brought his eyes up to look at Terry. “So… your dad’s Nightmare. I mean, the actual personification of nightmares themselves.”
Terry raked his fingers through his hair, which was laying unusually flat on his head. “I’ve got a dad, and that is not him. It. Whatever.” Never mind that he hadn’t seen his father since he’d joined the Initiative. That wasn’t important.
Victor turned his eyes to the sun rising over the horizon. “Well, Doctor Strange got rid of him for now, in any case.” He clucked his tongue, which made a slightly odd sound (at least, to Terry). “And now you know your own secret origin.”
Terry grunted, rubbing his eyes with his thumb and forefinger. “I’m tired,” he sighed. “I’m afraid to go to sleep, and I’m so tired.”
“He’s gone now. It’s okay to sleep. I promise.”Reselling of exclusive sneakers is a niche yet powerful global market that trades more like art collecting or commodities trading.

Industar-23U 4,5/110 (Russian Индустар-23У) is an enlarger lens for large format photographic enlargers. Designed to film format 6,5x9 cm. Produced in 1955 in USSR on Lytkarino Optical Glass Factory (LZOS) and Krasnogorsk Factory Zvereva (KMZ). The optical design is 4 lenses in 3 groups (Tessar).
On my copy marked abbreviated name I23U 4.5/110.
Mounting Industar-23U 4,5/110 on Digital Camera
The lens is designed for the enlarger and does not have the focusing node. To make them comfortable to shoot, I adapted the special helicoid from Industar-50. The lens has a 39mm mounting thread. I attached the lens to a homemade helicoid by ring M39-M42. And then, I add two medium extension rings to shoot in a comfortable distance for photographing people. Focus range about 1.5-15 meters. To reach out to infinity, you need to replace one of the rings with a smaller one but then increase MFD.
Aperture petals
View on Nikon D80
With such a helicoid, the lens is convenient to shoot. The lens has a diaphragm with 6 petals. The diaphragm closes smoothly. On a scale marked values 4,5-5,6-8-11-16—aluminum aperture ring. The lens barrel is painted in dark gray.
Industar-23U 4,5/110 Photo Examples
All of the examples captured by the camera Nikon D3100, exports from RAW without any post-processing.
Industar-23U 4,5/110 Sharpness
At wide-open, the sharpness is not bad, but the lens is not super sharp. The lens is designed for large format.
f/ 4,5
Lens resolution at 5x magnification in the center/edge is 50/13 lines/mm. In fact, all enlarger lenses best behavior when shooting macro. Because they are then designed, but at infinity also behave decently.
f/ 4,5
When you close the aperture to a value of 5.6 and 8, the sharpness improves, but only slightly.

Industar-23U 4,5/110 Character and Bokeh
f/ 4.5
I have not found in bokeh Industar-23U 4.5/110 for something special, but nothing bad, I can not say.

f/ 4.5

Also, the lens does not keep the backlight. On the light side, it handles well, probably saving its constructive lens planted deep into the barrel about on the 5 mm.

Summary
The only positive quality Industar-23U 4.5/110 is its price. For a dime, you can get the lens with a Tessar design and a focal length of 110mm, attach it to a helicoid and shoot flowers, etc. However, the optical quality of the lens is still weak.

William Haggas tasted Epsom Oaks success last year with Dancing Rain and he appears to possess a strong chance of securing back-to-back successes with Vow.
Vow has been considerably impressive in winning on her opening two career starts and 6/1 may represent considerable each-way value come race day at Epsom.
The daughter of 2005 Epsom Derby winner Motivator began with a tough success at Newbury, where she was being shaken up a long way out, but made fast progress in the final furlong to win a shade cosily.
There are grounds to believe that she was not suited by the soft surface and the maiden has thrown up some big-race winners in the past, most notably 2005 Oaks winner Eswarah and Dancing Rain.
Vow has since been sent to the Oaks trial at Lingfield where she was ridden far closer to the front and again won well in the end, albeit that she looked remarkably green when striking the front down the home straight, wandering right across the track.
It is worth noting that all of the last eight Oaks winners have previously finished in the first two in a recognised Oaks Trial.
However, not since 1999 has the Lingfield winner followed up in the Oaks, although Look Here did win at Epsom in 2008 after taking second at Lingfield, while Midday occupied the same two positions a year later but in the reverse order.
Given that Vow has run so greenly thus far, there has to be doubts as to how well she will cope with the demands of Epsom, but she certainly deserves to take her chance based on the improvement that could well be in the pipeline.
Other factors that could be in Vow’s favour are that eight of the last ten Oaks winners have started at prices of 10/1 or shorter, her stamina is proven as she has already triumphed over 1m4f and that she has had at least two career starts.WORKS FOR

Gene Manifestation Microarray Technology to Acute Myelogenous Leukemia Gene manifestation array technology has been put to a number of uses in order to more fully elucidate AML biology. Broadly, array analysis has been applied to the diagnosis and prognosis of AML; development and understanding of AML therapies; and elucidating the mechanisms of AML pathogenesis (summarized in Table 3). Below, we present case studies of the use of array technology in each of these areas of AML biology. Table 3 Uses of gene expression microarray technology in AML. Array technology in diagnosis and prognosis Gene expression profiling has demonstrated diagnostic utility within the research setting. Expression signatures might have predictive power in classifying leukemias from individual examples. Expression profiling takes a variety (>10 g) INK 128 of INK 128 high-quality RNA. Although it may not replace molecular and cytogenetic tests like a diagnostic technique, it can be a robust device in predicting individual reaction to therapy possibly, although this area hasn’t however been explored thoroughly. Prediction of known AML subclasses can be carried out using gene manifestation profiling, and AML subgroups with prognostically relevant chromosomal abnormalities could be predicted by using this technique (Bullinger and Valk, 2005). The dedication of novel AML subclasses continues to be performed using microarray technology. Bullinger et al. (2004) utilized cDNA microarrays to find out gene manifestation in bloodstream and bone tissue marrow examples from 116 AML individuals, including 45 individuals with regular karyotype AML. This group determined two book subgroups of AML comprising individuals with regular karyotypes with significant variations in survival moments (Bullinger et al. 2004). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed on outcomes from a check group of 59 individuals to secure a group of molecular subgroups with specific gene manifestation signatures, also to develop a supervised learning algorithm. This algorithm was utilized to secure a 133-gene medical outcome predictor that was after that validated on the rest of the 57 individuals to be able to forecast general survival with this group. By using this predictor, overall survival was predicted accurately within the validation group including the subgroup of patients with normal karyotype AML. The gene expression predictor was a strong independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (Bullinger et al. 2004). A second study performed by Valk et al. (2004) determined gene expression profiles within blood or bone marrow of 285 patients with AML. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, sixteen groups of patients with separate molecular signatures were identified. Clustering was driven mainly by chromosomal abnormalities, (i.e. t(8; 21), inv(16), t(15;17), 11q23, C7q), genetic mutations, (i.e. versus MDS-related AML of the M2 subtype, by identifying gene expression signatures INK 128 associated with these two forms of AML (Oshima et al. 2003). Interestingly, expression profiling of APL and its microgranular variant (AML M3 and M3v) demonstrated that there are distinct differences between these two forms of promyelocytic leukemia (Haferlach et al. 2005). Additionally, FLT3-ITD is associated with 147 distinct gene expression changes in APL; differentially expressed genes are associated with pathways involving cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion and migration, coagulation, inflammation, differentiation and myeloid granules (Marasca et al. 2006). The absence or presence of Rabbit polyclonal to TLE4 FLT3 mutations can help determine the prognosis of APL patients. Although some mutations have already been identified, almost all, present in around 25% of sufferers, are inner tandem duplications (ITDs). They are known to result in in-frame insertions inside the juxtamembrane area from the receptor. Various other less regular mutations involve the spot encoding the activation loop, & most frequently influence codons aspartate 835 and isoleucine 836 (D835/I836). These have already been reported in around 8% of sufferers with AML (Gilliland and INK 128 Griffin, 2002; Kottaridis et al. 2003; Small and Levis, 2003; Radich and Stirewalt, 2003). A report of 203 sufferers with PML-RAR-positive APL confirmed that sufferers with FLT3 ITDs or D835/I836 mutations got linked poor prognostic indications. For example sufferers with either FLT3 activation or ITDs loop mutations got higher white bloodstream cell matters at display, frequently 10 109 cells/L or better (Gale et al. 2005). Exactly the same study found that FLT3 ITDs had been correlated with M3v subtype, bcr3 break-point, and appearance of reciprocal transcripts. Sufferers with mutant FLT3 got a higher price of induction loss of life, but no factor in relapse or general success at 5 years. Microarray analysis revealed differences in expression profiles among patients.Date night and we’re headed out to one of our favorite pubs. We eat and have a couple of drinks, casually talking and watching the people around us. There’s a game on the TVs over the bar and a crowd is cheering for the home team.
I unbutton the third button on my blouse, leaning forward just a bit so you can see the merest glimpse of purple lace. Knowing full well that I have you distracted, I start asking random questions, changing the subject midway through a sentence and generally try to get you flustered.
Being hidden in a booth, I unbutton another one, keeping it closed enough that no one but you can see anything. You take a drink and look down and back up at my face. Your expression wavers between apprehension and anticipation.
I order another drink and sit back, still flipping conversations and questions to keep you off balance. By now, you have resigned yourself to the fact that I am just going to tease you all night and decide to play along. You keep an eye on my cleavage while trying to keep up with my verbal games.
Finishing up, I slowly button up one and then the next. You are paying the bill when I get up to go to the restroom. I bend over directly in front of you to grab my purse, making sure you get an eyeful of my ass and wiggle it just a bit.
On the way home, we sing to the radio and chat. I know that in your head you are still seeing that purple lace and my butt. We park the car, head inside and you check your watch. “It’s 8–bathtime,” you say.
I slowly shake my head and kick off my boots one at a time. Next to come off was the blouse, again one button at a time. The jeans get unbuttoned slowly and discarded on the floor. I watch you watching me as I reveal all of the purple lace.
“What’s that saying? Something about ‘If her panties match her bra when you take her clothes off, it wasn’t you who decided to have sex.'” I smirk as I head towards the bedroom.

Isn’t that what you call your Parrot?
And don’t even get me started on no-self. What kind of crazy, new age, wacky thinking is that all about?
What’s that, you say it’s all dharma? You mean like the TV show Dharma & Greg?
I’m sure this Buddhism stuff can seem as foreign as a fly in your nose to most people. And trying to “talk the talk” to those with no exposure or experience in the Buddhist practice can easily get them agitated and put-off when I try to share it with them. I might as well start chanting for them in Pali!
All this has really become a bit of a dilemma for me lately, as I now think so much differently than I used to. My mind is not the same, my perspective on life, or how I handle life and different situations has all changed dramatically because of my practice as a Buddhist. Leaving me to wonder if I need to fake it, and let others remain comfortable in their thinking. Or should I just try my best to say nothing when confronted with questions from someone seeking advice or counsel? Which, when I do that, only leaves the other person thinking that I don’t care or I’m not really listening with genuine compassion. Oh, the conundrum!
Once again I find myself looking at my teacher for the best example. Bhante Sujatha has a magnificent gift of communicating in a way that anyone can understand. Even in his somewhat broken english, others are always left with a feeling of acceptance and understanding. He is totally present, and often says very few words. Never ever telling anyone what to do, or judging what is right or wrong. Yet people always find comfort, and walk away with a bit more clarity and inner peace. He leaves them in a softer and gentler place. But what is his secret?
Not so surprisingly, his secret lies in the teachings. And he has practiced and studied a very long time, and with great determination and diligence. Developing his wisdom, his virtue, and such tremendous mindfulness that is always filled with compassion for others. And if I can find any fault with his character, it is that he often forgets to care for himself first. He is so powerfully driven to bring peace and love to the World that he often puts his own basic needs aside for the benefit of others. His vision, as I perceive it, is that he can help so many people in this lifetime and he does so with gratitude. He sees the love that others have for him as only a source of more love to offer the World.
Does this sound like I am putting him on a pedestal? Well I assure you that I am not. I love him so much, I respect him, and I am so grateful for his presence in my life and the lives of my Family. I’m so very grateful for the wonderful work I get to see him accomplish. Helping people in the community, the rest of the Country, and in other countries as well. I am just so very blessed.
So my work is cut-out for me. To remain determined in my practice, but develop more skill, wisdom and virtue. To be more humble and mindful of my words and more open to hear what others are really saying. To learn that less is more in most cases. Coming to understand, that most people like me, simply want to be heard, loved and accepted. No need to teach the dharma or even offer advice. I only need to be fully present and have an open heart, one without judgement or ego. Just being a genuine human being.
And perhaps that is truly the deeper teaching of the Buddha.
May you be well, happy and peaceful.These budget Soundcore wireless earbuds bring the noise for just $52November 26, 2021
Anker is known for its value-focused wireless earbuds under the Soundcore label, and the Life A2 fit that bill particularly well. These wireless earbuds tick all the right boxes: the 11mm drivers deliver booming sound that’s great for bass-heavy tunes, you get a large control surface on each earbud, and they’re highly customizable.
What makes the Life A2 that much more enticing is that it gets hybrid active noise cancellation; the earbuds do a great job tuning sound in your vicinity by up to 90%. It’s not as powerful as the likes of Sony and Bose, but then again, those earbuds cost three to four times as what you’re paying here.
On that note, the Life A2 earbuds normally cost $66, but they’re on sale now for $52. You’re not saving too much here, but this is the lowest these earbuds have been on sale for, and considering what’s on offer, they are a good value overall.
Soundcore Life A2
Soundcore’s Life A2 wireless earbuds get the basics right. They produce a booming bass-heavy sound, tune out ambient sound, have three mics on each earbud, and last seven hours from a full charge. In short, you’re getting well-designed earbuds that offer great value for what they cost.
They’re astonishingly good for calls as well thanks to the three mics in each earbud. As is the case with most wireless earbuds, they’re tuned to deflect wind noises, so you can make clear calls when you’re outdoors.
And with seven hours of music playback from a full charge, you’ll only need to charge these once a day. The case has enough power for two additional charges, and with fast charging, a 10-minute charge gives you 90 minutes of playback. All things considered, these are among the finest budget earbuds around, and if you’re hunting for the best Black Friday headphone deals, you’ll want to give the Life A2 a look.

RO. Optimization matters.
Even before getting interested in Artificial Intelligence (AI), I have always enjoyed puzzles. French mathematical games (see trophy below left) for 30+ years. Moreover I managed to solve 50+ IBM Ponder This challenges.
In 2019, I met some IBM business partners in Vienna to explain the value of decision optimization.
IBM Planning Analytics / TM1 automates planning, budgeting, and forecasting.
IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio :
Rapid development and deployment of decision optimization models using mathematical and constraint programming.
Cubewise, enjoyed my presentation and even took some pictures during my presentation.
Later on, at their own customer events, it was my turn to take some pictures of them pitching CPLEX on top of PA.
I was very happy with that but that was only the beginning.
In 2020, they made me very happy. They asked me a puzzle (Not solve a puzzle this time, but write the challenge that will make other people crazy, not me!)
And not only for fun : the winner would get a real prize : a trip!
CUBE+WISE=MORE
Use each number between 0 and 9 only once, to replace the letters in the sentence.
The sum must be correct, you must use each number EXACTLY once. With the correct sum, there are many solutions. But which solution has the highest value for the letters R, O and I?
Target: Maximize the value of ROI. There is only 1 correct largest value for ROI. What number (like 123) corresponds to the letters ROI?
One can solve this challenge with a pencil but it takes some time.
Let me take the opportunity to explain how easy it is to solve this puzzle with IBM CPLEX.
Within IBM CPLEX you may rely on OPL and write
using CP;
...
dvar int CUBE;
dvar int WISE;
dvar int MORE;
dvar int ROI;
maximize ROI;
subject to {
CUBE+WISE==MORE;
ROI==100*R+10*O+I;
CUBE == 1000*C+100*U+10*B+1*E;
WISE == 1000*W+100*I+10*S+1*E;
MORE == 1000*M+100*O+10*R+1*E;
// all letters are different
allDifferent(append(C,U,B,E,W,I,S,M,O,R));
}
Which is very easy to read and gives the solution in less than 1 second.
You may do the same with Python.
CUBE=1000*C+100*U+10*B+E
WISE=1000*W+100*I+10*S+E
MORE=1000*M+100*O+10*R+E
ROI=100*R+10*O+I#constraints
mdl.add(CUBE+WISE==MORE)
mdl.add(mdl.all_diff(C,U,B,E,W,I,S,M,O,R))#objective
mdl.maximize(ROI)#solve
msol=mdl.solve()
You may also use a more generic model:
string maxobjective="ROI";
string equation="CUBE+WISE==MORE";
that will build the OPL model and solve this.
I used Constraint Programming solver within CPLEX. But Mathematical Programming works too both in OPL and Python.
Enumeration in OPL, Python or Javascript work fine too for this tiny challenge. For real business problems that could take years or even much more time. This approach cannot scale.
Thanks again Cubewise and congrats Cansu Agrali for winning this contest.
Let me quote Cubewise as why complete enumeration is not enough in real life:
Decision Optimization
“Considering we have a solid plan in place and we have an accurate vision of the future, there is only one thing left to do: execute it ! The reality is that we need to execute this plan in an environment that is full of constraints, conflicting targets, and thousands of options to consider. Decision Optimization focuses on what route is best to follow within the constraints we have, given the targets we set in a specific priority.
Today, CPLEX is the best performing solution to tackle these mathematical algorithm challenges. As a bonus, it integrates perfectly with TM1.”
No Optimization within AI is as bad as using only your reptile brain instead of your primate brain. Not wise when you want to get our of a maze.

I’m introducing them in the run up to the So Many Beauties performance so here is Jisun. Jisun has an incredibly beautiful quality of sound on her violin and creates soaring melodies as well as delicate ebbs and flows that uplift the listener! She and Ellis, our postgraduate violinist, complemented each other so well – weaving improvised melodies and textures together, echoing what the participants with dementia were playing or singing. Jisun was very sweet with the participants and is a great improviser who works well in a group.
Here’s what she has to tell us;
I’m currently a third year student studying violin with Yossi Zivoni at the Royal Northern College of Music. Originally Born in Seoul, South Korea, I moved to England with my family since age of 13 and lived in Birmingham since then before coming to Manchester for university. A passionate and orchestra music lover, I play and very much enjoy working in group ensembles and orchestras, and have been a member of many orchestras such as the RNCM Symphony, Chamber Orchestras, Manchester University Music Society Symphony, Chamber Orchestras, City of Birmingham Symphony Youth Orchestra, Orfeo International Music festival Symphony Orchestra, Young Musician’s Symphony Orchestra London and etc. I’m currently the leader of Liverpool Philharmonic Youth Orchestra 2016-2017.
Outside school work and many ensemble playing, I’m also a keen musician who very much believes and hopes my music can be used at many outreach places and voluntary occasions to play and share my music with those who are in need and deliver them hope, love and joy through the power of music- This is the reason why having been given the opportunity to meet and work along side with our Genius Kora player Holly has been such a privilege. What Holly does for people at the NHS hospitals, care homes and for the elderly people in Dementia in special, watching and playing along side with Holly truly has been a privilege experience and life changing experience to having been able to see small miracles and happy smiles she can bring to these people in need.
In the future I hope to become a secondary/primary music teacher and my long term goal is to become an orchestra player. I’m very fortunate to be able to participate and play at this wonderful So Many Beauties concert and to play all the music written and composed and premiered by Holly and the participants with dementia.Sunnybank QLD
I would have to say this is now one of my favourite restaurants for Malaysian I've been to so far in Australia and pretty much on par if not better than my Sydney favourite of Alice's in Thornleigh. The beauty I find with Little Singapore is that they seem to be good at all the classic dishes, while other places tend to be great at some and not so good on others. Everything I tried here was good and would happily have again.
The service was fast, the portions generous and the prices very reasonable. If they had one of these in Sydney it would be the busiest in town but so good to have around. I'm definitely visiting again next time I'm up in Brisbane.

oooh, yum-oh! This looks like the real thing!! I was desperate for Nasi Lemak after returning from Kota Barhu in the north-east of Malaysia and sadly Mamak in Sydney's Chinatown just didn't cut it, despite the write-up in the Herald.
So I guess I have to go to Queensland, eh?...
Hi Kyle, you'll be happy to know that Little Singapore told me they intend to open a shop in Sydney somewhere. If they do they'll put Mamak to shame plus I predict many other Malaysian eateries. But in the meantime it's worth heading up to QLD to sample.
oh my! If Little Singapore do come to sydney, I hope you'll be doing a blog review! - keep ME posted - I'll be there for sure!!
Hi Kyle, We visit Little Singapore Sunnybank quiet reguarly and each visit is the BEST. The food and service is always great. You should definately visit Brissie and eat at Little Singapore Sunnybank or City.
Simon, you can't write up good Malaysian restaurants that aren't in Sydney - not fair!!!!Ready to book an appointment for a Liquid Nose Job at 7Q Spa?

“All incoming and outgoing flights from Khartoum Airport have been suspended until October 30 due to the situation in the country,” said Civil Aviation Authority Director General Ibrahim Adlan.
Following a military coup on Monday, armed forces detained the civilian leaders who have been heading the transition to full civilian rule following the April 2019 overthrow of autocrat Omar al-Bashir.
Detained leaders include Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres demanding his release on Tuesday.
The coup raised fears for the fate of Hamdok, but Sudan’s top general Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said the premier was “at my home… in good health” and would be able to return to his own home “when the crisis is over”.
“Yes, we arrested ministers and politicians, but not all” of, Burhan said at a news conference.
His comments suggested Hamdok was not among those arrested and detained but, shortly after, the Information Ministry, which remains loyal to the prime minister, relayed a statement from his office demanding his immediate release.

Especially in Asia, where there is an urgent need to raise awareness of the disease and to support people cannot afford to get the right treatment. For 10 years now, EMPOWERED – The Cancer Advocacy Society of Malaysia, has acted on these critical issues, helping and enlightening communities who are suffering from the lack of information and hope. In this interview with Wallance Cheong, project executive at EMPOWERED, a new member of our Horyou platform, shares the values and missions of this organization with our community.
When was Empowered founded?
EMPOWERED was officially registered with the Registrar of Societies Malaysia in 2008 and is governed by an Executive Committee Board consisting of elected volunteers. It was founded by Dr. Christina Ng, a Consultant Medical Oncologist and our program started from year 2009 onwards. The organization is an ally of the poor who are afflicted with cancer. EMPOWERED is committed to helping them to cope with cancer and life through the society’s many structured and personalized programs, and we bring these programs right into their homes. Our mission is to save lives, to prevent cancer and eliminate suffering amongst the poor.
Your organization raises awareness of a condition that is considered taboo by many. How do you set the tone to discuss it with the general public?
The cancer awareness level, particularly in Asia, remains a challenge and some may perceive cancer as a taboo to be discussed. All the myths and misunderstandings about cancer are generally due to the lack of the right education and knowledge. Thus, we constantly raise public awareness and advocacy through our tailored campaigns and projects, educational exhibitions and talks, workshops etc. Furthermore, in accordance with society’s vision and mission, we actually bring these programs and supports right into the underprivileged communities home. We enable our EMPOWERED professionals to touch the hearts of the public.
Do you have any plans and projects for 2018 that you would like to share?
We will carry out our annual signature campaign – Colorectal Cancer Awareness, Screening and Treatment Project (CCASTP) 2018. However, unlike previous practice, we would like to heighten public awareness level of cancer issues by organizing a Charity Run. The run is planned to be carried out in November, in conjunction with EMPOWERED’s 10th Anniversary and the Lung Cancer Month, and we are expecting about 2,000 people to join us.
You are a new organization in our Community. Tell us about your expectations and projects for Horyou.
We understand Horyou is an esteemed, established platform and action-oriented social network for the social good; EMPOWERED is honoured to join as a member of this big family. As time goes by, we expect to reach a wider public, raise public awareness and advocacy of cancer and generate funding and support for the sustainability of EMPOWERED’s projects with the aid of Horyou.2021-2022 Graduate Bulletin > Colleges and Departments > Interdepartmental and Interdisciplinary Programs > Administration (Core), M.S.A.

Damn you Bustracker app with your incredibly helpful and timesaving ways… now I have no time to sketch my local bus stop… 😉 @on_lothianbuses
Still I like the free flowing doodle style that these 10 secoond sketches can achieve – I hope you do too.
From my bus journey to work yesterday morning this sketch shows just how crowded the bus was and how rainy and damp it was outside. The windows are all steamed up with condensation so I have to wipe a space clear to see just how rainy and damp it really is out there.
It was a bit windy today, and still is by the looks of it so I left the two wheeler under the stairs and headed to work via the number 8 bus. One thing the bus gives you is sketch time. I sat right at the front and concentrated on the corner looking out of the window.
Time flies when your wanting just a few more minutes, and before I knew it we’d turned past The Balmoral and onto the North Bridge. Time to ring the bell.
Congratulations to Hearts for lifting the Scottish Cup at the weekend, and commiserations to Hibernian who were runners up in the all Edinburgh final at Hampden. Although I missed the celebratory bus tour through Edinburgh on Sunday I thought I should mark the achievement by one of our teams with a sketch. I found a great picture on flickr taken by Stuart Montgomery, HERE is the original photograph.
With my bike still in need of repair I travelled to work on the @on_lothian number 8 bus this morning. I hope to take the bike into Bicycle Works this weekend, thanks @cocteautriplets for the recommendation.
With journey time on my hands I was looking round for something to sketch, and decided upon a couple of tickets I found in my pocket. By the time I looked up again the bus was just reaching the top of Broughton Street. Sketch done.
Enjoy your Friday everyone. 🙂SV OG-Zuchtschau OG-Zucht- und Nachwuchsschau (LG 04) - JKLR

Abstrakti
The thermal and rheological properties of spray-dried, ethanol-precipitated, purified, and deacetylated spruce galactoglucomannans (GGM) were investigated by rheological measurements and differential scanning calorimetry. The shear rate dependence of viscosity and the effects of the drying method, temperature, ionic strength, and deacetylation on rheological properties were studied. GGM solutions exhibited a shear thinning behaviour. GGM solutions did not obey the Cox-Merz rule. The storage modulus of GGM solutions increased with an increase in concentration; gradually until a concentration of 5%, but rapidly at higher concentrations. Ethanol-precipitated GGM solutions showed a more elastic behaviour than spray-dried GGM solutions. Deacetylation caused an increase in apparent viscosity and more significantly in storage modulus. The storage modulus increased slightly with a decrease in temperature. A small amount addition of NaCl slightly changed the oscillatory behaviour. The effects of above factors were discussed in terms of molecular interactions. The rheological measurements of GGM solutions provide the basis of functionalities of GGM solutions.Targeting MC1R in metastatic melanoma
published in the journal Science Translational Medicine color,.D.,.
"Approximately 60 percent of patients with metastatic melanoma develop brain metastases during the course of their disease. Patients with brain metastases have much shorter life expectancies than patients without brain metastases. Our study shows that the MC1R continues to mark melanoma cells even after these cells metastasize from the site of origin to brain, and this peptide can bind to MC1Rs in melanoma brain metastases. One potential application for this technology is to use our imaging systems to identify MC1R-postive melanoma tumors and then treat these lesions with therapies delivered by this peptide," Miao says.
For now, the current study demonstrates the first-in-human ability to image melanoma metastases using the group's radiolabeled peptide. With more funding and collaboration, the Miao group hopes to explore the therapeutic potential in the near future.Description

The first post discussed highlights of the CoC program Registration, and the second provided resources for tiering and ranking projects..
Here are five tips for writing a great rapid re-housing RFP:
1. Think about what your community needs. Take a look at the gaps in your homelessness system, and determine where you can have the most impact. For example, if single adults make up the majority of your homeless population, but the vast majority of your resources are for homeless families, you should target this money towards rapid re-housing for single adults.
2. Create an RFP and application that aligns with the Core Components. The Core Components of Rapid Re-Housing were developed in collaboration with, and endorsed by, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and HUD. A program must have all three core components to be considered a rapid re-housing program, but that doesn’t mean that one organization has to provide all three. For example, your Public Housing Authority might administer the financial assistance while a nonprofit service provider provides the housing identification and case management services. However your program is structured, you must ensure that all three core components are in place.
3. Align with best practices. The Core Components create a minimum standard for an effective rapid re-housing program, but you can further improve your program take by implementing some of the best practices included in this paper (starting on page 4). Ask how applicants will market to landlord and retain them; how they will provide the least amount of financial assistance necessary to serve the most people; and how their case management will be strengths-based, client-driven, and voluntary.
4. Ask what will be different. If your applicants have never provided rapid re-housing before, they should describe how this will be different from what they are already doing, especially if they have been operating a transitional housing program or a shelter.
Ask for sample job descriptions, eligibility criteria, and policies and procedures that will be used to operate the program. Too often, rapid re-housing case manager job descriptions look exactly like traditional shelter or transitional housing job descriptions. Rapid re-housing case management should look really different: it takes place in a client’s home; it is voluntary, primarily focused on obtaining and sustaining housing and, because it is short-term, connects clients to other community resources that will help them keep their housing.
The program staff should also include a housing specialist or locator. Rapid re-housing does not work without having a pool of readily available landlords, so having a person whose entire job it is to recruit and retain landlords is really important. Here is an example Housing Specialist job description. Also, ask applicants how they structure their financial assistance. Financial assistance should be individualized, flexible, and use a progressive engagement model of assistance.
5. Ask for outcomes. If your applicant is new to rapid re-housing, but they have operated other kinds of programs, you should evaluate them based on past performance. Some key ones you should look for:
- Do they incorporate a Housing First approach?
- How many people are exiting to permanent housing?
- Do they have past monitoring findings and have they been resolved?
- Does their program align with CoC priorities?
If they have operated a rapid re-housing program in the past, you should evaluate them based on recent outcomes including:
- How long does it take to rapidly re-house someone in their program from program entry to housing?
- How long do people stay before exiting the program to permanent housing?
- At what rate to people become homeless again after exiting to permanent housing?
Stay tuned to the Alliance blog once the NOFA is released for more resources and tips. If you have any questions or ideas you want to share, comment below or email me at ablasco@naeh.org.Categories

The phase of feeding your baby formulas might be rocky, and you’ll need to exercise patience. It’s no news that there are specially-produced formulas – and they help with various issues in babies. Enfamil Nutramigen is one of those formulas, and it helps with health issues like cow’s milk allergy, insomnia, excessive crying, diarrhea, etc., in babies.
Research and experience have shown that Nutramigen’s taste is weird, and babies tend to reject it at first introduction. Although the formula is effective and hypoallergenic, its smell is a drawback. But since the formula is most times recommended, mothers have no choice but to get it despite the not-good smell.
Common questions about Mixing Nutramigen
Can you mix two different formulas?
Yes, you can mix two types of formula together especially if they are the same brand of formula and they have the same basic ingredients. However, you must ensure you follow the standard mixing instructions. Mixing two different formulas is also good if you are transitioning from one formula to the other. All you need do is to gradually increase the formula you are transiting to and reduce the former one.
Listed below are some questions that bug first-time moms. We have taken the time to answer them all.
- Can you mix Nutramigen with breast milk?
- Can you mix Nutramigen with whole milk?
- Can you mix Nutramigen with Cow’s milk?
- Can you mix Nutramigen and Alimentum?
- Can you mix Nutramigen and Enfamil A.R?
- Can you mix Nutramigen and Similac Sensitive?
- Can you mix Nutramigen with soy formula?
All you need to know about mixing Enfamil Nutramigen
Mixing Nutramigen is one way to make babies take to the formula easily. Many mothers use some things to complement Nutramigen so that their babies will eat it, and it’ll eliminate the common health issues. However, you must be careful with the stuff you mix with Nutramigen- so that it’ll be effective.
Can you mix Nutramigen with breast milk?
Breast milk is known to contain several nutrients that will aid your baby’s growth and development. But on the introduction of Enfamil Nutramigen, you might wonder if you can mix Nutramigen with breast milk. Well, it’s not a bad idea to mix breast milk with Nutramigen; in fact, it’s one of the best ways to allow your baby to take the formula easily.
You can mix the formula and the milk in equal proportions and reduce the breast milk’s amount as time pass. Gradually, your baby will adapt to Nutramigen’s taste and take it without the milk.
Can you mix Nutramigen with whole milk?
Whole milk is usually introduced to babies that are a year and above. That’s because babies need to develop well before they can digest the whole milk’s ingredient. However, is it permissible to mix Nutramigen with whole milk? Yes, you can. Many mothers do it, either to mask the formula’s weird taste or to wean your baby off the formula.
Moreover, whole milk contains fats that can aid rapid growth and development in babies. You can mix whole milk with the formula if your baby is almost 12 months old and you feel like fully introducing whole milk to her diet. However, it would help if you tried not to mix Nutramigen’s powdered form with the milk in place of water.
Can you mix Nutramigen with Cow’s milk?
Cow’s milk? That’s debatable. One of the issues Enfamil Nutramigen eliminates is cow’s milk allergy. Babies with cow’s milk allergy are advised to take Nutramigen because it doesn’t contain the milk. Hence, mixing cow’s milk with Nutramigen might not be a good idea for babies with cow’s milk allergies.
So, you should know the reason why Nutramigen is recommended for your baby. Besides, you can mix the formula with cow’s milk in equal amounts if your baby isn’t allergic to the milk.
Can you mix Nutramigen and Alimentum?
Similac Alimentum is like the equivalent of Nutramigen, though Enfamil produced the latter. Both of the formulas are made from similar ingredients because they perform similar functions. Nutramigen and Alimentum help eliminate colic, diarrhea, cow’s milk allergy, insomnia etc., within 24/48 hours of introduction.
Furthermore, both of them are hypoallergenic and contain essential nutrients for rapid growth. However, mixing Alimentum and Enfamil might not be the most excellent idea because of their effects on babies. Hence, if, by chance, you want to combine both, run the idea through your pediatrician for advice.
Can you mix Nutramigen and Enfamil A.R?
Studies have shown that you can mix Enfamil Nutramigen and A.R if your baby isn’t used to the former’s taste. Although it’s vital, you combine both formulas with the correct amount of water, no more, no less. You can also take nighttime feeding into consideration and premix a couple of bottles. However, you should note that it’s the powdered form you’ll premix. Premixing the formula will prevent you from spilling the formula while half-asleep.
Can you mix Nutramigen and Similac Sensitive?
Similac Sensitive is a milk-based formula given chiefly to babies without cow’s milk allergy, while Nutramigen is administered because of milk allergy, colic, insomnia etc. However, it’s understandable when you’ve got the leftover formula, and you want to mix it with Nutramigen, but it’s not the best idea.
Mixing Similac Sensitive with Nutramigen can hinder the latter from eliminating your baby’s symptoms. Imagine your baby being fed Nutramigen because he’s allergic to cow’s milk; mixing the Formula with Sensitive can increase your baby’s allergy, and Nutramigen might not work.
Can you mix Nutramigen with soy formula?
Soy formulas are formulas specially-produced for babies with lactose intolerance. The formula contains soy in place of cow’s milk in regular formulas. However, can you mix soy formula with Nutramigen? It’s relatively possible to mix both. That’s because Nutramigen is also recommended for babies with lactose intolerance.
After all, it doesn’t contain lactose. Thus, you can combine both. Although Nutramigen doesn’t contain soy and the introduction of soy formula to your baby’s food might bring about some allergies.
Hence, if you wish to mix Nutramigen with soy formula, make sure your baby isn’t allergic to soy, and it’s advisable to check with your pediatrician to prevent unnecessary breakouts.
In essence, you can mix Nutramigen with another formula as long as you take precautions and ask your pediatrician the way to go.
Can you make Nutramigen up in advance?
It is not advisable to make Nutramigen up in advance, because you may have to warm it up for the baby to drink. It is not advisable to warm the Nutramigen formula beyond room temperature (75°F) as it will render the benefits from probiotics useful. Also, you can’t use the microwave to warm the formula because it can cause hot spots that can burn your baby’s mouth. So what can you do?
The best and safest way to do this is to wash and sterilize your baby’s bottles, then fill them with the hot water you need. Put the lids on them and put them in a safe place. Whenever your baby wants to eat, take a bottle and warm it up for 30 seconds, then quickly add the formula powder to it and mix. This ensures that your baby gets a fresh feed whenever they want to eat and at the right temperature too.
Does nutramigen taste bad?
Nutramigen has a bitter and sour taste. This explains why most babies hate the taste of Nutramigen. But you can make it taste better.
How to make Nutramigen taste better
Most baby hates the taste of Nutramigen because it doesn’t taste good, but it is their food anyway and you have to find a way to make it taste better if they are refusing it. One thing you can do is to add organic vanilla extract, organic grade B Maple syrup, or organic carrot juice to help make Nutramigen taste better. Here is a post that contains different kinds of organic sweeteners for baby formula – how to make baby formula taste better.
Why does Nutramigen smell so bad?
Not only does Nutramigen taste bad, but it also smells bad. It makes the baby’s poop and burp smells bad too. But who cares? It works for babies, and that should be the only motivation to use it. The reason why Nutramigen smell so bad is because of the special formulation that makes it work for your baby.
Does nutramigen contain soy?
Nutramigen is a hypoallergenic formula made with iron. It is not soy-based but it has added soy like other formulas. So it is free for babies that have soy allergies to use.
Conclusion
Enfamil Nutramigen is a unique formula produced mainly to eliminate health issues like acid reflux, colic, insomnia, excessive diarrhea, etc., in babies. Quite a lot of pediatricians recommend it, and many parents use it too. However, introducing Nutramigen into your baby’s diet might be difficult, especially if your baby takes longer to adapt.
So, it’s necessary to ease your baby into the formula gradually, and you can do that by mixing the formula with other food like breast milk, whole milk, and so on. The above article already highlighted what you should know about mixing Enfamil Nutramigen. You should adhere to and implement the tips.Send Your Child to Camp 2011

Describing the experience as “awesome,” the group of students from Para Hills and Parafield Gardens high schools and the Bedford Park Australian Science and Math School visited Flinders late last year as part of the SHE Leads High pilot program run by the YWCA.
YWCA Adelaide project officer Claire Tatyzo says the program is a leadership development program for young women in years 10, 11 and 12 at high school, designed to inspire pathways for future success.
“It is an opportunity for young women in high school to develop skills, confidence and build their leadership capacity in every aspect of their lives,” Ms Tatyzo says.
Flinders student ambassadors Jacinta Koolmatrie and Joyce Haddad, pictured, shared some of her uni experiences with the visitors.
The visits were coordinated by the Student Access Unit at Flinders University which is involved in a range of young adult and community engagement programs.
YWCA Adelaide’s SHE Leads High program is expanding to other outer metropolitan and country high schools in 2016.

If you’re a betting person: Lynx the preseason favorite in the West
The Western Conference has been the power center of the WNBA for the past five years. The place where the superstars compete for and win championships.
But it is also now the place where some of the league’s best young talents are poised to make their breakouts: Nneka Ogwumike in Los Angeles, Kayla McBride in San Antonio, Skylar Diggins and Odyssey Sims in Tulsa and, of course, the Seattle rookie combination of Jewell Loyd and Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis.

Stuffed tomatoes are another in the delicious line of traditional Greek stuffed vegetables, or gemistes. This recipe also features.
Try to find large meaty tomatoes all of similar size and shape. This will help to ensure even cooking and lends to a lovely looking platter on your table! Slice even lids approx the same size for all your tomatoes and use a thin edged spoon to scoop out tomato insides. Remember to reserve a cup of the insides to mash and add to the filling.
similar sized and shaped large tomatoes ready for stuffing
And take the time to find currants and pine nuts. Pine nuts are available most of the year in large groceries but currants may require a little more searching. I stock up when I find them in my local market and keep them sealed in a freezer bag. Dried currants last for up to a year or longer this way and freezing is a simple way to keep them on hand year round.
sweet dried currants and pine nuts
The crunch of the nuts and sweetness of the currants turn this dish from side to main course. The textures and flavors are such a fantastic combination of authentic Greek cooking, stuffed tomatoes really are an exceptional representation of authentic Greek food.
MAKE AHEAD
You can make filling ahead up to 5 days, covered, in the refrigerator. Remember to bring filling to room temperature before filling.
Just FYI – this filling is also absolutely amazing all on its own 🙂
make filling ahead up to five days approx.
*a 9” round cake pan works well for eight large tomatoes.
ALL of your recipes look amazing… Next week is going to be greek vegan week in our house, can’t wait to try these and many other delicious recipes you have posted. Thanks so much for sharing and please keep posting 🙂 x
I have an allergy to pine nuts, any other suggestions?
hmmmmmm…. I do remember having this with pistachios that were chopped into pretty small pieces and they were quite nice. Not sure how you would adjust for salt as pistachios are sometimes hard to find unsalted. And, of course, slivered almonds are often added to rice pilaf so think those would work well too. Think I’m leaning towards the almonds myself 🙂 let me know which you try and how you liked them! Kiki
Do you think this could be made using cherry tomatoes – as hoes d’oeuvres? And if so, what might the baking time be?
Oh I love that idea Susan! Well, I’d probably start at 10-15 minutes. You need to check for the skin to become slightly wrinkled and that the tops especially are pretty crinkled looking. The tomato meat should be soft enough that it is easily pierced with a fork. Test at 10-15 minutes, then every 5 minutes after that. Even if they become just slightly blackened on top, that’s still fine and pretty tasty – I like to char my stuffed peppers that way. Please do let me know how they turn out! Kiki 🙂
This is a bit delayed but cherry tomatoes are so small. Maybe try the Campari (??) tomatoes which are bigger than cherry but usually smaller than regular tomatoes.
My mom used to use golden raisins instead of currants. O do not believe you can achieve the wonderful taste of stuffed tomatoes when using cherry tomatoes. There are a lot of ingredients going into them (larger tomatoes) to imitate the real taste.
This sounds delicious and I will be making them this week, but I’m concerned about the mint. Does the dish end up tasting minty or does it just integrate into the rest of the flavors? 🙂
the mint is wonderful, it brightens everything up a notch 🙂
Your recipe was easy to follow and the Yemista were delicious. I added some potatoes to the pan as an accompaniment. Thanks for sharing.
Is there another way to stuff these with out the dried fruit and nuts or meat?
you can just leave them out if you prefer – still delicious 🙂
I made this last night and it was so good. So good. So good. So glad I had left overs. I found the filling tasty, but just okay before I filled the tomatoes – thought it needed some lemon squeezed over to eat on its own. But the finished dish once stuffed in the tomatoes and baked was absolutely beautiful. Reduced the amount of oil to about 1/4 cup just because, and only had time to bake for about 1 hour, but followed the recipe otherwise – oh, and my rice needed about 25 minutes to cook and absorb the liquid – I imagine it depends on the type of rice you use…
Thanks so much for this recipe – it will now be part of my regular dinners and lunches. I ate it with a little sauce made of tahini, water, lemon and garlic for dinner, and leftovers with a bit of feta cheese on the side for lunch.
Yum yum yum yum yum.
They sound amazing, but I’m always confused with the baking part. Do you cover the baking dish or bake them in an uncovered pan?
no, do not cover the pan. cover each tomato with it’s tomato cap 🙂
I’m coming to this party a bit late but thought I would make a comment anyway. After living in Athens three years I fell in love with Greece and, of course, the food. I often makes stuffed tomatoes (or peppers, or even those wonderful little globe squash). I’m a lazy cook so I don’t sauté anything in advance. I just finely chop onion, carrots, any other veggies I have in the fridge. I also add the tomato pulp, lots of oregano or dill and rosemary (a little turmeric for extra health kick) And good EVOO! Add tofu or cashew cheese and salt & pepper. Mix together. I place the tomatoes in a pan – then cube carrots and potatoes and fill the pan around the tomatoes to hold them in place as well as add additional veggies. Drizzle all with EVOO. Yum! Κάλι όρεξη
I’m making these tonight, and eating the leftover stuffing while I wait! Yum yum yum. This will be a great recipe to take to a potluck!Abstract
From September to November in 1995 a total of 49 mature sea trout were caught and radio tagged in the estuary (Randers fjord) or at the river mouth of the River Gudena in Eastern Jutland. The tagged trout were between 2 and 6 yr old with total body length of 56-85 cm. Twenty-five of the tagged trout ascended the river. They were tracked every third day, for up to six months, until death or descent. Great variation was found in migration pattern and duration of river residence. Some fish spawned and left the river, some died after spawning, while others died unspent. The sea trout preferred to stay on the southern side of the main river, and Males spent significantly more time of the freshwater stay in spawning tributaries than females. Most of the trout ascended the main spawning tributary, the River Lillea, where none passed a weir, 2 km upstream the confluence, despite the presence of a fish ladderDorothy Rosby

Listening to the radio one day, I heard the editor of a cooking magazine say that 4 p.m. is the “proper” time, indeed, the only time to serve Thanksgiving dinner. If your turkey is done any earlier you should toss it in the trash and start over. No, he didn’t say that.
He did say that it’s only logical to serve Thanksgiving dinner later in the day because, “It’s dinner after all.” Fair enough, except 4 seems a little early for dinner, especially for a stuffed shirt like him.
I’m sure he’d be appalled that I grew up eating Thanksgiving dinner at lunchtime. My mother might have preferred 4. It takes a long time to cook a turkey big enough to serve a family of 12. I think she put ours in the oven around Halloween.
I’m exaggerating. But I do recall her rising practically in the middle of the night to put a turkey the size of a yearling heifer into the oven. I don’t need a bird that big, so I continue to serve our Thanksgiving meal at noon or when the little pop-up thingy in the turkey pops up, whichever comes first. And my guests have never complained—at least not about the time we ate.
I was curious about when other people serve their Thanksgiving meal, so I went to that fount of all knowledge, the internet, and discovered there are more than 200,000,000 results on the question. I didn’t read them all because there isn’t time before Thanksgiving. But I did find a survey that claims more Americans serve their turkey between 4 and 5 than any other time, with those who serve it between 3 and 4 coming in a close second.
Big deal. I’m sticking with my routine. I’m a rebel and a nonconformist and I like it that way. Besides, I have some very good reasons for serving my Thanksgiving feast at noon. For one thing, I have to eat every five or six hours if the people I love are going to continue loving me back.
So whether I serve my turkey at noon or not, I will need a meal at noon, and if I’m going to have a noon meal, it may as well include a turkey. I’m going to have to cook the darned thing anyway.
This means that by the time Stuffed Shirt is eating his “dinner,” I’m enjoying a second piece of pie. And when he’s doing his dishes, I’m having leftover turkey for supper. It’s so much more efficient my way.
Besides, for most people, there are basic components of Thanksgiving Day. If you leave any of them out, all you have is a Thursday with extra calories. For some, it’s not Thanksgiving unless there’s a turkey and stuffing. For others it’s football or the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. For me, it isn’t Thanksgiving unless there’s an afternoon nap.
As the cook, I could never nap before dinner—not with preparations to be made and the smell of a roasting turkey filling the house. If I don’t eat until 4, I’m not going to be able to fit my nap in until almost bedtime.
Most importantly though, eating at 4 would interfere with my all-important turkey noodle soup ritual, and I won’t do that. If it weren’t for the promise of turkey noodle soup, I’d serve prime rib on Thanksgiving.
Immediately after Thanksgiving dinner/lunch, I put the turkey carcass and other magical ingredients into my stockpot. Then I let it simmer the rest of the day in preparation for National Turkey Noodle Soup Day, which is celebrated every year on the Friday after Thanksgiving—at least by me. Along with soup, the traditional Turkey Noodle Soup Day meal includes leftover pie and other desserts. And by the way, it’s best served at noon.

Americans can’t even agree on turkey time
Dorothy RosbyDuring a Pandemic, it seemed like a great time to go on another Road Trip. Well, not really. Having planned this over 6 months ago, I decided to go forward with my plans in the hope that the virus would start to wind down and that I could again experience freedom outside the realm of Florida. I love my Parks, I love my sunny weather, but I hate the hot summers and honestly between that and the call of cooler temps and grass I could actually squish my toes into, it was a no brainer to go. With mask in hand, and hand sanitizer always on standby, I headed to Woodstock, IL to walk a movie set.
For those who don’t know, the infamous “Groundhog Day” ritual is held every February in the town of Punxsutawney, PA. They pull the famous critter out of his hidey hole for everyone to see and he magically tells the council if there will be 6 more weeks of Winter or not. I was blessed to be able to see the real town, the real “Gobbler’s Knob,” and yes stand on the actual stage where they have the fun event on my last road trip in 2018. BUT what MANY people do not know is that the movie was not filmed there at all, but in another city called Woodstock in the great State of IL. The town, the Park, and that beautiful Bed and Breakfast in the Movie were all filmed there. So when making my plans for this summer, I wanted to really find the areas and spots of the Midwest that would be fun, exciting, and just all together interesting for the soul.
Thankfully it wasn’t hard to find, I was met with such excitement as I parked in the FREE lot. I had shown up on a Saturday and they were having their Farmers Market as well. It couldn’t get any better, a Farmers Market AT Gobbler’s Knob??!!?? Walking up, there it was. The Pennsylvania Hotel in the Movie where Rita was staying, she’s dropped off at it during the very early part of the film. What is fascinating about this is that its actually a very old Opera House in the Town who has housed many stars like Mickey Rooney and Orson Wells (who by the way is FROM Woodstock!). It’s a beautiful red brick building and it’s near the edge of the town, so it was the first thing I saw. And then, the Park, aka Gobblers Knob, I was freaking out at the sight of it! It is the center of Town, so it couldn’t be more of a postcard image with it’s streets lined with trees and brick paved roads. All I could see in my head were the crowds listening to the “Pennsylvania Polka” as Phil and the crew were getting ready to watch the groundhog make his appearance. The gazebo were Phil and Rita slow danced to was located in the center, and then there is an iron gateway on all four sides welcoming you to the Park. Seriously, I could’ve sat there all day and people watched.
I got down to it and pulled up a virtual walking tour guide () which took me to each spot around the town on what was filmed where. It helped SO MUCH because I hadn’t watched the movie in awhile, as I should have and recommend for anyone going on this quest, as it is a heck of a lot easier to find things when you have it fresh in your mind. I headed down to 209 Main Street to the Movie Theater, known as the Alpine Theater and is home to the Harold Ramis Auditorium. Although thanks to Covid, it wasn’t open, but it was still neat to look through the windows at the old Theater. Right on the other side of it is the ally which has a gigantic mural of Groundhog Day, along with the Opera House fame, and the character Dick Tracy, whose animator drew him and lived in Woodstock for 46 years. Excellent photo opps here! Also towards the back of the ally are two statues, one of the famous local Orson Welles and the other of the Groundhog.
I headed down to the bottom of Main Street where the railroad tracks start to cross and across the street at 109 Church Street, is the Bowling Lanes used in the film. They have their pic on a banner located outside of it, it was a thrill to see. From there I headed up Madison Street to find the corner of Judd Street, this area was where Phil Connors was trying to help the homeless man over and over again in the ally-that part always broke my heart. Not a fun day when that day is someone passing over and over again. After that little tinge on the heart, I was in search of Cass Street and the infamous “Ned Ryerson” our favorite Insurance Salesman who is just too annoyingly awesome and sweet for his own good- BING!! I have to tell you, I love a Town that acknowledges their claim to fame on plaques. First off, we all have gotten lazy on looking up things, and second, it was nice to have a selfie with these spots and know you were standing on film history. More towns, cities, etc.. need to do this. So I round the corner and there is the plaque “Ned’s Corner” and I freak out!! Yes, it’s the little things in life. The puddle also that he continually falls into is on the same Cass Street- at least it is in the movie.
Now if you head up Cass Street you run into the Courthouse and Jail at the top of this Town Square, located on Van Buren St, just adjacent to the Opera House. I am a sucker for the old buildings and architecture, did get to go inside but most of it was roped off for Covid. The Public House located next door to it is now a Restaurant, and is the spot where they filmed all of Bill Murray’s bar scenes. They weren’t allowing anyone to eat indoors in IL at the time of my visit, so I wasn’t able to sneak a peak. But hey, still I got to see where he filmed it.
Down the way from this on the same street is the location of the “Tip Top Café” which is now a bunch of businesses combined. Here is where he famously sat with Rita and listened and recorded all of the details about her, along with the infamous breakfast where he didn’t care what he ate and how much he ate because, hey, there were no consequences for a day on endless repeat.
I walked around Gobblers Knob for a bit, walked inside the gazebo where Rita and Phil slow danced while it snowed, and among the spots where they built the snow man and he made the ice sculpture. It was pure magic.
But there was one more stop that was the pinnacle of my adventure….the icing on the cake, if not the cherry. And that was the Bed and Breakfast on Cherry Tree Lane in which he woke up at….over and over again. On the way, up the infamous street seen on the movie over and over again, you can find the piano teachers home at 348 South Madison. There is a plaque on the house, but it’s a private residence so I just grabbed a pic and left.
I walked down Madison to Fremont Street, the Bed and Breakfast (Cherry Tree Inn) coming into view like a red carpet to a Broadway Premiere. It was beautiful, and I was in awe of how I was standing on movie history. I just started to take pictures when a woman approached me and asked if I would like my pic taken, I said oh no worries, and she then said “I own this.” The smile that was already on my face grew ten times bigger as I asked question after question about the movie and her beautiful home. And then she offered a free tour, and my heart raced with glee! For the next hour I was shown the first and second floor, the view down the road, where the movie cameras were set up, the famous area where he walked into for breakfast every day, the front door he touched, the old newspaper article about the house on the wall, and memorabilia from the movie- including the clock, the Cherry St sign, and the coffee carafe from the Café. Honestly I couldn’t believe my luck. I was not only getting a tour, but a FREE tour, and it felt like an exclusive, behind the scenes one at that! Did you know this is a real, active B&B? Yes!! You too can stay at the movie magic- beautiful rooms, fresh homemade breakfast made for guests, Wifi and Cable in all of the rooms, also a copy of the movie to watch while you stay there, huge common rooms to enjoy with other guests or your family, back massagers in all of the showers, along with big comfy beds and a beautiful grounds area to walk or sit on the patio. Open all year and the owner could NOT be more nice and friendlier – my shout out to her and her amazing job on this place!
I left Woodstock feeling so amazing…I would live here in a hearbeat if they didn’t have this thing in the Midwest called snow. I highly recommend a visit to Woodstock…it was a great thing for me to do during Covid because it was a lot of outside things, people wore masks all over the place, and there wasn’t a way for any of it to be “closed” – it’s all public. If you loved the movie, you’ll love Woodstock. Who doesn’t love a walk inside a Norman Rockwell painting? Yeah, it’s that ““Put Your Little Hand in Mine…” The Town that Built the Film “Groundhog Day.””

Originally an arcade hack and slash adventure, it was ported to the SNES in 1994. I played through it yesterday on a whim, and it brought all kinds of nostalgia for the 90s rushing back. It has 16 levels of sword-swinging, orc-slaying, magic-blasting adventure as our heroes journey forth to defeat the Red Dragon Gildiss and save the Kingdom of Malus from his tyranny. You can slay the dragon (or die in the attempt) in less than an hour. There’s something really charming about the ultra-brief, ultra-breakneck pace of old 16-bit games, and it’s a huge part of why I love this game.
The King of Dragons was an early score by Yoko Shimomura, who’s now known for her work in the Kingdom Hearts and Paper Mario series. Her work on this game really sets the tone for the adventure. It’s not her best work, and she’s limited somewhat by the SNES’ crude audio CPU. But despite that, the music in this game is especially catchy. Here’s a representative sample:
This is your basic hack-n-slash arcade adventure. You move through stages, you mash the attack button. There’s a lot of strategy in how you approach enemies or position yourself on the screen, but the core gameplay is very basic and intuitive. You don’t need to memorize advanced techniques to succeed in The King of Dragons, meaning anyone can jump right in and see what it has to offer.
The setting is a classic D&D-style fantasy adventure. You’ve got humans, dwarves, elves, orcs, and dragons, just to name a few. Essential classes like fighter, cleric, and wizard are present and accounted for. It’s not the most original thing in the world, but it feels familiar, like a comfy pair of shoes. I’m definitely at home playing an axe-swinging goblin slaying orcs and lizardfolk left and right. The locations are vibrant and varied, from crumbling towers to enchanted forests to underground dungeons. There’s nothing groundbreaking here, but the level of polish and care that went into the art design comes off very well.
One thing that sets this game apart from its contemporaries is a level-up system. Points aren’t pointless here. At set score thresholds your character gains levels, increasing their max hit points. You also pick up weapon and equipment upgrades throughout the game that increase your attack power, defense, shield recovery speed, or attack speed depending on the character. It’s a very simple advancement system, but each upgrade feels satisfying and meaningful, serving as an incentive to keep playing.
The difficulty is the perfect sweet spot. It’s a pretty tricky game, but every enemy has their exploitable foibles that makes them trivial with practice. Seeing the ending of The King of Dragons isn’t all that hard, but you’ll probably need to pick up some extra continues. The caveat is that you should basically always play as Fighter or Cleric. The other three classes are interesting, but have extreme drawbacks. Wizard and Elf lack a shield and are extremely squishy, and Dwarf is short and levels up slowly.
Great co-op games are hard to find, and The King of Dragons is one of them. It’s from the golden age of co-op beat-em-ups like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Golden Axe, Final Fight, and Streets of Rage. While the arcade version features three-player simultaneous co-op, you’ll have to make do with two on the SNES. Still, it’s a lot better than stupid Maximum Carnage, with its single-player nonsense. If you’re looking for a rad old game to play through with a friend, possibly while drinking, then look no further than this gem.
There’s a lot to recommend The King of Dragons, but also some interesting limitations. Most fans of the genre have probably played the seminal Golden Axe, and you might expect The King of Dragons to be similar, given that they’re both about weapon-wielding, well-muscled heroes fighting fantasy monsters. But they feel almost completely different. Golden Axe has lots of jumping around from platform to platform, as well as a rather deep combat system. The King of Dragons, on the other hand, is about as simple as it gets. You don’t have combos or even a run function. The only options are a single attack, a block, an awkward jump, and a magic spell (at the cost of some health).
So does that mean the game lacks variety? Absolutely not. The combat, despite being simple and a bit repetitive, is actually incredibly varied. With five characters to choose from, each of which feels unique, there’s a lot of replay value. You can get up close and personal with the Fighter, Cleric, and Dwarf, or you can go for range with the Elf and Wizard. Honestly, the Elf and Wizard kind of suck since they can’t block, but they add fun variety all the same, especially when playing co-op.
Having such a limited moveset might feel restrictive in a lesser game, but in this one it only serves to focus you on the action. What’s more, each of the 16 stages has a boss, most of which are unique and require careful strategy to bring down. You have to decide where to stand, when to block, when to jump, and when to swing your sword like there’s no tomorrow.
The SNES generation is my favorite era of gaming (which might explain why I write about it so much), and a big part of that is all the great brawl/hack-n-slash games. It’s easy to jump in and jump out of a game like this, knowing that you can breeze through the early stages in a flash. Game over? No biggie. Have to stop and go to work? Not a problem. With a game like The King of Dragons, it’s not so much about reaching the endgame as enjoying the ride along the way. It’s about as simple a premise as you can have for a game, but the execution is so satisfying and polished that I can guarantee you’re going to have a fun time.
So is the elf a lady or a man? I’m getting mixed signals from different artwork.
It’s a dood, he’s just a bit effeminate. They all have names too, but they’re never said in game.
I absolutely adore this game.
I grew up playing Golden Axe in arcades and on my Sega Genesis.
I never had a Super Nintendo.
So I saw it at friends houses.
Playing later, I fell in love with it.
Later in life I bought it for the Playstation capcom collection and I still play it to this day.FoodLogiQ's Blog and Email Updates

Hundreds of food executives convened in New Orleans this week for IFMA’s Chain Operators EXchange (COEX), the industry’s only conference “created by operators, for operators.” With an agenda packed with content built by a committee of foodservice operator executives, the event showcased pertinent issues operators are facing today.
FoodLogiQ was featured on the main stage this year at COEX along with GS1 US and Ripe.io to discuss the current state of blockchain in foodservice. The session provided an overview of blockchain, addressed several of the common misperceptions about the evolving technology, as well as helped to better differentiate between blockchain and one of the potential use cases for blockchain - traceability.
“There’s a lot of confusion out there and a lot of assumptions that blockchain and traceability are one in the same,” said Katy Jones, FoodLogiQ Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer. “It is critically important to take a step back and really understand the business problem and what you are trying to accomplish before jumping into the technology to support it.”
The panel also addressed several important aspects of blockchain, including the required foundations for whole chain traceability, as well as interoperability and why it is critical to blockchain within the food industry.
These required foundations, or standards, that make it possible to implement blockchain include basic supply chain visibility business processes. That means implementing an international standard like traceability, whether on the blockchain or not, standards are the invaluable common denominator that can streamline the transmission of detailed product data between parties.
Additional sessions at COEX this year included advancement in food safety technology, the role of delivery services on the foodservice brand, as well as a variety of panel presentations on supply chain transparency, collaboration and innovation..

The consumer price index is up 5.4 percent in the past twelve months after Congress and two presidential administrations made unprecedented spending in response to the COVID pandemic, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The month of September saw an overall increase of 0.4 percent, including an increase of 1.2 percent for gasoline and 3.9 percent for heating oil.
In hindsight, of course, inflation was perfectly predictable and a direct result of Congress spending, the weaker dollar, and massive quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve.
Since January 2020, national debt has risen by $ 5.5 trillion as Congress passed stimulus after stimulus to support the economy after 25 million jobs were lost at the height of the COVID lockdown in April 2020: Sept. , $ 2 trillion CARES bill and $ 900 billion phase four signed by former President Donald Trump and the $ 1.9 trillion stimulus packages signed by President Joe Biden.
Of this, $ 3.1 trillion was monetized directly by the Fed, which increased its holdings of government bonds from $ 2.3 trillion to $ 5.4 trillion. About $ 500 billion came from foreign central banks, which finally resumed new purchases from around May 2021 after staying at about $ 7 trillion for 17 straight months. The rest, about $ 2 trillion, was largely bought by US financial institutions, in part with the help of emergency loans from the Fed.
As a result, the M2 monetary base has grown by $ 5.4 trillion since January 2020 to nearly $ 20.8 trillion now. We have literally printed money to cover every portion of the debt incurred as a result of the COVID pandemic and lockdowns.
Now it looks like the economy is overheating and inflation is getting particularly sticky given the highest levels since the 2008 oil bubble. Senator Joe Manchin (DW.Va.) has already ruled out voting for such a high number, and now Biden is moving in his direction.
Last week, Biden ruled out the $ 3.5 trillion topline, telling reporters on Oct. 15, “Look, it’s clear it won’t be $ 3.5 trillion. So the question is: How much of what is important do we bring into legislation? “
The original bill was $ 450 billion for universal pre-kindergarten, $ 500 billion for universal family paid vacation, $ 111 billion for universal community college with two years of tuition paid, $ 82 billion for retrofitting Schools, $ 80 billion for professional training, $ 500 billion to extend the $ 3,600 and $ 3,000 child tax credits, $ 222 billion for green power tax credits, and about $ 100 billion more to support Medicaid expansion in 12th Forcing states that have decided against Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion.
Now Biden has to negotiate away many of these points, that is, if he wants to get the bill over the finish line. Even if, say, $ 1.5 trillion were cut from the proposal, it would still be a gigantic $ 2 trillion, which will undoubtedly force the Fed to continue its massive quantitative easing program even if the central bank signals that it is she is ready to reduce her program to buy government bonds.
That said, the increased inflation Americans experience every time they go shopping could last longer – much longer. Stay tuned.
Like this:When my dad drove me from Chicago to Iowa State University, a six-hour ride in his 1965 dark blue Plymouth Belvedere wagon, we didn’t speak a word. He was anxious and angry that I had turned down an offer from the Air Force Academy. They had promised a full scholarship, room and board, summer employment and a job after I finished. “That sounds like a good deal,” he told me.
But I had something else in mind. Cobbling together an ROTC scholarship, a partial athletic scholarship and another independent scholarship, I would have enough to cover my education and expenses for four years. I could throw myself into learning, when I wasn’t busy throwing a javelin.
I was hungry and ambitious, even if I didn’t know much about this new world. “Who’s the idiot who came up with that idea?” I asked when told I couldn’t take five majors. My younger self was kind of argumentative.
I had big plans, especially because I was the first kid in my family to go to college. My dad’s family first came to Maryland in the 1640s as indentured servants, and what followed was 14 generations of farmers, builders, soldiers, sailors—largely self-taught people who served their country and worked hard.
My father continued that tradition. He was an enlisted sailor, a high school graduate, who moved my two brothers, two sisters and me 21 times before I got to college. That included stints in Maryland, Kentucky, Florida, Illinois, California and back again. I attended four different high schools, several of them more than once.
Dad did have a few words before going. “Maybe we’ll see you at Christmas,” he said, then pulled away in his Plymouth, leaving me curbside with my Boy Scout trunk containing all my worldly possessions.
*
When I was 13 and living in Lexington Park, Maryland, my fellow Eagle Scout Randy Rupp and I collected a year’s supply of food as well as holiday gifts and toys for a needy family. On Christmas Eve, 1968, we packed full two U-Haul trucks, and my dad drove one dressed as Santa. The ride didn’t take all that long, but it felt like we traveled to a different world. The family lived in a shack with a tarpaper roof and a dirt floor.
We were not exactly living like kings: My four younger siblings, dad and I lived in government housing for enlisted Navy personnel. When I was nine, not long after my mom passed away, I shared a bunk bed with one of my brothers in a makeshift room, rigged up with blankets hanging from a carport outside our house in Imperial Beach, California. I slept on the top bunk so neighborhood dogs couldn’t lick me awake.
Later that night, after visiting the tarpaper shack, I watched astronauts from Apollo 8, who circled the moon ten times. I watched on a color TV, a brand-new Magnavox set that my dad went into hock to get.
I remember that moment like it happened a minute ago. I was literally tingling and having this thought: Who were these people living in a shack, who were we, and who were these people up at the moon?
It didn’t seem fair that they had a dirt floor and we had a color television. And I was gripped by the idea that these other people took off in a rocket and flew to the moon. They were proving that you can do anything if you can get your mind ready.
I carried this feeling—this dual notion—of unfairness and the sense that anything was possible with education straight to Ames, Iowa. This fueled me, even if my dad was angry, wondering and worrying what would become of me.
*
When we arrived on campus, I was surprised to see that it was pretty empty. It turns out we were four days early. (It was the only day my dad had free to take me.) With less than ten dollars in my pocket, I wasn’t sure how I was going to get by until the dorms and the dining hall opened. But within an hour, another kid and I were offered a job assembling cots, paid with meals and a place to sleep.
Before long, my world opened up like never before. Finally, I had four straight years in one place. Growing up, one constant was the local public library or the library on base. Now not only did I have access to a great college library, but my ROTC scholarship allowed me to buy anything in the bookstore—any book, not just those on a professor’s syllabus—that I thought I needed to be successful. I couldn’t believe my good luck; I was in heaven.
Except for teachers, there wasn’t anyone I knew who had been to college. But after a sophomore high school project simulating the Apollo 13 mission, I began thinking more about how can we predict the future, design the future, and control it. I had this self-derived idea that college was the way to get the tools necessary to design things that don’t exist—not just objects, but also structures, systems, organizations.
My original plan was to study engineering, linguistics, political science, history and anthropology. There might even have been a few others. College to me was going to be a feast—and I just didn’t understand why it made sense to only major in one thing. When told that wasn’t possible, I pulled back and double-majored in political science and environmental science, taking as many of the other courses and eventually independent studies as the hours in the day allowed.
*
While I was drawn to many fields, I wanted to do more than graze. That led me to Don Hadwiger, a professor who taught science policy and food and agriculture policy. He talked about making change to make things better: For example, how do you feed more people? Science was not just about learning for the sake of knowledge, it was about solving problems.
When I was 19, a junior, some university administrators hired me to go to the Iowa state legislature to talk about a technical project involving mining coal and then restoring the farm land for greater agricultural productivity. “We have no idea how you understand this project, but you explain it better than we do,” they told me. Later they sent me off to Washington, DC, to do the same.
So here I was in college, learning about politics and engineering and science—and how science gets translated and interpreted. The school also let me design and build my own grant-funded engineering project: a system that could minimize the dust from mined coal and limit environmental effects. All of this led to working at the Ames National Laboratory right after graduation to come up with ideas and design energy-related projects.
College created this incredible environment for me to learn in the widest possible way. It allowed me to give concrete shape to my high-school-age notion that a place of learning can fuel the designer of the future; enable multiple ways of thinking, multiple pathways and subjects; and then apply that learning to drive change and make something new.
It made me think: Wouldn’t it be great if universities worked that way more broadly, engaging across disciplines to solve problems and creating opportunity for the widest possible cross-section of students to take part? This has inspired my work at ASU in designing a New American University.
My dad and I were probably equally stubborn. I can remember sleeping in the doghouse in the backyard, during a sleet storm, rather than argue with him. But he didn’t stay angry and he didn’t carry a grudge. After that first drive to college, our relationship was positive. I know he was proud of me. And I know he saw, in his way, the value of what I am trying to achieve. a lighter weight fabric. Fabric is lightly structured to allow a freer more flexible fit.

As such, it is sometimes simple encounters that determine the desire to become a perfumer. Such was the case of Emilie Coppermann who sealed her destiny when she met a perfume designer when she was a teenager.
Emilie Coppermann’s journey
Emilie Coppermann was drawn to the idea of a career in perfumery at a very young age. Indeed, a striking encounter with a perfumer made her want to integrate this fascinating universe when she was barely 13 years old. Determined to pursue her dream, she naturally turned to study chemistry. She then joined the largest international perfume school: ISIPCA in Versailles. His talent was quickly recognized by the perfumers of Symrise and more particularly by Jean-Louis Sieuzac and Dominique Ropion. Both decided to take her under their wings and this is how she integrated this company in which she has been practicing since its beginnings. She admits having learned a lot from these two noses recognized around the world. They are the ones who taught him the fundamentals of perfumery. Likewise, Emilie Coppermann has at the same time forged sincere ties with perfumer Maurice Roucel, another personality in the olfactory world that she considers to be one of her mentors.
Emilie Coppermann’s woody style
Although influenced by the world of perfumers who trained her, Emilie Coppermann has developed her own style. In addition, she admits to being very attracted by woody scents. These funds form the basis of each of his creations, whether they are masculine or feminine fragrances. She often associates them with fresher tones and particularly likes galbabum, mandarin or angelica. Jacques Carles, president of the Center for Luxury and Creation, says of her that she “draws her inspiration from passion” and that her essences “lead us astutely into a world of wood and spicy perfumes. She skilfully combines unusual materials, he says, to create harmonious compositions that make us want to discover more ”. This is how
Emilie Coppermann considers everything to be a source of inspiration. She uses, in this case, each of her trips, her many encounters and her curiosity to create ever more successful perfumes. She has, among other things, developed the famous Kapsules by Karl Lagarfeld as well as Play and Play Intense by Givenchy or the iconic Black XS for her by Paco Rabanne.

WILLEMSTAD - Towing Company KTK offers a part of the staff the opportunity to leave voluntarily. Those who submit their resignation will receive a golden handshake.
Due to the crisis at oil company PDVSA, the activities of KTK decreased by 80 percent. How many of the 136 employees have to leave, the KTK did not say.
This shows again how dependent Curaçao is on Venezuela.Print made by John Horsburgh, 1791–1869, British, Abbeville, 1836

Siaya County Coordinator for Immunization Services Joshua Ondiege and journalists from Royal Media Service, Kenya News Agency and Weekly Citizen were unceremoniously hounded out of the public facility by the medical superintendent Dr Aliech Adoyo who accused them of intruding into his office without following protocol.
This came despite the media team speaking earlier to the County Executive Committee member for Health, Dismas Wakla over the phone and making arrangements for the briefing.
Wakla, who told the media that he was on his way to the airport, referred the journalists to Ondiege. Some members of the media team had earlier joined the queue for the Covid-19 jab as they were waiting for the coordinator.
Trouble for the journalists started when they went to the Medical Superintendent’s office to inquire about Ondiege’s office.
The secretary directed them to an office whose occupant referred them back to the Medical Superintendent’s office where, after explaining their mission again, they were ushered into an office to wait.
After a two-hour wait, the scribes went back to find out what could be happening and also seek permission to shoot a video footage of a queue of the residents who had turned up for vaccination as they waited for Ondiege whose office, apparently is housed outside the hospital compound.
On entering the medic’s office and introducing themselves and the mission, the indifferent Dr. Adoyo ordered the journalists out, saying that they ought to know the protocol to follow.
Attempts by the journalists to inform convince him that they had not breached any protocol and had even been in communication with the county minister for health and other officials fell on deaf ears, as he retorted that he had nothing to do with the media.
“What is the CEC health?” he posed adding “In any case, he is just a lawyer and should have advised you on the protocol to follow before coming here”.
As he was dismissing the media, a team sent by the CEC Health to brief the journalists arrived and, tongue tied, sought to know what was amiss.
Instead of an answer, they were also ordered out of the compound, with a warning not to talk to carry their business anywhere in the vicinity of the hospital.
The officials, who were equally taken aback, led the journalists out to the department of health and sanitation offices where they briefed them on the status of Covid 19 in the county.
Ondiege said that the number of residents has increased at all the 17 vaccination centres across the county and expressed hope that they would be able to beat the target.
The coordinator said Siaya had so far managed to vaccinate 56,000 people from March 2021 to date out of a target of 115,000 by December.
He said that several strategies, among them increasing the number of vaccination points by opening 40 more sites, have been put in place to ensure that they get the remaining 59, 000 people that is required to hit the December deadline.HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!
This is how I spent my day.
I did some laundry, worked on some writing (I got unblocked! No more creative constipation! Yay!), and decided that since my mum had given me a pumpkin, I HAD to carve it. I mean, come on, it's Halloween, what else am I gonna do? (besides walk up and down Main Street in full costume, but we'll blog about that later.)
So here's how it went.
Me and my pumpkin.
I watched Signs while carving the pumpkin. You can see Mel in the background keeping watch over my progress.
YUM! no, I didn't really eat it. Not even roasted seeds.
I'm imitating my pumpkin's vacant expression. This is the face I make at least forty-three times a week at work.
The finished product!
And here's me admiring my handiwork.
Had a good time! Now my little pumpkin will sit on my mum's porch to greet all the little trick or treaters that don't show up at my fourplex apartment.Plastic Business cards- Design your business cards or grab high-quality presentation folder at K12Print.

Abstract
Moreover urban waste can be seen as a cultural problem because it affects various aspects of life, and the impact on urban waste management system nowadays are not effective and efficient yet. The reason for conducting this research is the emergence of the informal sector phenomena of urban waste management that can contribute to reduce the volume of urban waste production. The purpose of this research is to find out the informal sector strategy in urban waste management, especially inorganic waste. The researchers used qualitative research to explain the phenomenon as the focus of research.
The result of research is 3M phenomenon, that is derived from Indonesian words (Mengubah = Changing, Mengurangi = Reducing, Manfaat = Benefit), in the management of urban inorganic waste. The explanation are; Mengubah: turning waste into economic value; Mengurangi: If the economic value of the urban waste volumes increases, the volume of urban waste will eventually be reduced; and Manfaat: the benefits obtained are management cultivating empowerment, reducing the burden of the landfill volume, being closer to inorganic zero waste condition.
Suggestions are as follows: [a] development of management towards go-green, [b] urban waste management based on predictable community empowerment will be more effective and efficient in the future.

Abstract
With the successful launch of the Swift Gamma-ray Burst Explorer, it is widely expected that the prompt optical flashes like GRB990123 would be easily detected. However, the observations show that for a number of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) no early optical flash has been detected, which indicates that the reverse shock emission must be suppressed. Here we explore the possibility that the optical flash may arise from the internal shock emission. For GRB990123 and GRB060111b, although their optical emission are not correlated with the gamma-ray emission, we propose here that their optical and gamma-ray emission may arise from different internal shocks (which can be formed by collision of different shells), and find that, under certain circumstances, the optical flashes of GRB990123 and GRB060111b can well be explained by the internal shock model. For GRB041219a, the prompt optical emission was correlated with the gamma-ray emission, which can also be explained by the internal shock model if we assume the optical emission was the low-energy extension of the gamma-ray emission, and we find its redshift is about z ~ 0.2. As for GRB050904, we have shown in previous paper that the optical flash was produced by synchrotron radiation and the X-ray flare was produced by the synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) mechanism. Therefore we conclude that the early optical flashes of GRBs can usually arise from the internal shock emission. Meanwhile in our model since the shells producing the optical flashes would be easily disrupted by other shells, so we suggest that the bright optical flash should not be common in GRBs. In addition, we also discussed the SSC emission in the internal shock model, and find that for different values of parameters, there would be several kinds of high-energy emission (at ~100 keV, ~10 MeV or GeV) accompanying the optical flash. For a burst like GRB990123, a GeV flare with fluence about 10-8 erg cm-2 s-1 is expected, which might be detected by the GLAST satellite.

Us women-who-care types are a driven bunch. In our earnest quest to reduce consumption and save our planet, we've probably pictured ourselves as unwavering frugal demi-gods, turning a make-up free cheek to advertisers with a sense of empowerment, ease and calm.
The reality? Perhaps a little different. But that's no reason to beat yourself up.
Two things: We don't live in a cultural vacuum, and we're human!
In today's material obsessed society, we are surrounded by constant pressures to consume. The 'more is more' mentality is pervasive and clever. Advertisers directly and indirectly flood us with imagery which is designed to manipulate us into believing "I'm not good enough because I don't look like her", or "I'll be happy if only I had this thing".
Dangerously, this ubiquitous messaging is coupled with an age of instant gratification. Fast food at our disposal, the world's knowledge at our fingertips, that new dress only a click away… everything we want, we can have..And we can have it right now.
Ideally, we would be mindful enough to resist the need for anything "instant", take a deep breathe, and stay focused on investing in our deeper goals from which we can reap long-term, more fulfilling benefits. The more well-practiced would turn to a long meditation or bush hike, perhaps.
But this is an emergency; there's no time. Your brain is telling you that you desperately need your happiness hit, and about you're about to click "add to cart." You know you don't need this and you've seen the devastating reality of a world of overconsumption. You're about to lose an internal battle - until you remember this list of instant, earth-friendly happiness boosters that these will take you less time than it would to get from one end of Ikea to the other.
Choose your favourite(s), or for a more personalised emergency mood-boosting experience, make-up your own:
Cuddle a pet
Do you really need an excuse? Well here's one anyway. Snuggling up to one of our furry friends is proven to fulfil social needs, make us happier, and even improve physical health. Like you needed to be told! If (like me) you're currently pet-less, an cute-puppy themed youtube session is an almost-decent substitute.
Cuddle a person.
You know the feeling of being mid-embrace in a firm, heartfelt hug? It's nice right? I bet you're smiling just thinking about it. Turns out hugging can reduce the stress hormone cortisol, and increase levels of the 'love hormone', oxytocin. Speaking of oxytocin, i'm sure you know what else releases this bliss-inducing hormone….
Give Happiness away.
Brightening someone's day is a simple way to feel super chuffed. It doesn't have to be grandiose or time-consuming, just a few thoughtful, kind words uttered, or a small act of kindness. It could be as simple as smiling warmly at a customer in your service industry job, or leaving an "I love you" note for your partner. You'll have not only made another person feel warm and fuzzy, but you'll feel a good dose of wholesome, enduring, hitch-free happiness yourself. The best kind.
“No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted."- Aesop
Make your bed (accomplish something small).
Gretchen Rubin, best-selling author of the Happiness Project, proclaimed "when I was researching my book on happiness, this was the number one most impactful change that people brought up over and over." Why? Because making your bed is an easy, quick way to accomplish something that will benefit your everyday life. It's an act of self-love really; a small everyday, investment in your own happiness that settles our self-doubt and declutters our thoughts. Go on. Make your mum proud.
Aside: My hunch is that a small DIY project would have the same effect!
Blast your favourite song. Dancing compulsory.
This is quite self-explanatory. I can't promise that you won't be embarrassed if caught doing this, but I can promise it's probably a risk worth taking. Because, music, endorphins, mind-body connection, that's why.

Accept & surrender to something you can't change.
Often a source of unhappiness in our lives exists because of something we are resisting. It's understandable that stressors impact us, but fighting against one that is unchangeable is draining, and blocks feelings of love, warmth and joy - all the good things! It only takes a few mindful minutes to go deep and identify some element in our reality that we are actively resisting. Once this is isolated, simply decide to accept - surrender to what is. Enjoy the overwhelming sense of relief which follows.
Plan a bucket-list adventure.
Hitting the shops can give you a buzz, sure, but can it match finally sitting down to plan a grand (or micro) adventure that's been on your bucket list for years?
It's common to feel stuck in our day-today situation, subscribed to the idea that our lives are out of our control. But despite what it seems, the reality is that we are in the driver seat. Try to keep an open mind, and look for opportunities. It doesn't matter if your "adventure" is finally beginning that veggie patch, or going on a round the world trip; and it doesn't matter if your schedule means you've had to plan these 5 years in advance. Just get started - and be ready to greet the rush of ridiculously happy feels headed straight for you.
Phone a friend (or your mum!)
It comes as no surprise that social connections makes us happier. But research also shows us that our closest relationships are the most important. We probably come in to contact with our broader social network daily through work, uni or school, but when was the last time you really, properly connected with your nearest and dearest? As the saying goes, they're only a phone call away!

Earthing.
Have you heard of Earthing? It basically means walking barefoot upon the earth. The practice of earthing as a therapy has been claimed by some to have numerous health benefits due the negative charge of the earth. Whilst the jury is out on these claims, simply getting out in nature is a tried and tested method to feel better. In fact, many of you mentioned 'nature' when we asked you what happiness is. The grounding, calming and humbling effects of connecting with the earth could be just what you need to feel happier, and give you the clarity to see through social pressures to consume.
Look for the love
Love permeates our lives in infinite ways - the challenge is to notice and be grateful for it. Meditate for a moment on the powerful sources of love which exist, such as the unconditional love from our partner, family and close friends. Picture it as a coloured light radiating toward you an engulfing you, if it helps. Next, take a moment to be grateful for the not-so-big, but no less significant, love which is all around us. A stranger smiling at you on the street, a sunset that you happen to catch on the drive home, a mother soothing a child. Just thinking about, and being grateful for, these sources of love is enough to feel rejuvenated, warm and happy!

Hel is the Norse goddess of the dead. She controlled over the hidden world, Niflheim, where she got the dead. Her name signifies “one that stows away.”
As a general rule, Hel is just referenced in passing in Old Norse writing. It implies her person is not well characterized and her character minimally created. A few history specialists even recommend that she is an illusion of the creative mind of the Norse artists.
In Norse folklore, Hel’s dad was the joke artist god Loki and her mom the giantess Angrboda. Loki and Angrboda had three youngsters: the wolf Fenrir; the snake Jormungandr; and Hel, their solitary girl.
Hel was brought into the world with the bones on one portion of her body completely uncovered and, along these lines, is frequently portrayed as a half dark and half white beast. She grew up with Fenrir and Jormungandr in Jotunheim, a place that is known for the goliaths, until Odin, leader of the Aesir, concluded they should live in.
Asgard where their dad came from.
Hel is related to a hellhound named Garmr just like crows. She is additionally at times partnered with the Hagalaz Runestone.
In Asgard, the other Norse divine beings were awkward with Hel’s appearance. Consequently, Odin consented to send her away and gave her the World of Niflheim one of the Nine Realms. There she became sovereign of the dead.
The Norse accepted that a great many people went to Niflheim when they passed on. Just fighters who were killed in the war zone didn’t go to Niflheim. All things considered, half of the heroes who kicked the bucket in the war zone went to live with Odin in his palatial home Valhalla and the other half with Freya in her life following the death domain Folkvang.
Niflheim was separated into areas, including one called the shore of bodies. Here, a palace loaded up with venomous snakes stood pointing toward the north. It was loaded with killers, liars, and philanderers who endured while their blood was sucked by a mythical beast named Nidhogg.
At the point when Odin’s child Baldur kicked the bucket on account of a stunt by Loki, his spirit was likewise gotten in Niflheim. Hermod, another child of Odin’s, consented to go to Hel to persuade her to send Baldur home. Yet, Loki played another stunt to make it unthinkable for Baldur to get back to this present reality. The possible openness of his craftiness prompted the apocalypse, a fight among great and evil knew as Ragnarok.
In Niflheim, Hel was held up by two workers called Ganglia and Ganglion. It is said they moved at such a leisurely pace that they gave off an impression of being stopped. They served her dinners in a dish named “hunger” and with a blade named “starvation.”
Hela, the anecdotal villainess in Marvel Comics’ American comic books, depends on Hel. She has likewise included in the webcomic The Order of the Stick, where she is the main enemy who needs to annihilate the world.

PAWTUCKET, R.I. (WLNE) – The Pawtucket School Committee voted unanimously on Thursday night for a limited number of students to return to school in-person in September.
Students in pre-K, kindergarten, and the “special population” students will return in-person. All other grades will return through distance learning through December, or until the situation changes.
“We felt this was the safest decision for our students,” said Gerard Charbonneau, the Chairman of the Pawtucket School Committee.
Only four out the district’s 15 buildings have been deemed safe to use for in-person learning.
Students returning in-person will be spread out between Potter-Burns Elementary School, Jenks Middle School, Varina Elementary School, and Nathaniel Greene Elementary School.
“We have buildings that currently don’t have air ventilation systems,” said Charbonneau. “We would be exposing 75% of our student population of over 8,500 children to insufficient airflow.”
Parents who were hoping for a full return to in-person school are now trying to make arrangements for distance learning.
“I’m a nurse, I work 3rd shift. I unfortunately don’t have a lot of time to sit there during the day and help my son,” said Melissa Casto, whose son is going into 8th grade at Goff Middle School.
Charbonneau said the committee considered situations like this, but ultimately the decision came down to safety.
“I hear you. I’m a parent of two Pawtucket high school students. I share your frustration,” said Charbonneau. “But the reality as it sits here in our community today, we cannot open these schools safely.”
Governor Gina Raimondo will announce how she wants Pawtucket School District to reopen on Monday.Skin of Color Society, NEJM Group and VisualDx Launch Free Webinar Series on Addressing Racism in Medicine
Leading Organizations Collaborate on Timely Four-Part Virtual Series Focused on Curbing Disparities and Bias in Healthcare
ROCHESTER, N.Y.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Skin of Color Society, NEJM Group, and VisualDx are proud to announce a series of virtual panel discussions that call attention to health disparities and structural racism in medicine. The four-part webinar series, “The Impact of Skin Color and Ethnicity on Clinical Diagnosis and Research,” will delve into longstanding problems in education, research, and patient care as well as introduce ways to improve outcomes in marginalized patients.
Studies have shown patients with darker skin experience worse health outcomes than patients with lighter skin. This free series will address the socioeconomic factors, structural racism, and implicit bias that lead to disparities, as well as look at how the medical community can address these issues by offering tangible, real-world solutions. Each discussion will feature insights from renowned experts, thought leaders and advocates that are driving the industry forward to improve the health and lives of underrepresented populations.
The four-part series will feature the following topics and leading physicians:
- “Structural Racism and Racial Bias in Medicine,” Wednesday, October 28 at 1 pm ET: Focused on identifying health disparities and highlighting solutions to address this issue such as medical education, more training and funding, and fast-tracking research publication. Panelists include Susan C. Taylor, MD, Henry W. Lim, MD, and Maritza I. Perez, MD; the discussion will be moderated by Susan Saulny.
- “Hair Disorders in People of Color,” Thursday, November 12 at 1 pm ET: Focused on the external factors and systemic diseases that can cause hair loss, and the need for physicians to understand the effect of ethnicity on the significance and cultural meaning of hair loss to better treat this critical problem. Panelists include Ncoza Dlova, MBChB, FCDerm, PhD and Andrew F. Alexis, MD, MPH; the discussion will be moderated by Amy McMichael, MD.
- “Pigmentary Disorders and Keloids,” Wednesday, November 18 at 1 pm ET: Focused on sharing the latest research and treatment options on keloids/hypertrophic scarring and on the breadth of pigmentary disorders and how these conditions are often signs of systemic disease, causing serious psychological and social ramifications. Panelists include Seemal R. Desai, MD, FAAD, and Donald A. Glass II, MD, PhD; the discussion will be moderated by Pearl E. Grimes, MD.
- “COVID-19 Comorbidities and Cutaneous Manifestations of Systemic Diseases in Adults and Children,” Wednesday December 2 at 1 pm ET: Focused on the challenges of recognizing systemic diseases in melanin-rich skin types, using skin signs of COVID-19 morbidities to demonstrate the need to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in patients of color. Panelists include Lynn McKinley-Grant, MD, FAAD, Candrice R. Heath, MD, and Ginette A. Okoye, MD.
“For 20 years, we have been committed to improving diagnosis and care in patients with skin of color,” said Art Papier, MD, CEO of VisualDx. “We are thrilled to team up with such exemplary partners who share in that commitment. Now is the time to not only talk about racial disparities, but to do something impactful about the problem by equipping our clinicians with the ongoing education, training, and comprehensive information tools needed to improve patient care.”
“Implicit bias and structural racism play a central role in the development of health care disparities. One example is misdiagnosis of skin diseases in patients of color,” said Kathy Charlton, Managing Director of NEJM Group Education and Applied Knowledge. “NEJM Group is pleased to be a part of this collaborative effort with Skin of Color Society and VisualDx to engage and educate clinicians to strive for diagnostic quality and accuracy in patients of color.”
“Founded 16 years ago, the Skin of Color Society’s (SOCS) programs in education, research, and mentoring and SOCS’ collaboration with other dermatology societies have significantly increased the numbers of underrepresented minority dermatologists, research grants, publications, and educational opportunities in skin of color dermatology. SOCS welcomes this collaboration with NEJM Group and VisualDx. These webinars exemplify the type of education needed to understand implicit bias and eliminate health disparities in people of color,” said Lynn McKinley-Grant, MD, FAAD, SOCS President.
These events are free and open to the public but are geared toward frontline healthcare workers. Skin of Color Society, NEJM Group and VisualDx would like to thank Zoom Video Communications for its in-kind support of this webinar series.

I have family coming in from Germany for the next week, and I can’t wait to get my hands on them 🙂 Obviously, they’re going to be my first priority for the next several days, so I’m making it official. I’ll be back, if all goes as planned, on Monday, January 6–or Tuesday. We’ll see.
I’m hoping you all had a wonderful Christmas, and that you’re planning for a relaxing New Year’s Day.
Did someone say “New Year’s Resolutions”? I’m not going to share mine. As our pastor says, I think it’ wiser to make plans than it is to make promises. So–a blessed New Year to all of you, and I’ll see you in 2014.Background and purpose: The benefit of carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic high-grade stenosis has long been proven. The role of angioplasty as an alternative is still a matter of debate. We compared the occurrence of intraprocedural microembolic signals and ischemic lesions between carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid angioplasty with stent placement (CAS) without a protection device.
Methods: 88 patients who underwent a CEA and 41 patients who underwent CAS were prospectively investigated. One day before and after the intervention diffusion weighted MRI-studies were obtained. In 21 CEA and 18 CAS patients transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring was performed during the procedure to detect microembolic signals (MES).
Results: DWI-lesions could be detected after intervention in 17% of the CEA patients compared with 54% of the CAS patients (p<0.005). The median lesion volume was 0.08 cm(3) in the CEA group and 0.02 cm(3) in the CAS group (p<0.001). Ischemic complications consisted of 2 strokes (2.3%) with symptoms lasting more than seven days in the CEA group and 1 stroke (2.4 %) in the CAS group. The median number of MES in the CEA group was 17 versus 61 in the CAS group (p<0.001). No significant correlation was found between the total number of MES and ischemic lesions in either group.
Conclusion: A larger number of emboligenic particles with smaller volume is detached during CAS. Additionally DWI lesions were observed in different territories after CAS but not after CEA. Conventional TCD emboli detection is not useful to compare interventional therapies of the carotid arteries. Feb 2010

Wright was killed in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota — 10 miles south of Minneapolis where the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin, who faces murder charges in the death of George Floyd, is ongoing.
In a statement released Monday evening (April 12), the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension identified Kim Potter as the officer who shot Wright. He was reportedly pulled over for expired tags when officers discovered a warrant. When they attempted to arrest Wright, Potter, a 26-year veteran of the department, shot him, claiming she meant to use her taser.
Barack and Michelle Obama shared a joint statement on Tuesday (April 13) addressing the shooting, saying their "hearts are heavy" following "yet another shooting of Black man."
," their statement read in part.
Beyonce also paid tribute to Wright on her website.

Signals¶
Inputs:
Segmentation
Segmentation out of which a subset of segments should be selected
Outputs:
Selected data(default)
Segmentation containing the selected segments
Discarded data
Segmentation containing the discarded segments
Description¶
This widget inputs a segmentation and creates a new segmentation including only some of the input segments. Segment selection can be based on their content, their annotations, or their frequency; it can also be random. No matter which method is used, the widget emits on a second output connection (not selected by default) a segmentation containing the segments that were not selected.
The interface of Select is available in two versions, according to whether or not the Advanced Settings checkbox is selected.
Basic interface¶
The basic version of the widget (see figure 1 below) is limited to the selection of segments based on a regular expression (see Method: Regex in section Advanced interface below). The differences with the advanced interface are the following: (i) regular expression options are not accessible (-u, Unicode dependent, is nonetheless activated by default); (ii) auto-numbering is disabled; and (iii) annotations are copied by default.
Figure 1: Select widget (basic interface).
Advanced interface¶
In its advanced version, the Select section of the widget interface comes in three versions depending on the value chosen in the Method drop-down menu (see figures 2 to 4 below).
Figure 2: Select widget (advanced interface, Regex method).
Method: Regex¶
This method consists of selecting the segments of the input segmentation whose content or annotations are matched by a regular expression. The Mode drop-down menu (see figure 2 above) allows the user to specify if the segments corresponding to the regular expression should be selected (Include) or not (Exclude), in which case the segments that do not correspond to the regular expression will be selected.
The Annotation key drop-down menu allows the user to choose an annotation key from the input segmentation; in that case, the segments whose annotation values for this key are matched by the regular expression will be selected (or not). If the value (none) is selected, the content of the segments will be matched against the regular expression.
The Regex field is designed to specify the regular expression used for segment selection, and the Ignore case (i), Unicode dependent (u), Multiline (m) and Dot matches all (s) checkboxes control the application of the corresponding options to this expression.
In the example of figure 2 above, the widget is
configured to include (Mode: Include) from the input segmentation the
segments whose annotation value for key category (Annotation key:
category) is either noun or verb (Regex:
^(noun|verb)$).
Method: Sample¶
This method consists of selecting the segments of the input segmentation with a random sampling process, such that every input segment has the same probability of being selected or not.
Figure 3: Select widget (advanced interface, Sample method).
The Sample size expressed as drop-down menu (see figure 3 above) allows the user to choose the way in which to express the wanted size for the sample. If the value Count is selected, as on figure 3, the size of the sample will be expressed directly in the number of segments (Sample size). If the Proportion value is selected, the size will be expressed in percentage of input segments (Sampling rate (%)).
Method: Threshold¶
This method consists of retaining from the input segmentation only the segments whose content (or annotation value for a given key) has a frequency in the segmentation that is comprised between given bounds.
Figure 4: Select widget (advanced interface, Threshold method).
The Annotation key drop-down menu (see figure 4 above) allows the user to select an annotation key from the input segmentation; if so, the frequency of the annotation values associated with this key will condition the inclusion of input segments. If the value (none) is selected, the frequency of the segment content will be decisive.
The Threshold expressed as drop-down menu allows the user to choose the way in which to express the minimal and maximal frequency limits. If the value Count is selected, the limits will be expressed in absolute frequencies (Min./Max. count). If the value Proportion is selected, as in figure 4, the limits will be expressed in percentages (Min./Max. proportion (%)). For both values (minimum and maximum), thresholding is applied only if the corresponding box is checked.
In the figure 4 example, the widget is configured to retain only the segments whose annotation value for the key category (Annotation key) has a relative frequency (Threshold expressed as: Proportion) comprised between 5% (Min. proportion (%)) and 10% (Max. proportion (%)) in the input segmentation.
The elements of the Options section of the widget interface are common to the three selection methods presented above. The Output segmentation label field enables the user to specify the label assigned to the output segmentation. [1] The Auto-number with key checkbox enables the program to automatically number the segments of the output segmentation and to associate the number to the annotation key specified in the text field on the right. The Copy annotations checkbox copies every annotation of the input segmentation to the output segmentation. regex defined.
- A regular expression must be entered in the Regex field in order for computation and data emission to proceed.

Interview: Duong Quang Thanh
Which investment areas is EVN prioritising to meet the increasing demand for electricity?
DUONG QUANG THANH: Between 2011 and 2015 the added capacity of Vietnam was about 18,500 MW. During that time EVN began operation of 17 power projects with a total capacity of 9852 MW, which represents a 25% increase in the allocated capacity under the Master Plan VII. This was a significant contribution to Vietnam’s efforts to overcome power shortages that have occurred in the past. According to the adjusted Power Plan VII, the total generation capacity of EVN investments in 2016-30 will be 14,610 MW, spread across 21 power supply projects. By 2020 we are expecting to finalise an additional 14 projects with a combined capacity of 7185 MW.
EVN plans to implement new thermal-power plants, including several urgent projects in the southern regions to support electricity generation at the power stations in Vinh Tan and Duyen Hai. For the electricity transmission grid, most investments will be used to ensure better power transmission from the generating stations to the distribution centres in line with 2020 efficiency targets. The transmission grid target for 2020 is to meet the N-1 reliability standard, and to strengthen the north-south transmission capacity, particularly the 500-KV line which runs between Ha Tinh and Pleiku.
What is the outlook on the use of coal-fired power plants and other power sources in Vietnam?
THANH: The total capacity of coal-fired thermal power plants put into operation in 2016-30 under the Revised Master Plan VII accounts for approximately 46% of the nation’s total power supply. Because of Vietnam’s rising economic activity, the total capacity of coal-fired power plants is set to increase from 33.3% in 2015 to 43.1% in 2020 and to 48.7% in 2025. However, between 2025 and 2030 it is projected to decrease to 44.5%. As the data suggests, power plants fuelled by coal will play a key role in ensuring future energy supply until approximately 2025, but then usage will trend downward from 2030 onwards. Another key point highlighted in the Revised Master Plan VII is promoting renewable energy and increasing the proportion of electricity produced from renewable energy by 2030.
The 27,000-MW renewable energy target, which includes small hydro power, wind power, solar energy and biomass, will account for 21% of the national power supply. We anticipate that the total capacity of renewable energy sources put into operation between 2016 and 2030 will be above 25,000 MW, or about 26.2% of new installed capacity. This includes both a 6000-MW wind-generated power project and a 12,000-MW solar power project.
In what way is renewable energy considered in future investment priorities?
THANH: EVN plans to research and develop new power sources to contribute to the green power initiative throughout the country, evaluating pricing and finding the most optimal cost and work efficiency in order to advise the government on how to issue development plans for solar and renewable energy production. When talking about wind power projects, EVN has started using Official Development Assistance loans from the German government for phase one of the Phu Lac project, also in Binh Thuan. This project has a capacity of 24 MW, and has been operating since September 2016. In addition, we are preparing and arranging investments in the province of Ninh Thuan for the Loi Hai plant 1, which has a capacity of 30 MW. For solar power, EVN and its affiliates intends to invest in development plans for the central highlands, south-central and the southern regions of the country. Those locations have been prioritised by the parties due to the need for more power in those.Indian Wells R1: Dominika Cibulkova vs (Q) Katerina Siniakova
Dominika Cibulkova is one of the most dangerous unseeded players in the draw at the 2016 BNP Paribas Open. The Slovakian arrives in California is good form after a run to the final in Acapulco a couple of weeks ago. Cibulkova faces Czech qualifier Katerina Siniakova in her opening match of the tournament on Wednesday afternoon. The winner of this mat h will face the third seeded Agnieszka Radwanska in the second round.
Cibulkova continues to show signs of improvement after a poor Australian summer. Dominika reached the final at Acapulco where she was on the losing end of a 3-hour epic against Sloane Stephens in what was the greatest final of the season thus far. However, Cibulkova was unable to keep her run going in Monterrey, suffering a straight set loss Anett Kontaveit in her opening match of the event (perhaps suffering physically from a long week in Acapulco). Interestingly, Dominika doesn’t have any points to defend from now until Eastbourne, meaning that the Slovakian has a great chance to dramatically improve her current ranking of number 57 in the world. Cibulkova is a former quarter-finalist in the Californian desert, reaching the final 8 in 2014.
Katerina Siniakova stormed through the qualifying draw at the BNP Paribas Open over the past couple of days. The Czech dropped a total of 6 games on route to recording straight set wins over Raveena Kingsley and Julia Boserup. The problem for Siniakova is that she has not won a main draw match since Shenzhen (the only tournament that she has recorded main draw victories this season).
This will be the first career meeting between the pair. I highly doubt that Siniakova has the confidence or the composure that is required to truly test a determined Cibulkova on this occasion. I do expect this to be a competitive match though, Siniakova certainly has potential and has the advantage of coming through qualifying and therefore already playing a couple of matches to get used to the conditions. Ultimately, Dominika should be too good and should set up a blockbuster second round clash with Agnieszka Radwanska.Commissioned Works
If you would like to commission a painting by me, I enjoy doing portraits, totems (or animals you have a special relationship with), seascapes, landscapes and abstract art. Paintings are done in oil on cotton or linen canvas, or with watercolor on paper and take 4 – 6 months from commission to delivery.
SORRY, MY COMMISSION SLATE IS FULL and I am not accepting any new commissions at this time. Please email me if you would like to be placed on my waitlist.
The commission process starts with you providing me with photos (at least three) of what you have in mind and a description of what you would like – via email. If I feel a connection to your vision (and perhaps I have suggestions), we will then decide on the size and a 30% deposit is required.
I then do a very basic sketch, just to show my basic ideas, placement, cropping, size, etc. and upon your approval, I begin painting. You are not allowed to see the painting until I am finished. Why? Because doing a commissioned painting is a spiritual process for me.
I connect with your soul and I paint what YOU need, or what would delight your soul. So my paintings are not just about creating a pleasing image. There is an alchemy to them, that either speaks to your soul, or gives you support for the next steps on your soul’s journey. I didn’t decide to paint this way. I just began doing commissions and this is what happened.
One client walked in the door, looked at her painting, and burst into tears. The painting was a landscape that depicted the difficult time she’d been going through, but also the magic that awaited her if she kept going – and how it was ALL good, because together the crags and the flow created a beautiful painting.
I felt a bit ‘iffy’ about a painting I did for another client’s husband (a gift from her to him) – an interpretation of Ganesh – because I knew it would spiritually challenge him. And I wasn’t sure he was ready for it. I explained this to his wife when I shipped it and told her not to be surprised if he didn’t want to hang it up yet. I advised her to just be patient and when he’s ready he will put the painting up. Turns out he loved it on sight.
If this sounds like the kind of art you’d like to enjoy, just email me and we’ll get things rolling!
Price
Prices for oil paintings start at $1200.00 for a 20″x24″ (unframed, but my canvases have 1.5″ thick sides, so don’t really need framing) and increase with size to a maximum of 48″x60″. Price includes Ground Courier shipping within the continental USA or Canada.
Prices for watercolors start at $700 for an 11″x14″ and increase with size to maximum of 18″x24″. Price includes Ground Courier shipping within the continental USA or Canada.
A 30% deposit is required upon commission.
SORRY, MY COMMISSION SLATE IS FULL and I am not accepting any new commissions at this time. Please email me if you would like to be placed on my waitlist.
Guarantee
If you do not LOVE the finished painting, after I send you a photo of the finished work, you do not have to purchase it and I will refund your deposit 100%. Art is a joyous process that involves a connection of souls and I would never want you to pay for a painting that you didn’t absolutely adore and value deeply. Because I do not deem a painting finished until I love it so much I’d be happy for you to refuse it – you do not need to feel bad for not wanting it! Believe me, if a painting was ever refused, I would be truly happy to keep it.
Prints & Giclees
I also have a few of my paintings available to purchase as prints or giclees (printed on canvas), or even as a greeting card. So if you’re on a budget, check out my prints…
Hola! I’ve been reading your web site for a long time now and

Austin Tx! Just wanted to say keep up the excellent job!Narrative-driven gaming specialist Telltale Games is coming back from the dead - though with only the name, part of its back catalogue, and two people who have never worked at or with the company before at the helm.
Telltale Games was known for its narrative-focused gaming titles, many of which were based on popular - and expensive-to-licence - franchises like Minecraft, Game of Thrones, Guardians of the Galaxy, Batman, and The Walking Dead. Sadly, it turned out that there's only so big a market for quick-time-event story games, and the inclusion of ever-more licences simply fractured an already niche market: In September 2018 the company announced its effective closure, 14 years after it had been founded by LucasArts alumni Kevin Bruner, Dan Connors, and Troy Molander; plans to keep running with a tiny skeleton crew of 25, chosen from its high water mark of 400 staff, came to naught, and the company officially shuttered.
The company has now announced its emergence from the ashes, but in a manner that will likely cause the company's fans unease: It has been acquired and will be re-launched by two people who have never worked at or with the original Telltale Games before: Jamie Ottilie and Brian Waddle.
'All of us were big fans of the games Telltale created, as we strongly believe in games as a storytelling medium and nobody did it better,' claims Ottilie, who will serve as the chief executive of the reborn have little in common with its original incarnation, however: It is to be headquartered in Malibu, with Ottilie and Waddle operating the company personally. While the pair claim to have 'hired or contracted [...] key talent from the original company,' Polygon claims that Ottlie stated in a brief interview that only 'some workers from the original Telltale Games will be offered freelance roles' and that the company isn't in a position to offer full-time employment just yet.
The new Telltale Games has also confirmed plans to make use of the old Telltale Games' back catalogue of titles, many of which were removed from sale when the company closed. It hasn't yet named any specific titles, however, and it may struggle to bring back some of the more popular games: Licensing agreements are likely to have terminated when Telltale Games closed the first time around, while Skybound Games took over The Walking Dead itself to bring the story to a conclusion.

WEDNESDAY, Oct. 6, 2021 (HealthDay News) -- Iron is vital to health, and too little in your diet might lead to heart disease, European researchers report.
They said about 1 in 10 new cases of heart disease in middle-aged people might be prevented if they had sufficient levels of iron in their diets.
"Our findings are based on an observational study and can therefore only report on associations, not on causality," said lead researcher Dr. Benedikt Schrage.
"This being said, our findings indicate that iron deficiency might be a suitable target for preventive measures in the general population and support the conduction of trials which explore the efficacy of iron supplementation in individuals with functional iron deficiency," said Schrage, of the general and interventional cardiology department at University Medical Center in Hamburg, Germany.
The connection between iron deficiency and heart disease isn't clear. But iron is essential for equilibrium in the body and energy metabolism, which might be a potential link, Schrage said.
People who are deficient in iron usually don't consume enough of the mineral in their diet or can't process the iron they do get, he said. Iron-rich foods include meat; poultry; eggs; seafood, including tuna, scallops and shrimp; vegetables such as spinach and sweet potatoes, and beans, according to the American Red Cross. Other good dietary sources include enriched breads and pasta, and fruits like strawberries and watermelon.
"Iron supplementation per se plays a minor role, as long as the overall uptake is sufficient," Schrage said. "However, some individuals might not be able to absorb enough iron via the intestines. For these individuals, intravenous iron therapy might be an option."
Earlier studies have found that iron-deficient patients with cardiovascular diseases are more likely than others to be hospitalized or die. Giving intravenous iron improved symptoms, function and quality of life in heart failure patients with iron deficiency, the researchers noted.
The current study included more than 12,000 European men and women with a median age of 59. Over roughly 13 years, the researchers looked for heart disease and stroke, death due to cardiovascular disease and death from any cause.
At the study's start, almost two-thirds of the participants had what's called functional iron deficiency. This means they have enough iron, but not enough in the blood for the body to work properly, Schrage said. These individuals were more likely to develop heart disease and were also more likely to die during the next 13 years, he said.
During follow-up, 18% of the participants died, 5% of them from cardiovascular disease. Also, 9% were diagnosed with heart disease and 6% with stroke.
Iron deficiency was tied to a 24% higher risk of heart disease, a 26% increased risk of dying from cardiovascular disease and a 12% higher risk of dying from any cause, compared with no iron deficiency, the researchers found.
When Schrage and his colleagues calculated the effect of iron deficiency over 10 years, they found that 5% of all deaths, 12% of cardiovascular deaths and 11% of new heart disease diagnoses could be attributed to iron deficiency.
But don't rush out and buy iron supplements just yet, according to a heart expert not involved with the study.
Dr. Gregg Fonarow, director of the Ahmanson-UCLA Cardiomyopathy Center, said there is mixed evidence about the connection between iron and heart disease.
"There is clinical trial evidence which demonstrates patients with heart failure and iron deficiency derive benefit from intravenous iron treatment," he said. "There is no comparable data supporting oral iron supplementation in heart failure."
For heart disease, the findings so far regarding iron levels and risk are complex, said Fonarow.
"Both iron deficiency and iron overload have been associated with increased coronary heart disease event risk," he noted.
People shouldn't supplement their iron intake to ward off heart disease, he said.
"Further studies and, ultimately, prospective randomized trials are needed before treatment with any form of iron should be considered for modification of the risk of coronary heart disease," Fonarow said.
The report was published Oct. 6 in the journal ESC Heart Failure.

It's about balance really. That article is a little extreme and the author seems threatened. I agree that wonder can be found everywhere.

Balance, yes. But first some solid commitment and values. Ive never known anyone to have such a negative reaction to Louv, his book, his work. And so the essay is provocative simply in its opportunity to consider another perspective-- I so take for granted that people, parents especially, will be willing to support and promote their childrens relationship to the natural world. Seeing as the sustainability of our planet relies on those relationships, and all. So now we have a widely published and read article accusing Louv of fundamentalism. Yikes! But maybe also: Yeah! Because, if we are prompted to engage in increased dialogue about what we want for our children and communities, thats just gotta be a good thing. Thanks for all youre doing to inspire people to engage.

Also commonly referred to as a secured loan, this involves putting up property such as a savings account, home, piece of equipment or watch as a guarantee of remuneration. In the case that you fail to make your payments, the loaner may seize whatever you used as security. Collateral loans Springfield MA are different from unsecured loans (credit card, student loan, personal loan, etcetera) and have a few advantages over them.
1. They Are Easier To Obtain
Since the creditor is ensured reimbursement of some form regardless of whether you can make the owed payments or not, it is often easier to qualify for a secured loan. If you have a poor credit score or a sparse credit history, you have a better chance of securing a collateral loan than an unsecured one which may have stricter requirements. For this reason, this type of loan is also a good stepping stone for building your score and financial credibility.
2. They Typically Come With Lower Interest Rates
This is also due to the reasoning mentioned above. Collateral loans are regarded as carrying less risk for financiers in general. As a result, lenders may be willing to show leniency and charge lower interest rates.
3. They Often Have Higher Upper Limits
You may also be able to acquire a higher value loan with collateral. The creditor has a way to regain the loaned funds and may thus be more inclined to provide more funds than if they did not have this assurance.
Secured loans may take longer to apply for than unsecured ones and they do come with the possibility of losing property. However, they are also generally easier to get, particularly if you lack a good credit background and may offer more resources and smaller interest rates.This Toy Gun Makes 350 (Clean) Spitballs From One Roll Of Toilet Paper
Date Published: 01/09/2020 2:20 PM.
Aptly named the Toilet Paper Blaster Skid Shot, the toy gun spit ball shooter works by simply attaching a roll of toilet paper to the side of the gun and feeding in the first bit of toilet paper into the slot, then just add water into the container on top of the gun.
To fire it, pull back on the lever to feed toilet paper into the gun, then pull back on the handle to cock it and moisten the toilet paper with the (clean) water, and pull the trigger to launch the spit ball.
When you attach a full roll of toilet paper to the spit-ball gun, you'll be able to create up to 350 spit balls. The spit-ball gun requires not batteries, it includes 3 cut-out targets to practice your aim with, and works best with 2-ply toilet paper.

A new book on the life of Teko Modise gives rare insight into the muti rituals performed at Orlando Pirates.
The biography‚ The Curse of Teko Modise‚ details midnight baths on the eve of games that it is asserted Modise and his teammates took part in when the former Bafana Bafana playmaker played for Pirates between 2007 and 2011.
“There was a lot to get used to at Orlando Pirates. One of the most interesting things was the role of muti‚” the book asserts.
“….”
When new rituals would not work “the sangoma would revert to the classic ritual – the bath.
The players would be woken up at midnight before a game and made to bath in water mixed with a specially prepared concoction of herbs and other ingredients.
“Many players were religious and these practices made them uncomfortable.
"However‚ at Orlando Pirates everything is performed as a team. Religious or not‚ you get in the bath.
“The players would bath in a special mixture‚ then shower‚ climb back into bed and try to sleep before the game.
.
“‘The water was very black‚’ Teko recalls. ‘You have no idea what is in there. You could see some sticks and leaves but who knows what else was in there. It would be very itchy‚ very strange’.
“The biggest problem was when they had to play at night.
"As they could not dry off their jerseys would be damp‚ their socks would be damp and they would become very cold and uncomfortable.”

No one knows for sure whether the election results will lead the country to a better future or worse.
“The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born,” Italian thinker Antonio Gramsci once said. Three decades after the downfall of the Marcos dictatorship, which left deep and lasting wounds on an impoverished nation, the Filipino people are once again clamouring for “change”.
Amid a zeitgeist of “grievance politics“, a significant number of Filipinos have voted for “outside the box” candidates who have openly questioned the utility and wisdom of existing democratic institutions in the country.
Fed up with empty promises, and suffering from one of the highest rates of poverty and unemployment in Asia, the Philippine electorate has voted into power a curious mixture of political outsiders (PDF).
Exit polls suggest the country has elected its first self-described “socialist” as a president. Rodrigo Duterte, the tough-talking and iconoclastic mayor of the provincial city of Davao, has claimed a landslide victory by capturing more than five million votes over his nearest rival in the Philippines’ single-round presidential elections.
It was a polite, democratic slap in the face of the oligarchic establishment, which has ravaged a highly promising nation for decades.
After having raised expectations to stratospheric levels, however, the incoming Duterte administration faces an uphill battle in satisfying an impatient, exhausted, and polarised citizenry.
The Philippines has entered a new period of uncertainty, with hopes of radical change flying along fears of democratic backsliding.
Without question, this has been the most polarised election campaign in modern Philippine history. Until the final hours of the campaign period, leading candidates, during their speeches, adopted a highly pugnacious language against their opponents.
The Duterte camp, which effortlessly managed to gather hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic supporters, saw the firebrand mayor promising radical change and an end to oligarchic rule.
His closest opponent, former interior secretary Mar Roxas, the anointed successor of the outgoing President Benigno Aquino, promised to fight for democracy against the supposed impending threat of dictatorship under Duterte.
Contrary to the Western media coverage, Duterte is no Donald Trump, although both of them have gained international notoriety for uttering highly controversial statements.
No less than the incumbent president called upon reformist camps, led by Mar Roxas and neophyte Senator Grace Poe, to unify against Duterte, who hasn’t been shy about mentioning dictatorship, abolishing of congress, and a whole host of controversial statements in the past months.
It was a clash of narratives, raising fears of massive election-related fraud and violence.
To the delight of everyone, however, the Commission on Elections, which has always been a favourite target of media critics and opposition candidates, managed to pull off arguably the most peaceful, credible, and transparent elections in Philippine history.
The only wrinkle in the picture could be the vice presidential race, which is separately contested.
It has been neck-and-neck between Ferdinand “Bong Bong” Marcos Jr, the sole son of the former dictator, and Leni Robredo, the widow of one of the most revered statesmen in Philippine history, Jesse Robredo.
READ MORE:The contradictions of Rodrigo Duterte
Most experts believe that Leni Robredo, who has been described as a social-democratic legislator, is tipped to become the second most powerful official in the country.
Unwilling to concede, Marcos has flirted with the possibility of launching a formal complaint after shedding doubt on the credibility of the elections.
In many ways, the Philippines is poised to elect its first left-leaning government, led by two former provincial officials, Duterte and Robredo.
Though extremely different in their demeanours and views on democracy, both figures are political outsiders par excellence – reflecting the depth of popular discontent with mainstream candidates.
Similar to Latin America in recent decades, the Philippines, a former Spanish colony, seems to be lurching to the left, with voters booting out conservative-centrist candidates from the upper echelons of power.
In the senate race, for instance, Risa Hontiveros, a long-time leftist activist, managed to make it to the “magic 12” circle of new incoming upper-house legislators.
OPINION: The Philippines’ autocratic nostalgia
Contrary to the Western media coverage, Duterte is no Donald Trump, although both of them have gained international notoriety for uttering highly controversial statements.
But unlike the real estate mogul, Duterte is not just some “reality show” star. For two decades, he oversaw, with an “iron fist”, the transformation of the Hobbesian city of Davao into one of the safest and most prosperous in the country.
Starting with limited resources, but overseeing an astute social media blitzkrieg, Duterte gradually managed to outgun his well-heeled opponents by presenting himself as the only “authentic” candidate with requisite political will to end decades of incompetent and corrupt leadership in the country.
He captured the imagination of peripheral regions such as Mindanao and Visayas by promising an end to the reign of “imperial Manila”, giving more political autonomy and fiscal resources to the provinces.
He built a strong base among the upper and middle classes by promising a swift end to crime and corruption, not to mention Manila’s grinding traffic.
The challenge for Duterte, however, is to make a speedy and steady transition from a campaign-trail candidate, loose cannon on rhetoric and bumper sticker in policy proposals, into a sleek and “statesmanly’ president with tangible solutions to the country’s myriad problems.
Bringing together a cabinet filled with seasoned technocrats and new faces, Duterte seems to be beginning to rally support and sympathy from both markets and the civil society.
Amid ongoing disputes in the South China Sea, he has also sought better relations with powerful neighbours such as China. A new era awaits the Philippines, but no one knows for sure whether it is for better or worse..Secret Hearts # 83

The South Shore Breaker
It was a demonstration she had seen during Fire Prevention Week as an elementary school student that initially sparked Amber Barkhouse’s interest in becoming a volunteer firefighter with the Cornwall and District Fire Department in Lunenburg County.
“The chief who was there for a very long time, Johnny Yates, he put on Fire Prevention Week (activities) for years and he always made it interesting for kids and the first time I decided I wanted to be part of the fire department was when he brought his smoke machine in and put us in a small room and showed us how to be down low below the smoke if we were ever in a fire,” said Barkhouse in an interview.
Barkhouse comes from a family of volunteer firefighters. Her father has been a member of the Cornwall and District Fire Department for some 26 years and his two uncles were founding members of the department.
At 16, she officially joined the ranks and has since completed her medical first responders training and while she can’t enter burning buildings until she completes her level one fire training, Barkhouse “helps out the best I can” on fire calls.
Now 18 and graduated from Parkview Education Centre, Barkhouse has been recognized for her dedication to the fire service and the community. On Aug. 5, she was presented with the Canadian Volunteer Fire Service Association (CVFSA) Don McKee and Jim Hayter Memorial Scholarships. It was the first time both scholarships were presented to the same recipient.
“We’re pretty proud of her,” said retired fire chief Steve Patterson.
Barkhouse intends to pursue a career in enforcement as a fisheries officer. This fall she will be taking the Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC) fisheries program at the Shelburne Campus and after graduating there, plans to take a two-year wildlife conservation program at Holland College in P.E.I, and then she'll be off to Saskatchewan for her policing program.
Barkhouse has been working at the Northfield Poultry processing plant for the summer. In her free time, Barkhouse says she likes to go fishing, four wheeling and horseback riding.
“I’ve been riding since I was six,” she said. “I still ride at least once a week whenever I can get over to the barn (Red Pine Stables). It’s one of my free time resets.”
She also farms and grows meat birds.
“I like to be outside.”
Barkhouse was also involved in competitive Olympic style wrestling while in high school until COVID-19 hit. She holds the Nova Scotia Schools Athletic Federation (NSSAF) 2020 Senior Wrestling Championship title for 90kg.
Barkhouse was supposed to compete in the North American Indigenous Games this summer in Halifax, which was cancelled due to the pandemic. Where wrestling is a “close and personal” contact sport, when it makes a comeback remains to be seen, said Barkhouse.
Barkhouse recently took part in a question and answer session:

Q. What’s your greatest indulgence?
A. Eating ice cream.
Q. What is your favourite movie or book?

Posted in Australia, Photography Tagged broncs, bulls, cowboy, Jindabyne, rodeo, Snowy Mountains, Tumbarumba Leave a commentTaking time off from his crusade against Turkey Twizzlers, Jamie Oliver has turned road tester by taking the new Range Rover Evoque onto the streets of London.
In fact, the celebrity chef's foray onto the streets of the capital actually marked one of the first times that someone outside the company has driven the new baby Range Rover. He hasn't completely given up on food though, because Oliver's drive took in some of his favourite London foodie spots to pick up ingredients to create the city’s best veggie burger.
Much like his 'Naked Chef' days, Oliver visited Brick Lane, stopping at Taj Stores for spices and yoghurt and Beigel Bake to collect bread rolls, and he put the car well and truly through its paces by taking a shortcut through Bishopsgate Goods Yard, wading through water pools and taking the car across a series of ramps through the tunnels.
Parking wasn't an issue for the small-big car, thanks to its ClearSight Rear View feature, which turns the rear-view mirror into an HD screen to give an unrestricted view of what’s behind the vehicle.
"I absolutely love this car, it was so much fun to drive on the busy streets of London and through the water trough in the Bishopsgate tunnels," said Jamie Oliver. "I’ve always loved Land Rover and I had a brilliant time designing my cooking car last year, so when I was asked to come and test out the new Evoque, I jumped at the chance."
"The fact that Land Rover can create something as versatile as the Discovery and as agile as the Evoque is such a testament to this brilliant British brand."
To Open or Not to Open…That Is The Question
And so it goes every year: Black Friday sales that begin at even more extreme hours of the day (and night). Some mega-stores open at midnight on Thanksgiving with promises of super discounts, others open bright and early at 5:00 AM on Friday morning with “door-buster” sales.
For some consumers, these late night / early morning sales are a part of their Thanksgiving tradition. They get all of their Christmas shopping out of the way, and score some good deals. Frankly, I never saw the appeal in this mad rush to shop, as I like to sleep in on Black Friday, eating leftovers and watching bad TV in a happy tryptophan-induced coma. But I digress.
However, some retailers are kicking off their “Black Friday” sales on Thanksgiving Day proper.
Can we attribute this to the fact that, according to a Deloitte survey, 25% of Americans said they planned to shop on Thanksgiving Day this year? Or maybe it’s because the 2013 holiday shopping season (from Black Friday to Christmas) is 6 days shorter than last year.
Whatever the reason, it has some consumers worried that they’ll miss the best deals if they wait until Friday to shop. It has others claiming these mega-stores are forcing consumerism into what should be a day of family and rest.
Huffington Post recently published an article entitled, “Costco, Nordstrom Refuse to Ruin Thanksgiving,” which outlines various retail practices on or around Black Friday. Nordstrom’s tradition is to reveal their holiday displays on Black Friday proper, and places like Costco or BJ’s Wholesale don’t see a worthwhile amount of customer turnout on Thanksgiving to warrant being open. Some companies just want to give their employees a much-needed day off.
Whether you’re a retailer or a consumer, what you’re doing on Thanksgiving Day is based on what’s most important to you. It’s that simple.
If what’s most important to you (as a consumer) is that you get that flat screen TV at the lowest possible price (no judgment), then you might have to choose between turkey time and time spent in line at Best Buy on Thanksgiving.
And if, as a retailer, your priority is moving product before the end of the year, and making up for a poor 3rd quarter, then opening a little earlier on Friday (or even Thursday night) could be a fiscally responsible move.
It’s quite the hot topic this year. How is your business approaching it?As part of the drawdown process from Afghanistan, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III approved a plan to transfer authority from Army Gen. Austin S. Miller to Marine Corps Gen. Frank McKenzie, Pentagon Press Secretary John F. Kirby said today.
Miller is the commander of U.S. Forces-Afghanistan and the Resolute Support Mission. McKenzie is the commander of U.S. Central Command.
This is all part of the safe and orderly retrograde that will have all U.S. troops out of Afghanistan by the end of August â€” well within President Joe Biden’s order. “We expect that transfer to be effective later this month,” Kirby said. “General Miller will remain in theater in coming weeks to prepare for and to complete the turnover of these duties and responsibilities to General McKenzie.”
Kirby emphasized that McKenzie will retain all existing authorities that Miller currently possesses and commander of U.S. Forces, Afghanistan. “He will continue to exercise authority over the conduct of any and all counterterrorism operations needed to protect the homeland from threats emanating out of Afghanistan, and he will lead U.S. efforts to develop options for the logistical, financial and technical support to Afghan forces once our drawdown is complete.”
This process will allow the United States to maintain a diplomatic presence within Afghanistan, as U.S. and Afghan leaders hash out the new bilateral relationship between the nations. The bottom line for the United States is to ensure Afghanistan never becomes a haven for groups that wish to launch attacks on the homeland.
Austin also approved establishing U.S. Forces Afghanistan to be led by Navy Rear Adm. Peter Vasely in Kabul. Army Brig. Gen. Curtis Buzzard will lead the Defense Security Cooperation Management Office, Afghanistan that will support Vasely.
Buzzard’s office is based in Qatar. That office will provide funding for the Afghan National Defense and Security forces to include over the horizon aircraft maintenance support.
Kirby confirmed U.S. forces have left Bagram Airfield. Kirby called this a key milestone in the drawdown process.285 EUROS?

I look down the leash. There sits a solid dog with
thick legs, a cinder-block head, and a chest bigger than
a mailbox, a very happy look on its face.
"Yes ma'am," I reply. "That's what they
say. Noodles sure looks like a happy dog. How old is
she?"
A
working dog should fit inside a
mailbox, not have a chest as big as one.
Some variation of this conversation invariably takes
place when I go to an AKC go-to-ground trial with my two
terriers - a small female Jack Russell and a large male
Border Terrier.
At one time or another in these conversations, I have
been told that hunting terriers need long legs to
"follow the horses" and that "short legs
are needed for a dog to be able to go to
ground." I have been told that certain breeds
have huge heads and jaws "in order to kill
badgers," and that dramatically elongated heads
"set the eyes far enough back that they can't be
bitten by a fox." I have been told that
"colored dogs will get ripped up by fox
hounds," and that the solid coated Border terrier is
"the last true hunting terrier." And
again and again I have been told that, "the British
fox is much larger than the ones we have here in
America".
I listen, but I don't believe much of it anymore.
In truth, very few terrier owners hunt their dogs, and
most terrier owners have never seen a fox much less a fox
den. In this increasingly urban world it is a lucky
accident if the average terrier manages to nail a rat,
field mouse or mole. Such accidental take is not the
specialized work that terriers were bred to do,
however. As Captain Jocelyn Lucas notes in Hunt
and Working Terriers (1931): "Working
terriers means, in sporting parlance, a terrier that will
go to ground on fox, badger, or otter, and not merely a
dog that will kill rats or hunt out
rabbits."
Badger and otter hunting with terriers has been illegal
in England for nearly 30 years, however, and it looks
like fox hunting will soon follow. If Jocelyn Lucas
were alive today, he would be standing in a visa line
waiting to come to the U.S., where red fox, gray fox,
groundhog, possum and raccoon are in abundance and where
badger and nutria can also be worked in some
states.
If you want to hunt in America, all you need is a proper
dog.
A Proper Dog
A "proper dog," of course, is harder to get
than it sounds.
For one thing, almost all the dogs you see at Kennel Club
shows are too big to actually work. In fact, this
appears to be true in Great Britain as well where most
hunt terriers are small ununregistered Jack Russells,
patterdale-type fell terriers, crosses, or dogs of
pedigree unknown. The naturally small
Kennel Club breeds that do exist rarely see hunt service
as they are likely to have other failings as far as the
hunter is concerned -- lack of gameness, lack of nose,
lack of voice, or lack of judgment, to name just four
common faults.
While nose, voice, gameness and judgment are all
important attributes of a working terrier, no attribute
is more critical than size.
If a dog cannot get down a hole, nothing else matters.
Perversely, however, while size is the one characteristic
of a hunting terrier that is easily measurable in the
show ring, it is also the one attribute of a working
terrier that is most shrouded in misrepresentation and
ambiguity.
Consider the Border Terrier, for example: the
American Kennel Club standard for the breed says
"the body should be capable of being spanned by a
man's hands behind the shoulders."
This is a ridiculously imprecise measurement. Which man's
hands? Does this mean there can be no women
judges? And if the average man can span a 19-inch
dog, does this mean such a dog is actually capable of
going to ground in a natural earth? Finally, if the
standard for the Border Terrier is supposed to reflect
the requirements of a working dog, why is the entire
shoulder and chest area of the Border Terrier a
clear determinant of whether a dog can actually go to
ground -- afforded only 10 points out of a possible
100?
Walter Gardner, in his book, About the Border Terrier,
notes that the earlier border, which was bred for
work rather than exhibition, was certainly smaller than
many borders we see today, and describes Jacob
Robsons Flint, one of the most famous working
border terriers, as weighing just 12 pounds.
The typically show-ring border terrier we see today
weighs half again as much and has a chest span of about
17 inches.
The fact that chest span is given such short shrift in
the show ring is hardly surprising when one considers
that many people think a dog has proven its worth if it
can merely shove its head and shoulders into a den
entrance.
In fact, a true working dog should be able to enter a fox
den or groundhog sette and negotiate the entire pipe
from main entrance to bolt hole -- without having
to be dug out of the ground. In a natural earth
this den pipe will be 15 to 40 feet long and will rise
and fall, twist and contract, challenging the dog at
every turn.
A dog that routinely fails this challenge is not a useful
dog. In fact, hunting with a large dog that cannot
get past the first turn is nearly impossible, as it
requires a team of diggers to sink a new hole whenever
the tunnel changes direction, and in the end you may end
up excavating the entire length of the den.
A large dog in a small hole is also a danger to
himself. A terrier that has to dig hard in order to
move up a tunnel is a dog that has to push dirt behind it
in order to make progress. As earth is shoved to
the rear, a dirt wall can easily form just behind the
dog, "bottling" it off from its air
supply. Because a digging dog is working hard and
breathing hard (as is the quarry) asphyxiation
underground is a very real possibility.
A small dog, on the other hand, can simply scoot over
small dirt mounds and around constrictions and
obstacles. Not only will such a dog face the quarry
with more energy and more air, it will also have room to
maneuver to avoid a bite and force a bolt. A larger
dog, on the other hand, may find itself face to face with
the quarry, jammed tight in the pipe, already tired, and
with a dwindling air supply. Only tragedy can come
out of such a situation.
A Fox is Not a Coyote
Ken James, who hunts his Wills View pack of Jack Russell
terriers in the mountains and farm country of Western
Pennsylvania, has measured the chest size of a wide range
of terrier quarry. His conclusion is that any dog
with a chest larger than 14 inches around is going to
have a very difficult time.

Hunter's Story
What is fascinating about these measurements is how
clearly they demonstrate a simple fact: the chest
size of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is almost exactly the
same as that of the North American groundhog or woodchuck
(Marmota monax).
Many Kennel Club terrier owners find this hard to
believe, and some argue that the fox dens they have seen
have larger entrances than the average groundhog
sette.
This last point is true, but only for the first three or
four feet of a red fox den. Here, at the front
entrance, the fox excavates the groundhog hole into a
vertical oval so that it can bolt out of the den at a
trot. Farther back from this first three or four
feet of excavation, however, a groundhog sette is
generally left as it was found, with a fox able to exit
the same carefully disguised bolt hole the groundhog once
provided for himself.

Fox
Wasco Taxidermy Mount Manikin, 14 inch chest
When confronted with measurements of American red fox
chests, some American terrier owners will argue that the
North American red fox is a different species than its
European counterpart and therefore must have a smaller
den.
This is simply not so.
The red fox is an import, brought to the United States in
the 1600s because the native gray fox would climb trees
when chased by men on horses. British redcoats,
anxious to continue their fox hunting tradition in the
New World, brought with them the quarry they required for
their sport, and the red fox flourished as forests fell
to fields. Not only are there more red fox in
America today than at any other point in history, there
are also more groundhogs, more gray fox, more raccoon and
more possums all due to changing habitat which
worked to encourage more of these agricultural
opportunists.
In both England and the United States the size of the red
fox is quite variable, with larger animals generally
found in the north, and smaller animals in the
south. In The Working Terrier British
terrierman D. Brian Plummer notes that he has caught fox
as small as 6 pounds and as large as 20 pounds but that
"the average weight for adult fox is roughly 14
pounds, and vixens are usually smaller than
dogs."
In his book, How to Spot a Fox, J. David Henry
notes that the average adult red fox in the U.S. ranges
from 5.5 to 12 pounds in southern states and between 11
and 20 pounds in northern states. Henry reports
that in Great Britain the red fox ranges from 11 to 16.5
pounds for dogs and from 10 to 14.5 pounds for
vixens.
In short, the British and American red fox are exactly
the same creature and they are exactly the same size,
with foxes on both continents having a mean size of 10 to
14 pounds.
It should be said that a 12-pound fox is not built like a
14-pound dog, but like a 12-pound tabby, with a tiny
chest, and bones that seem almost elastic. Fox
biologist J. David Henry, in fact has entitled one of his
books, Red Fox: The Catlike Canid in order to
stress both the morphological similarity of the cat and
the fox, and their nearly parallel hunting styles.
A 14-pound dog will find it difficult to follow a 10 or
12-pound fox to ground in a tight earth because, in all
likelihood, a dog this large will have a chest that is at
least 2 inches too big.
The dog you need in the field has a chest span of under
14 inches and will probably stand little more than 12
inches tall at the shoulder and weigh in at 9 to 12
pounds a mere shadow of the dogs we typically see
winning in the show ring.
A dog this small can follow a fox to ground and negotiate
the average groundhog den with relative ease they
are, after all the same-sized sette.
This last fact seems to disappoint some terrier
owners. Perhaps this is due to the anglophile
streak we see among many terrier owners a
glorification of all things British, with a latent
suggestion that American dogs and American quarry
must somehow be inferior. The royalist image of
wealthy redcoats riding to fox is, after all, more
attractive than that that offered by the American
terrierman slogging through pastures dressed in overalls
with a sharp spade over one shoulder.
That said, the terriers needed by both parties are
exactly the same, and a proper dog for red fox is also a
proper dog for groundhog, gray fox, and raccoon.
The fact that the majority of Kennel Club dogs on both
continents cannot make it in the field has less to do
with changing quarry or changing geography than it does
with show ring standards that cloud the issue of size
while at the same time giving the bulk of all show ring
points to such non-essential characteristics as eye
color, nose color, the lay of the ears and the carriage
of the tail.
The good news is that even as England and Scotland move
to ban fox hunting with dogs, hunting with terriers is
beginning to take hold here in America.
While the best days of the British working terrier may
lay in the past, the best days of the American working
terrier lie immediately ahead. Those that would
prefer to work their dogs in the real world, rather than
fantasize about the nature of working dogs in a far off
land, need only find a small terrier out of working stock
to start their journey.

Latest entry is a distinct comedown after its immediate predecessor, the smashingly exciting “Star Trek: First Contact,” which marked the feature helming debut of series regular Jonathan Frakes. Even though Frakes is back, “Star Trek: Insurrection” plays less like a stand-alone sci-fi adventure than like an expanded episode of “Star Trek: The Next Generation.” Still, new item strikes a deft balance of predictable heroics and quirky humor to ensure respectable if not spectacular theatrical biz. Down the road. pic should live long and prosper in ancillary venues.
Even longtime Trekkers may be confused by the frenetic opening sequence, which has the android Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) inexplicably running amok during a Federation-sponsored cultural-survey mission. Very soon, however, “Insurrection” reveals the method behind Data’s seeming madness.
The Ba’ku, the peaceful inhabitants of an idyllic planet, are in clear and present danger of forced relocation, thanks to an ends-justify-means alliance between Federation leaders and their new allies, the aging Son’a. Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) leads the Enterprise crew to the Ba’ku planet, hoping to capture his android ally before Data is eliminated by the combined Federation and Son’a forces. This cues the film’s funniest sequence, in which Picard tries to regain Data’s trust by prompting a Gilbert & Sullivan karaoke sing-along.
Once on the Ba’ku planet, Picard discovers that the 600 or so inhabitants are sweet-natured Luddites who rejected advanced technology centuries ago and, thanks to the metaphasic radiation permeating their planet, remain eternally youthful. Picard and his fellow officers begin to enjoy the same benefits from this natural phenomenon as they stay on the planet.
The age-reversal magic is a mixed blessing for the Enterprise crew. Cmdr. Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Lt. Cmdr. Troi (Marina Siritis) are inspired to get frisky in a candle-lit bath, while Lt. Cmdr. La Forge (LeVar Burton) finally develops the ability to see without high-tech enhancement. On the other hand, Lt. Cmdr. Worf (Michael Dorn), the Klingon officer on temporary reassignment from Deep Space Nine, develops a nasty case of Klingon pimples. And Picard is briefly seized with an uncontrollable urge to mambo. No kidding.
Ru’afro (F. Murray Abraham), the seriously hideous leader of the Son’a, wants to remove the Ba’ku from their planet so his people can gain control of the metaphasic radiation. In this, he has the tacit support of the Federation, represented by Admiral Dougherty (Anthony Zerbe). Dougherty has agreed to violate the Prime Directive of the Federation — a time-honored rule against interfering with the natural development of other civilizations — to gain a little bit of that metaphasic stuff for a few million Federation members. But Picard, a First Directive purist, isn’t so easily swayed. Defying direct orders, he leads the Enterprise officers in a defense of the Ba’ku.
Working from a serviceable script by Michael Piller, Frakes maintains a brisk pace and generates a satisfying amount of excitement. Unfortunately, it’s not always easy to make sense of what people are doing — and, more important, how they’re able to do it — during the frenzied hurly-burly of the final half-hour. The picture makes warp-speed leaps from one locale to another, from the Ba’ku planet to the Enterprise to the Son’a spacecraft to the planet again. In the process, tension is sustained, but clarity occasionally is obscured.
Even when things get most confusing, however, the lead players manage to easily carry the audience along. Stewart reveals more of Picard’s romantic side in this outing, in scenes that pair him with the subtly sensuous Donna Murphy as an extremely well-preserved 300-year-old Ba’ku. (“I must warn you,” Stewart announces in his most deliciously plummy tone, “I’ve always been attracted to older women.”) Spiner, Dorn and the other regulars go through their usual paces with appreciably undiminished flair and gusto.
As Ru’afro, whose face has the look of ancient parchment stretched tightly across a skull, Abraham indulges in just the right amount of scenery chewing. Zerbe artfully implies some minor pangs of conscience as Dougherty. It’s worth noting that there’s a conspicuous cut-away from the specifics of his character’s grisly demise.
Here and elsewhere, it’s obvious that — unlike the darker and edgier “First Contact,” which received a PG-13 — “Insurrection” has been scrupulously crafted for a PG.
Tech values, including Matthew F. Leonetti’s lensing and Michael Westmore’s fanciful makeup — are in keeping with the franchise’s high standards. As usual, though, there’s a conspicuously (and deliberately?) cheesy touch to the high-tech trappings. At one point, Cmdr. Riker announces he will assume “manual control” of the Enterprise. Up pops a device that looks like a computer-game joystick. Yeah, right.Choose "Make this ad premium" at checkout.

In fiction, the most typical use of this trope is a male GBF to a straight feminine protagonist but other permutations are very slowly starting to appear. Gay guys can hang out with each other, and so they have so much fun doing so. Why would they deal with a lady until it’s their mom or sister? Because that woman occurs to be you, and so they take pleasure in your organization just as much as they do hanging out with other guys.
TV asserted a newfangled social liberalism with these equivocal equipment. And as a outcome of the GBF was invoked to enliven a scene with their feminine pals, the criterion was usually that they emulate them of their mannerisms. While gay romance and drama was mainstreamed with masculine-performing characters like the Brokeback boys, “femmy” males were relegated to more comedian, supporting roles. Up so far, Sterling has embodied most of the one-note tropes created by the “gay finest friend.” However, that’s just who he’s. He is one shade of the many colors of the rainbow . Also, the perform of gay characters, particularly these in films like Philadelphia, have been to ensure that gay people have been good, respectable folks that resembled the common straight person. Sterling wants the world to know he is GAY in every way and can flounce about in essentially the most feminine method potential.

The dismissive attitude toward Hindu traditions, not just by foreigners but by India's own, is a result of a variety of factors: colonialism, proselytism, scientism, and blind westernization. It is not surprising therefore that even some of the Indian teachers who traveled west to teach yoga and meditation ignored the disciplined practice of Hindu modes of prayer, worship, and belief. "Just focus on breathing and meditating with eyes closed," seems to be the gist of their advice to Western students.
And in the public pronouncements and in their writings, the well-known marketers of yoga and meditation seem too eager to ignore the sacred language of Sanskrit, and the disciplined meditative utterance of sacred sounds and words that can transform the leaden mind into the bright vehicle for reaching the transcendent. As we read more about some of the celebrated Indian gurus who came to the U.S. to show and tell, we realize how much they sacrificed in their attempts to reach and teach their new students, who had difficulty tucking their legs under them, and getting their ears and tongues attuned to the sounds of Sanskrit.
But the fault is ours too. After I went through the sacred ceremony of Upanayanam or Munji—rather late in my youth, instead of at the age of seven as recommended in the scriptures—I did not practice performing the Sandhyavandanam, the daily dawn and dusk oblation to the Sun. I am not the only lapsed Brahmin around—the "higher caste" men and boys (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, and Vysyas) who, after the sacred thread investiture ceremony, are supposed to perform the Sandhyavandanam daily—who does not perform this duty daily, I believe. But that was not the case a generation or two ago, and I remember my paternal grandfather sitting every morning and evening to perform what I thought was a truly mesmerizing ritual of prayer.
Luckily, there are still some in my family—cousins, their children, and friends—who diligently and thoughtfully perform the Sandhavandanam daily even now, and there is a new interest in these sacred rituals, which are truly necessary if one wants to discipline one's mind to perform serious meditation and yoga. These days there are attempts to enable girls to undergo the sacred thread ceremony so that they too can perform the Sandhyavandanam. I mention all this to bring to your attention, in a roundabout way, the chanting of the Gayatri mantra, which the seven-year-olds, who undergo the Upanayanam, are taught and which then they are supposed to chant regularly during their daily Sandhyavandanam.
No one has written a more eloquent and erudite explanation of the Gayatri mantra than I.K. Taimni (1898-1978), who served as a professor of chemistry at the University of Allahabad in India. A distinguished member of the Theosophical Society, Iqbal Kishen Taimni (his parents were so accepting of all religions that they gave their son a Muslim first name) has written in his inimitable style commentaries on and translations of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras as well as the Shiva Sutra. Taimni begins his introduction to the Gayatri mantra by reminding us that the path to enlightenment rests on three pillars—character building, worship or upasana, and yoga—and without the careful shaping of the mind through worship and self-discipline the path of yoga becomes too difficult to traverse, and our attempts to walk that path end in failure.
Hindus regarded the meditative utterance (japa) of the Gayatri mantra as an essential and integral part of their daily life; that is, when the performance of the Sandhyavandanam was carried out religiously and rigorously. While it may be difficult for everyone to follow the path of self-realization, the great Hindu sages advised and offered us a device to acknowledge and face God daily, and the chanting of the Gayatri mantra is considered the most effective way of doing that for those living the mundane life. The Gayatri mantra is mentioned in all four Vedas, as well as in Tantra texts. It is considered to be of such power and importance that Taimni says, ". . . the great importance of this mantra should leave no doubt in the mind of the reader that it is capable of unfolding our spiritual faculties in a remarkable manner provided it is used properly" (p. 8).J. B. S. Haldane
John Burdon Sanderson Haldane FRS ( /ˈhɔːldeɪn/; 5 November 1892 – 1 December 1964 [1] [2]), nicknamed "Jack" or "JBS", [3] was a British scientist known for his works in physiology, genetics, evolutionary biology, and mathematics. With innovative use of statistics in biology, he was one of the founders of neo-Darwinism. A veteran of the Great War and with no academic degree, he taught biology at the University of Cambridge, the Royal Institution, and University College London. [4] Renouncing his British citizenship, he became an Indian citizen and worked at the Indian Statistical Institute for the rest of his life.
Haldane's article on abiogenesis in 1929 introduced the " primordial soup theory", which became the foundation for the concept of the chemical origin of life. [5] He established human gene maps for haemophilia and colour blindness on the X chromosome, and codified Haldane's rule on sterility in the heterogametic sex of hybrids in species. [6] . [8] He is also remembered for coining the words "clone" and "cloning" in human biology, and " ectogenesis". With his sister, Naomi Mitchison, Haldane was the first to demonstrate.
Arthur C. Clarke credited him as "perhaps the most brilliant science populariser of his generation". [9] [10] Nobel laureate Peter Medawar called Haldane "the cleverest man I ever knew". [11] According to Theodosius Dobzhansky, "Haldane was always recognized as a singular case"; Ernst Mayr described him as a "polymath"; [12] Michael J. D. White as "the most erudite biologist of his generation, and perhaps of the century"; [13] and Sahotra Sarkar as "probably the most prescient biologist of this [20th] century." [14] According to a Cambridge student, "he seemed to be the last man who might know all there was to be known." [12]
Biography
Early life and education
Haldane was born in Oxford to John Scott Haldane, a physiologist, scientist, a philosopher and a Liberal, and Louisa Kathleen Trotter, a Conservative, and descended from Scottish ancestry. His only sibling, Naomi, became a writer and married Dick Mitchison, Baron Mitchison (thereby becoming Naomi Mary Margaret Mitchison, Baroness Mitchison), who was his best friend at Eton College. [15] His uncle was Viscount Haldane and his aunt the author Elizabeth Haldane. Descended from an aristocratic and secular family [16] of the Clan Haldane, he would later claim that his Y chromosome could be traced back to Robert the Bruce. [17]
Haldane grew up at 11 Crick Road, North Oxford. [18] He learnt to read at the age of three, and at four, after injuring his forehead he asked the doctor of the bleeding, . [19] At age 8, in 1901, his father brought him to the Oxford University Junior Scientific Club to listen to a lecture on Mendelian genetics, which had been recently rediscovered. [20] Although he found the lecture given by Arthur Dukinfield Darbishire, Demonstrator of Zoology at Balliol College, Oxford, "interesting but difficult," [10] it influenced him permanently such that genetics became the field in which he made his most important scientific contributions. [13]. [21] He participated for the first time in scientific research as a volunteer subject for his father in 1906. John was the first to study the effects of decompression (relief from high pressure) in humans. [22] He investigated the physiological condition called "bends," such as when goats lift and bend their legs if discomforted, that is also experienced by deep-sea divers. In July 1906, on board HMS Spanker off the west coast of Scotland, Rothesay, young Haldane jumped into the Atlantic Ocean with the experimental diving suit and barely made out. The study was published in a 101-paged article in The Journal of Hygiene in 1908; where Haldane was described as "Jack Haldane (age 13)" for whom it "was the first time [he] had ever dived in a diving dress." [23] The research became a foundation for a scientific theory called Haldane's decompression model. [24]
He studied mathematics and classics at New College, Oxford and obtained first-class honours in mathematical moderations in 1912. He became engrossed in genetics and presented a paper on gene linkage in vertebrates in the summer of 1912. His first technical paper, a 30-page long article on haemoglobin function, was published that same year, as a co-author alongside his father. [25] He presented the mathematical treatment of the study on 19 October in the Proceedings of the Physiological Society and was published in December 1913. [26]
Haldane did not want his education to be confined to a specific subject. He took up Greats and graduated with first-class honours in 1914. While he had full intention of studying physiology, his plan was, as he described later, "somewhat overshadowed by other events" (referring to World War I). [21] His only formal education in biology was an incomplete course in vertebrate anatomy. [1]
Career
To support the war effort, Haldane volunteered for and joined the British Army, and was commissioned a temporary second lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion of the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) on 15 August 1914. [27] He was assigned as the trench mortar officer, to lead his team for hand-bombing the enemy trenches, the experience of which he remarked "enjoyable." [21] In his article in 1932 he described how "he enjoyed the opportunity of killing people and regarded this as a respectable relic of primitive man." [1] He was promoted to temporary lieutenant on 18 February 1915 and to temporary captain on 18 October. [28] [29] While serving in France, he was wounded by an artillery fire for which he was sent back to Scotland. There he served as instructor of grenades for the Black Watch recruits. In 1916, he joined the war in Mesopotamia (Iraq) where an enemy bomb severely wounded him. He was relieved from war fronts and was sent to India and stayed there for the rest of the war. [21] He returned to England in 1919 and relinquished his commission on 1 April 1920, retaining his rank of captain. [30] For his ferocity and aggressiveness in battles, his commander Douglas Haig described him as the "bravest and dirtiest officer in my Army." [31]
Between 1919 and 1922, he served as Fellow of New College, Oxford, [32] where he taught and researched in physiology and genetics, which he had no formal education on. In the year he joined Oxford he managed to publish six papers dealing with physiology of respiration and genetics. [1] He then moved to the University of Cambridge, where he accepted a newly created readership in Biochemistry, in 1923 and taught until 1932. [16] During his nine years at Cambridge, he worked on enzymes and genetics, particularly the mathematical side of genetics. [16] While working as a visiting professor at the University of California in 1932, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. [33]
Haldane worked part-time at the John Innes Horticultural Institution (later named John Innes Centre) at Merton Park in Surrey from 1927 to 1937. [34] When Alfred Daniel Hall became the Director in 1926, [35] one of his earliest tasks was to appoint an assistant director "a man of high quality in the study of genetics" who could became his successor. Recommended by Julian Huxley, the council appointed Haldane in March 1927, with the terms: "Mr Haldane to visit the Institution fortnightly for a day and a night during the Cambridge terms, to put in two months also at Easter and long vacations in two continuous blocks and to be free in the Christmas vacation." [36] He was Officer in charge of Genetical Investigations. [1] He became the Fullerian Professor of Physiology at the Royal Institution from 1930 to 1932 and in 1933 he became full Professor of Genetics at University College London, where he spent most of his academic career. [37] As Hall did not retire as early as expected – retiring in 1939, [35] Haldane had to resign from the John Innes in 1936 to became the first Weldon Professor of Biometry at University College London. [16] Haldane's service was recorded to have helped the John Innes as "the liveliest place for research in genetics in Britain." [36] At the height of World War II, he moved his team to the Rothamsted Experimental Station in Hertfordshire during 1941 to 1944 to escape bombings. [1] Complying an invitation of Reginald Punnett, who founded the Journal of Genetics in 1910 with William Bateson, he became the editor since 1933 until his death. [2]
In India
In 1956, Haldane left University College London, and joined the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in Calcutta (later renamed Kolkata), India, where he worked in the biometry unit. [1] Haldane gave many reasons for moving to India.. [38] In an article "A passage to India" which he wrote in The Rationalists Annual in 1958, he stated: "For one thing I prefer Indian food to American. Perhaps my main reason for going to India is that I consider that the opportunities for scientific research of the kind in which I am interested are better in India than in Britain, and that my teaching will be at least as useful there as here." [39] The university had sacked his wife Helen for being drunk and disorderly and refusing to pay a fine, triggering Haldane's resignation. He declared he would no longer wear socks, "Sixty years in socks is enough." [40] and always dressed in Indian attire. [10]
Haldane was keenly interested in inexpensive research. Explaining in "A passage to India," he said, "Of course, if my work required electron microscopes, cyclotrons, and the like, I should not get them in India. But the sort of facilities which Darwin and Bateson used for their researches—such as gardens, gardeners, pigeon lofts, and pigeons—are more easily obtained in India than in England." [39]. [41] He took an interest in the study of floral symmetry. In January 1961 he befriended Gary Botting, the 1960 U.S. Science Fair winner in zoology (who had first visited the Haldanes along with Susan Brown, 1960 U.S. National Science Fair winner in botany), inviting him to share the results of his experiments hybridising Antheraea silk moths. He, his wife Helen Spurway and student the Haldanes in their honour and had regretfully declined the honour. After the two students had left the hotel, Haldane went on his much-publicized hunger strike to protest what he regarded as a "U.S. insult." [42] [43] [44] Bhubaneswar, the capital of Orissa ( Odisha). [38]
Haldane took Indian citizenship; he was interested in Hinduism and became a vegetarian. [38]." [45]. [46]
When on 25 June 1962 he was described in print as a " Citizen of the World" by Groff Conklin, Haldane responded:. [45]
Personal life
Haldane wed twice, to Charlotte Franken and Helen Spurway. [47] In 1924, Haldane met Charlotte Franken. Charlotte at the time was a journalist for the Daily Express and was married to Jack Burghes. Following the publication of Haldane's Daedalus, or Science and the Future, she interviewed Haldane and started a relationship. [21] So that they could marry, Charlotte filed a divorce suit, resulting in some controversy as Haldane was involved as co-respondent in the legal proceeding. [1] Not only that, as Sahotra Sarkar reported: "For her to secure a divorce, Haldane overtly committed adultery with her." [14] Haldane's conduct was described as "gross immorality," for which he was formally dismissed by Cambridge's Sex Viri (a six-member disciplinary committee) from the university in 1925. Cambridge professors including G. K. Chesterton, Bertrand Russell, and W. L. George raised their defence for Haldane insisting that the university should not judge on a professor's private life as such. [33] The ouster was revoked in 1926. Haldane and Charlotte were married in 1926. Following their separation in 1942, the Haldanes divorced in 1945. Later that year he married Helen Spurway, his former PhD student. [48]
Haldane once boasted about himself, saying, "I can read 11 languages and make public speeches in three; but am unmusical. I am a fairly competent public speaker." [33] He had no children, [33] but he and his father were important influences to Naomi's children, of whom Denis, Murdoch and Avrion Mitchison became professors of biology at the University of London, Edinburgh University, and University College London, respectively. [15]
Inspired by his father, Haldane often used self-experimentation and. [49] In his decompression chamber experiments, he and his volunteers suffered perforated eardrums. But, as Haldane stated in What is Life, [50] "the drum generally heals up; and if a hole remains in it, although one is somewhat deaf, one can blow tobacco smoke out of the ear in question, which is a social accomplishment." [51]
Haldane had no problem making himself unpopular among his colleagues from the start of his academic career. In Cambridge, he annoyed most of the senior faculty because of his uninhibited behaviour particularly at dinner. His partisan, Edgar Adrian (the 1932 Nobel laureate), had almost convinced the university for his appointment as Fellow of Trinity College, but that was ruined by an incident when he hurriedly brought along a gallon jar of urine from his laboratory to the dining table. [14]
Later life and death
In the autumn of 1963, Haldane visited the US for a series of scientific conferences. At the University of Wisconsin, Sewall Wright introduced him before his speech, noting many of Haldane's achievements, after which Haldane modestly remarked that the introduction would have been more accurate if all the references to "Haldane" were replaced with "Wright". [13] In Florida, he met, for the first and only time, the Russian biochemist Alexander Oparin, who had developed the origin of life theory quite independent of his own in the 1920s. It was while there that he started feeling abdominal pains. [14]
Haldane went to London for a diagnosis. He was found to have colorectal cancer, and had a surgery in February 1964. Around that time Philip Dally was making a BBC documentary about eminent living scientists, which included Sewall Wright and the double Nobel laureate Linus Pauling. Dally's team approached Haldane at the hospital for the documentary profile, but instead of a filmed interview, Haldane gave them a self-obituary, [52] the opening lines of which run:
I am going to begin with a boast. I believe that I am one of the [originally as "I am the most"] most influential people living today, although I haven't got a scrap of power. Let me explain. In 1932 I was the first person to estimate the rate of mutation of a human gene. [14]
He also wrote a comic poem while in the hospital, mocking his own incurable disease. It was read by his friends, who appreciated the consistent irreverence with which Haldane had lived his life. The poem first appeared in print on 21 February 1964 issue of the New Statesman, and runs: [53] [54].
He willed that his body be used for medical research and teaching [55] at the Rangaraya Medical College, Kakinada. [56]. [57]
His surgery in London was declared successful. But the symptoms reappeared after returning to India in June, and in August, the Indian doctors confirmed that his condition was terminal. Writing to John Maynard Smith on 7 September, he said, "I am not appreciably upset by the propect of dying fairly soon. But I am very angry [at the English doctor who performed the operation]." [14]
He died on 1 December 1964 in Bhubaneswar. On that day the BBC broadcast his self-obituary as "Professor J.B.S. Haldane, obituary." [52] [58]
Scientific contributions
Following his father's footsteps, Haldane's first publication was on the mechanism of gaseous exchange by haemoglobin in The Journal of Physiology, [25] and he subsequently worked on the chemical properties of blood as a pH buffer. [59] [60] He investigated several aspects of kidney functions and mechanism of excretion. [61] [62]
Genetic linkage
In 1904, Arthur Dukinfield Darbishire published a paper on an experiment attempting to test Mendelian inheritance between Japanese waltzing and albino mice. [63] When Haldane came across the paper, he noticed that Darbishire had overlooked the possibility of genetic linkage in the experiment. Having sought advice from Reginald Punnett, a professor of biology at the University of Cambridge, he was ready to write a paper but only after an independent experiment. [13] With his sister Naomi and a friend Alexander Dalzell Sprunt, one year his senior, he started the experiment in 1908 using guinea pigs and mice. By 1912, the report was ready. [14] But the paper titled Reduplication in mice was published in the Journal of Genetics only in December 1915 [64] that became the first demonstration of genetic linkage in mammals, showing that certain genetic traits tend to be inherited together (as was later discovered, because of their proximity on chromosomes). [3] (Between 1912 and 1914, genetic linkage had been reported in the fruit fly Drosophilla, [65] silk moth, [66] and plants. [67])
As the paper was written during Haldane's service during World War I, James F. Crow called it "the most important science article ever written in a front-line trench." [13] Haldane himself recalled that he was the "only officer to complete a scientific paper from a forward position of the Black Watch." [21] As was Haldane, Sprunt had joined 4th Batallion Bedfordshire Regiment at the start of World War I, and was killed at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle on 17 March 1915. [68] It was upon this news that Haldane submitted the paper for publication, in which he remarked: "Owing to the war it has been necessary to publish prematurely, as unfortunately one of us (A. D. S.) has already been killed in France." [64] He was also the first to demonstrate linkage in chickens in 1921, [69] and (with Julia Bell) in humans in 1937. [70]
Enzyme kinetics
In 1925, with G. E. Briggs, Haldane derived a new interpretation of the enzyme kinetic law of Victor Henri in 1903, better known as the 1913 Michaelis–Menten equation. [71] Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten assumed that enzyme (catalyst) and substrate (reactant) are in fast equilibrium with their complex, which then dissociates to yield product and free enzyme. By contrast, at almost the same time, Donald Van Slyke and G. E. Cullen [72] treated the binding step as an irreversible reaction. The Briggs–Haldane equation was of the same algebraic form as both of the earlier equations,. [73] [74]
Haldane's principle. [75] [76]
Origin of life
Haldane introduced the modern concept of abiogenesis in an eight-page article titled The origin of life, in The Rationalist Annual in 1929, [77]." [77] The idea was generally dismissed as "wild speculation". [78]
Alexander Oparin had suggested a similar idea in Russian in 1924 (published in English in 1936). The hypothesis gained some empirical support in 1953 with the classic Miller–Urey experiment. Since then, the primordial soup theory (Oparin–Haldane hypothesis) has become the foundation in the study of abiogenesis. [79] [80] [81] Although Oparin's theory became widely known only after the English version in 1936, Haldane accepted Oparin's originality and said, "I have very little doubt that Professor Oparin has the priority over me." [82]
Malaria and sickle-cell anemia
Haldane was the first to realise the evolutionary link between genetic disorder and infection in humans. While estimating the rates of human mutation in different situations and diseases, he noted that mutations expressed in red blood cells, like thalassemias, were prevalent only in tropical regions where deadly infection like malaria has been endemic. He further observed that these were favourable traits (heterozygous inheritance of sickle cell trait) for natural selection which protected individuals from receiving malarial infection. [83] He introduced his hypothesis at the Eighth International Congress of Genetics held in 1948 at Stockholm on a topic "The Rate of Mutation of Human Genes". [84] He proposed that genetic disorders in humans living in malaria-endemic regions provided a condition ( phenotype) that makes them relatively immune to malarial infections.." [85] This became known as "Haldane's malaria hypothesis", or concisely, the "malaria hypothesis". [86] This hypothesis was eventually confirmed by Anthony C. Allison in 1954 in the case of sickle-cell anemia. [87] [88]
Population genetics
Haldane. [89] [90] He wrote a series of ten papers, A Mathematical Theory of Natural and Artificial Selection, deriving expressions for the direction and rate of change of gene frequencies, and also analyzing the interaction of natural selection with mutation and migration. The series consists of ten papers published between 1924 and 1934 in journals such as Biological Reviews (part II), Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society (parts I and from III to IX) and Genetics (part X). [91] [92] [93] He gave a set of lectures based on this series at the University of Wales in 1931, and were summarised in a book, The Causes of Evolution in 1932. [20]
His first paper on the series in 1924 specifically treats the rate of natural selection in peppered moth evolution. He predicted that environmental condition can favour the increase or decline of either the dominant (in this case the black or melanic forms) or the recessive (the grey or wild type) moths. For a sooty environment such as Manchester, where the phenomenon was discovered in 1848, he predicted that the dominant melanic moths will have fifty times more survival fitness than the typical grey ones. [14] According to his estimate, assuming 1% dominant form in 1848 and about 99% in 1898, "48 generations are needed for the change [for the dominant to appear]... After only 13 generations the dominants would be in a majority." [91] Such mathematical prediction was considered improbable for natural selection in nature. [14] But it was subsequently proven by an elaborate experiment (named Kettlewell's experiment) performed by an Oxford zoologist Bernard Kettlewell between 1953 and 1958, [94] [95] [96] and further by a Cambridge geneticists Michael Majerus in his experiments conducted between 2001 and 2007. [97]". [98] He was the first to estimate the rate of human mutation in his 1932 book The Causes of Evolution. [99] At the John Innes Horticultural Institution, he developed the complicated linkage theory for polyploids; [34] [100] and extended the idea of gene/enzyme relationships with the biochemical and genetic study of plant pigments. [101] [13]
Political views
of having been a Soviet GRU spy codenamed Intelligentsia. [102] [103]". [31]
Social and scientific views
Human cloning
Haldane was the first to have thought of the genetic basis for human cloning, and the eventual artificial breeding of superior individuals. For this he introduced the terms "clone" and "cloning", [104]: [105].
Ectogenesis and in vitro fertilisation
His essay Daedalus; or, Science and the Future (1924) introduced the term ectogenesis for the concept of what is later known as in vitro fertilisation (test tube babies). He envisioned ectogenesis as a tool for creating better individuals (eugenics). [106] Haldane's work was an influence on Huxley's Brave New World (1932) and was also admired by Gerald Heard. [107].
Criticism of C.S. Lewis". [108] Haldane. He also wrote an essay criticising Lewis's arguments for the existence of God, entitled "More Anti-Lewisite", a reference to the poison gas and its antidote. [109]

Scientists. [113]
Awards and honours
Haldane was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1932. [37], Oxford, and the Kimber Award of the US National Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the Linnean Society of London's prestigious Darwin–Wallace Medal in 1958. [56]
Legacy
The Haldane Lecture at the John Innes Centre, [114] where Haldane worked from 1927 to 1937 is named in his honour. [36] The JBS Haldane Lecture [115] of The Genetics Society is also named in his honour.
Haldane was parodied as an obsessive self-experimenter, described as "the biologist too absorbed in his experiments to notice his friends bedding his wife" by his friend Aldous Huxley in the novel Antic Hay (1923). [116]
Quotations
- He is famous for the (possibly apocryphal) response that he gave when some theologians asked him what could be inferred about the mind of the Creator from the works of His Creation: "An inordinate fondness for beetles." [117] [118] or sometimes, "....stars and beetles." [119] This is in reference to there being over 400,000 known species of beetles in the world, and that this represents 40% of all known insect species (at the time of the statement, it was over half of all known insect species). [120]
- He was often quoted as saying, "My own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose." [121]
- ." [121]: 209
- " Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he's unwilling to be seen with her in public." [122] [123]
- "I had gastritis for about fifteen years until I read Lenin and other writers, who showed me what was wrong with our society and how to cure it. Since then I have needed no magnesia." [124]
- "I suppose the process of acceptance will pass through the usual four stages: (i) This is worthless nonsense; (ii) This is an interesting, but perverse, point of view; (iii) This is true, but quite unimportant; (iv) I always said so." [125]
- "Three hundred and ten species in all of India, representing two hundred and thirty-eight genera, sixty-two families, nineteen different orders. All of them on the Ark. And this is only India, and only the birds." [126]

- When asked whether he would lay down his life for his brother, Haldane, presaging Hamilton's rule, supposedly replied "two brothers or eight cousins". [128]

Awashima Jinja is a shrine for women, famous for its huge collection of dolls. Japanese are superstitions about dolls, many people find them mysterious or frightening, believing that they have souls or the power to influence human lives. There are a number of shrines and festivals where people dispose of their old dolls - they feel that if they just threw them in the garbage, the dolls’ souls might come back to haunt them like ghosts. Awashima jinja is especially devoted to dispose of hina ningyo, which are dolls that are given to young girls on Girl’s Day March 3rd. There are thousands of dolls here, as well as sculptures, figurines, carvings, and statues. You’ll find tanuki, maneki neko, daruma, frogs and many more.

This.The Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, has faulted the process involved in the implementation of the Better Education Service Delivery for All (BESDA) projects across the 17 focal States.
Adamu, represented by the Minister of State, Mr Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba disclosed this in Abuja on Thursday at the BESDA Technical Meeting between the ministry and the 17 focal states.
He, therefore, suggested the use of the National Identity Number (NIN) for enrolment of new pupils/students on the scheme.
The Minister also queried the projected 13 million figure adopted by the World Bank as a basis for launching the program across the country.
According to the Minister, the projected 13 million Out- of-School figure presented in 2017 was not sufficient enough to determine the actual numbers of enrolment from across the states.
“When I came into office in 2019, I said this programme sounds like an official way business, they said what do I mean, I said my first degree in law, the 2nd and 3rd is the law.
“So I asked them; you have a cast number, somebody said Nigeria has 13million out-of-School children and that was done in 2013.
“ And that world Bank said they had projected the population of Nigeria to be X, Y, Z and that at the time they made the projection, they had counted the number of schools in Nigeria.
“ And the numbers of children that are there and they had done the mathematics and minus it from the number in school from the one they expected that they would have born and they said the minus is the result, he said.
He further said he asked the World bank how many were expected to die and was not told any.
“ They said they have on the basis of this world bank number you have projected 13 million in 2017, I also asked them that so now we have a loan and we are going to give it to these states and the states are now to collect 100 dollars on the head of every girl they bring and for every boy, they take 80 dollars, and they said yes.
“I asked further how do we know the ones they bring and the ones they don’t bring; how do we know their sex? Are we able to raise their skirts? They said No.
“ Then I said this is a very very complicated scheme, “ The minister added.
The Minister further enquired on the system’s capacity on verification of claims by states presenting pupils for enrolment asking if there was any National enrolment Identity Number.
According to him, how do you know the sex of the child presented for enrolment? Is there an enrolment national identity number that you can give to these children when they are being enrolled?
He said that the response he got from the World Bank was no; therefore, faulting the programme.
Adamu also emphasised that every state that registers any pupil/student on the scheme must register the person with a National identity number so as to effectively track the progress of the child under the BESDA project.
“I requested that pupils at the basic level should be registered with NIN at least we should begin with the primary school level.
“I told them to let us start with this 611million dollars, let us start with the project, let us know how many children the states are bringing; world bank disagreed,” he added.
He said that the country must get it right in its education sector, saying that this would only be achieved by setting the nation’s basic education sector on the right path.
He added that the security and stability of Nigeria hinged on the ability to provide functional education to the citizens.
The ministry’s BESDA Coordinator, Hajia Amina Haruna, said the programme had been progressive and recorded results on the decrease of the Out-of-School Children in the focal states.
Haruna said that for every state that enrols a girl-child in the basic school, the sum of 100 dollars would be given while on enrolment of a boy in the school, the sum of 80 dollars would be given.
According to her, BESDA, a five-year programme commenced in 2018 in Nigeria and will end on Oct. 31 2022.
IPOB paid American lobbyists to spread falsehoods, misinformation about Nigeria – Presidency
“The BESDA programme is a $611m World Bank grant that aims to enrol OSC into the classroom, improve literacy and strengthen accountability for results in basic education.
“The benefitting states are Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Ebonyi, Gombe, Jigawa, Kaduna, kano, katsina, kebbi, Niger, Oyo, Rivers, Sokoto, Taraba, Yobe and zamfara State.Cutting the Legendary Black Prince's Brother, 110 cts Red Spinel
Mother nature can take thousands of years giving birth to pristine beauty in the depths of its rocks. And so, as a matter of respect for its creation, a genuine expert reserves a few more decades grasping the very essence of this treasure, before finally transforming the beautiful into the sublime.
The story of this rare vibrant pinkish red stone began 15 years ago in the Pamir Mountains, where it was found at the legendary Kuh-i-Lal mine – home place to some of the world’s most celebrated spinels. With its exceptional weight of 160 carats, the crystal was polished into an egg shape of 112.8 carats, displaying fabulous color, luster and clarity even in its rough state.
112.8 carats rough
Nevertheless, no matter how long a gem cutter twists and turns an unrefined piece of pure nature in his hands, those hands will long to mold it into a work of tangible and visible perfection instead. A lapidarian can spend a lifetime before undertaking to cut a stone. Studying the material thoroughly, understanding its features and properties, and estimating the most favorable shape and size for the future stone are crucial at the preliminary stage. Once the rough touches the diamond wheel, there is no turning back. Responsibility increases even more when a gem is one-of-a-kind. In such case, mere knowledge and craftsmanship are not sufficient: insight and luck must both be present.
The preconception of this stone took one and a half decade. After preforming, its bulk of 112.80 carats shrank down to 58.45 carats, acquiring distinct octagonal outlines instead of multiple crystal faces. Placement of the future table was the determining factor in revealing the color and clarity of the gem at their best, and the master has done this task flawlessly. Perfect proportions, sharp edges, precisely cropped corners – all these hi-tech tricks have been performed so easily, as if the gem cutter was molding a lump of sugar rather than a piece of extremely hard material of tremendous value.
With all the knowledge, skill and luck, an extraordinary crystal of spinel has been lovingly polished into this piece of supreme beauty. Now that the rough has sacrificed its weight, the faceted stone has acquired true magnificence: excellent emerald cut, perfect clarity, and exceptional weight of 35.55 carats, displayed in a unique variety of raspberry red. No wonder this color comes to mind whenever we think of a miracle; for what is a miracle, if not creating an unmatched treasure with your own hands?

When I ran across a pack of 25 stencils at Walmart for $10.00 I just couldn’t pass them up.
I thought that a wooden shingle would be perfect for one of the stencil quotes, that is if I had one left that was large enough. I was in luck, I did have one large enough for the quote shingle For Shingle Sign

How to Make a Shingle Sign
So, I pulled it out and used my sanding block to smooth the shingle down enough to stencil on.
I wanted the shingle darker so, I used some of my homemade aging solution to darken the shingle.
Then I centered the stencil on the shingle. When centering makes sure the thicker part of the shingle is up at the top, then stencil the quote using white acrylic paint.
Since shingles are too thin to add a sawtooth hook I drilled two holes at the top of the shingle sign, on each side. Then added a piece of twine for hanging.
Great Quote! It makes me think of the dreams for my blog, and for dreams to come true one has to work at it. They don’t just happen. My Dreams help to keep me going.

I love that quote and it’s so appropriate for me right now. I need a sign like this to hang next to my bed, just as a reminder when I wake up every morning.
Thanks Michelle! If I hung the sign next to my bed for a reminder to get up and go to my day job I think I would need one with a little more colorful words. LOL
Great quote and it looks beautiful on this piece of wood, Linda. You got an amazing deal on that pack of stencils.
Thank you Julia! I know I just couldn’t pass them up. They are made from cardboard, but if I’m careful they should still last me a long time. Thanks for stopping by!
What a fun quote and so inspirational for us who like to DIY! It really speaks to me, especially now that I have a pile of stuff I need to get done!

An investigation is underway into a Friday morning fire in a southeast neighbourhood that displaced a family of three.
Fire crews responded to a home on McKerrell Way S.E. in McKenzie Lake at around 7 a.m. following several calls to 911 reporting a fire. Firefighters encountered smoke emanating from the front door of the house.
Two adults and a child escaped the building unscathed prior to the arrival of emergency crews.
Calgary Fire Department officials confirm the fire originated in a bathroom and spread into the attic, but the exact cause of the blaze has yet to be determined.
Damage to the home is considered extensive and the building is uninhabitable at this time.
Officials with the Calgary Fire Department told CTV News there were no working smoke detectors in the home.
In a statement to CTV News, Shamon Kureshi, president and CEO of Hope Street Real Estate Corp. — the company that manages the rental affairs for the property owner — refuted the claim of no working smoke detectors, stating that detectors were in place and had been confirmed to be in working order during a detailed move-in inspection.Helping those in need

In addition to continuing to incorporate their Irish heritgae in the reception (Did you see how they did so in their outdoor wedding ceremony?), they brought in details from both their New Hampshire and Virginia home states. Top it all off with fun details like koozie escort cards (How fun!?) and a T-shirt guest book and it goes without saying that this celebration was a one-of-a-kind blast!
From Christine: From the invitations to the programs to all the table signs, I designed and created every piece to ensure our big day had a cohesive look and feel. Other handmade details were our handfasting ribbon, the “C” and “S” hanging during our ceremony, the ribbon wrapped dessert towers and the chalkboard table signs. We met at a Red Sox/Nationals game, so rather than our guests signing a book, we had them sign our team shirts! And everyone went home with a navy or green koozie that said “SlÃ¡inte!”, an Irish drinking toast meaning “health”.
We wanted to incorporate where we both grew up, so some of the details we included were: Me (New Hampshire)- Maple candy in our welcome bags, Red Sox robe while getting ready, Sam Adams Summer Ale as the “Brides drink” and my Dad and I surprising our guests by switching to “Sweet Caroline” mid father/daughter dance. Shaun (Virginia)- VA peanuts in our welcome bags, grits as part of our wedding dinner, southern touches of mason jars and burlap, and of course our wedding being in VA!
We realized early on that we did not want all the “normal” wedding details, so we skipped certain things, like a wedding cake, opting instead for a dessert bar (complete with Irish cream cupcakes!).
Christine’s advice for other DC-area couples:
It’s easy to get overwhelmed with all the options and opinions coming at you for your big day, but no matter what, stay true to who you both are and what you want. Also, figure out a budget that works for you and stick to it. This is your wedding day, so do exactly what you want (and don’t want) to do!

The release added two new shooting modes to the native Windows 10 experience. Today, Microsoft is now bringing the update out of preview and sending it out to all users.
The release brings Windows Camera up to version 2019.124.60, which is updating automatically. Before getting into the details, let’s have a look at the official changelog from Microsoft:
- New shooting modes – Two new shooting modes have been added- Document and Blackboard.
- Bug fixes and various improvements.
Microsoft is merging some Office Lens features into Windows Camera. Blackboard is known as Whiteboard on Lens and is now available on the camera app.
Whiteboard was launched by Microsoft early in 2018. The app is a collaborative service that works with inking features within Microsoft Office. Users can write content on the screen and share it with multiple users on other devices.
Last year, Microsoft brought a rotation ability to the camera application on Windows 10. It is now possible to rotate the camera 90 °, 180 ° or 270 ° before taking pictures or recording videos.
Furthermore, the update also introduced the ability to take a picture simply by holding down the camera button.
Camera App
As mentioned, the latest update for the app is arriving for users automatically. Still you can check out the Windows Camera app by visiting the Microsoft Store here. Among the features available on the app are:

“Hundreds of people from minority groups have experienced hate crimes and many more have no confidence in the authorities to protect them,” says Marco Perolini, Amnesty International’s researcher on Discrimination in Europe. “The Bulgarian authorities urgently have to take a strong stand and ensure they are adhering to national and international laws, ensuring human rights for all.”
Racist and xenophobic hate crimes
Legislation exists in Bulgaria to prosecute hate crimes linked to racism and xenophobia but authorities consistently fail to identify and adequately investigate them.
Attacks against migrants and asylum seekers spiked in 2013, according to the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee and other local organisations. The Deputy Prosecutor General informed Amnesty International that the Sofia Prosecution Office opened 80 pre-trial criminal proceedings concerning crimes against ethnic minorities – including migrants, asylum seekers, Roma and ethnic Turks — between January 2013 and March 2014. However, the collected data is not comprehensive and does not reflect the full extent of these abuses.
Nazir, an asylum seeker from Iraq was attacked with metal knuckledusters by a group of eight or nine people in September 2013. He was hospitalised for nine days and had to have two operations. Police failed to come to the hospital to take Nazir’s statement and refused to register his complaint afterwards. Nazir recounted how the police “told me to go away or they would send me back to Iraq.” When questioned by Amnesty International, the Ministry of the Interior said two police officers were sanctioned for lack of due diligence in this case after an internal inspection, but it is currently unclear whether or not an investigation into the attack against Nazir has been launched.
For certain crimes, such as murder or physical assault, a racist or xenophobic motive constitutes an aggravating factor and attracts an additional penalty, however authorities often treat these crimes as motivated by hooliganism, which prosecutors told Amnesty International is easier to demonstrate. This is partly due to the fact that many officials lack the relevant knowledge and experience to be able to put the existing laws into practice.
“Often, discriminatory elements of the crime, such as racist insults, are simply overlooked by the authorities. The euphemism of hooliganism is no substitute for prosecuting crimes as what they really are,” says Marco Perolini, Amnesty International’s researcher on Discrimination in Europe. “Racism and xenophobia can only end if the authorities acknowledge and document their existence.”
Metin, a Bulgarian citizen of Turkish origin, was brutally attacked by a group of skinheads dressed in black outside an apartment block, home to a large number of migrants. He sustained life-threatening injuries and spent several weeks in a coma. One of the attackers shouted to a man who tried to intervene when they were attempting to break into Metin’s apartment prior to the attack: “Why are you defending migrants? They are killing Bulgarian girls.” Police apprehended the suspects on the spot and a pre-trial investigation was opened for attempted murder motivated by hooliganism.
Homophobic and transphobic hate crimes
There is no legislation in Bulgaria to prosecute homophobic hate crimes which are currently investigated and prosecuted simply as hooligan acts.
In January 2014, the government proposed a new criminal code, which included sexual orientation as a prohibited hate motive, but the law’s adoption was suspended in anticipation of parliamentary elections in October 2014. The new government is yet to commit to the change.
“Homophobic and transphobic abuses are swept under the rug in Bulgaria. The Bulgarian authorities must revise the law on hate crimes to include all grounds of discrimination so that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people can begin to live without fear,” says Marco Perolini.
Mihail Stoyanov, a 25-year-old student, was brutally killed in a park in Sofia in 2008 because he was perceived to be gay. During the investigation, a man testified that the two suspects were part of a group intending to “cleanse” the park of gays. However, because of gaps in the law, in August 2013, the Sofia City Prosecution Office pressed charges for murder motivated by hooliganism. The prosecutor in that case told Amnesty International: “The law is limited and that’s why I could not take into account the homophobic motive in the indictment.”
Barriers to justice for victims
A majority of victims of hate crimes do not report them to the authorities in the first place. Some say it is because they don’t believe the police will adequately respond to their case, or even because they fear further discrimination from the police.
According to a recent European Union survey, 86% of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in Bulgaria who had experienced violence or threats of violence did not report these incidents to the police. About a third of those who didn’t report cited fear of homophobic or transphobic reactions from the Bulgarian police as the reason for their reluctance to lodge complaints.
Few of those who do report hate crimes receive justice through the courts or reparation. Amnesty International spoke to complainants who were not informed about their rights as victims or any developments in their case, which falls short of what is required by Bulgarian national law.
Aurore, a black French national, was physically assaulted at a bus stop in Sofia by a group of seven or eight men. They imitated a monkey and then pushed her to the ground and kicked her. Her white friends who were with her had not been targeted, and it is clear she was a victim of a racist attack. She was never summoned as a victim to appear in court nor informed about the court hearing. The court absolved the suspects of all criminal liability and imposed a fine.
Aurore told Amnesty International: “..part of me died that day… and even more so, by knowing that those people were just fined and that I was not informed about the hearing…I don’t want money or anything, I just want these acts recognised and sanctioned adequately so that perhaps similar things won’t happen in the future again”.
“Bulgarian authorities must investigate, acknowledge and publicly condemn hate crimes to prevent such crimes in future and to challenge the deeply entrenched prejudices that exist in Bulgarian society,” concluded Marco Perolini.

InspiredTennis Legend Arthur Ashe to Join Tennis Industry Hall of Fame
*Apparel pioneers Cheryl Singer and Andy Varat also to be inducted during the 12th Annual TIA Tennis Forum on Aug. 26 in New York City. *
NEW YORK, N.Y. (Aug. 19, 2019) — It takes dedicated individuals in all segments of the tennis industry to move this sport forward, and on Aug. 26, the industry will honor three people who helped to shape the state of tennis in the U.S. and around the world..
Ashe, who was born in Richmond, Va., in 1943, won the US Open in 1968—the first year of “Open” tennis—the Australian Open in 1970 and Wimbledon in 1975, and he was the first African-American selected to the U.S. Davis Cup team, competing on winning teams in 1963, ’68, ’69 and ’70.
But Ashe’s legacy lives well beyond his wins on the tour. He was an activist, author, educator and a tireless campaigner for civil rights and racial equality. The same year he won the US Open, Ashe joined with Charlie Pasarell and Sheridan Snyder to found the National Junior Tennis League, now called the National Junior Tennis and Learning (NJTL) network. Over the last 50 years, NJTL has transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of youngsters. Today, the NJTL network reaches 180,000 kids every year through 300 chapters across the country.
Ashe, who contracted HIV through a blood transfusion, worked to educate others about HIV and AIDS, founding the Arthur Ashe Foundation for the Defeat of AIDS and the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health. In June 1993, five months after his death, he was posthumously awarded the U.S.’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by President Bill Clinton. This past June, a street in Richmond was renamed “Arthur Ashe Boulevard.”
“Arthur was taken from us too soon, but his influence on this sport and industry is extensive,” says Tennis Industry Association (TIA) President Jeff Williams. “He helped to make tennis popular during the ‘boom’ years of the sport, and his enduring support for tennis and education for America’s youth continues to inspire new generations.”
Tennis champion Stan Smith will honor Ashe at the Tennis Industry Hall of Fame induction ceremony, where he and TIA executives will present a plaque to Ashe’s wife, Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe.
Also being inducted into the Tennis Industry Hall of Fame will be Cheryl Singer and Andy Varat, apparel pioneers who made Tail a top company in tenniswear and helped to pave the way to new and better relationships with specialty retailers in this industry.
It all started when Singer, an avid tennis player, walked on court in 1974 in Florida with a custom-made denim tennis skirt. Her tennis friends loved what they saw, and soon, Singer and Varat, her brother, went into business. They decided to call the new company “Tail” as a counter to the popular Head tennis apparel brand.
The pair borrowed money to pay for a booth at a tennis show in Miami Beach—and their product was the talk of the show. “From there, it kind of organically kept growing,” Singer says, “and we became very involved with our customers.”
Singer and Varat’s relationships with Tail’s customers and retail accounts is legendary, and is a key to their success. “The more input we got from our customers, the better product we could produce,” Singer says. “The feedback is what we wanted—we were very good listeners.”
“We brought something new to the industry,” adds Varat, who with Singer sold the company in 2008. Now, they help Singer’s son, Brad, with his apparel company, Lucky in Love. Brad Singer will introduce his mother and uncle at the Tennis Industry Hall of Fame induction ceremony.
“We were always leading with fashion trends and bringing that consistently to the industry,” Varat says. “For us, it was all about relationships, service and quality.”), David Haggerty (2017), Vic Braden (2018) and Jim Fromuth (2018). Tennis Industry Hall of Fame inductees are recognized with their names displayed on a plaque at the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I.
Ashe, Singer and Varat will be honored during the Tennis Industry Hall of Fame induction ceremony, which will take place during the 12th Annual TIA Tennis Forum at the Grand Hyatt New York from 8:30 to 10:30 a.m.on Monday, Aug. 26, which is the first day of play at the 2019 US Open.
In addition to the Tennis Industry Hall of Fame, the Tennis Forum will include the latest news and research about the state of the tennis industry, business insights and updates on grow-the-game initiatives. New this year will be the first Tennis Industry “Discovery Challenge,” a competition designed to generate ideas to help grow the sport.
While the TIA Tennis Forum, Discovery Challenge and Hall of Fame are free to attend, space is limited, so registration is suggested.

“We scoop ice cream and when I started training, I tasted all the flavors," said Howdy Hero Brandon Todd. "It’s fun.”
The shop’s mission is to create jobs for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
“I’m the one who won the homecoming queen,” Howdy Hero Amber Easley said.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one out of four adults in the U.S. has some type of disability.
Howdy Homemade was born out of the desire to provide job opportunities to people who have been marginalized because of society’s misunderstanding of their abilities. But what if all employers could be inclusive of these folks? A company called Rangam is trying to achieve that through SourceAbled, a global workforce solution.
“At Rangam, I would say our mission is to promote employment for everyone,” Rangam CEO Nish Parikh said.
Parikh says the company helps integrate neurodiverse talent into professional sectors like IT, engineering, health care, finance, and business.
“We know every individual with a disability, they bring in some strength and some abilities," Parikh said. "It's our job to tap into that and do that mapping to the right job.”
Rangam offers guidance to bring people living with disabilities into the workforce. However, Parikh says the first step is helping companies build and scale up their disability hiring programs to create a culture of inclusivity, especially during the interview process since he says that’s often the most nerve-racking for folks living with special needs.
“We help individuals to take the interview in an effective way, so we are truly screening in candidates versus screening out,” Parikh said.
Candidates like 26-year-old James William Potvin, who says he struggled to find work in the first few months of the pandemic.
“It has been difficult in the past," Potvin said. "My personal philosophy, my first, my personal choice is always to be very open about the fact that I am on the spectrum.”
Potvin says he was diagnosed with a higher-functioning form of autism at 10 years old. Thanks to support from SourceAbled, he’s currently working a contract position where he’s quantifying data and sorting mail.
“At the end of the day, people on the spectrum want to work," Potvin said. "They do. Like, I want to work.”
Potvin says his empathy is a strength that has helped him advocate for himself in interviews. He just needs a chance to show people he can step up and excel at his job.
“That feeling is very good," Potvin said. "The feeling of having like a small community even if at the end of the day, it is work. You know, we're all here to make money. But it is still nice to be part of that community.”
No matter who you are or where you work, Potvin says everyone wants to contribute to society and feel valued.About the Campaign
The one thing our people need most these days, is inspiration. Our society seems to be in a depressive state. Our youth are without hope. They find no outlet to explore their talents, interests and dreams in Haiti. They are leaving the country by the thousands. They need to be inspired and equipped to build the Haiti of tomorrow.
This is why I want to build the First Inspiration & Leadership Campus in Haiti. To inspire and provide the mindset, skills and knowledge they need to be confident and lead their families, communities and country to a better future. The facility will provide the tools they need to transform Haiti from the inside out.
A better Haiti will be possible when we address the urgent need for access to quality educational opportunities for children and adults alike, community partnerships and self-empowerment opportunities.
This campus will be a multi-functional facility that will provide opportunities for individuals to elevate themselves via a truly supportive education, business and health-oriented environment, and includes four components: the Educational component, the Business Development component, the Community Hall and the Recreational Component.
This campus will be the first of its kind in Haiti. The long-term vision is to build one of these campuses in each of Haiti’s departments. The impact and significance of such a structure are evidenced by the success of our pilot Tech Center in Jacquet, Haiti. We have gained first hand experience as well as unique and tested strategies that will be applied to this full-scaled campus.
How much are you willing to contribute to build the Haiti you want to see? Do you believe Haiti needs better leaders? How much does Haiti mean to you? These questions will be answered by how you decide to move forward as a contributor, action taker, game changer, investor, visionary, legacy builder or history maker.

The managers of B&H Photo and Video Supply believe they're safe if they willingly have a fight hosted there. A nearby building goes under structural collapse, and their netted safety is short-lived. Howard Rust Jr. and Cadence "Scratch" Carter join forces to take on Maki Genryuusai under the conditions of fighting where debris and detritus threaten to squash them once and for all. Visibility and air quality both take steady nosedives in the wake of the destruction, but a fight is still demanded in which for humanity to prove something... (WINNERS: Rust and Scratch)
MAJIGEN SERIES - MAKI vs RUST and SCRATCH - "A PICTURE WOULD LAST LONGER"
(DOWNTOWN)
B&H PHOTO AND VIDEO SUPPLY is supposed to be the best damn photography place on the planet. It's got vintage cameras, it's got the shinest new cameras, it's got something for EVERYONE. And even though this translocated Metro City is devoid of power, some sneaky employees have managed to wrangle an exclusive MAJIGEN SERIES fight to take place in front of the historic storefront!
Someone probably should have made sure HOWARD RUST knew that he was signing up for a two-on-one fight against MAKI GENRYUUSAI for what could easily be the FATE OF METRO CITY, though! And his teammate SCRATCH isn't exactly known for being a team player, to boot...
If that were all that was going on, it might not be so bad. But the wily B&H employee might not be smirking so hard once he realizes that the storefront is directly under the SINCERITY INVESTMENTS BUILDING, which is currently undergoing structural collapse at the very moment. So, uh. So much for the vintage camera equipment! It'll probably get buried under the rubble of a sixty-story building, but who's counting?!
NOTE: Fighters will find it increasingly hard to breathe as the fight goes on from all the concrete dust and detritus flying about in the air! Not to mention, the entire sixty-story building is probably going to make it harder to block in the fight. But stay wary, folks -- the fight must go on, even if part of the twenty-third floor falls between you and your opponent!
Things have gotten strange here in Metro City once again. Before it was like the end of the world was coming, but now things have literally gone to hell in a sense. Things are abandoned and strange happenings are going on. It's not exactly the most suitable time or place for fighting, but Maki isn't just here to fight. She's here investigating what's going on in her hometown and trying to see if there's anything she can do to help. Little knowing she'd unwittingly get herself signed up for a sanctioned fight here. But in Maki's opinion, once you've gotten yourself into a fight, there's no backing out. Even if things are truly seeming a lot weirder than before.
Standing outside the B&H Photo and Video Supply store, Maki wipes her tonfa with her vest, trying to get it looking as clean as possible for the fight to come. "Normally I'd be looking forwards to a fight," Maki comments idly, "But in this case I just want to get it over with and get the hell out!"
SOME TIME AGO...
Howard Rust, Jr., is in Metro City after a lengthy series of bus rides and catching his breath on a bench in an impeccable state of repair while the world just goes on around him. He's not sure how long he's been sitting there, but he doesn't seem to think much of just letting the world around him go by.
He holds up an ad he got in the paper.
"Yep! This is where the store is at," he says aloud, patting the paper with his free hand and a can-do smile, "got to say that this part of the States is awful pretty this year."
He walks through the bustling streets of Metro City, loud and colorful with people of all walks of life. It's always a happening place, underneath the mid-day sky... the beautiful, mid-day sky of swirling green, flickering orange, and what might be accents of octarine to those eyes that can see it.
"Heck, just some time ago it was blue!" He narrates aloud. "Can't wait to get that new camera to capture all this... really breathtaking."
Someone lurches along at a steady pace a ways behind himself. A hand, pale and dessicated by... age? Rests upon the man's shoulder, a low voice rumbling as if to say something. Hesitating? Having trouble thinking of something to say? To be fair, if one were standing behind the man to check out the buns he's done up his hair in, they might be speechless too.
"Hm? Oh, you're an enthusiast too, eh?" He says, turning about-face to whoever just touched his shoulder. "Don't worry about it, I won't be needing this since I know where it's gone in."
He hands the paper over. The other guy fumbles clumsily and slowly, as though... uncertain... as to what they're exactly going to do with this development. They grunt and wave a hand on up high.
"High five? Sure!" He responds with a clap that echoes through the streets and even sends this currently wordless individual staggering back. "All right! I'll be seeing you."
"...Brains?" The bewildered man left behind murmurs, holding up the paper without any seeming desire - or ability - to read it, a glass-eyed, dead stare as discolored saliva drips out of their gaping maw, helpless to do anything to avert the strange man's path.
Down an alley, a group of especially pale individuals look to one another.
"Did that just happen?" One asks. "Did he notice that--"
"He's perfect," another says, "come."
"...I don't think I want a taste of what he's g--"
"No. No. I wouldn't either."
"...Oooooooohhh, that." An understanding is made.
NOW...
Howard Rust, Jr., comes along to the very front of the B&H Photo and Video Supply store as the city grows darker and darker by the minute.
"Thanks a whole lot for showing me the way," he says with no lack of sincerity as he waves off the group of very pale people whom seem to have very inviting gazes and impeccable dental benefits, wherever they work, as he walks along up to Maki.
"'scuse me," the heavy-set Canadian-born man stops a ways short of the Genryuusai ninja as she's wiping off her tonfa, "you wouldn't happen to know something about some tourney thing? Supposed to meet with this Maki Genryuusai," he cheerfully asks.
"I asked 'em if they knew who they were talking about. I mean, a Genryuusai! One of the really famous clans, if you're in on that sort of thing." He says. "I could spot one from about a mile away. Would you know her?"
He asks this completely unironically.
An out-of-towner might consider the sky pretty around the city. For the natives? The sky is usually the last thing concerning them, especially in the uglier parts of the city. People are more worried about what might be behind them than above them, and usually, that's a good fear to have.
Of course, some of them know how to take advantage of this kind of thing. One 'Scratch' Carter knew how to do some things above street-level that would make even regular neighborhood inhabitants boggle. A lot of guts and confidence, and a little bit of reckless disregard for safety.
It didn't help when a huge chunk of the city suddenly got sucked into the Twilight Zone, sure, but it helps keep her above the fray when things get even crazier than usual. So it's no surprise that when one Howard Rust arrives, her partner is nowhere to be found except up. "Man. You're even more lost than the usual tourists we get from France," mutters the cyan-haired girl, squatting above on the B&H sign above the shop's entrance., precariously balanced with her skates. "I assume you're the Rust guy the creepy crawlies partnered me with?"
Those strange people don't bother Maki too much. Most likely because if they tried anything funny with her, they'd be on the receiving end of her tonfa rather quickly. After all, it took less than ten seconds for her to take down a crazed fan who wanted to get a bit too close and personal that time before a fight, so those things couldn't give her that much trouble either. As for this guy, though, Maki's a little uncertain about him at first. When he makes the statement about the Genryusai clan and all that, Maki sneers a little as she turns to face him.
"Listen," Maki says with narrowed eyes, "I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt and presume you're not being sarcastic or some kind of a kiss-up to me. I am, indeed, Maki Genryusai, and I hope for your sake that you realize that your ability to spot famous people has failed you." She points her tonfa at Rust. "I hope you're aware that I'm taking a big leap of faith fighting out here like this."
Then Maki looks up at Scratch, and her face contorts into a scowl. "And just WHAT the hell are you doing up there?" Maki points her tonfa at Scratch. "If you're one of those extreme sports girls..." Her voice fades as she realizes who Scratch is, and she shakes her head with an angry sigh. "All right, you two are the ones who are gonna take me on in this fight, huh? Well, I'm warning you now, I'm not holding anything back against either of you." She twirls her tonfa a few times with one hand before gripping it tightly again. "We've got a fight to do, so let's get it on!"

There is something about this man that seems... strangely detached, on some level, from the surrounding reality. He appears human, at least. At worst, someone or something that fails to understand that doing up his hair in buns is not something a human male culturally... does, typically speaking.
He looks up to see the girl in the cyan hair speak, at which point he waves a hand on up high.
"You bet!" He waves along. "They were talking about someone else too, guessing that's... her, then," he gestures to Maki, to which he says to Scratch...
"Hello there, Maki Genryuusai! I'm Howard Rust, Jr., and--"
Maki is quick to correct him after this blunder. For his failure to properly identify her for being Maki, he seems to put emphasis on her family. What, exactly, does he know about them...? (If anything, considering who he just confused for Maki...!)
Even as she scowls and lectures, Rust Jr., for all intents and purposes, doesn't seem to be taken back too much by her irritation.
"Oh, sorry about that," he kind of laughs it off with a wave of a hand. How can he laugh at a time like this? Is he not aware of what's been going on around him?!
"Well, I won't keep you waiting with," he says as he steps back out into the almost completely abandoned streets. Interesting individuals look on, many of curious postures indicative of either deformed spines, or maybe a lack of care of how they're bending them. Some cast less than human silhouettes, for what light is actually there.
Up above, a loud noise fills the air. There isn't an immediate cause that can be seen, but those creatures aware of any sense of danger think it best to flee on the spot.
"Ladies and... gentleman," one tall, dark-clad individual of the most hypnotic gaze imaginable seems to see it fit to avert their eyes with an inhuman hiss, "please, if you will, take your places..."
Howard Rust, Jr., maintains that smile throughout. "Never thought I'd see the day I'd lock weapons with a Genryuusai," he says as he withdraws a length of pipe from a worn toolbelt, sounding all too eager as opposed to... afraid? Uneasy? Absolutely nothing about this situation should warrant excitement or comfort, and yet... and yet...!

Scratch looks at Maki, scowling right back at her from her perch. "What's wrong with extreme sports? Aside from the fact that it's pointless here right now, with..." She points up, before hopping off the sign and finally reaching street level. Landing next to Rust, she looks to the lost young man, shaking her head. "Well, this explains a lot," she grumbles, rolling her wheels back and forth on the street as she looks between her partner and heropponent. "So this is just another fight, right? No stupid things they're going to throw at us, right?" she asks, muttering....until the loud sound appears in the air.
Reeling back, she shields her eyes...then glowers at the dark clad man above them. "Oh, great..." SHaking her head, she rolls back, alongside Rust. "I'm getting real sick of all of this shit," the jaded young girl sighs. Bad enough the city is bad as it is, now demons. She'd be more freaked out if she wasn't so fed up.
"It's not that I have anything against extreme sports per se," Maki says as she moves back while Scratch comes down. "It's just that this isn't the best place for them." Then that loud noise occurs, and Maki looks around, seeing that dark clad man. Maki narrows her eyes again and grips her tonfa tighter. She wants to speak but no words come to her mouth. All that comes is a sneer that indicates Maki is definitely not happy with what's going on here. Once she has had her moment of rage, she looks to Rust and says, "Trust me, unless you're more skilled than you seem, you'll think twice about wanting to lock weapons with me again!" Looking between the two fighters then the dark clad man, Maki waits a little longer, as if expecting something else to happen. When that doesn't happen, Maki simply shrugs and gets into her fighting stance.
"So as they say in France," Maki adds, still not smiling in the least bit as she stares at Rust, "En garde!" Maki twirls her tonfa a few times before attempting to come in quickly with her tonfa as if to prove her point about matching with her.

Silently, a few gestures are made from the... well, it's not specific to say 'strange man' considering there's at least one in the ring. Let's say the strange one trying to play announcer, who thankfully catches the swift beginnings with the blink of an eye, signaling to someone else with a working camera.
Yet another flits away with a hiss as the red light comes on, as though they were being overly cautious about infrared lights for whatever reason. Maybe they're just playing it safe in regards to the use of any lights not within the visible light spectrum to the human eye?
"Fight!" It's almost an afterthought, given how quick and decisive Maki moves in. She makes a decisive point, indeed, what with how the tonfa jabs up against the side of the man's face with such speed and ferocity that his saliva glints in the odd... day... night... hell??? Sky. Hell sky?
He staggers back dramatically and clumsily, a notable bruise forming on the side of his face.
Moments later, right where he was standing, a large chunk of concrete crashes against the ground, exploding into a fine, possibly asbestos-filled powder that splashes debris everywhere and emits a foul-smelling, lung-choking mist of fine particles.
"Whoo!" The strange man that's actually a part of the fight wipes the side of his mouth. "That was a close save, right there! Thanks a whole bunch, heard your clan was good people," he says as he stands up, stretches out... and points the pipe towards Maki, as if to track her movements.
As opposed to thinking about running, assuming that's not the only thing to fall from the sky...
(...Don't look up.)

Snorting at Maki, Scratch adjusts her gloves and her headphones, already not liking the girl with the tonfas whatsoever. Even if she can tell the other woman is far more skilled, the skater's already made it a personal goal to smack her arrogant opponent across the jaw at LEAST once this fight.
Which is a goal that looks already rather dim considering the swiftness she takes to cracking her partner across the face. "Shit," she mutters, rolling askew and away from Rust to clear out the path, as well as force Maki to fight in two directions. Though with her moving this briskly, she breathing even more heavily than the others, meaning the powder and ash sifting around the air affects her all the quicker.
Coughing out some of it, she grunts before making a straight line toward Maki from the side. Dropping down low after a fast break, she extends out one foot, rear wheel still in contact with the ground while the other foot slides along tucked underneath her outstretched leg. The aim is to collide straight into Maki's ankle and trip her up, but hopefully even if she misses, she's in a good place to get away and regroup.

Things are coming from the sky, and the dust they're giving off is making her choke a little. She wipes her eyes as they start to tear and then, thinking instinctively, dives to the side believing something's coming down on her. Well, there is something coming AT her, but not down on her from above. That something was Scratch, who almost took her down, but thanks to Maki's super agility, she missed. Of course, there's still that stuff around her which is causing her to gag a little.
"What is this, some kind of a joke?" Maki asks when she can talk. "Well, I don't like it... and I don't like YOU trying to take me down like that!" Maki attempts to strike at Scratch's legs with her foot.
Up above, high above, the Sincerity Investments Building is tall enough that it dares to pierce the sky of this strange world. Bit by bit, piece by piece, the building's hubris is awarded with ruin and decay. From there, gravity keeps taking over.
Pieces fall on either side of this makeshift street arena in front of the photography specialist store, and each hit is disastrous. Small craters form with every piece of debris, and the already low visibility of this crazed hell-realm goes lower with every spewing cloud of dust.
Rust's coughs are lost in some of the cacophony of destruction, but his visual form - to the absolute contrary - is not. With a deft leap that seems to defy his overweight stature, his advancing age, and the fact he's wearing flip-flops, he actually steps up off a nearby piece of concrete as a platform and leaps into the air...
...Then off another falling piece...
...And one just above!
Arcing his back as he leaps up high above the haze, there's a glint in his eye and a smile on his face as he looks down upon Maki and Scratch alike. Bringing a hand into his toolbelt, he withdraws three screwdrivers to go between his fingers. It's a picturesque scene, casting an otherworldly glow against the backdrop of this hideous landscape.
Then he gets clipped by a falling piece of rock and he gasps loudly in shock, clumsily and haphazardly flinging the screwdrivers in a wide, vaguely triangular shape where Maki currently crouches to show up Scratch for her initiative.
...He'll probably be okay on the way down.
Maybe.

Missing the slide kick aimed at Maki's ankles, Scratch is quick to pop back to her feet, pushing off the ground with her hands and twisting back up in a rather flashy way. Questionably efficient, sure, but it's what works for Scratch, especially when Maki is already bearing down at her , rushing in to sweep out at her own feet. Falling back back, she manages to catch the kick with her wheels rather than her ankles. It's unorthodox, but it means her entire leg manages to take the shock rather than the those vulnerable joints.
Rolling back again, Scratch coughs. Looking up, she finally starts to notice what's going on above them, and curses to herself...though clearly loud enough for everyone else to hear. "Shit!" Pushing away off the ground, she avoids one piece that falls where she had fallen, then follows Rust's suit, using the rest as stepping stones back toward Maki. Her breath gets ragged and raspy, the dust making her high pace all the more risky. But she's not about to give up on her style yet, leaping off one wide piece back to Maki, extending an arm out for Maki's hair on the way down and trying to twist her down with the momentum of her fall.

"Who picked a time like THIS to schedule a demolition?!" Maki asks angrily, watching as her attack is deflected by Scratch. Acting quickly, Maki leaps away from Scratch, just barely avoiding another piece of debris hitting her, and lands just in time to bring her arm up to deflect Rust's incoming attacks away. "Of all the stupid luck, me, a Genryusai ninja having to face you two in a place that is nothing like my hometown!" She shakes her head, almost as if to get the dust out of her hair, though it's not easy given how much is swirling around. "But I got myself into this fight, might as well get out of it."
Then she turns to face Rust once again. "You think those toys are gonna faze me? Think again, kiddo!" Maki takes a few running steps, then flies towards Rust with her leg outstretched. "I'll show ya hurt!"

The larger, older man deemed 'kiddo' is coming in fast after getting glanced by some falling debris, quickly spiraling out of control of his ability to make any sort of smooth landing or otherwise gauge how far up he is thanks to that collision with the crumbling construction.
Maki flies upwards with a single, confident, piercing kick that goes through the dust. Rust is a spiral of chaos, taking his pipe in both hands.
"Hey, sure!" He replies, somehow, coughing once. Pipe in both hands, he whirls in whatever direction he's going in relation with the ground (one would assume 'down,' but when you are an experienced fighter this sort of thing has more nuance than just what the laws of gravity usually spell out).
Closer and closer, ninja versus ninja. A whirling pipe strike, a lunging kick....
There is a mighty clash that rings out, blowing aside the granular mists that briefly obscure them, and for a split second there's a clear connection of Maki's leg neatly deflecting the pipe strike - and the rest of him with it - sending him on a corkscrew down into the storefront with a veritable explosion of glass, paper fliers, and a now shattered neon 'OPEN' sign that hadn't had any power go through it since all this began to happen.
Moments pass, and it's not clear to begin with if he's--
"I'm all right!" The man calls out, holding up a bloodied arm. "Not my first run through glass. It happens."
One of the pale men of a persuasive gaze looks incredibly conflicted about whether or not to stand where they are, or to go forth and partake in the unspoken invitation of shed blood to feast.
They once again reconsider given the initial evaluation of the man's character.
Her impromptu leaping attack avoided after a leap from the ninja, Scratch manages to land on her feet, a good thing as she's forced to hit the ground rolling and curl away from more debris. At this point, she's forced to to pull the front of her shirt over her mouth, her breathing becoming even more scratchy as the dust and debris keep coming down. It's good she's used to moving a lot, because she's doing a whole lot of it, as things keep falling above them.
Letting her older partner handle the direct approach, Scratch continues to wind around, trying to find an opening that she can use to slice in and attack from the side or something. Unfortunately, his attempt at intercepting Maki's attack brings another loud curse to the skater's lips, seeing the result. "Goddammit!" she shouts, running over to her partner's side. "Come on, get up," she mutters, trying to pull him out of the mess, bloodied arm and all. "Hate to admit it, but she's too fast for me to catch. Seeing as you're the only one of us able to keep her feet glued, I need you on your feet, capice?" She grumbles, tone making it obvious this isn't out of altruism.

Maki shouldn't exactly call older people kiddo. It's just a bit of a sarcastic comment personally. And given how things are going right now, being outnumbered and having a lot of debris coming down from who knows where, she's got a good reason to be very negative. Especially with another bit of debris almost hitting Maki as she lands from her kick, stepping out of the way just in the nick of time, but the dust causes a few more coughs from her. "If this is what fighting in hell is like," Maki comments, "Then I'm going to make sure I live like a saint the rest of my life!" She dusts her vest and tonfa off after that as well, before looking to Scratch and Rust.
A pause as the two are decided upon mentally. "You can say what you want, girl," Maki says as she steps towards Scratch. "But there's no way you can glue my feet down. Do what you want, I'll just dodge it more!" Maki steps closer. "I've dealt with many types of opponents, both in the fighting circuit and while battling the Mad Gears, so if you want to keep fighting me with your skates, then that's your decision." She attempts to grab at Scratch and perform a swift over-the-shoulder throw.

"But I wouldn't advise it much longer," Maki says as she successfully throws Scratch. "You're gonna need better footing if you want to keep up with me!"
"Ahh, it's not that bad," and on what grounds does this man claim that, when the light of the sky has been sealed away to be replaced by this demonic realm's aetherial decor, when such interesting... people... walk the streets, and those who cling to normalcy are all hunkering down in fear?
Maybe it's entirely about the hit he took, as Scratch helps him up and out. He does not look the part of anyone who can really keep track of Maki's quick speed and nasty strikes, all but staggering and even tripping on his face when he gets out of the shattered storefront. Well, almost, he manages to catch himself with the pipe.
"Thanks for helping me up with," he murmurs, as Maki all but shuffles up to snatch the Scratch and he just sidesteps another small piece of twisted metal - part of the photography store's own display, thanks to some of the debris up top prying some of the decorations free.
"Anyway, hey, me too!" He chats along with Maki even as he staggers towards her. While the world is falling apart around him. And things are being written in sentence fragments. All falling. Apart. All. It.
...
"Whoop!" He staggers forward, having to use his free hand to try and catch himself up against Maki. Assuming he does, he starts to stagger along up against her like she's some kind of ladder, kicking and climbing upwards into what could be an impressive kickfli--
Wait, was he even staggering at all to begin with?
Pulling Rust back up to his feet, Scratch is forced to sacrifice her time and a shot at Maki to get her partner back on track, and it bites her in the ass, when Maki comes after her particularly. Trying to get herself out of the way, she ends up only thrown over Maki's shoulder with a swift move, her back slamming into the ground painfully with a loud cough. The coughs only grow louder as she pulls herself onto her feet, struggling with the air both from the landing and the increasingly toxic air.
"Guh hughhh....you think I sit on my ass letting Mad Gear bastards do as they please?" she growls, letting Rust take to the attack first...and watching him stumble. "...what..." She's regretting wasting the time to help him it seems. Shaking her head, she charges in herself, buidling speed and trying to come in low at the back of Maki's ankles...just as Rust seems to straighten and tries to climb up her into a kickflip? Ok, maybe it wasn't a bad idea after all....

Being caught by Scratch means that she's finding it a bit hard to keep herself planted on the ground. But it also means that she's able to avoid being caught by Rust's attack. In fact, just as she's hit by the attack from Scratch, Maki rights herself and twists around, landing on her feet just as she feels like she's being hit the hardest. All while slipping away from her opponents for the time being. Then she coughs even harder, the expenditure of air leaving her lungs more vulnerable for another coughing fit. "Damn, why now of all times?" Maki gets out in between coughs, trying to cover her mouth with her non-tonfa arm. She finishes coughing then wipes her eyes again.
"This whole thing is making me feel sick in more ways than one," Maki comments to both of her opponents, rushing forwards as more debris comes down towards where she was. "Namely in that I'm sick of this fight, and I think we should increase the intensity, don't you think?" Maki seems to be aiming primarily at Scratch as she drops down onto the ground and begins spinning around like a human whirlwind. The dust will really kick up now... and so will Scratch if she doesn't get out of the way quickly.
Maki, having deftly avoided Rust's attempt to find support and/or climb up all over her - is left to appear to genuinely stagger. He waves the pipe around to try to clear away the foul, choking air that up until now he appeared to have a grand old time being able to speak over. His lungs are a bit overdrawn in whatever this mess is.
Maki is, for the moment, a bit of an afterthought as he tries to fan off the surrounding air with a number of vigorous swings, further insipid idiocy brought to a halt as he coughs several times in sequence.
The way he casually tries to fan the air even as a huge chunk of concrete - one that was but a yard away from crushing him then and there! - in the face of mortal danger and uncertainty may well make him seem that much greater a threat to good sense and sanity as opposed to the glowing, bright, whirling kick of Maki.
Incidentally, in his attempts to clear the air with a few pipe swings, he might bang that pipe against her leg. Given the speed that leg's flying at, and the angle that accidental(?) pipe swing comes in while he's otherwise occupied with the air he's breathing rather than OH MY GOD WE'RE GOING TO BE CRUSHED AND LEFT TO ROT IN THIS HELL REALM...
...Well, one issue at a time, one supposes.

Scratch manages to pitch in underneath Maki and lift her up from behind, even if it means disrupting Rust's attack a little too much. While she's glad to finally have tagged the cocky ninja woman, she was hoping to have gotten in a tandem attack instead. "Damn," she mutters, whipping around again, and taking the time to pull her shirt front over her face again in that makeshift breathing mask. NOt that it does much of a job from the way she's already coughing.
"Fine by me." Words to life and die by, clearly, as when Maki plants herself in and spins her glowing leg out like a hurricane, the skater is caught up in the storm. Flung back, she manages to avoid crashing into a window like Rust did, but for all the good it does her, painfully skidding across the street across the rubble strewn already The kick certainly did its number on the slater, but she's not about to lay down yet. Despite the blood and scratches on her, she seems even more amped up as she gets to her feet. "Ok...now it's ****ing on...." she growls.
Kicking off the ground, she charges in, and once she's got enough speed, she leaps, turning over onto her side and seemingly barrel rolling straight toward the ninja. Except rather than just using her body to attack, her legs stretch outward, like trying to do a near-split in the air, causing her feet to stick out like a blender blade, wheels cutting through the air with faint glowing energy.

A huge pipe like that can and will hurt quite a bit. Maki's been hit by quite a few of them by Mad Gear punks. She ducks down quickly, but that only leaves her open to the incoming attack from Scratch, which hurts quite a bit. She drops to the ground, lying face-up and then looking in time to see another piece of debris coming at her. Rolling like a log to the side, Maki quickly rolls back onto her feet and dusts herself off.
This time, there is no dialogue. Instead, Maki keeps her focus on Scratch as she rushes at her, apparently intent on keeping the battle between her going strong. She attempts to give Scratch a taste of how she's feeling with a swift whack of her tonfa.
"Hoo!" For the moment removed from the ensuing melee between heroic ninja and provocateur on wheels, the aging Canadian-born handyman ninja of extremely questionable judgment and hair fashion sense - which one being moreso a thing for debate - finishes waving off the dust in the air for what little good that'll do it.
The mysterious individuals who have gotten everyone together for this seem a bit less approving - this is all supposed to be a fight for not just the future of Metro City, but perhaps humanity as a whole. These fighters should be here to prove SOMETHING, shouldn't they? Yet...
He slowly turns back towards the fight, between the sequences of colorful energy, of anger-laden strikes, of anything and everything about two dwellers of Metro City who are under such incredible duress over this awful circumstance. They all could be jumped by bloodsuckers at any time, sucked into the darkness of whatever twists people into... whatever the afflicted become.
He hardly seems cognizant nor caring of it, stretching his arms out. "Right! Right then."
He takes a few steps towards Maki's back, casually as though someone just simply walking and not at all in a manner that suggests the intent of stealth, tapping the pipe towards her back while she's going in for that jab.
"Appreciate the breather," he says, "but I'm just fine! Thanks for the consideration, but I'm a bit more... rough and tumble than that," and he's trying to prod her more as though it were to grab her attention, not... knock the wind out of her.
A small rock that bounces off his upper back adds a little bit of extra force. "Oops!"

Landing after her Bio Slash, Scratch wavers a bit to regain her balance, given the amount of stuff she needs to weave around and roll over to avoid the further collapsing debris. But she hit the ninja woman good, she knows that much, and that's enough to spur her on even further, confidence bringing her adrenaline rush to another level.
So when the jab comes in, Scratch is confident enough to pivot away and spin from the strike. It's a dodge by the barest of hints, catching on the sleeve of Scratch's shirt but otherwise avoided. The provocatuer doesn't dwell on how close it was, instead focusing on bringing the fight to Maki all the more. "Get bent!" she shouts to Maki, trying to do another vault off another piece of falling debris just like before, and grabbing for Maki's head, just like before. The difference this time? Her limbs splay out wide, trying to make sure she can grab a piece of Maki even if she tries to hop away, and use that purchase to pull herself in to plant skated feet HARD into the ninja's chest.

Maki gets caught by the pipe again, but this time it hits her in a way that she can avoid Scratch's incoming attack. Unfortunately, with that and the fact a piece of debris grazed her head, Maki's really losing her patience with these two. "I can't believe I got suckered into this. I'm so going to make sure Guy never hears about this... or else!" She then turns to face Rust, scowling once again. "And hitting me with that pipe? Where would you come up with such an idea? That's not how you hit someone with a weapon!"
Maki narrows her eyes a little more as she twirls her tonfa a few times, before gripping it again. "Let me show you how you hit someone with a weapon! Like THIS!" She swings her tonfa in a wide arc, attempting to hit hard.

That tonfa goes in a wide arc, and the older, larger, dimmer man just sways his head back slightly as though it's not much of an effort...?
In reality, he's reeling from that rock that just beaned him. The hissing that escapes through bared teeth makes the whole motion seem more conscious, tense, and closer a call than it probably is, even as the displaced air of the tonfa swing threatens to undo his, er, immaculately styled hair.
"That does seem like a way you would hit someone with a weapon, you bet!" He says in agreement, bereft of any detectable sarcasm. "See, most ninja types, they're pretty secretive. I can understand that, but you know, it's--"
He coughs. The air, it's back! It never left, now that part of the storefront nearby has collapsed under the weight of what has been falling on top of it for a while. The collapse creates a bit of a slope, enough for some debris to start rolling anew.
"Hmm? Whoop--" He leaps straight up as one rolls towards him, touching on the top and otherwise clearing it.
He probably doesn't mean to accidentally give it an extra kick to roll a bit quicker, a bit harder into where Maki stands, but sometimes in a split-second reaction of life or death - even for complete, utter idiots like himself - these sorts of things happen by accident, or at least the confidence that a fellow ninja's already on the ball.
Or being rolled over by the ball-shaped debris.
Either or, really.
Faltering a bit as Maki avoids her completely despite her attempted countermeasures, Scratch is forced to scramble a bit to avoid landing awkwardly on the rapidly building debris on the street. Her breathing is reaching a peak, judging from the way she's starting to truly rasp right now. But she's not about to slow down yet if she can help it. She has to prove herself even if a little bit.
Charging, she ducks and twists around the rest of the falling debris that rains down near her, trying to get back into range of Maki while she's busy with Rust. As Rust ends up sending a huge chunk rolling toward Maki, the skater punk tries to come in from the side, ready to strike should the ninja try to avoid the hunk of rock from the side. Trying to pounce in close, Scratch pulls out something she'd been storing in her cargo pants, and had been rattling about earlier: spraypaint. Flicking the cap off with her thumb, she pushes what minor reserves of energy she has through the can as she shakes it, spraying out a force-ful of charged up krylon straight at the ninja's face and hopefully blind her, if only just a little bit....
Because she'll need all the help she can get when she finally crashes from her adrenaline rush and near collapses to the ground, hacking and struggling to breathe regularly.

Rust is really on the ball there. Maki is knocked for a loop, meaning that she avoids Scratch's incoming attack quite perfectly, but leaving her dazed, confused... and gasping for air as more dust gets into her lungs. She coughs quite a bit, even patting herself on the back a few times like it will help. She shakes the dust out of her hair and rubs her eyes a little. "How much dirtier can I get? No wait, I don't want to know." She then looks down at a piece of debris at her feet and picks it up.
"It's not a traditional ninja weapon, but I don't care!" Maki yells at Rust. "You work with hardware, so try this on for size!" She yells as she hurls the small piece of debris at Rust.

"You all right there, mis--" He coughs, as the collapsing of the photography store is no doubt introducing its own chemical cocktails into the air around the three of them. "I sure hope she's okay," probably referring to Maki, "that was a pretty big on--"
Maki's yelling confirms otherwise, unaware of how briefly she may have been a Maki pancake, and he seems a bit relieved about it. These three people and their struggle may well set a course for humanity's future within this cursed, dangerous land so far removed from normalcy.
Why does he seem so unperturbed by any of this?
As Maki challenges him to try them on for size, he stands between Maki and Scratch - ostensibly shielding Scratch from whatever's being thrown at them - as he thrusts his right hand forward in a straight, open palm, throwing a leg down in a stomp (which - yes, of course, loosens up more horrible lung-hating particle matter) into some stance that appears at least half-way serious.
The debris deflects neatly off said hand like a droplet of water off a properly sealed wall, perfectly going back at an arc that can realistically be considered in Maki's direction as he maintains that smile on his face.
"I'm more of an extra, extra, extra large, but thank you!"
As he says this, an especially large piece is starting to roll down the slope, but... more on that one... next round...
It's a lucky thing, Scratch supposes, that despite her rather ill-timed collapse after trying to spray Maki in the face with her paint, the skater is allowed time to pick herself back up. She's still not looking too good, face and eyes red as she continues coughing. And she doesn't seem to be popping up too fast or moving very fast, only just managing to weave away from the constant barrage of things falling down at them right now.
Still, she manages to get herself out of the way of most. The rest, generally what Maki is throwing at them, Rust manages to stop and knock back toward Maki. "...thanks," Scratch manages to get out, realizing what Rust did. But no time for more than that little bit of gratitude. Instead, she tries to regain her old pace, rushing Maki again, then spinning, elbow wheeling backward to try and slam into the ninja girl's chest with the momentum built up.

As the elbow comes at Maki, she sees yet another piece of debris coming right at her. She jumps out of the way of both the attack and the debris, before looking and seeing that her thrown piece is coming back at her rather fast. Thinking quickly, she raises her tonfa and deflects it away. Then she has yet another coughing fit. "Damn it," She says out loud. "I really hope Guy doesn't see this now!" She takes a moment to stop coughing, though with all the dust around it's not as easy as it should be. With her free hand, Maki also rubs at her eyes, trying to get the dust out of them.
Once her vision is returned and she's stopped coughing, Maki turns to face Scratch once again. "You're welcome," Maki replies with total sarcasm mode activated. She then attempts to follow this up with a whack of her tonfa to emphasise the point.
That exuberant comeback and all that oxygen it eats up gets paid back with interest as he loses Scratch in their advance to bring the fight back to Maki. His... strange comfort in all this situation can't quite seem to completely stay afloat of all the dust and grime in the air while the sky falls on them.
"Oh yeah, Guy, too!" He says in the heat of the moment while the two women are exchanging simple, cautious blows their oxygen intakes and fields of vision allow them. "I'd sure like to meet him--"
There's a very, very, very big rolling piece of debris coming down quick. Is he even aware that he's in its path? Now's not the time to really... fanboy about any of this, if he is.
There's a coughing fit that goes with this request, as he waves his right hand about in a completely futile gesture to improve the air quality in this off-beat dimension, waving a pipe around with similar intention but equal lack of effect.
"Hm, I'm beginning to think--" really, Howard Jr., really, "--things are getting a touch dead-- HA CHOO!"
With this thunderous sneeze, so too does his left arm - the one holding the pipe - surge back with a start, tapping it up against the large boulder debris that previously stood to run them over.
Against all sense of physics in regards to the size and momentum of the huge thing as opposed to the size and traction of the far smaller thing, it abruptly stops. Feeling an odd jerking sensation in his left shoulder, he actually thinks to look back up and behind him.
"Huh. Would you look... at that! Almost got... squished... flat," he's somehow got a smile on his face even as his dialogue gets fractured by choking noises. Maybe it's equal parts laughter and choking?
Fractures form up top. The interesting pale gentlemen manning the camera(s) and observing the fight look upon with wider eyes.
"Well... crisis... averted," he says as he walks off to the side once to catch his breath, holding a hand up against the stopped boulder, slightly knelt over.
A wedge-shaped section cracks off and slides down, narrowly avoiding clipping the man's head based on his decision to kneel down and take a breath, just flips barely over Scratch by its tip, and threatens to smash Maki.
The nearby camera crew already is fleeing to find marginally less dangerous places to stand to keep filming the battle.

Things are getting crazy right now, but Scratch, despite her heavier and scratchier breathing, is still aware enough to manage up a defense. Even as her rushing elbow is slipped away from, she's able to bring up her ownguard, arms moving to protect herself as the tonfa slams toward her. THe strike still manages to get the wind out of her sails as it pushes her away, just underneath the huge chunk of debris flying back as Maki. "NGhh...."
Rolling back up to her feet and skidding to a stop, the skater grumbles and coughs a little louder. "Goddamn slippery..." she mutters, another cough covering up her curse. "Hold her off!" she shouts out to Rust before she starts skating around in a wide arc. Trying to stay out of Maki's range of influence, and give her some idea of where she can strike out.

Debris coming at Maki again, this time bigger than before, and Maki doesn't want any part of it. Unfortunately, while she may not want to be part of it, the debris does want to be part of her. She's crushed by it and finds herself in a world of hurt as she struggles to get free. Once she manages to do so, being a ninja and all, she struggles to get up, finding her body racked with pain. Then, in a surprise turn of events, Maki doesn't have another choking fit. No, instead she has a sneezing fit instead! Unfortunately, those sneezes add more pain to her body, which has her feeling a lot more annoyed than previously.
"Clever trick, but I don't know if it will be enough," Maki comments as she rushes towards Rust. "Because this time, I'm holding NOTHING back!" She attempts to launch into a flurry of attacks against Rust at a fast rate of speed, obviously showing that she's really mad now!

All around, Sincerity Investments is falling down. Joining the strangely circular bits of structure and lettering are bent girders, desks, papers... it's all coming down, and fast. They might be shooting holes all the way down through the sewers beneath - if that is what is beneath the streets in this realm, any more.
Rust looks up to see Maki crawl out of that slapstick-y situation (that was also a sticky situation, if not so much a slap situation) as he coughs it up. His free hand goes to his mouth in what is probably the first sincere bit of humanity and acknowledgement of something really terrible happening. Scratch, still, asks that he hold her off.
Easier said than done! It's Maki Genryuusai, with her irrepressible spunk and demand she won't be holding anything back. She makes her claim to the style of Bushin-ryu known to Guy out there - if he's even seeing this - with a flawless combination of strikes, bending the will of the world's energy to every blow. It's fast. Very fast.
His only grace is that his back (well, his side, depending on how he contorts with the blows) is up against a very large piece of debris. It sandwiches him there, true, but it also gives him something to hold his free hand up against to keep steady as she whacks away at him.
"Hooo-aaaackpth!" He can't decide if he's grunting in pain, hacking up a lung, or having a good laugh at having his ribcage and chin beaten in for good measure as he holds the pipe up high in his left hand, as if waiting for the perfect break in the action.
"I-I don't hold anything back," he stammers through the blows, "'cept for mayonnaise," what?
This probably counts as a relevant battle cry as the pipe, now held at the apex of how high he can lift his left hand straight into the sky, down into the asphalt.
The entire ground shakes violently for that one moment.
A camera guy (ghoul?) shrieks as the recording camera falls out of its tripod, barely saved.
The entire cloud of dust that had somehow found a way to settle on the ground is kicked up anew in an impact greater... well, probably equal, at minimum... to when some of the bigger chunks of the nearby building hit the ground. The seismic force is incredible for that one glorious moment.
Rust's form is only barely visible within this newfound cloud of dust. He seems to have thought to have held his breath, given he is no longer coughing to betray his position.
It seems like now is a case of a ninja's finest technique versus another's, as spider cracks continue to form where everyone stands.
Scratch's footing may be unsure in its wake, but given Maki's close proximity to this great, single blast of strength, well...

With Rust managing to take up all of Maki's attention at this point, Scratch continues to wheel around and pick up speed, thankful to get the moment to find an avenue of attack. NOt that she's doing a good job of staying under the radar, with her constant coughing reminding everyone of her presence. "NNghh...." Still, knowing she has some length to attack once she finds her opening is a big boon. She can be patient...patient...
...patient is not Scratch's forte, though. Grunting, shecan only wait for long enough before she rushes in....and it's a good thing she moves when she does. Leaping up, she sees Rust slam the ground, and the entire area shake. Eyes widen, unable to keep her reaction restrained. "Holy shit!" she shouts, even as she aims to grab Maki, and hopefully shove her painfully to the ground with a huge leaping footshove, with the ninja's shoulders as a fulcrum.

Having been on high alert after what just happened, Maki finds no problem in avoiding Rust's incoming attack. Even in her weakened state, her agility hasn't left her one bit. Yet there's still the issue of the incoming attempt to be thrown by Scratch. So Maki decides to teach Scratch a lesson in how to be throwing people around. As soon as Scratch has a hold on Maki, she immediately takes advantage of this to use Scratch's position to grab her shoulders and then implement a handstand on her shoulders.
Then, Maki does something totally unusual. She does a one-eighty somersault putting herself upwards while Scratch is upside-down. Then Maki throws her to the ground from up in the air. Dropping to the ground, Maki shows a little pain as she lands, but still manages to keep herself steady.
...Or does she?
From pretty much out of nowhere, as though a sudden indentation into some body of written work - or maybe a red-inked correction, Rust is just suddenly standing atop a girder that has half-embedded itself into the ground, which casts a shadow over Maki where she stands.
Rust stands with his arms crossed as the dust... uh... doesn't exactly part, but at least gives way to where he is. His very strange hair buns do not sway in any sort of wind or anything of the sort. Arms crossed, he holds the pipe and for a very fleeting second, has the proper look of a ninja on the prowl, staring down below.
"Wow, you're really fast," as if he has to state the obvious, "that's a Genryuusai for--" he coughs. Looks like that dust didn't part /enough/. Oh well...
All it takes is one good downward smack of the pipe to have the girder he's standing on give way and threaten to clobber Maki over the head.
Ok...that hurt.
Scratch had hoped to fling Maki away, but instead, she ends up spiked into the ground herself when the fancy ninja agility trumps her own street-level control. Crashing into the ground painfully, the skater groans, rolling away painfully. She managed to avoid the aftermath of Rust's crazy one-man seismic activity, but that doesn't mean much now. Rolling away, still hacking, the skater regroups her thoughts, looking back as Rust starts to use a girder nearby slam toward Maki. "Christ..." she mutters at the older man, wondering what else he has up his sleeve.
Still, she's not about to let him do all the work. Rushing at Maki again, she leaps into the air and flips backward, holding one foot back while the other lashes outward in a somersaulting kick. As she backflips, her other leg is released, a glowing flash along her skate as the other foot cracks out with extra tension.

A pair of well timed attacks, first from Scratch and then from Rust. Unfortunately, no matter how hard she tries to evade or counter, Maki just can't do it. She's too blinded by the dust and debris, and she finds herself on the receiving end of a huge beatdown. Once all is said and done, Maki is lying facedown on the ground. While small pieces of debris continue to fall around her, almost like they're trying to bury her. She lifts her head and glares a little, while muttering, "If Guy even THINKS of mentioning this, he'll be in so much pain!"
Then Maki's head droops again and her eyes close. Apparently, she's been double-teamed well today, and she's not happy about it. Not to mention, that debris only added insult to injury... or is that the other way around?
Maki is a contender as an heir to the Bushin-ryu style - if any one of them were to face her alone, it is unlikely they would have triumphed. In fact, in that split-second, the spinkick that fails to overcome the upended girder is, at least, enough so that he doesn't come off of it smoothly.
He comically waves his arms as his footing grows unsteady, falling off and rolling along the ground like a (comparatively) rank amateur as opposed to that moment of almost genuine control of the situation, coming to a stop by the cyan-haired skater, all sprawled out on his back as he lies in a veritable pile of matter almost no one should feel comfortable enough resting in (since THE BUILDING IS STILL COMING DOWN)!!
"Careful," he says as he pulls himself up, "that's... that's a Genryuusai, you know--"
"No, I do believe you are the victors," winces someone who has especially pronounced canines, over where they're trying to film the fight.
"Nope, nope." Howard stands up. "They just pop right on back up! You can never call a fight their final one." How does a guy who looks like an out-of-place, completely oblivious tourist... know that much about her family? (If he even does!)
"Any sec now," he coughs, clearing the air with his free hand, "she'll come right back up..."
"She is defeated." Reaffirms the local guy with a very interesting set of teeth. "You have fought with... grace, and... valor," they seem to be fishing for compliments to a man who seems like he got by with as much luck as he did actual ingenuity in using his surroundings, "and determination," they would say to Scratch, with only slightly less hesitation.
Some horrible buzzing noise comes from a ways away, the already dark and strangely colored skies blotted out by... some other darkness and/or interesting sight that coincides with this darkness.
Completely oblivious to this (most likely), Howard narrows his eyes and crouches down to Maki. "You're still good, aren't ya? You're a tough one, you know--"
It's probably up to Scratch to be the one to show actual common sense between the two of them.
The big Method Slicer that Scratch attempts manages to connect somehow, not even aiming to synchronize with Rust's attack (how do you synchronize with a falling girder after all?). But even then, Scratch can't quite stick the landing, falling awkwradly and mostly collapsing as she finally hits the ground. Grunting painfully, she rolls herself over along the uneven ground, face red and tears in her eyes as she's caught in another coughing fit. PUlling herself up while still coughing, she looks on, waiting to see if Maki tries to get up again.
Luckily, one of the 'organizers' steps in, informing her and Rust that they are the victors. "Hey, don't argue right now. If they say its a win, take it," she manages to get out before another fit overtakes her, shirt coming over her face again to cover her breathing. She glances up to the mysterious demon, glowering at him with barely restrained contempt right now. She knows better than to talk back, at least in earshot. As she stands up, she looks up at the still collapsing buildilng above them. "Whatever you want to say to her, say it to her somewhere where shit isn't falling down on us. And where we can breathe." Whether or not Rust follows, she's getting the hell out of here, but now.
"I dunnooooo," he seems skeptical? What isn't to be skeptical of is how there's a whole building about to collapse on them. The collapse's intensity grows greater and greater. More and more space is filled with falling building bits. Some desks. An elevator.
"Huh. Shame about the storefront," Rust mumbles along, as his form disappears in the rubble from Scratch's view. Is he so dim as to not have made it out?! Could he have been flattened along with Maki?
The pile of ruin grows greater and greater. The buzzing sound continues. The interesting people of amazingly scary teeth, for a moment, cast their camera on a wide angle to the escaping Scratch and the uncertain fate of one Howard Rust, Jr. and Maki Genryuusai...
There is one last swell of toxic, eye-watering, lung-killing dust in one final symphony of utter destruction, and it all grows still.
...
...
...
...Two silhouettes appear from the clearing smog, one heavy-set man, one blonde young woman, the heavy-set man limping along as he appears to be helping Maki out...?
"Yep!" Yep, he calls out, in what respect? "She's... she's still in it, all right," his voice is strained as he moves along out from the ruin at the crawl of a snail, "she's sure choking me here at!"
...She's unconscious.
"Kind of... kind of hard to pull her off... ha ha!" He's sure taking being deluded about being choked by an unconscious woman to the apocalyptic backdrop of ruin really well, all things considered...
It may well be the strangest sight today, in a realm that invites no sense of normalcy to anyone, anymore.
From the relative safety some blocks down away from B&H at this point, Scratch collapses to her knees, hacking and trying to expel out all the dust and other crap that had ended up in her lungs over the course of the fight. She's going to need a whole lot of water after this, that's for sure. As she coughs a bit more, she glances back over to the storefront, covering her face with her arms as the collapse is complete. She feels the shockwave of the impact shake the entire area, and she frowns when she sees nothing coming from the dust at first. "Geez, what an..."
Then the two figures emerge from the dust, prompting a prolonged blink from the skater. She doesn't quite get a chance to say it, but 'are you serious?' is a clear unspoken comment from her expression. Both Rust and Maki's emergence, and his...apparent choking by the unconscious Maki? "...." Shaking her head, Scratch is almost tempted to just walk away, and leave the weird man to his own devices. Almost. "Just...get her over here. We'll find some place to leave her for now. This place just ain't safe." Then again, none of Metro City in here is safe, comes her line of thinking....
Meanwhile at the Crimson-Permanente Building
A pair of glasses fall from the rooftop. They fall for a good 30 seconds until a cloud of locusts catch them and they go back up to the roof. They hover for a few moments and then slowly descend as if somewhat confused.
While the building crumbles the locusts then hover throughout the battlefield as if looking for someone hovering by Rust Jr. keeping a distance away when realizing that he isn't the person that they were looking for they hover away until they move back towards the Crimson-Permanente Building. A shadowy figure carrying someone by piggy back steps out of the door raises a hand to the locusts as if taking something from them.
Then that shadowy figure runs away carrying the other person in question.

06.09.2014One thing you will soon discover is that Tarot reading is much more than a form of card divination that can tell us about our past, present and future. The giving of Free Tarot Readings revolves around the the long held belief a set of specific cards, in this case Tarot cards, may be used to achieve insight into the past, the future and the present concerning yourself or a client. The belief in the divination ability in the deck of cards is often linked to the occult nowadays and is frequently tightly linked to various other paranormal and spiritual practices like palm reading and clairvoyant psychic readings.
The decks used in free tarot readings originally appeared in their most recent form the Middle Ages, where the deck was used often for betting and gaming purposes, however much older sorts of the the Tarot may be traced back to age-old Egyptian times, whereby these were employed to try to reveal hermetic wisdom. Contemporary occult uses of Tarot Cards did start to gain acceptance in Western Europe during the end of the renaissance period as Tarot Reading grew to become more common with traveling gypsies who used the Tarot as a method of communicating with strange spiritual guides. The Cards of the Tarot Decks can be split up into 4 unique suits of cards and a compilation of 21 unique image cards. The ways in which each individual card is actually interpreted is determined by the type of tarot deck that is being used along with the position where the card is drawn or placed throughout a online tarot reading.
In addition there are a number of other tarot spreads and various readers will use a number of these spreads throughout the reading.
There was a question on here before like this, but I wanted to see for myself what was up with it. Angel cards always give a positive reading and are great for people who dislike Tarot, but like the idea of a card reading. I think people fear and critisize that which they feel is too estranged from their own beleifs.
Or your god speak to you saying “Dear Child of mine, divination is the tool of Satan. Unless you have something to back up WHY Divination is the tool of Satan, you’re just wasting your time here. Listen, you do a little more research into what Wicca, Paganism, Magick and The Craft are, and then get back to me.

This tarot spread offers a breakdown of the subject’s whole life, making use of Twenty-one cards set up in 7 groupings composed of 3 different cards in each group. In this tarot spread offers a general guide similar to the Horseshoe spread above, but employs less tarot cards.
Free Tarot Readings ares steeped in history from ages ago and give a powerful advice about how we live and ongoing events. I actually want to hear you answer each individual question and share your opinion in DETAIL.
My cousin is a Wiccan and her ex used to call her a Devil Worshipper, and I’ve been called the same because of a pentacle necklace with a moonstone on it. Do any of you know a good website where I can talk for 100% free (without having to give a credit card number) to a psychic? I know it would be a lot easier to just go out and buy a regular deck of tarot cards, but my parents refuse to allow me to get them. There are many types of decks like Aquatic tarot and many types of spread like celtic cross. It does this by enabling us to peer into the areas in our lives that are challenged as well as offering us new perspectives.
It should be pointed out that a number of experts on ancient Egypt have recently cast doubt on this assertion. Some of these decks add an additional picture tarot card, referred to as the Fool or the Joker. Psychic Tarot Readers may also use candles and incense or deep breathing techniques to make certain a individual is relaxed. When a psychic tarot reader is conducting a reading for a querent, they could ask them to cut or mix the tarot deck, to make sure that the deck will develop some kind of spiritual link with the individual.
The ten different tarot cards in this particular tarot spread are utilized to look into the present predicament and what might be creating concerns. They’re one way to channel your will into an object to receive an answer, so to speak.
I give tarot readings all the time to people for fun, and everyone I give them to enjoys learning what each card I draw for them means. Even if the person who created it says the Angel Cards are used as messages from god’s messengers themselves? I loved him with all of my heart so tenderly and passionately unending love and affection .. I myself am a novice tarot reader, i use playing cards instead of tarot and i practice on anybody i can find, lol.
I’m not looking for obnoxious, backbiting answers, but want to hear from someone who actually cares. In essence, the Tarot are mirrors to the self, reflecting our world back at us, and enabling us to peer into our inner beings.
In this tarot spread, the 2nd card is placed over the very top of the very first tarot card. Whatever higher being out there, whether it be your god, or the universe itself, will bring an answer within this reading.
Maybe you were just doing it wrong, although everyone has their own way for going about things. It can help us on our journeys and shed light on the important life lessons we ultimately must learn if we are to achieve personal growth and transformation. This is world of the hidden self, the world of dreams, and the world of one’s personal truths.
This is the realm of the soul and it is often the driving force behind our motivations and behaviors. Not a trick into luring people into some kind of cult or a way to disrespect whatever god you believe in. By exploring the realm of our unconscious, we can truly come to understand our inner workings. The next tarot card looks into the future a couple of months on, and then the 7th card drawn examining the emotional well-being of the man or woman searching out the answers. The next tarot card picked reveals the effect of the people surrounding the person and the ninth tarot card covers desires and uncertainties.

Wildwood - It’s bad enough that businesses are short staffed. Some businesses are closing due to short staff and/or lack of funds to keep their businesses afloat due to the pandemic. I literally witnessed tourists loading their bags up in wawa with hands full of merchandise. Wawa is an easy target and should have security during this time. Lost prevention must have their hands full! If they steal from our local businesses, they are stealing from us locals!!!

6/30/2021Kura, a leading UK shared transport service provider, has been supporting Vanderlande, in helping prepare for opening a new European fulfillment centre in Dartford, Kent, being built by one of their clients.
Vanderlande, headquartered in Birmingham, is a global market leader for future-proof logistic process automation at airports, in the parcel market, and of process automation solutions for warehouses.
The new building, branded Powerhouse, is being constructed for a leading online retailer on the site of the old Littlebrook power station near the south side of the Dartford Crossing in Kent,. The four-story building will have a gross internal floor area of 2.3 million sq ft, and will be one of the largest fulfilment centres in Europe.
Vanderlande asked Kura to provide a dedicated staff shuttle to help transport a specialist team from their Indian office from Canary Wharf to the Powerhouse site daily from April this year through to an estimated completion date in September 2021.
Kura has ensured all vehicles and drivers fully conform with latest Government guidelines to minimise infection risks, including daily deep cleaning of vehicles plus use of social distancing, face masks and hand sanitiser on board.
The service was not without its challenges, with Kura having to quickly switch vehicles being used from a 49-seater coach to three smaller minibuses due to an urgent request by Powerhouse site security staff to reduce the size of the Vanderlande staff bubble to six people maximum.
The Powerhouse shuttle is the first time that Vanderlande has used Kura, and Kerry Redman, Project Administrator for Vanderlande, has been delighted with the service:
“Kura has been extremely helpful and supportive during the project. Along with the ‘normal’ Covid issues, we also faced challenges accessing the site, which Kura dealt with quickly and professionally, including plenty of communication outside normal working hours. Vanderlande has been really happy with the service received especially how reactive Kura has been in adapting to the changing brief”.
Kura has 10+ years’ experience in corporate transport solutions, sourcing, delivering and managing Home to Work services, staff and contractor shuttles plus VIP transport for high profile transfers, events and tours.

A day in the life of a Contracts Manager
What is a Contracts Manager?
A construction Contracts Manager helps to win building contracts. They also help control costs and keep construction projects on track. Upon receipt of a commercial handover of a contract or new order, a Contracts Manager for Smartroof is responsible for the operational programming of both design and production, as well as the onsite installation of the Smartroof to comply with client build programmes. This includes all onsite health and safety and quality assurance to deliver the end product to the satisfaction of the client.
What is a typical day like for you?
4am: I have a meeting with an architect and builder about a self-build project in Fareham. The one-way journey is 184 miles, travelling on some busy major roads. The journey is 3hrs 20 mins on a good day with no congestion. I always allow for an additional hour on the journey time for traffic, leaving home at 4am to arrive onsite at 8.45am.
9am: An inspection of formation takes place with the client and builder.
10am: I debriefed both the client and the builder on scaffolding requirements, erection sequence, health and safety measures (including the temporary bracing of a free-standing masonry gable wall) and the agreed installation date.
10:30am: Vehicular access arrangements are then organised. As access to the site is restricted, the client is instructed to inform neighbours via letter about the work that will be taking place.
11am: I then have a follow up meeting with Southern Cranes to:
- Size cranes: As there is restricted access with a small working area, we are recommended a 35 tonne city crane or a 40 tonne at half-rigged.
- View overhead obstructions: A BT cable in the crane lifting zone is identified. Instructions are made for this to be removed by the builder prior to roof installation.
- Buried services: The crane is to be positioned offset to the site drive to clear all buried services. Buried services include all the incoming water, electric and gas mains running down the main drive.
- Ground conditions: All ground is made up with a hard core base that has not been CBR (California Bearing Ratio) plate tested to ensure that the ground can take the weight of the crane without destabilisation. The alternative to CBR testing is to provide large crane EKKI mats to reduce the outrigger loadings, reducing the overall ground bearing pressure.
- Site access: As access is restricted with low-level branches from an oak tree, the builder is also instructed to cut back branches that are up to 3 metres.
12pm: I perform a daily weather check on XC Weather for the next day’s deliveries. The Smartroof product comprises of large solid panels and spandrels that act as a sail board in high winds, potentially making the installation a high risk activity, especially on windy days.
Deliveries are strictly controlled to fully comply with health and safety measures. The installation will only occur if the average wind speed is 15 mph (9.80 m/sec) or under. Should the wind speed be too high, the installation is postponed until the wind speeds have dropped to a safe working level.
High winds were identified on two of Friday’s deliveries, so these deliveries are rescheduled with the client, factory, haulier and installation teams and the cranes are cancelled and re-booked.
4pm: The road network is not as bad on the return trip, so I arrive home at approximately 4pm.10 Free Reverse E-mail Lookup For Online Dating Sitestest

Seriously, NBA players and team Owners, is all this negativity that your bringing to basketball really worth it.
I read an opinion the other day regarding the status of the tech world and it fits neatly into what is happening within the NBA. The article mentioned how computer specs don’t matter anymore and ease of use and quickness to applications like getting to the web are more important.
Fans of the game of basketball really don’t care about the intricacies of the labor agreement between the NBA and the NBA players, all we care about is the game of basketball. NBA players are rich, NBA owners are wealthy and at the end of the day neither side is going to do anything significant enough that could change or affect those roles.
Both sides need to be honest and understand that all the back and forth is preventing both sides from making money. Not only are they not making money but if this labor issue goes to the courts and the courts make the decisions, neither side will be happy. Don’t believe me, just look at parents coming out of family court. I have seen and heard stories of one side thinking they had an advantage only to be upset with what the court decided.
It’s past the time to put egos and leverage aside and get a deal done so we the fans can enjoy the game of basketball again.

For added than a ages we saw aggregate but the few capital shops close. Schools bankrupt for alike longer. Parks and area abide locked; activity for walks is discouraged. Marco, a sommelier at a Michelin-starred restaurant, has already acclimated up all of this and abutting year’s holidays while abandoned at home. In a way, these long, aberrant canicule are evocative of airless August in Florence, aback there’s a accumulation departure and anybody (except us) flees to the seaside: restaurants, gyms and cinemas close, streets are abandoned and accompany are gone. We are well-practised at isolation.
Thankfully, we haven’t accomplished abounding aliment shortages; panic-buying was shortlived (there was a weekend aboriginal on area the pasta aisles were emptied) and bounce has brought an affluence of produce. But abrade and aggrandize are still quick to leave the shelves – it seems that anybody is baking their hearts out, us included. Affable has consistently been my ideal antidote and distraction to any botheration – a backing day, heartache, homesickness, writer’s block. There is a affectionate of amenity to affable that makes it accomplishments and joyful. The aroma of a block baking in the oven, or the baking of onion in olive oil, is a familiar, reassuring, heartwarming smell. A affair of authoritativeness during this aeon of so abundant uncertainty.
As a family, affable has kept us not alone aggressive and nourished but has entertained us; it has been article to attending advanced to, to anatomy the continued day around. We may absence activity out on trips, seeing accompany or accepting Sunday cafeteria with nonna, but in abreast I’ve swapped added recipes than anytime – with my neighbour from her window, with strangers over amusing media and with my mother and my mother-in-law over video calls. Affable brings us together, lets us biking with our tastebuds and keeps us affiliated during these demanding times. Marco has active a years-old sourdough activity that never had a adventitious to get off the arena until now. Mariù, my eldest, and I accept been authoritative compound videos of her kitchen endeavours – rolling pasta, authoritative pizza, decorating cakes, flipping, frying, mixing. Luna, the littlest, joins in with egg-cracking and bowl-licking.
I acquisition myself fatigued alike added than accepted to the adeptness of Tuscany’s frugal, simple, inherently abating cuisine, award means to “make do” with what we accept at home. We abatement aback on our favourite ancestors dishes. We aren’t affirmation about whether the kids are bistro their vegetables; we are bistro all the cakes we broil and accepting that bottle of wine for circadian aperitivo – whatever brings a smile and keeps anybody relaxed. Aback it comes bottomward to it, the act of affable itself is as abundant a abundance as the eating.
Chicken and farro minestroneThe admirable affair about minestrone is that you can (and should) acclimate it to what you have. It doesn’t booty abundant accomplishment – aloof a bit of time. I like to use two Marylands (the thigh and drumstick cut out of a accomplished chicken) that baker in the soup, creating their own stock. You alone absolutely charge the meat from one for the soup itself; the blow I’d atom to use in craven sandwiches with mayonnaise, walnuts and celery the abutting day.

Towards the end of the affable time, abscess the pasta in a ample pot of salted (about 1 tsp per litre) of water until al dente, then drain and bung with the sauce. Serve with grated Parmesan.
Bread, angel and jam cakeThis is a rustic, forgiving, pudding-like cake. It’s abating in the best means but it’s additionally frugal, and for me there’s annihilation as acceptable as transforming what would contrarily be befuddled out into article delicious. I save up $.25 of dried aliment until I accept about bisected a large loaf’s worth. You ability like to add a scattering of sultanas or chopped walnuts.

Very adamantine crusts that don’t breach bottomward can be discarded. You can alloy the aliment admixture with an captivation blender or aliment processor, but I usually do this by hand.
Add eggs, sugar, butter, baking crumb and auto to combine. Stir through apples and jam (you can additionally adorn the top by bouncing the jam over the top of the block with a knife already it is in the tin, rather than active it through the concoction – this looks admirable with a aphotic or blithely coloured jam such as blackberry or raspberry).

Consumers are less likely to choose their personal favorite option when making decisions for shared consumption. This effect is weakened when consumers believe that they are similar to others or there is a high-power distance in the society, and is strengthened when they share consumption with their close friends.

Abstract:
This presentation examines the emergence of ethics in national education policies and the Australian Curriculum. During the twenty-first century ethics has gained more recognition and prominence in the national education landscape, this has occurred concurrently with the increasing centralisation and federalisation of Australian school education. However, there has been little discussion about the rise in status of ethics in the context of national school education, or published literature pertaining to this trend. In the light of this deficit, it is timely to analyse the ethical content in national education documents and assess how they are positioned to guide and inform what ethics means in contemporary Australian school education. Key documents analysed for this research include the Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians, the Australian Curriculum, the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers and the National Framework for Values Education in Australian Schools. An exploration of relevant sections of national education policies and the Australian Curriculum leads to a consideration of whether the ethical content identified represents a coherent discourse and specific educational agenda. I argue that a considerable amount of ethical content in national documents has two key purposes: firstly, to foster an understanding of the role of citizenship in democratic society and secondly to promulgate and assemblage of core values designed to engender a sense of shared purpose and identity. However, these two core purposes are problematic as they are predicated on school stakeholders’ acceptance, understanding and action. To pursue these lines of inquiry the presentation will critically examine the nature of the terminology used to express ethical principles and values in national education policies and the Australian Curriculum, and consider different interpretations which can be applied to these terms. Critical analysis will also be applied to investigate the ethical themes and issues in the national education documents. Finally, Aristotle’s notion of phronesis is proposed as a fruitful way in which stakeholders in school education can engage, critique and translate into practice the ethical values and principles that are espoused in the national education documents. Phronesis can serve to give those in schools a means of understanding how ethical precepts can be meaningful and relevant to the context and culture of their school. The presentation is intended to give more recognition to the role of ethics in Australian school education and promote discussion and research regarding how it is positioned in a national context.Daily Paragraph Editing 2 (Teacher’s Guide)

Liminal living: dispersal versus safe sites in a brackish tidal wetland.
We are currently investigating seed dispersal dynamics of a brackish tidal marsh at Rush Ranch Open Space in Solano County, California. Through the evaluation of seed bank surveys, seed traps, and flotation experiments, we seek to understand dispersal syndromes of tidal marsh plants, and how dispersal relates to key processes that shape vegetation patterns in tidal wetlands. In particular, we are interested in whether seed dispersal results in localized seed input, or if the seeds are well-distributed. Further, if the seeds are well-distributed, do the physical gradients of the marsh determine the distribution of species? Previous studies have demonstrated that patterns in tidal wetlands tend to be driven by inter-specific competition as well as tolerance to salinity and inundation, despite ubiquitous dispersal of propagules by taxa established throughout the greater estuarine wetlands of the region. If hydrochory is the principal mode of dispersal, we predict that all areas of the marsh will have representative species from other zones, which the seed banks should directly reflect. Despite widespread dispersal, above ground vegetation in tidal marshes tends to adhere to strict zonation patterns. I predict that the results of these experiments should help demonstrate that different zones are assembled by physical processes, independent of the composition and richness of the seed bank flora. Positioned at the confluence of San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, Rush Ranch and the greater Suisun March complex host an impressive diversity of native California flora, including the federally endangered Suisun Thistle (Cirsium hydrophilum var. hydrophilum). The results of our studies will help inform future management and restoration efforts for the Suisun Thistle, as well as the greater estuarine complex, in the face of myriad effects associated with global climate change and sea level rise.

both Freeserve and [now] Tesco in the UK, but not through my 'default' ISP of
Demon. I have been corresponding with Demon via email, and have had 3
suggestions:
1) Try it again! Very useful - NOT - I pointed out that I have been trying it
again for a number of months with no success.
2) Check that I am not using a proxy - I pointed out I had problems with their
proxy when I first tried it around 5 years ago, and I've never used it since!
3) Let them know the results of 'tracert' from the DOS command
line. (A worthwhile suggestion!) I have passed on the results and I am awaiting
a reply.
Through Demon, tracert managed to go for 12 hops or so to one of
sprintlink.net's devices then started to time out. This may be related to the
problem, but I also tried the same thing with (basically) the same result
through both Tesco and Freeserve. The subtle difference is that while the
requests were timing out, I was still able to load the AdaIC pages through Tesco
and Freeserve (but not Demon)!
I'd be interested to hear if anyone else on the list uses Demon as their ISP
and, if so, whether they can see the AdaIC site through them.
Thanks
John

This one does it with a Gibson Les Paul and a humongous Marshall stack. Or ten. Here’s the cover of a new “unofficial” two-disc set documenting Neil Young and Crazy Horse’s blazing “Ragged Glory” tour of 1991.
Like an electric guitar getting too close to an amplifier and triggering a squall of feedback, today’s time at the writing desk proved a happy accident. I did not even realize it was the great Neil Young’s birthday today when I finally sat down to write a long-promised (to me, at least) review of a terrific new “unofficial” Neil Young CD release for the excellent Collectors Music Reviews website and blog that I contribute to. Anyway, the upshot to the afternoon is that I had some rare leisure hours to listen to (okay, blast at maximum volume is more like it) this “Ragged Glory” tour memento four or five times in a row as I wrote, and then published, my review just in the nick of deadline (in other words, seven minutes before I had to pick up my daughter at day care). Neil Young, who has been making music for five decades now, is a timeless but always timely marvel; a man for all seasons, styles, genres, and moods — and easily one of my favorite artists of all-time for numerous reasons (a few which I’ve attempted to outline below; but hell, if I had realized it was old man Neil’s birthday, I might have run off at the mouth even more … probably just as well that I didn’t). This will have to do for a hasty, but hopefully tasty, birthday tribute.
Neil Young & Crazy Horse — “Buffalo Campaigner,” Recorded live at Memorial Auditorium, Buffalo, New York, February 16, 1991
DISC ONE (69:01): The Star-Spangled Banner (Opening), Hey Hey, My My (Into The Black), Crime In The City, Blowin’ In The Wind, Love to Burn, Cinnamon Girl, Mansion On The Hill,′s “Freedom,” had been a harbinger that Neil (after spending much of the 1980s exploring new textures and techniques) was in the mood to hark back to his halcyon days of softer, more rustic works like 1972′s “Harvest,” the noisy arrival of “Ragged Glory” in 1990 was a tempest that connected his electrical and creative circuits back to the majestic sonic mansions previously found on 1969′s “Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere” and 1975′s .
Here’s Neil doing “Hey Hey, My My (Into The Black)” from his raucous “Ragged Glory” tour with Crazy Horse:
An oldie but a goodie: Neil Young offers a new song to the audience, a little ditty he’s just written called “Heart of Gold”:

Reblogged this on RPM: Jonathan Perry's Life in Analog and commented:
Roll another number for the road: Hey, let’s make it seventy, which is what birthday boy Neil Young hits today. That numeral is pretty significant, both as a marker of age and (I like to hope) progress, and the musically fertile decade that it represents. In Neil Young’s case, the ’70s were very, very good to him (and he was very, very good to them) in a creative and commercial, if not always personal, sense. He lost two friends and co-conspirators, guitarist Danny Whitten and roadie Bruce Berry, to drug addiction and fatal overdoses during the early part of the decade, and their spectral presence — and that of loss itself — continues to haunt and inform his music. in fact, his darkly devastating work, “Tonight’s The Night,” was so claustrophobically mournful that it wasn’t released by his record company until 1975 — two years after it was recorded, and even then only reluctantly after pressure from Young. The album dealt both explicitly and implicitly with those deaths, against a pervasive, shrouding backdrop of dread and loss in general. Though it received mixed reviews at the time and wasn’t a commercial blockbuster, Young has been quoted as claiming that “Tonight’s The Night” is the closest he’s ever come to making “art.” The work, of course, has since come to be regarded as a pivotal masterpiece and a benchmark in Young’s long and prolific career. Rather than stifle or paralyze him, tragedy and grief seemed to fuel Young — perhaps in part due to his having successfully exorcised, or exhausted, his emotional demons. Young released an album for every year of that decade (he again matched that total in the ’80s) — a clip that seems almost unfathomable by a major artist now — and he also wrote and recorded much more that went unissued. That total doesn’t count the occasional times he re-grouped with some or all of his old cohorts in Crosby, Stills, and Nash — or the two solo albums he made in rapid succession — ’68’s self-titled solo shot and ’69’s epochal “Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere” — before the close of the Sixties. He was all of 24 as 1969 gave way to 1970, and he was right: There was so much more to come. These days, Young is as busy as ever, with a telephone-book sized autobiography in the can (and another allegedly on the way). He’s roared through myriad styles and sub-genres, alienated and annoyed at least one record company, and released 13 albums in the last 15 years alone (35 total). Then there’s his ongoing, endless “Archives” multi-media music project entailing the unearthing of a lifetime’s worth of tapes, recordings, tangents, demos, and detours of his massive back catalog. Never obvious, easy, or lazy, Young remains a restlessly, and relentlessly, creative artist who continues to confound and conspire, illuminate and obfuscate, as well as vex and endear, but mostly inspire, his fiercely devoted fan base. In short, he always keeps moving, through intuition rather than calculation, and rolling another number for the road (whether physical or spiritual) to keep himself — and us — going. Which, to me at least, is exactly what an artist, especially one named “young,” is supposed to do.Ah, butt shot cover. The only thing that really bugs me about this cover is that the scratch marks don't look right. I expect them to be parallel with one another. This is the type of thing I get distracted by.. other than the butt.
Anyway, this is the first of what looks to be a series about a female werecat named Faythe. Her father is the leader of the pack, the Alpha, and oversees a territory south of the Missouri and east of the Rockies to the Mississippi. Faythe is one of only 8 unmarried female werecats in the U.S. so she feels overprotected and fights bitterly for her independence. She's the rebel in her household. She is the only female to insist on college, and although she's supposed to be left alone, she knows her father has her under guard. Unfortunately for Faythe, her "independence", such as it is, is coming to an end. Werecat females are being abducted, and she is made to go home for her protection.
There is an excerpt of the first chapter. I read it before I decided to get this book, but the excerpt actually made me worry a little bit that I wouldn't like Faythe. Why? Well.. if you read it, Faythe puts herself in a dangerous situation instead of asking anyone for help. She has options, but feels that she has to prove herself so is willing to get hurt to do so. Well.. this stubbornness is a reoccurring thing. I think one reviewer on Amazon called her "Too Stubborn To Live". I was worried this would drive me crazy, but I was pleasantly surprised that it did not. I can't say the same for everyone who reads this, but I could understand this flaw – she's still growing up, and she's blind to the position her parents have to take. I know someone like Faythe – my younger sister, so maybe I'm just naturally more patient with this. That and as the book progresses, I think we see some of the blinders removed from her eyes. She begins to see things differently and I think she finds out that her independence is really hiding from responsibility. As a reader I also secretly called her spoiled. The only girl, the youngest, she calls her father "Daddy", and even when she's "independent" at college, she bills her father without telling him that she's graduated and signed up for grad school. I think that in book 2 (Rogue), we're going to see a more mature Faythe. That's the way I see the books going. If not.. I may find the stubbornness harder to deal with, but for now it makes her a very interesting heroine for me and I hope it continues.
Another trait that I felt that some of the werecat characters seem to have was – greater emotion closer to the surface. Maybe it's the animal nature, but Marc, Faythe's ex-fiance shows a lot of territorial jealousy, and Faythe has a lot of anger and lashes out at Marc often. I'm a bit baffled at their relationship. He's still unable to accept her breaking off of their engagement, and she can barely speak to him without wanting to hurt him. I want to know – what happened?! There's some backstory there.
Stray is a debut novel and its 600 pages long. Which I was surprised by. I thought the length was a little long, but it wasn't overly so, but I also enjoy movies that go longer than expected, so not sure how other readers feel about this.
Overall I really liked this one. I think the series will have a similar satisfying girl kicking-butt feel as Kelley Armstrong or Patricia Briggs. The only warning I have is there is brutal violence in this book. The bad guys are really nasty and like to toy with their victims, and both they and the good guys can turn into giant black panthers that kill.

The Belgian striker was on the receiving end of a dreadful challenge by Lasse Nielsen to win a penalty for his side, which Jorginho converted to double the Blues' lead after Andreas Christensen's opener.
Lukaku was clearly struggling in the aftermath of the clumsy tackle, which left him clutching his lower leg, and Tuchel chose to send on Kai Havertz in his place rather than risk worsening the issue.
To make matters worse for the Chelsea manager, he then witnessed Lukaku's attacking colleague Timo Werner pull up with a hamstring issue shortly before half-time, with Callum Hudson-Odoi sent on in his place.
Lukaku's injury comes a matter of days after Tuchel voiced concerns over the 28-year-old's heavy workload for club and country.
Discussing the £97.5million summer signing, Tuchel said: "We are in the process of adapting to each other and in my opinion, I feel Romelu is being overplayed.
"I think he played too many competitions over the summer, with his national team and now the Nations League.
"He is a fantastic athlete and such a competitive guy that he wants to win these things.
"I know how much he wanted to have a good outcome for a European Championship with Belgium and now again in the Nations League, which was a huge match for him personally as it means a lot to him to play for his country, so he takes it really seriously.
"If that doesn't work well, he always takes it on his shoulders, thinks about it and reflects and I feel he is mentally tired. Not hugely so that we have a concern, but for me he is not fully enjoying it without having second thoughts.

"It is difficult to judge. Does he really need a break, or is it better to keep him on the pitch? The next national break is coming but this is what I feel particularly for him, and some other players too."
Despite suggesting he could rest Lukaku for the visit of Swedish minnows Malmo, the former Everton and Manchester United star was handed another start on Wednesday night.
He was searching to end a goal drought which extends back to the Premier League victory over Aston Villa on 11 September.1960s a year of civil rights and protests but its iconic fashion ranged from block colour dresses hats and knee high boots for ladies and bright coloured shirts and wide trousers for men with trendy hair styles to match.

Dynasty Season 5 is on the way but its pre-COVID is not back in the October release window so when will it air and when will Season 5 be on Netflix? Let’s take a look.

In this update to the classic prime-time soap reboot – and their children – Carrington and Colby fight for control of their fate.
When will Dynasty Season 5 be in the CW?
As we mentioned above, the series did not return to its regular October release slot as it did in Season 1 to 3.
Season 4 was greatly delayed due to the epidemic and the campaign did not begin until May 2021.

It is not clear exactly when this mid-season will begin, whether it could be in early January or the end of the 4th season in May 2022.
According to FindFilmWork from BTL, filming began on October 22, 2021 and is scheduled to end in August 2022.
When will Season 5 of Dynasty air on Netflix in the US?
In the United States, CW shows traditionally arrive on Netflix about 8 days after their closing broadcast. This was not the case with many of CW’s headlines in 2021 due to delays in production.
That production will hopefully get back on track, we should see Dynasty Season 5 is almost a week on Netflix US and shortly after the end of the series.
With the filming schedule not ending until the end of the summer of 2022, we don’t expect the series to be available on Netflix until September or October 2022 very soon.

“I wasn't nervous about anything because I had gotten all of the information I would need before surgery. The after care was wonderful. My doctor is a true artist. I look like I did 25 years ago only my body has a better shape. I love my new curves!” Beautologie Patient
Quick Info
- Gluteal Augmentation (sometimes referred to as “Brazilian Butt Lift”) is a 2-3 hour procedure where liposuction is done to your back, hips, and other areas to harvest fat and re-inject it into your buttocks. This liposuction is also used to shape the area around your gluteal area to give you more “roundness”.
- The fat re-injected into your buttocks can shape and augment the size of your gluteal area. Depending on your body and how you heal, up to 80-90% of the fat lasts for many years.
- After the surgery, the recovery is about 1-2 weeks where you should avoid sitting for extended periods of time and you must sleep on your stomach or side.
- We recommend fat injection over silicone buttock implants for safety reasons.
For many women and men, the butt is a major area of cosmetic concern. Having an insufficient or sagging butt can prevent women from wearing many clothes they would otherwise wear. While this condition may be hereditary, it can also come following weight loss or weight gain. Fortunately there is a solution. The skilled plastic surgeons at Beautologie Cosmetic Surgery & Medical Aesthetics can help you with a procedure known as a Gluteal Augmentation. If you feel you could use a little help with getting a tighter, rounder buttock shape, call Beautologie to find out more.
About the Gluteal Augmentation Procedure
A Gluteal Augmentation is a surgical procedure that serves to improve the size or shape of the buttocks. The Gluteal Augmentation is performed by liposuctioning fat from around the buttocks and reinjecting your own fat into the buttock to increase volume and modify the shape.
A Gluteal Augmentation is an outpatient procedure (you can go home after the surgery), and is typically completed in about 2 hours. The recovery time is about 3-4 days, but you should not sit for long periods of time for 2-4 weeks after the surgery.
Gluteal Augmentation Procedure
At Beautologie, a Gluteal Augmentation always begins with a consultation. This is because we know that understanding from both the patient and the doctor will help give you the best Gluteal Augmentation Bakersfield can provide. Your doctor will give you an opportunity to address any concerns or questions you may have. Additionally, he will lend his professional opinion to the matter, giving suggestions for the technique. In particular, we will discuss what to expect as far as volume and shape after the surgery. The consultation will take as long as necessary for both doctor and patient to be satisfied they understand one another and feel they can proceed with the Gluteal Augmentation.
During the procedure, the whole goal is to create lifted, perky and round appearance. The tiny incisions are placed where it can be easily hidden. Using his aesthetic eye and anatomical knowledge, he performs the entire procedure so your backside has a naturally fit and toned look and feel. As Beautologie patients report, they feel much more comfortable in tight fitting jeans and swimsuits following the procedure.
At Beautologie, our primary concern is patient safety and satisfaction. For patients looking for a Gluteal Augmentation in the Bakersfield area, we offer comfortable, effective treatment. We aim to give you the best Gluteal Augmentation Bakersfield has to offer. To find out more or to schedule a consultation, please call our office. We will be happy to help.Kun prize in a competition for young composers in Pus).A ]

The celebration took place at "Our Lady of Clairvaux", Ivato. The Eucharistic celebration began at 8:30 am, presided over by Father Bizimana Innocent, Provincial of the Salesian Vice-Province of Madagascar and Mauritius. The promotion of St. John has chosen as its motto: "It is to the glory of my Father that you bear much fruit and become my disciples" (Jn 15, 8).
Every year all Salesians in formation renew their vows, this is done on the eve of the first vows that the Novices will take on September 8. Note that these dates have become a tradition for the Salesian Congregation in Madagascar. Indeed, during the feast of the evening before, there were significant events, namely: the renewal of the vows pronounced by 15 confreres, six of whom are for two years and the others for one year. But it is also there that the 18 new novices were received who will replace the 22 newly professed, marked by their reception of the Holy Bible, their main tool for the year of novitiate. The novices going to profess their vows also received on this same occasion the blessing of their respective parents.
On the morning of September 8, at 8:30 a.m., the Eucharist began, presided over by the Father Provincial. He stressed during his homily that being a Christian requires duties and responsibilities, not only within the Church, but also throughout the world. And as disciples of Christ, it is our duty to preach the Good News so that the seed bears much fruit and we become true, faithful disciples. Addressing the novices, the Provincial declared that the religious vow is not an end but a life, an ever deeper communion with Christ.
At the end of the celebration, joy lit up everyone's face. Joy expressed and felt through the various speeches of thanks. In short, it should be known that the newly professed must go to Fianarantsoa (center of philosophical formation) to begin the next stage of their formation, for three years. Strengthened by our prayers, that they may remain faithful to their Salesian vocation.Basses
2014 Accuracy Miró Standard
In 2014, I was fortunate to meet Toné Compito Wellington during my studies in the US, who gave me an offer on this amazing bass and to become Accuracy basses artist. It immediately became my main instrument. It’s excellently built, beautiful and always inspires me when I pick it up, providing me with any sound I need depending on the music I’m working on.
Specs:
- 3 piece swamp ash body
- 3 piece dovetail neck (swamp ash/maple/swamp ash)
- Pau Ferro fingerboard with 24 frets
- 34” scale
- Custom split-coil Accuracy pickups and custom 18V electronics
2005 Fender Marcus Miller Jazz Bass
My first bass that I actually bought after playing my uncle’s bass for a couple of months. Bought it on British eBay with help from my uncle in 2009. I started customizing it partially to distinguish myself from my hero Marcus Miller, partially because the sound kinda wasn’t there. The bass had a terrible dead spot on the G note on the E string and generally didn’t cut through the mix well. I scraped the polyester finish from the body, changed the pickups for Nordstrands and made a custom mahogany pickguard with a friend of mine. More customizations followed during my trip to the US - new satin finish, reshielded cavity and drop tuner on the E string (and the signatures of my three biggest bass inspirations - Marcus Miller, Victor Wooten and Anthony Wellington. I’ve mainly been using it for recording lately, and have a lot of sentiment for it.
Kuckovsky custom fretless
I bought this bass from a friend of mine after using it for a year with various bands. I love the sound of the fretless and need it in various projects from time to time. This bass delivers just what I need in this area. It has a huge sound pallete thanks to the combination of the Bartolini and piezo pickups. It is also built in a special way, the body is a sandwitch of Swamp Ash, Alder and Wenge with a Maple/Mahogany glued neck and Ebony fretboard.
Amplification
Aguilar Tone Hammer 350
Aguilar GS112
I’ve been using Aguilar gear since 2012 and I never looked back. I love a transparent, clean sound that translates 100% the sound of my instrument, kinda like a PA, and the Tone Hammer with the GS 112 deliver just that.
Soundelirium 12.6 custom cab
In 2016, I have been looking for a speaker cabinet to use for local gigs in Bratislava, that would be loud enough to play a small club without a PA, sound good both with a bass guitar and upright and be light enough to travel in public traffic with. This custom cabinet from Jan Novotny at delivers all of that for me and has become my main cabinet of choice for smaller gigs. It is equipped with a 12” neodymium speaker and 6” ceramic speaker with an on/off switch and 700 W power output at 8 Ohms.

Here are this week's questions, based off Labor Day and work:
1. Something you've done in recent days or months that might be described as a labor of love?
Cleaning out the old homestead. Doing so, and working at selling the contents was something I was required to do by the terms of a trust, but it was still a labor of love since I have worked very hard to be a good steward of the things I've found and also to pass on to family members things I think they would like to have.
Like vintage hats to little girls, and a whimsical pitcher set to a cousin. (My grandmother collected pitchers.)
2. Last time you 'worked your fingers to the bone'?
See above. And below. That's the dining area.'d say the hardest job right now is police officer. On a national level, the police officers' jobs have become so much more dangerous than ever before. On a local level, they're expected to to enforce unenforceable town ordinances which they don't even agree with.
The job on the list that I'd most like to do -- well, it's still not an easy one, but I think the one I'd most like personally would be farmer.
The job I'd least like to do -- oh, it's a tossup. Almost any of them. Police officer, probably.
A job I would add to the list -- right now, teacher.
4. A recipe you make that is labor intensive, but worth it?
Cheese Danishes. I usually only make them now for very special occasions, like Easter, but I used to make them on a regular basis. There are just a lot of steps to making them, and you have to start the day before, but they certainly are delicious. The photo below is from Pixabay. I have never tried topping off the cream cheese filling with fruity ones, but you know, I think I will try that!
5. Last job you did or task you completed that required teamwork?
See #s 1 and 2. I couldn't have done it without my wonderful hubby. Yes, every last storage area (and there are many) is completely emptied.
6. Insert your own random thought here.
Speaking of my wonderful hubby, Labor Day was his birthday! Appropriately, he spent the day working with our son-in-law and grandson on a carpentry job, then we celebrated at night with family. (I took along the Never-Fail Chocolate Cake, always a sure hit for his birthday or any occasion.) This photo is from several years back, but he hasn't changed much (although Arielle sure has -- that's a recent photo of her, in the hat, above!). So thankful for this wonderful, godly man and the blessing he is to everyone who knows him.
And this labor-intensive Hodgepodge is a wrap! Happy Wednesday, all!
Happy Birthday to Mr T. What a great job y'all have done in cleaning out and restoring a treasure in your family.
Sure sounds like you and your hubby have been working hard! The danishes look fantastic, I think I'll make some this week :)
It was really enjoyable to see the family homestead. It is such a charming New England style home. Arielle looks darling in her "new" hat. Happy Belated birthday to Mr. T! 🎂What’s a good NPS score? Have you found yourself here because you’ve just done an NPS survey and aren’t sure how to interpret your results? NPS surveys can be like chess; they’re easy to execute, but there are layers of complexity once you learn how to play the game.
In this article, we’ll unpack how to calculate your score, how you should compare it to industry benchmarks, and then examine how you can refine your analysis.
How do I calculate my NPS score for my mobile app?
Let’s start with a quick flyby of the basics.
Here’s the traditional NPS question:
On a scale of 0–10, how likely is it that you would recommend our product to a friend or colleague?
Your respondents fall into three categories:
- Promoters: answered 9–10
- Passives: answered 7–8
- Detractors: answered 0–6
Your final score will fall inside the range of -100 to 100. You get your score by subtracting the percentage of demoters from the percentage of promoters.
If your score is positive, that means you have more promoters than detractors. If your score is negative, then you have more detractors than promoters.
Here it is:
NPS = % of Promoters – % of Detractors
It’s a simple formula, especially given that it purposely leaves out passives, who have no direct measurable effect on your brand’s reputation.
If you’re using Instabug, this will be calculated for you automatically on your survey results tab.
Got your score? Now let’s see what it means.
What’s considered a “good” NPS score for my mobile app?
Short answer: it’s all relative.
For most cases, if it’s above zero, then it’s “good.” But how good that is widely varies by industry and context.
Let’s start with 0. Zero is a purely neutral score, indicating you’ve got the same number of people who are happy versus unhappy.
From zero to 30 is what’s generally considered to be a safe zone, neither poor nor exceptional. Some industries peak in this area. It’s a pretty average place to be. If you’re in this range, you can find ways to improve.
Score above 30, and we’re talking about companies that consistently make their customers happy, and are good at it. Their Promoters outweigh their Detractors by far.
If you have an NPS over 70, you’re a star. These companies are customer experience champions. They have devoted and talkative fans who will actively try to recruit new ones. Their promoters are basically volunteer brand ambassadors, who spread the word of mouth enthusiastically.
What are industry benchmarks for NPS scores?
Over two-thirds of Fortune 1000 companies use NPS. So where do you fit in?
We’ve republished the scores from this year’s US Consumer Benchmarks Report from Satmetrix.
Public averages can be good for a quick check-in to see where you’re at, but take this info with a grain of salt. Specific context can have an effect on scores; for example, some entire regions vote more conservatively than others. There are trends across industries as well, as shown below.
Average NPS by Industry (U.S. figures, 2019)
As you can see, the average NPS distribution across industries is all over the place, and (mostly) in the above-zero range. The average NPS in the software industry was 31 in 2018, well into the “good” zone. But cable TV and internet service providers slump far below neutral. These are examples of industries where getting a negative NPS score might not be a terrible thing—it might be extremely average. Even if you’re fitting in with industry standards, it’s still a sign that you’ve got some work to do.
Ultimately, where comparisons are concerned, industry benchmarks are only the beginning. Because the goalposts for greatness vary based on industry, location, language, and more, the most well-rounded analysis you can get is by doing a holistic competitive analysis that sizes up the competition from all angles. Your NPS score is just one item in your toolbox when it comes to finding out how you measure up.
Using in-app NPS surveys to collect better feedback
There are layers of depth to executing the perfect NPS survey: targeting the right people, asking at the right time, asking contextually in the right place, and following up properly. Instabug will help you accomplish your goals from start to finish.
NPS is attractive for being a simple, quantitative measurement that lets you know where you stand with your clientele and your competition. But that number only scratches the surface, and there’s more you can do with the Net Promoter System.
Some of the most important information you can take from NPS isn’t even the score itself. If you’re sending in-app surveys with Instabug, you’ll see an option for a second question: What can we do better? These answers will be some of the most valuable data you’ll get from your entire NPS survey. Backing up your numbers with qualitative answers will give you more context about what’s happening and what you need to do to create a more successful app.
Create custom questions and follow-up actions for NPS surveys using Instabug.
Instabug’s NPS survey options pack a lot of extra functionality into the world’s most popular customer satisfaction survey. You can customize the wording of your questions, request additional feedback, add thank you messages, and choose follow-up actions. Route promoters to the app stores to leave you positive reviews while requesting additional information from passives and detractors. Reach out and communicate with dissatisfied users by sending individual replies to survey respondents.

I’ve run a number of posts on emotional abuse lately. Last week I wrote about how men can be victims of emotional abuse, too, and yesterday I ran a post by my friend Natalie on how to recognize emotional abuse.
The question then becomes, though, what do you do about it?
Natalie has a great community and support group at her blog Emotional Abuse Survivor.
Last week, though, one reader left a really interesting series of comments on how to actually draw some firm boundaries so that you’re not sucked into ridiculous conversations where you are belittled, yelled at, criticized, or blamed for things that were not your fault.
I want to run those comments today, with this caveat. What I’ve noticed when it comes to abusive marriages is that you can divide them into two groups:
- Marriages where a spouse is controlling, critical, and domineering, and where really dysfunctional communication patterns have developed where the spouse treats the other horribly;
- Marriages where one spouse is controlling, critical, and domineering, and the problem is not communication patterns. The problem is that the spouse has a personality or character disorder (usually narcissism).
You see, sometimes we can actually develop an abusive way of relating to one another because we allow someone to treat us badly, and soon that becomes the norm. They end up treating us in ways that, given a different set of circumstances, they would never normally have done. But some people honestly are evil. And no amount of changing how you act can rescue the marriage.
I’ve watched a couple close to me walk through this recently, and I do believe that it’s more a #1 type of marriage. He was controlling, but he also recognizes it now and he wasn’t narcissistic. It’s for marriages like this that these steps listed below may actually restore the marriage. And I posted last year a wonderful story of a marriage that emerged from emotional abuse, because the wife demanded to be treated with respect.
In cases with a narcissistic husband, you should still take these steps because it will keep you sane and it will stop the verbal dance. But it will not fix the marriage, because it’s essentially a character issue.
Are you PeaceKEEPING or PeaceMAKING?
With that preamble, here’s BCMan (and he’s writing from the perspective of a male being emotionally abused; what he’s saying can just as easily be switched around and it’s still right on):
I was in an abusive marriage for 24 years. I lived with harsh relentless criticism and tolerated verbal abuse on a regular basis.
I’m happy to report that our marriage has been free from abuse for the past three years. I’m 100% certain it will continue “abuse-free”.
My advice to men in abusive relationships. You are in your current situation (to a large part) because the first few times your wife engaged in abusive behaviour, she got her way. She received positive reinforcement for her negative behaviour. By accepting unacceptable behaviour, the unacceptable behaviour became acceptable.
Don’t expect your wife to change. First, you must to change yourself and your response to her behaviour.
Instead of positive reinforcement, provide negative reinforcement for her bad behaviour.
Sheila wisely advises “draw boundaries and confront”. Here’s the step by step implementation plan I used effectively to end my wife’s abusive behaviour in six weeks:
- Get clear on your boundaries. What is the specific behaviour you will no longer accept or tolerate? Write it down (don’t skip this). I wrote “I will no longer tolerate demeaning or belittling speech”.
- What are the exact words you’ll use when confronting that behaviour? Write them down. I wrote “you have a right to feel frustrated or angry; you don’t have a right to demean or belittle me”
- What will be the negative consequence if she continues her behaviour? Think of an action you can take immediately that will clearly show that you no longer tolerate her old behaviour. My action was to end the discussion immediately and leave the room.
- What are the exact words you’ll use to communicate the negative consequence? Write them down. I wrote “stop now or I’m ending this discussion and leaving the room”.
- What is the new behaviour you want her to exhibit and the reward for exhibiting the desired behaviour? I chose resuming the discussion in an environment of mutual respect and working on the resolving the underlying issue that she was angry about.
- What are the exact words you’ll use to communicate the desired behaviour? Write them down. I wrote “I’ll be glad to resume the discussion in a mutually respectful manner and work to resolve what you’re angry about”.
- Anticipate how she will likely react. What are her “go to” strategies she has used in the past when you’ve attempted to stand up and confront her?
Does she:
- Deny her behaviour is abusive?
- Justify or rationalize her behaviour? “I do x only because you do y. If you stopped doing y, I wouldn’t have to do x” or “this is the only way I can get you to listen to me”.
- Deflect and play victim? “I do x but you do y which is so much worse. In fact, you’re the one who should apologize to me”
- Ignore completely whatever she says in her attempt to derail you and restore the status quo. Responding to her specific derailment attempt takes the spotlight off her bad behaviour … and she wins.
- Firmly repeat what you said and start implementing the negative consequence.
-.
Great advice! The Big Lesson: Decide what you will not tolerate. Set a consequence. Stick to it. Do not get sucked into any other conversation. Do that, and you will stop the crazy cycle.
Note: sometimes when we start doing that, spouses react very badly, because they are used to having control. If you fear that your spouse may physically harm you, please get you and your children to safety.
A Better Way to Honour God in Your Marriage:
Let’s talk in the comments: Have you ever had to draw clear boundaries about what you will and will not accept? What was the hardest part? How did it work for you?
I am copying all this and driving it to my friend today. I am helping a man who is now on day 4 of the cycle. His Wife told him on his lunch break yesterday to get out and take your clothes and don’t come back. Why? Because he won’t argue with her. Of course he has his part in the relationship – he is trying to recover from porn addiction. She is pissed. She was sexually abused growing up. There are so many issues. This particular cycle started because she couldn’t find the air chuck to put air in the tractor tire so she could mow the lawn. It is his fault and he does these things on purpose she says. It has gotten way crazier as the days wear on. His wife told their 6 year old son she has never been closer to murder. It is so sad. He called me from his driveway last night. He took the stand. He is taking the stand. He is breaking the cycle. He asked me. Why is this so painful? I can’t really answer that. But he is doing it. Who knows what today will bring. She has got to be tired by now….when I was in this place as the abuser I got tired around 3 days and would start to surrender- the problem was my wife had to give in…and that was what fed the cycle….in my case it was sex. She knew it too and she would do it just so I wasn’t a jerk until the next cycle. She would even tell me she knew and I just didn’t care because I needed what I thought “fixed me”. You have to take the stand. The pain of breaking the cycle will bring you so much joy you will do flips! Stay with it! You will find LOVE. Ask God to help you. It takes time and a ton of work but it is so worth it to be free! I pray for those who are suffering. I pray you can take the stand. Peace
Phil, thanks for sharing that story! I hope he is able to stand firm. It sounds like they both have huge issues to deal with, but you can’t deal with them if you’re not having productive conversations. And so you must stop that cycle and start listening to each other before you can do any healing. I’ll say a prayer for your friend.
This is not just great advice for emotional abuse within marriage, but in any relationship. Thank you for posting! I come from an emotionally abusive upbringing, so I have to choose my words carefully in the heat of the moment. The Lord has done much healing over the past 12 years, But I am in the process of seeking counseling to deal with my childhood wounds.
I was going to post my own comment, but literally it’s identical to yours! I am currently seeking professional counseling as well, having discovered within the past 3 years that I do have an emotionally abusive family dynamic. I’ve only gone to counseling twice so far, but it’s already been helping tremendously. I’m also getting married in less than 4 months, so that is a major factor in seeking out help. From reading this blog and talking with concerned friends, I realized I needed to get this handled to some degree before December. It’s way too important to try and work on with just the two of us, and dangerously assume it will just work itself out.
I was going to comment about my home life and then saw your comment! Any advice on how to move forward from an emotionally abusive mother? I’ve gone to counseling (it begins as counseling for my parents’ divorce but always comes around to my mom somehow), but they always have tried to bring my mom in at some point and show her which actions are wrong and how they hurt me but she refuses to see it. I’m struggling trying to move past this and stand up for myself still.
Sheila,
Thank you for this, by the way! When I saw the previous posts I thought to myself, what’s the solution? And, here it is!
I was married once before. I didn’t have the mental tools in place for this situation. In my current marriage, this situation arises. I read something before about boundaries, but there were no instructions like what’s outlined in your post here. So, I blindly applied the boundaries. By and large, they’ve worked. However, there have been times when I didn’t have the proper words in place to neutralize the negative behaviors.
I now know what to add to my situation to make it more effective.
Oh, I’m so glad that this helped you, Kimberly! (I hope the original comment writer sees this, too! 🙂 )
I was in an emotionally, verbally, spiritually, financially abusive relationship for 15 years. The concrete detail of this piece is what I finally learned in therapy. These steps are so empowering and will reveal the true heart of the abusive person: whether they seek to improve or roil out of control with selfish frustration. Thank you for sharing this very practical tool!
I’m so glad that you found it helpful!
BCMan certainly has some wisdom when it comes to how to deal with abuse in a marriage! And, as one commenter said above, this is really applicable to all relationships (it could be a family member, work colleague, ‘friend’). I was reminded of a quote that I found (it’s teacher/student related, but really works in any relationship)
“We teach our students how to behave by what we ALLOW, what we STOP, what we IGNORE, and what we REINFORCE.”
I have found that reminding myself of those four capitalised words has helped in my parenting (as a homeschooler), but also in my relationship with my husband.
Praying for courage and strength for anyone who is reading this and facing this kind of situation today.
My spouse’s emotional abuse is in the forum of abandonment and indifference. He covers his personal selfishness by saying he is drawing his boundaries but what that actually means is he wants to live the bachelor’s life and have his family waiting on the sidelines. I am a Stay at home Mom with no income. Removing myself doesn’t help this situation. Any advice?
I’m so sorry! That’s really, really hard. It sounds like the first thing you need is good community around you so that you have some support. Do you belong to a good church? Could you find a moms & tots group to join and get some friends? I think it’s really important to have mentors and friends, and people who do know you. If you’re in the U.S., MOPS groups are really good, and you can find one in your area here. And they have older women who will also act as mentors who can perhaps help you navigate some of this. Again, I’m so sorry!
Yes, Sheila!
I have more to add.
You may not be able to leave now because of your children and financial situation. But, you can live in dignity.
1. Start putting aside a little $$, even if just a dollar here and there.
2. Don’t have any more children.
3. Find online resources like Leslie Vernick to build up strength.
4. Read boundaries in marriage and implement them.
5. Tell your doctor that you are being emotionally abused.
6. Create an escape plan because setting boundaries may escalate the abuse to the point of needing to leave.
Great points, Libl! Thanks for adding them. I totally want to second your suggestion of Leslie Vernick’s site–it’s great. And so is Natalie’s!
I believe I am in a marriage in the first group. We got into terrible cycles of arguing/dysfunctional communication. I was passive and wanted our marriage to work and let him walk all over me for years, not knowing that he was battling porn addiction and also had a history of sexual abuse which he never shared with me prior to marriage.
i started reading this blog, Leslie vernick and Natalie’s blog and I cannot express enough how helpful it was to me simply to know I was not crazy, and I was not alone! Two things that have stuck with me that one of them wrote is that ” it will get worse before it will get better” , and that ” you have to be willing to let the relationship go (if you start implementing boundaries etc)”.
I silently repeated this to myself on the night where I refused to engage in his tirade, and he went on a rampage trying to find every self help and marriage book I had and threw it in the garbage.l, etc to try to get me to react. I didn’t. At that point I was dying inside not knowing if he would turn to physical violence and the thought that I would have to follow through with a separation . He then followed me into a bathroom and wouldn’t let me leave because he wanted to “talk” so eventually I called his mother. I told him if he ever did that again I would call the police. And it sounds terrible and I still feel like I will never love him the way I used to again but after that night he has treated me with more respect than ever before. He finally agreed to some counselling and he is making an effort to be better. And I don’t think he is a true narcissist , he loves his kids and his family and says he loves me( but he tends to be neglectful , uncaring of my feelingsetc) but I’m in a waiting game now, to see if his change is real.
I grew up in a very conservative community , and I wish I had known these things when I was dating/ newlywed… I could have saved myself a world of heartache.
Hi there,
I’m so glad that you’re starting to see some hope! That’s wonderful. And I’m so glad that you stuck to it. Your husband needs to change for his own good, too. That’s what many women don’t realize–by refusing to set boundaries, they’re not operating in a loving way, because it isn’t loving to allow your husband to do these things.
I’m glad that you found these blogs and books and that they’re helping you. I’ll say a prayer for you.
Hopeful,
He sounds like a sexual abuse victim. I was abused and didn’t tell my husband until my father went to jail and I couldn’t keep it a secret any longer.
He endured 20 years of emotional and verbal abuse, a checked out wife during sex and just emotionally unavailable. We had moments of connection, but for most of the marriage we were friends with benefits
I felt nothing. Even I didn’t understand my behaviour. I was regularly cycling unto suicide and I’d use the threat of it to control him. I was beyond terrified of him leaving and feeling abandoned and not safe.
It just screws up a child so much that adulthood can be excruciating.
Mercifully Abba has helped me heal. And him. Enough that he can sit in a counselors office and tell me I’m abusive. Which made me cry. Because I don’t want to be that way.
It’s awkward having boundaries. I have no idea how to communicate. We are going to be in counseling for a long time… But I feel like I have more control over my life and that I’m now more his wife than I have ever been.
Getting to this spot… It’s been almost 7 years of emotional pain and work and I have way more to go. I want to quit, but I won’t, because I love him.
The best thing my husband ever said was, “I am not playing your game anymore.” It gave me permission to heal.
Oh, thank you so much for sharing your story, Taunya! That’s very helpful.
Also Sounds helpful for dealing with teens who have gotten used to manipulating to get their way.
Yes! Absolutely. Couldn’t agree more. I think it’s just smart to set these kind of boundaries in general with people.
I have emotional abused my wife and I feel ashamed and embarrassed that I have done this. We have split up for now with the chance of the D word at some point. I did tell that I shouldn’t have done what I did and that I was sorry. Since we have split up I have started counseling to make myself better and stop what I did in the hope of getting my back. But she says no at the moment a d might no for good. So if there are abuser ready this….
Please take a look at what you are doing and stop before you lose that person. Because you don’t want to be in my position….
Thank you for taking the time to read this…
I’m at a loss of what to do. I don’t deny my shortcomings in my marriage but my husband literally rolls his eyes and ignores me when I ask the most basic questions. I’m pretty sure I’m being emotionally abused but how do you set boundaries when the threat to walk away or leave the marriage is what he says he wants?
Great article. You dont have to be married to a person or even friends or even meet the person often enough. When a pro abuser gets to you he knows exactly how to abuse you. I have always been very careful of men with abuse having been married and divorced at a very young age and the guy being manipulative, but I still got fooled this time around. Thankfully I have a lot of things going on in comparison to which an abusive person in an alleged long distance relationship, seems minor but boy has it been a show ! I do not think anyone should stay with an abusive person. They usually have a personality disorder. They are usually psychopaths. It is not a mild form of mental illness, an abusive person is mentally ill. Period.
Abuse is a very dangerous something and should be taking seriously by people. Thanks for this article
I hope this blog is still open. It has been 28 years for me and We have a 12 year old so leaving only brings the abuse directed to my daughter. It’s all mental abuse with a character disorder. Blames me for everything and when I set boundaries, she tries to kill herself. I think she really would! It’s like literally fighting a demon. Knows all the tricks.
Geof, I sometimes think that in fact it is demonic posession, especially when it comes to BPD. I’ve seen others say the same thing on these forums. There are a huge amount of behaviors that are evil and they are exactly the same between people, and most are done unconsciously. How is that possible? Or when they deny being someplace with you shortly after you were there, or deny that they said a certain thing. It’s like there is a demon that takes over and the person is not there.
To add to the conversation here as someone who has studied psychology, I want to be careful not to label something as demonic when it’s often caused by a great deal of trauma to the individual.
When it comes to BPD, like all other mental illnesses and personality disorders, you can be a Christian and suffer from BPD. In fact, one of the leading psychologists in BPD research was herself a Christian but she wasn’t immediately healed when she found Jesus. She will always have BPD, but she can manage her symptoms and the disorder better with a therapy program that she designed herself and is how the standard practice for BPD clients.
Although I do believe that we can face evil forces in this world, let’s not label psychological illnesses as demonic possession when there are so many who are seeking help for their disorders. I prefer keeping them separate; if you want to say that someone is possessed, don’t then say that they have BPD. It is very vilifying of those who have the disorder, which again is often caused by a great deal of trauma at an early age.
When you mention personality disorders, you say that usually it it NPD – narcissistic personality disorder. That is a fairly common disorder for men, but women much more frequently have BPD – borderline personality disorder. The emotional abuse from women (or men) with BPD is similar to NPD. Even those who don’t meet the criteria for the disorder can still have some of the traits, and they ruin a relationship, and ruin the life and psyche of the abused. If you go to a counselor, you’ll be told that you have to love one another and communicate, etc. But this is impossible until the disordered person gets help, which is unlikely to happen, because cluster B personality disordered people tend to blame others and not accept responsibility. I am a man who has been emotionally abused (and physically, too) over years of marriage. At the beginning I drew clear boundaries and did not put up with it. But that didn’t work. After hundreds of episodes of being screamed at and put down over meaningless things, I started to bite the bullet and allow her to walk all over me. It’s no better or worse now, but at least I don’t have to expend all the energy to battle against the Injustice if a situation that will never improve.
I been. Married for 20 years and I am insulated every single day to the point I have completely lost the person I once was! I have now began to try and search for anything that I can do right, my husband doesn’t seem to think I do anything right yet he stays with me ?! I ask him why since everyday he complains about me! He can’t even tell me one thing. He says if I change he will stop treating me this way and I will have the marriage I’ve always wanted! I change but it’s never good enough! He’s totally convinced me of what a worthless human being I am it’s very sad. I need to keep myself from completely drowning. Help me someone
Michelle, that is very, very wrong, and I’m so, so sorry. It sounds like you really need to be talking to a counsellor or a mentor so that you can get the strength to draw some boundaries and stand up to him. Just because he says those things does not mean you need to listen. Please talk to someone who knows about emotional abuse, because it’s very hard to navigate this alone.
I am emotionally exhausted, I have been in a relationship for almost 3 years. It started off a bit tumultuous, since he was going back and forth with his ex gf, of which I wasn’t aware since he repeatedly stated it was over. When it finally was he started behaving strangely, out of nowhere he would accuse me of cheating and demanded checking my vagina every day I came home from work. What I thought was a bit weird, kinky but since I wasn’t cheating I was ok with it, at the beginning. Then he started claiming that he could see based upon the color that I was cheating, he would text me almost non stop -while I was at work- to send him pictures of me at the desk. Needless to say I lost that job, the next job was just the same. He installed several locators on my phone, asking why I was outside when I was at my desk. I got defensive after being accused constantly without doing anything. I caught him on the other hand twice, texting other women that he had contacted on a dating app and the texts were juicy. When I confronted him he blamed me for it. He doesn’t want to be second best, which is not true, I have build everything around him, I am not allowed to go with my girl friends anywhere. We tried counseling, since now I have started to feel anxiety as soon as I leave my office, he is sure that I have cheated and even asked for a lie detector test. He thinks my job is to sleep with men on the job or clients, when I try to establish boundaries and leave the apartment when it gets heated he accuses me of going to sleep with someone in the parking lot where I sit in the car trying to cool off. He thinks I am doing drugs, which I don;t do, he is the one with addiction problems. I’m so sick of being probed every day when I come home and then he accuses me of sleeping around again, that I don’t even enjoy being intimate with him, since I have started menopause I am feeling a lot of pain. He has forced me to get checked by 4 different doctors and asked them why my vagina changes color, to which they replied it could be many factors, stress, high blood pressure, sitting prolonged hours , pH etc, however that is not enough for him. I wake up in the middle of the night because he starts ranting by himself saying that I am a whore , that I am cheating on him etc. I started looking up narcissistic behavior, I think he might have that plus some other issues. I love him however it it never enough for him, like I said we have tried counseling before, however he played the victim and we never really addressed what he is doing to me. I am getting paranoid myself, if I scratch my head I have to stop , if there is not enough hairspray on my head I had sex at work, I can’t wear perfume, I love wearing dresses, he thinks I’m dressing up for sex at work. He goes through my purse taking out hand lotion, lip stick etc. If I don’t text him -even though he is sleeping most of the time, since he is disabled, I had sex. I am sick of justifying myself for something I haven’t done.
Hi, on the off chance that you might see this 2 mos after the fact, I want you to know that I am so sorry for what you’ve been going through, and also – this is abnormal, destructive, sinful behavior on his part. Have you ever heard the saying, “Don’t throw good money after bad”?* Don’t throw good years after bad.
2) If you’re not married, RUN. If you are married, DON’T have kids.
3) DO get into counselling, by yourself. You need the support, you need to know why you’ve been submitting to this treatment., and you need the personal space (and guidance) to heal. This can be done in person locally, but there are also counselors who will do phone, or skype (type), or text-based counselling, which allows you to be more discreet.
4) If it’s legal in your state to record conversations w/out informing the other party, then you need to install an app on your phone to automatically record calls (try to hide it in a hidden folder AND also stop showing your phone to him. Please put a password on it). You can get another app for voice recording (so you can record in-person conversations). Both are available for free. This is so important, because it can be hard to get people to believe you otherwise – even yourself. A lot of abused people feel that they are going crazy, and it’s easy to revert to “did I remember that correctly? Am I reading bad motives into this?” And if he threatens you, you’ll have proof for law enforcement.
5) Read Leslie Vernick’s blog (use an incognito window, whether it’s your computer or phone), and her books (check your library system).
I’m so sorry for what you’re going through!
*(It’s like, if you buy a worn-out car thinking it was reliable, and you have to spend thousands of dollars to keep in running. You don’t want to “waste” the money you invested by scrapping the car and buying again, so you end up spending more to keep the car running than it would cost to buy a better car. Throwing good money after bad. )
My husband is emotionally & sometimes verbally abusive to me. My problem is whenever there is an issue at hand he never talks about it so in my mind it’s unresolved and he doesn’t wanna talk about it ever. I can’t say how I feel or we can’t come to a way to stop the reoccurrence. Then I feel withdrawn and disrespected. How do I fix that
I have the same exact issue with my significant other.
I know the feeling. Horrible when things that can be a 5 min productive conversation and instead it get swept under rug. Just simple lil things that if resolved would help you feel understood and closer.
I almost want to say that these individuals are afraid of vulnerability and have very low self analysis. Might get some sprinkles every so often. We don’t argue often but when we do this shutting down is the greatest source of frustration for me.
If you are not married or related to a person who has Borderline Personality Disorder, leave, run as fast as you can, and never look back. They are demons in human form. The sex of the monster does not matter. If you have to live with or put up with one who is a relative who you have to deal with, you’re going to have to learn to detach from their constant abuse. You cannot confront one of these people.
I found a really good video online regarding this, it was an Australian lady, I don’t have the link.
VHRT and others that have commented on BPD.
I am really concerned about your comments about demonisation and running from people with BPD. BPD is a condition rooted in trauma and to suggest a person must have a demon could be considered spiritual abuse. Further people with BPD need validation as part of their healing and to respond to them as these posts suggest could further their trauma and create harm.
People are abusive because they choose to be. There are people with BPD who are not abusive and others without BPD who are abusive.
Generalising about a person or condition such as BPD and saying that all people who have it are bad or demonised does a lot of harm to people who are already suffering. In my opinion hateful comments such as these are based on stereotypes and promote further stigma.
If you are saying your own partner has BPD and behaves abusively then I would encourage you to look at resources about abuse – even with the BPD an abuser has choices. The BPD may well in that case be being used as an excuse. However, if my partner accused me of demon possession due to a diagnosable condition I’d be seriously considering whether I was the one being abused. By the way I don’t have BPD but do have considerable experience in mental health.

so can anyone help me with setting some boundaries with my wife who loves to withhold affection and intimacy? I’m not referring to only sex when I say emotional withholding i mean. Honestly this behavior has been going on a decade since our first son was born… and after a few tours to Afghanistan.. I have been diagnosed with PTSD and as of a few months ago clinical depression but I digress any guidance or suggestions at this point is greatly appreciated and thank you in advance!Town Creek Repossessed Homes - Bank Repos Houses in Town Creek

Children are being locked up behind bars until they are 18 and then civilly committed to state hospitals until the government determines they are “safe” to be released back into the community. Yes, they have committed sexual offenses, but non-violent juveniles who are unlikely to make the same mistakes twice should not be warehoused on the possibility they will return to bad behavior.
Thomas Simmons was sent to juvenile detention at the age of 13 for sexually assaulting a younger relative. At 17, Simmons became the youngest person civilly committed to South Carolina’s adult violent sex offender treatment program indefinitely. Now 21 years old, Simmons is asking the South Carolina Supreme Court to release him.
However, experts disagree on whether Simmons is ready for release. The state Attorney General’s Office’s expert says Simmons is still dangerous. On the other hand, a psychologist at the sex offender commitment center where Simmons is being housed says Simmons should be released because he has shown no signs of violent sexual behavior for at least eight years.
Mr. Simmons’ situation is not unique. From research compiled by the Defender Association of Philadelphia, more than 10 states have some type of juvenile sex offender civil commitment procedure. In the four states that track their procedures and responded to information requests, at least 52 adults are presently committed as sex offenders for an indefinite time period because of sex crimes they committed as juveniles.
Mental health expert recommendations
Though juvenile sex offenders are often described by prosecutors as long-term dangers to society, mental health experts often disagree. Experts have repeatedly expressed concerns over the indefinite civil commitment of adults for juvenile sex crimes. In their view, the fact a juvenile committed a sex offense is not a clear indicator the juvenile will grow up to be a violent sex offender. Kids make mistakes.
Mark Chaffin, a director at the Center for Child Abuse and Neglect at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center said, “A very small number of kids are really likely to do horrible things, … If you want to protect the public, the price you pay is that you will harm probably a larger number of children who are not going to commit crimes . . . . That’s what no one really wants to face.”
Maryland juvenile sex offense sentencing
The purpose of juvenile courts is to assist in the rehabilitation of delinquent youth, not to punish them like adults. However, Maryland juveniles who commit certain serious sex offenses can be tried as adults. For a 16-year-old, those offenses include second-degree rape or sex offense (or attempt), as well as third-degree sex offense. For a 14-year-old, the offenses include first-degree rape or attempted first-degree rape, as well as first-degree sex offense or attempted first-degree sex offense.
A person found delinquent of first or second-degree rape, or first or second-degree sexual assault, as a juvenile will be required to register as a sex offender once the juvenile court loses jurisdiction over them (usually at 21 years old). However, the person must have been at least 13 when they committed the qualifying act, the State’s Attorney or the Department of Juvenile Services must request registration and the court must agree.
The consequences of a juvenile sex offense can be long lasting and life altering. If you or a loved one has been arrested and charged with a juvenile sex offense, contact an experienced juvenile defense attorney to discuss your situation and your options.Black Friday is officially here! 25% off site wide, and All domestic orders over $100 will receive

First, it was incredible to hear a part of the throne speech delivered in Inuktitut. Canada is richer for it and my sincere congratulations to Her Excellency Mary May Simon. I love that a quilliq was lit beside her and that I could smell it from where I stood.
I also want to thank all the Nunavummiut who voted for me, supported me and trusted me to represent them in this House. Qujannamiik.
Uqaqtittiji, as I flew from community to community, one constant message was heard, “We need housing and we need it now.” As members are aware, Nunavut has been facing a housing crisis for decades. Nunavummiut have been seeking help from the federal government to build more and better quality housing.
Uqaqtittiji, I would like to know when the Liberal government is going to move from planning to actually funding more housing for Nunavummiut, first nations, Métis and Inuit across Canada.
Qujannamiik.Peter Dutton faces an army of GetUp activists who plan to door-knock one in three households in his marginal seat of Dickson.
The battle for Dickson attracted dozens of volunteers to a meeting in Brisbane on Thursday night with the goal of visiting more than 20,000 households with the message ‘Ditch Dutton’.
As the Morrison Government continues to battle spot fires, with high profile independent Julia Banks declaring she will run against Health Minister Greg Hunt, Dickson will be a key battleground.
The New Daily has confirmed the activist group has amassed a war chest of over $250,000 to fight the failed Liberal leadership aspirant.
GetUp campaign director Ruby O’Halloran told The New Daily a team of more than 150 volunteers would shortly commence door-knocking across the electorate.
“For a lot of people, Peter Dutton is just the embodiment of everything they think is wrong with Australian politics at the moment,” she said.
“A lot of people talk about the time he was health minister, when he tried to make people pay a co-payment to see their GP.
“A lot of people talk about climate change and the time he laughed at rising sea levels in the Pacific.
“Many people talk about his treatment of asylum seekers – and just the leadership coup is another huge one.”
GetUp activists’ ground campaign will help Labor’s Ali France, who is running against Mr Dutton in the seat. Ms France, who was once an outspoken critic of Labor’s offshore detention regime, was drawn to campaigning after she lost a leg in a 2011 car accident and was treated by an “amazing surgeon” who was an Iraqi refugee.
Ms O’Halloran said the lessons of grassroots US campaigns for (Democrats) and Beto O’Rourke would be used to urge voters to “Ditch Dutton”.
“There have just been so many incredible international campaigns since 2016 that have really harnessed the power of door knocking. If you look at the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaign, and the Beto O’Rourke campaign in Texas that almost got rid of Ted Cruz, both of those campaigns really harnessed door-knocking.
“So, we’ve been speaking to a lot of international allies. We just decided door knocking was the most strategic way to get to voters. But I should add we are also doing phone banks, phone calls.”
“We want Peter Dutton’s race-baiting, homophobia, attacks on renewable energy and regressive economic policies out of our politics.
“We will work around the clock to make sure Dickson residents know he doesn’t deserve their vote,” she said.
GetUp admits the vulnerability of Peter Dutton took them by surprise in 2016.
“In the 2016 election his seat wasn’t marginal, he was sitting on a pretty comfortable 5.6 per cent. GetUp was actually one of the only organisations that went into Dickson hard. Even we didn’t necessarily know if we had a chance of unseating him then.
“The fact that his margin was reduced by more than double the average Queensland swing in 2016, I think that is a testament to the great campaigning that our members did there.
“And while it is true that he’s had an entire term of government to prepare for this moment, so have GetUp members. I think he’s been spending a lot more of his time focusing on causing chaos in Canberra and the failed leadership coup than addressing the needs of the people in the electorate.
“That’s going to come out on polling day.”
GetUp said the motivations of the volunteers were diverse.
GetUp volunteer Patrea Ryan said there was “a feeling in the electorate that 2019 could be a huge moment in political history.”
The Home Affairs Minister has admitted he faces a tough fight in the seat, which he secured by just 1500 votes at the last election.
“Ironically, the more they attack me personally the more people in Dickson get turned off their fanatical rants,” he said.
“GetUp is affiliated with the Greens and Labor. It’s run by left-wing extremists and to be at odds with GetUp extremists is something I wear as a badge of honour.”BOOKS

Curator Reviews
Nigella Lawson
Sparer, more savage and so much more poignant than “Pride and Prejudice,” (a great book, too, and I don’t mean to disparage it at all,) “Persuasion” is a novel that tells us, as only Jane Austen can, about the vanities and follies of being human with such memorably dry wit.View Nigella Lawson's Top 10 Favorite Books
Lore Segal
Most of my recent essays include a reference to Jane Austen and to my mum. I read and reread "Persuasion" for its painful rendering of love that continues in the absence of an object, and for the delicacy of its heroine’s goodness. Anne, in the sadness of what she believes to be her ruined life, can be concerned to prevent a country walk from being spoiled by her sister Mary-- a marvelous depiction of obnoxiousness. And the happy ending is delicious.View Lore Segal's Top 10 Favorite Books
Brandon Taylor
I love Persuasion because it is a novel about people who change their minds, and there’s nothing more human than someone changing their mind and realizing the consequences of their choices. It’s a novel about grown up people making grown up decisions, but also it’s a novel about grown ups being childish and petty and silly. It’s her best novel, I think.View Brandon Taylor's Top 10 Favorite BooksConnect with and learn from others in the QuickBooks Community.

The Essential Haiku: Versions of Basho, Buson, & Issa, poems selected and translated by Robert Hass (1994). Hopewell: The Ecco Press.
The Essential Haiku is a concise introduction to “big three” masters of the Japanese haiku tradition: Basho, Buson and Issa. I cannot speak to the accuracy of Hass’s translation from the Japanese, but the poems read well in English, and the reviews I’ve read do not find significant fault with the translations. When I compare Hass’s versions to other translations, I do not usually see big differences in the content of the poems, but to me, Hass’s versions consistently read better as as poems in English. Curious readers will want to seek out other translations of these poets, but to my mind, no book does a better job of introducing the depth and range of classical Japanese haiku in English.
The introduction and notes are a joy, as you would expect from Hass, a former Poet Laureate of the United States and a celebrated essayist. One thing I find especially valuable about Hass is that he doesn’t overemphasize the foreignness of Japanese haiku. He enables us to see their universality in a way that specialized commentary sometimes does not.

To Make a World: One Hundred Haiku and One Waka, by James Luguri (1987). Privately and posthumously published.
In 2005, while looking for something else in the back issues of The Christian Century, I first learned of the existence of what’s become one of my favorite books of haiku, To Make a World: One Hundred Haiku and One Waka by James Luguri. In an appreciative essay from May 1987 simply titled “James Luguri’s Haiku,” John E. McEntyre, a colleague of the poet, noted that Luguri had collected his haiku and a waka in a manuscript before he had died. Using those clues, I found and purchased a copy of the small posthumously published paperback from an online bookseller. The book’s one-page biography of the poet provides only a few details:
A native of Lindenhurst, Long Island, James Luguri left home at the age of thirteen to enter a Carmelite community. After ten years he left the order and completed his education in Berkeley, California, receiving advanced degrees at the Graduate Theological Union and the University of California. A teacher by profession, he taught at various institutions and at various levels, from junior high through graduate school and adult education. His principal forms of expression were haiku and aphorism, although he also wrote many longer poems and translated several works of Rainer Maria Rilke. On April 23, 1985, at the age of 38, he collapsed and died of a heart attack while jogging. At the time of his death he was on the faculty of the Franciscan School of Theology, in Berkeley, teaching in the area of theology and the arts, and also on the faculty of the Department of Religious Studies at St. Mary’s College, Moraga.
I enjoy reading and rereading the poems in To Make a World, which is arranged by the seasons. One inconspicuous haiku (number 23 of his 25 spring poems) says in its own way, at least to me, “Do not be anxious about your life.” For a few thoughts on that haiku and excerpts from To Make a World and The Christian Century essay, click here. By the way, the book’s main title ends line 4 of James Luguri’s waka, which is also included in the linked piece.
— Richard StrawDanny Fenster, an American journalist who has been detained in Myanmar since May, will have to wait longer for a decision to be made on his bail application. A lawyer representing Fenster said Wednesday that the case has been postponed after the judge overseeing it broke his arm, the Associated Press reported.
Fenster is the managing editor of Frontier Myanmar, an online publication based in Myanmar’s largest city, Yangon. While preparing to board a Michigan-bound flight on May 24 to visit his family, Fenster was detained at Yangon International Airport and has been in custody since.
Authorities arrested him for incitement—also called sedition—on grounds he allegedly spread false or inflammatory information. However, the charge against him has never been clarified to state what he is accused of doing.
Fenster is currently being detained at Yangon’s Insein Prison. His hearings are also taking place at the prison, though those proceedings are in the procedural stage and not open to media outlets or the public.
Fenster’s lawyer, Than Zaw Aung, said the judge who broke his arm is taking a month off to recuperate, and another judge will replace him temporarily. The defense and the prosecution resubmitted their arguments, and the new judge is anticipated to making a ruling at a new hearing scheduled for November 3.
The incitement charge carries a punishment of up to three years in prison.
For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.

Fenster’s lawyer said his client did not comment on the delay but appeared disappointed at not being released from detention under a recent amnesty for political prisoners. He is among about 100 journalists detained since a February Major General.After Hours GP Home Visits

The Supreme Court has found two Barmera men guilty by of brutally bashing a man in Loveday in August 2008.
Glyn Roberts Dougherty, 36, and and his brother Ryan Anthony Dougherty, 35, were charged with aggravated serious criminal trespass and aggravated unlawfully causing serious harm.
The court has heard the brothers bashed John Hack at his Loveday home with a cricket bat and crowbar, in front of Mr Hack's then nine-year-old son.
They have been remanded on continuing bail and will be sentenced at a later date.Benefits of a Vehicle Tracking System
A vehicle tracking system is composed of a device placed in an automobile, truck, boat, RV, ATV or another vehicle that functions with tracking a tracking service or software to find the car whether it must be lost or stolen. This is the most elementary part of vehicle tracking systems. However, there are other advantages of installing a GPS tracking device in all your household's vehicles.
Locating a stolen vehicle is the use of a vehicle tracking system. It might save enough time for police to be in a position to apprehend the thief before the car is damaged.

When installed in an automobile, a vehicle tracking system may identify and alert you to irregular driving. This could mean a thief is attempting to escape the region where the vehicle was stolen. It might also imply something is wrong with the individual driving the vehicle. The apparatus which include a camera installed on the dashboard may even enable you to identify the driver.
A vehicle the tracking system may be employed to spy on a partner or a teenage driver. But there are other very positive benefits to installing a rather sophisticated system on your automobiles.

Positioned in the care of an aging parent, you might be alerted to the sort of driving that would indicate a medical emergency or might help you know that a parent with minimal memory or other cognitive difficulties is secure.
Some Vehicle tracking system equipment can also be able to track driving habits. It might, for instance, track and record driving pace, cornering speed, and tailgating, too rapid acceleration following a stop, failure to come to a full stop, and more. This info might be utilized to help a driver become a more powerful and more fuel-efficient driver.
Periodic reviews of driving behavior can be both informative and instructive for any driver, but particularly for new drivers. It helps each family member cut fuel consumption, saving money and the environment at the same time. Some car tracking system applications can be programmed to allow you to know when it's time for regular engine or when the tires are impacting fuel economics because they aren't inflated.
The GPS navigation driving directions supplied with your vehicle tracking system may also have benefits for your family. Each driver will be capable to find the most fuel-efficient, the fastest or the most direct path to every destination. You are able to remove the concern of a family member getting lost in the wrong neighborhood and being at risk. With a few systems, you may also use the GPS monitoring to monitor the road and offer both an alert along with a detour if there's an injury or another traffic slowdown ahead.
The geo-fencing option in several systems may be utilized in many ways. You may utilize it to geofence areas usually went by your family so you'll receive an alert if the vehicle leaves the fenced area. Geo-fencing may also be utilized to defend drivers or parents.

Well ok they don't really ask but I like to tell them anyway ;-)
What you really need is some fishing line and a reinforced hook. All the rest you can do without.
The algorithm goes as follows:
1. Find small insects or grubs to use as bait for small fish
2. Catch small fish
3. Fillet small fish and use as bait for piranha.
Piranha are very shy and suspicious and they need to satisfy themselves that what they are about to bite cannot bite them back. So you cast your line vertically and let it rest on the bottom of the river. It will take them a couple of minutes before they start biting.
If you cast from the bank rather than a boat you risk your line getting tangled to the infinite number of submerged branches in the river.
Pygocentrus nattereri) - reputably the most ferocious of all.
In my experience the danger is minimal. The native people think nothing of going for a dip in waters brimming with piranha. I personally have bathed several times in isolated pools with piranhas in them in the dry season.
The only tricky bit is when removing the hook from one you just caught - you can easily lose a small but important part of your finger that way...

I happen to believe that females, particularly in the sales oriented positions, are better. They're more empathetic. They're better listeners."
Ho hum.
But if he had said, "We look for more males than females by design because men are better," there'd be demands from the intolerant left that CNBC never allow such a monster on TV ever again.
Exaggeration? Well, you tell me.
At Google, an engineer named James Damore, who has a Ph.D. from Harvard, just had a run-in with the intolerant left. He wrote an internal 10-page memo that basically said the reason there are more men than women working in Silicon Valley has less to do with sexism than it does with fundamental differences between the sexes.
He said the gender gap was partly due to biology; that men have a "higher drive for status" and that women are "more prone to anxiety."
How crazy do you have to be to believe that women are more prone to anxiety? Except a publication called Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Review states that, "female-biased conditions include depression, anxiety disorder, and anorexia nervosa."
Note: "female-biased conditions." But hey, they're only scientists. What do they know about these things? Besides, it's a generalization. It's not about (SET ITAL) all (END ITAL) women. You can say men generally are taller than women but that doesn't mean some women aren't taller than some men.
In any case, when the internal document was leaked -- and went viral -- Damore got canned.
And before anybody goes yelling about "free speech," employees of private companies have no such rights. Google had every right to fire Damore.
But let's not pretend that if he had instead written a 10-page document saying that Google should hire more women because they make better engineers than men, he not only would not have been fired, there's a good chance he would have been promoted.
You don't have to agree with anything James Damore wrote to notice that in some liberal quarters certain views are just not tolerated. Try delivering a conservative speech on a liberal college campus sometime and let me know how it goes.
Liberals may not like generalizations about gender, but they have no problem generalizing about inequality -- figuring that it's usually linked to discrimination. Sometimes it is. But sometimes it isn't.
Here's an inconvenient piece of information that the holier-than-thou crowd might want to think about. When women get Masters degrees, by and large, they're not in computer engineering, which would go a long way if you want a job in Silicon Valley.
Take a look at this list of the Top 10 Masters degrees for women (as compiled by College Atlas):
--Business Administration and Management
--Education.
--Social work.
--Elementary education.
--Curriculum and instruction.
--Education leadership.
--Special education.
--Counselor education.
--Nursing.
--Reading teacher education.
But the Top 10 Masters degrees for men include:
--Electrical engineering.
--Computer sciences.
--Mechanical engineering.
--Computer and information sciences.
There's something else Damore wrote in his internal document, which was titled, "Google's Ideological Echo Chamber."
"Differences in distributions of traits between men and women may in part explain why we don't have 50 percent representation of women in tech and leadership. Discrimination to reach equal representation is unfair, divisive, and bad for business."
By "discrimination to reach equal representation" he means outreach programs that target women and other groups whose numbers in the workforce don't comport with their numbers in the general population.
And he says, "Open and honest discussion with those who disagree can highlight our blind spots and help us grow.".Back in March, we talked about Subaru's intent to bring back the Justy. This highly-efficient vehicle is now available for sale in the UK, and it's got some great stats: 64.2 mpg (UK) in the Extra Urban cycle and CO 2aru (which is based on the Japanese-built Daihatsu Sirion) will only offer about 6,000 units a year throughout Europe and 1,000 in the UK.
The full details of this vehicle are available in the release after the jump and check out the gallery.
The full details of this vehicle are available in the release after the jump and check out the gallery.
In fact, with a 64.2 mpg Extra Urban figure, ultra-low 118 g/km exhaust emissions and annual £35 Road Fund Licence, the new Justy 1.0 R promises to be one of the cheapest petrol-engined cars to run on UK roads.
However, the five-door body offers interior space from the next class up while the efficient, 69 PS three-cylinder 1.0 litre engine offers sufficient power for long-distance driving. Top speed, for example, is almost 100 mph and the 0-60 mph time is 13.5 seconds.
The new Subaru Justy also carries a peace-of-mind five-year/60,000 mile warranty backed by five-years' UK and European roadside assistance.
Standard equipment is outstanding for a small car and includes: ABS with EBD, driver, passenger, side and front and rear curtain airbags, alloy wheels, air-conditioning, radio/CD player, rev-counter, fuel-economy read-out, four electric windows, reversing sensors, remote central-locking with alarm and ISOFIX child-seat mountings.
The front-wheel drive Justy is based on the Japanese-built Daihatsu Sirion. It is supplied thanks to an arrangement with Toyota which has a share in both Subaru and Daihatsu.
Subaru's version will be limited to only 6,000 units per year throughout the whole of Europe and 1,000 sales in the UK, ensuring strong residuals.
Strong Customer Loyalty
Lawrence Good, Subaru (UK) Limited Managing Director said: "Everyone is very enthusiastic about the new Justy as it is will appeal to environmentally-conscious motorists and those seeking ultra-low running costs.
"Subaru dealers enjoy strong customer loyalty and the new Justy gives them a much-needed entry-level car to sell to both existing customers and new prospects."
The new Subaru Justy carries a five-year/60,000 mile mechanical warranty and five-years' UK and European roadside assistance.
It also has a 12-year anti-perforation warranty and its Group 5D insurance rating is also highly-competitive.
Spacious Interior
The new Subaru Justy has a particularly spacious five-seat interior clothed in a stylish body with an exceptionally low 0.31 Cd drag coefficient which improves fuel economy and high-speed touring and refinement.
Its wide-opening doors and 590 mm seat height allow easy entry and exit – especially appreciated by older customers. The rear doors, for example, open to 80 degrees. Luggage space measures 225 litres with the rear seat up and 630 litres (VDA) when folded, making it a practical small family car. Its turning circle is an especially tight 9.4 metres.
Well-Proven Powertrain
The punchy 1.0 litre twin-overhead camshaft petrol engine – mated to a manual five-speed gearbox is not only extremely economical and low-polluting but also well-proven.
In fact, the same three-cylinder engine not only sees service in the Daihatsu Sirion but also in the Toyota Yaris and Aygo, Citroën C1 and Peugeot 107.
Producing 69.3 PS at 6,000 rpm and 69.3 lb ft of torque at 3,600 rpm, the 12-valve unit offers some of the highest outputs for its class.
And the variable valve-timing enhances both low-speed pulling power and high-rev responsiveness.
Top speed is a highly competitive 99.4 mph with a 0-60 mph time of 13.5 seconds. Meanwhile fuel economy figures are class-challenging at 46.3/64.2 and 56.5 mpg on the Urban/Extra Urban and Combined Cycles.
In addition, the CO2 emissions are among the lowest available in a petrol-engined car at 118 g/km.
This puts the Justy in Band B for Road Fund Licence at only £35 per year and should result in it being London Congestion Charge-free when proposed new changes take place in 2008.
European-Tuned Chassis
The new Subaru Justy benefits from a European-tuned chassis which has long suspension-travel for a smooth ride. Unusually, anti-roll bars are fitted at the front and rear which combine with firm damping to aid agility.
The front suspension is via MacPherson struts and the rear is equally conventional featuring a torsion bar with separate coil springs. Its power steering is via an electric system which helps fuel economy but has been tuned for more feel than provided by some competitors.
Safety-wise, the new Justy's multiple airbags are complemented by an advanced braking system featuring not only anti-lock ventilated front discs and rear drums (ABS) but also Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD). This optimises the braking force according to the weight distribution of passengers and luggage.

This will start a jetty server and execute all integration tests in the maven phase
integration-test using the
normal failsafe plugin. Integration tests are all classes ending with
ITCase and are written using JUnit.
To develop integration tests, you should start a local server with the scm-integration-test-plugin. This plugin is used as a way to introspect server internals. For example you can register event listeners here and access their triggers with a REST endpoint. Of course, this plugin is not and should not be installed in productive systems. You can start the server with this plugin using the following maven call:
mvn run -pl :scm-integration-test-pluginIn this two-day evidence-based course, participants class with parents and their newborns each day of the training.

Al Henson, Co-Host of SageTalk
Founder and Global Ambassador, Compassionate Hope Foundation
Forty years ago, Al and Susan Henson moved to Antioch, Tennessee and started a life-long ministry that would include a thriving, diverse church, a multi-national Christian school, and several other effective ministries for refugees and the poor in middle Tennessee.
Throughout the forty years, though, the Lord kept calling Al to Southeast Asia where he regularly traveled, serving the nations through building partnerships with trustworthy, national servant leaders. These experiences in Asia also exposed Al to the plague of poverty and human trafficking that is overwhelming Southeast Asia.
It was in response to this need, that Al launched Compassionate Hope Foundation in 2011.
Working with the national leaders whom he had known and served for years, Al has established a ministry rescuing and caring for hundreds of children in Thailand, Laos, and the Philippines.
Al Henson has a BS from the University of Tennessee and a Masters degree and Doctorate of Divinity from Liberty University. Al welcomes the opportunity to speak with your church or conference.

He often speaks at conferences and events and has taught in locations ranging from Ocean Grove Camp in New Jersey to the Upper Room Chapel in Nashville.
He is a graduate of Asbury University, and Asbury Theological Seminary. He has led local churches to engage in planting hundreds of new churches on four different continents.
Paul and his brother, Dallas businessman, Patrick Lawler, worked with the Compassionate Hope Foundation in founding and establishing two Patricia B. Hammonds Homes of Hope for orphans in Thailand.
Paul and Missy have four children and one daughter in law. As an ordained pastor in the United Methodist Church, UMs in North Alabama honored Paul by awarding him the Denman Evangelism Award for his servant-leadership in reaching new people for Jesus Christ.Band posters

A three-day international Conference “National Cinemas – A Universal Heritage Issues of Reappraisal, Preservation and Popularization” will be held in Yerevan on October 29-31.
The three - day Conference is organised in honour of French - Armenian filmmaker Henri Verneuil's 100th anniversary, which is included in the UNESCO Calendar of Anniversaries of Eminent Personalities and Important Events of 2020. Born in Turkey and relocated to France with his family in 1924, Verneuil's creative path was paved in the context of French commercial cinema, which is brilliantly represented by the over forty films made by this director. Verneuil only turned to Armenian subject matter at the end of his career, releasing his famous autobiographical drama Mayrig in 1991, which also became one of the key works of diasporan - Armenian cinema.
Using Henri Verneuil's legacy and the trajectory of the cinemas from the ex - socialist republics as a point of departure, the conference aims to address these ambivalent phenomena as heritages that complicate received perceptions of 'national' cinemas.
Traditionally seen as isolated phenomena that evolved on the margins of international film, the 'national' - or 'minor' - cinemas of the Soviet Republics and various diasporan communities, have often been excluded from dominant narratives and canons as being of predominantly local interest. These perceptions occlude the rich inter - cultural processes through which 'minor' cinematic industries evolved and had an impact far beyond their national borders.
Being classified as solely 'local' phenomena, films from countries such as Armenia remain outside of the purview of major archives, museums and festivals, which significantly limits opportunities for their restoration, access and broader circulation.
Working towards opening a cross - disciplinary and critical dialogue on the focal issues pertaining to ideas of national and 'minor' cinemas, the conference will engage over 15 international scholars, critics, archivists and film industry experts, who are working with the legacies of Soviet, socialist, and diasporan cinema.
The Conference will be held in English and Armenian, with synchronized translation. In the frameworks of this event, a special live conversation will be held with Henri Verneuil's son, director Patrick Malakian, along with an exhibition of posters from Henri Verneuil's films and a screening of the director's 1964 war drama 'Weekend at Dunkirk'.
An edited publication with papers presented at the conference will be released by National Cinema Center of Armenia following the event.

Springdale High School student survives COVID-19 after 14 days in ICU
A 16-year-old Springdale High School student is recovering at home after she was in the intensive care unit for 14 days and in a coma for six days with COVID-19.
Doctors told Camden Tucker’s family that she had a 1% chance of surviving when she was admitted to the hospital with COVID-19.
“We did everything we could possibly do to protect the kids from getting COVID-19 and it took her life and fortunately, because of the circumstances we were able to bring her back.” Camden’s father, Donald Tucker, said.
Camden Tucker was on a family trip when her brother noticed Camden was going into cardiac arrest. Her dad immediately did CPR while her mom called 911. Hours later, they found themselves at the Arkansas Children’s Hospital in Little Rock.
“They tested her for COVID, and that’s when we found out she was positive, we didn’t know,” Donald Tucker said.
Doctors told Camden’s family that she went into cardiac arrest after COVID-19 infected her heart muscle.
Based on Camden’s condition, her family was told the outlook was not good.
“When are told your child has a 1% chance to live, it’s just awful it sucks the wind out of your sail,” Donald Tucker said.
But slowly, Camden starting making progress.
“Every little breath, every little step she got better, we hung onto that feeling as tight as we could and then she just kept stomping on the gas pedal and getting better and better and better,” Tucker said.
Soon she was walking and talking. Beating all odds, doctors released her from the hospital after 14 days,
Now Camden is baby stepping back into normalcy.
“You start from zero, yes you start from zero. This is a girl in peak shape in her life and now she has to start from zero,” Tucker said.
A dancer for the Silver Stars Har-Ber High School team, Camden said she hopes her story is a wake-up call for others.
“Just because I was healthy and everything and I still almost lost my life, I hope they understand it can happen to anyone too,” Camden said.
Camden has been home for three weeks and is expected to make a full recovery.
She told 40/29 News she hopes more people will get their CPR training because that is what helped save her life.Drawing on The Office Group’s extensive knowledge of workplace needs, the Co Chair pairs a lightweight, sleek profile with great seating comfort

The Origins
In an age when we have come to rely on our smartphones to tell us the time a renaissance of the classic wall clock.I woke up this morning thinking about how far behind schedule I was – about three days or so. While discussing my planned route with Melanie a couple days ago, she mentioned that there were a couple major climbs of nearly 1,000 meters each in order to get to Grindelwald. I therefore figured it would take me two full days to reach Grindelwald, which would put me even further behind schedule. So I opted to use my Eurail Pass for the second time and take a train. There was a train station only 2 kilometers away from the campground, so it wasn’t long before I was on the train bound for Grindelwald. It was a flat trip for the first 10 kilometers or so, but immediately after leaving the town of Giswil the train started up. And it wasn’t a low-angle hill either. It wasn’t a cog railway and I was really surprised that a full-size train could climb that steep of a hill.
I was a bit disappointed to be taking the train instead of riding, but it turned out that I make the right decision. The first major climb was at least 1,000 meters, and the second one into Grindelwald was only slightly lower. So it would have taken two days for sure for me to ride it. As it was, I arrived in Grindelwald at 12:30 pm and got my first full-on view of the north face of the Eiger. What an amazing mountain!
And Grindelwald is surrounded by huge mountains. They’re about 2.5 times higher than the Chugach Mountains that we see to the east of Anchorage.
I took the train to the Jungfrauhoch, which at 11,333 feet is the highest train station in Europe. And this was no ordinary train. It was a cog railway which allowed it to climb much steeper grades – I guess the steepest was about a 20-25% grade, which is about twice as steep as some of the steepest roads. The first stage wound through the forest until the train got to Kleine Scheidegg, a hotel with other tourist facilities just above treeline. From there, a transfer to another train took up and through the Eiger. That’s the amazing part of the trip. Work began in 1896 to blast a tunnel 9.3 kilometers long inside the Eiger up to an area directly beneath a rocky spire on the ridgeline. Along the way, the tunnel comes close to the north face of the Eiger, so they’ve dug several access tunnels that break through to the face of the mountain at about the 10,500 foot level. You can stand right at the edge and look out the windows at the huge, vertical north face of the peak, and look straight down several thousand feet. It’s just amazing. Further up, there’s a huge train station inside the mountain at the 11,333 foot elevation, and from there more tunnels radiate out in several directions. One tunnel leads outside the mountain and provides access to the Aletsch Glacier. Another tunnel leads to an elevator 350 feet directly beneath the visitor center. A short ride up the elevator puts you at the visitor center that’s built directly on top of the ridge. Several walkways around the perimeter are cantilevered out from the rock, and you walk on see-through steel grating to the rocks and glacier hundreds of feet below your feet, so if you look down while you walk you get the unsettling feeling that you’re walking on air. I saw more than a few people staying as close as possible to the wall of the building, with a look of sheer dread on their faces.
I thought the facilities atop Mt.Pilatus were amazing. But the stuff at Jungfrauhoch tops Pilatus. It’s simply incredible what the Swiss have built up there. In addition to the visitor center/observation deck, there are several restaurants, tunnels everywhere inside the mountain, and out on the Aletsch Glacier you can walk around on groomed and roped-off trails that winds around huge crevasses. I took a short walk on the glacier, just to be able to say that I’ve been on the Aletsch Glacier. And if you want, you can go snow-tubing on the glacier (like bobsledding, but with inner tubes), and for the more adventurous there’s a zip line that’s about 500 meters long. It starts out about 20 or so meters above the glacier and gradually reaches the surface of the glacier at the landing zone, where you just come to a sliding stop on your back on the glacier. The whole experience, with all the stuff up there, is just amazing. Everyone should see it at some time in their lives.
Anyway, Grindelwald is an amazing place and it’s too bad I don’t have more time to spend here. Tomorrow (if it’s not raining and whiteout) I’ll ride up valley and over the pass at Grosse Scheidegg, which is a climb of about 3,000 feet. Then it’s down the other side to the Aare River valley. Should be a tough, but fun day.Wood Flooring FAQ. These areas will also require “screening” (light sanding) as a step in your maintenance program.
What color will work.
Do I have to have a sample?
Yes. You need a sample to compare with the other materials and surface colors in the space. You shouldn’t just rely on the word of the builder or designer, having a sample enables you to get an idea of what the entire room will look like BEFORE you install the flooring.
How do hardwood floors fare against other flooring surfaces?
It outlasts nearly every other flooring, and outperforms them all.
How do I care for my hardwood floors?
Sweep regularly, high traffic areas will need special attention, or use the hardwood setting on your vacuum cleaner. You should purchase a wood floor cleaning kit to keep your surfaces in the best possible condition.
How long will the job take?
The process through delivery to finishing and clean-up can take anywhere from 4-6 weeks. It is an arduous task, it is better for the job to take longer than for it to be done poorly.
What are the warranties and or guarantees?
We provide guarantees in our contracts. We warrantee our work for 1 year.
Does hardwood flooring increase my home’s value?
Yes, all home improvements can. Research shows that 90% of real estate agents think homes with hardwood floors sell faster.
Are hardwood floors environmentally friendly?
Yes. Hardwood floors are better than other materials in terms of insulation; they are recyclable and require less energy to produce.
We service and install in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.

Glen soaked the dirty rag in water, then started rubbing his sweat soaked face, letting the water dribble through the short hairs between his eyes. It helped to wash the salt out, but didn't do much to cool him off. Nothing seemed to cool him off in this weather. He reached down to his water jug and went to fill it.
"Damn it, Glen! What the hell are you doing?"
Glen was too tired to be startled. He turned slowly. "Barry, it's too hot to argue. Let me get cooled off..."
The lizard morphs eyes narrowed. "I'm not paying you to sit around and drink my water. I've got customers set to go and you're not even in norm form, much less harnessed!" His yellow eyes glinted in the hazy light. Barry was a stickler for the schedule.
Glen resisted the urge to slug the lizard. He hadn't even had time to have a drink since he stripped off the harness after the last run, his fourth of the day. It didn't bother Barry, though. In this heat, after all, the cold blooded carriage horse driver was comfortable while Glen had a rather heavy fur coat to deal with. "I just took a load up Beacon Hill and back! If you want to book these runs so close together, then you should get another horse!"
The lizard got right in his equine employees face, eyes glinting angrily. "I can do it in a minute! There are fifty college students vying for this job."
Glen rolled his eyes. The simple fact was his boss wasn't all that far off. Despite the fact that the mercury was bursting the thermometers and the air was so thick with humidity you could drink it, anyone with a vaguely equine norm form was applying for these jobs in droves. They paid well for what was usually not much work. The carriage drivers saved a fortune, too, not having to buy a horse and pay for its care. Glen gulped down half the lukewarm water in his bottle and set it aside. "Fine, lets go."
He walked over to the carriage, stripped off his shorts, and shifted to his very well muscled Percheron norm. For Glen, pulling the cart was a breeze and he truthfully loved to do it. Boston was one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and with the ban on all but necessary delivery trucks in the downtown still in effect after over 50 years, it was a delight to walk through. But on days like this...
Barry slipped the harness on easily with a well practiced motion. The driver had owned the carriage since long before the Change, and was used to putting this on in a hurry even with a protesting animal. Glen might have given him a hard time if his brain didn't feel like it was wrapped in wet, hot cotton. He blinked his eyes a few times and shook his head to help wake him slightly.
He felt the cart wobble behind him as his the lizard morph climbed in, then flipped the reigns slightly. It was somewhat anachronistic, Glen knew the route in his sleep at this point, but it was part of the old time charm of the carriage ride to let the driver look the part. Despite the heat, Barry was dressed in a heavy suit modeled on the old colonial clothing. He even carried a small whip as a prop. Glen glanced back to see the passengers, a couple of avian morphs each of species he didn't recognize, though one looked a lot like a tern. Between them, they were holding two cameras, a map and a Japanese-English translating computer. They barely made the carriage springs squeak as they climbed in. Much easier than the elephant morph last week, mused Glen. At least then, it had been cooler.
The reigns were flipped, and the Percheron started up instantly. He knew the route: Up past the old State House, down to the Common then up Beacon Hill to the new State house, finishing with a run by the waterfront and back to Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market. A long trip, longer than most of the carriages did in fact, but that was why Barry paid so well. Most equine morphs balked at pulling a carriage anyway, finding it demeaning, much less for a couple of miles.
Glen was reminded of how hot it was the moment that he started up the first low hill. The bulk of the carriage and its passengers should have been nothing, it usually was, but it felt heavy and got heavier with each step. He tried to ignore it, falling into a rhythmic pace as he passed the tiny brick circle that marked the Boston Massacre site. The street started to slope down a little, and Glen changed his pace to keep the small cart from pushing him into slipping. The heat rose off the pavement in waves, the buildings blocking any breeze from the sea or land. The sweat began to cover his hide, but the air was too damp for it to evaporate. It just stuck to him like a sticky blanket, making him feel all the hotter.
He began to feel dizzy.
He tried to ignore it. He could finish this tour and then just beg off before he got sick. He knew he could do it!
His head was swimming.
It wasn't that far!
He missed a step and clipped a hoof on a cobblestone.
He looked up the length of Beacon Hill, smelling a whiff of water from the nearby duck pond that sent his lips quivering. I've pulled heavier loads up bigger hills than this! he shouted to himself.
He missed another step, then stopped, exhausted. He couldn't even think about taking another step. His breath came in and out quick and ragged. He had a hard enough time staying on all fours!
Barry reacted instantly. "Go! Go!" he yelled, waving the whip about. He stood in his seat and whipped it forward, catching Glen lightly on the rump. "Move it!"
Glen looked disbelieving at the raging carriage driver, his passengers perched behind him in shock. He whipped me! he thought slowly, The bastard whipped me!
With a tired sigh, Glen willed back his morphic form. He glared at Barry. "That's it. I quit."
Barry's eyes got steely. "You can't quit, you'll never work in this town again!"
Glen fumbled with the harness, getting it off after a couple of false attempts, then turned, smiled weakly, then grabbed Barry by the collar and hoisted him up. "Get yourself another horse. Life is too damn short and it's too damn hot to put up with this crap." The lizard morph struggled, but even as exhausted as he was, Glen was still built like a skyscraper. "I'm going to go get a long drink of water now. You're going to refund these nice folks money," he said jutting his chin at the two tourists, "Then you're going to drag this cart back yourself." He looked at the two shocked tourists. "Sorry you had to see this."
The two Japanese tourists glanced nervously at each other, then back at him. "Hot?" asked one in a hesitant female toned voice.
Glen nodded as he set Barry on the ground. The shaken driver leaned heavily against the side of the carriage. "Very."
The woman's eyes glinted a little. "Want water?" she asked.
Cocking his head curiously, Glen nodded. "Please. I'd really appreciate it. I'd appreciate a shower right about now, too," he added with a slight mumble.
The woman's eyes lit up, literally, and suddenly Barry was being soaked from a stream of water falling out of nowhere. The lizard jumped as his suit was soaked through to the scales, but the water followed him as he raced for cover under a tree. It only stopped when the woman turned to Glen with bright eyes. "You?"
Glen laughed and held his arms out as the stream of cold water fell from nowhere and washed over his body..
It's like eating potato chips, I suppose, but I can't deny that I really do like running into people with information I don't have -- stuff that I congenially dub, "weird shit."
There really are people out there whose parrots sing opera or who have intricate mountains of information about earth worms or strong and congenial women who hunt alligators. Weird shit is not stuff I really want to delve into and retain -- the salty tang lies in the fact that I simply didn't know and not-knowing was delicious and sometimes addicting.
Last night, on Skype, I was chatting with a friend who knows more than I do about guns and ammunition. He doesn't own a Confederate battle flag as far as I know and he isn't some come-to-Jesus expositor of "second-amendment rights," but he knows something about guns and ammo and enjoys target shooting and, let push come to shove, defending himself.
Last night he was telling me about .223 ammunition. Apparently it's one form of standard military ordnance. When I said that the bullet attached to the cartridge looked rather small, he said it was ... and deliberately so: "It's not designed to kill. It's designed to wound. A dead man is just a body. But a wounded man requires two buddies to help him out ... two less guys in action."
Weird shit. Tactically, it made very good sense, however offensive and depressing the environment of those tactics might be.
None of this made me want to run out and get a gun or shoot anybody. But it registered on my weird shit-o-meter, the potato-chip, can't-just-eat-one portion of my mind.
Is there anything that isn't "weird shit" to somebody ... stuff that refocuses the mind, spices up all the known-and-comforting-and-vaguely-boring quantities of the mind, and provides a change from potatoes? The freshness is so refreshing and the tendency is to seek out more and more and more of that sort of refreshment ... to delight and be scrubbed clean in a new way of seeing. More and more and more and more... how refreshing!
But there is an insane quality to it all as well. Will there ever come a time when the need for new "weird shit" ends? The refreshing quality is scrumptious, but seeking out more and more and more things to inspire that refreshment is exhausting. Wouldn't it be easier just to enjoy the refreshment without all that seeking and being wowed?
I don't imagine for a moment that I will get over or relinquish this old habit of delighting in "weird shit." The habit is probably too thoroughly ingrained. But that doesn't mean I can't reflect a little and notice that every moment is a time for refreshment ... weird shit I simply didn't know and couldn't possibly see coming, however much I might pretend to be in control and knew it was coming. What's the matter with being refreshed without gobbling all the potato chips of "weird shit?"
You are weird shit to me. I am weird shit to you. You are weird shit to you. I am weird shit to me. Isn't that simply the truth -- a truth that requires no energy at all? Isn't it refreshing? Every moment ... refreshing? I think maybe it is. Imagine how much you know about what you know nothing about. Talk about weird shit.

209 Enabling Factors towards Safety Improvement for Industrialised Building System (IBS)
Authors: Nasyairi Mat Nasir, Zulhabri Ismail, Faridah Ismail, Sharifah Nur Aina Syed Alwee, Masnizan Che Mat
Abstract:
The utilisation of Industrial Building System (IBS) in construction industry will lead to a safe site condition since minimum numbers of workers are required to be on-site, timely material delivery, systematic component storage, reduction of construction material and waste. These matters are being promoted in the Construction Industry Master Plan (CIMP 2006-2015). However, the enabling factors of IBS that will foster a safer working environment are indefinite; on that basis a research has been conducted. The purpose of this paper is to discuss and identify the relevant factors towards safety improvement for IBS. A quantitative research by way of questionnaire surveys have been conducted to 314 construction companies. The target group was Grade 5 to Grade 7 contractors registered with Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) which specialise in IBS. The findings disclosed seven factors linked to the safety improvement of IBS construction site in Malaysia. The factors were historical, economic, psychological, technical, procedural, organisational and the environmental factors. From the findings, a psychological factor ranked as the highest and most crucial factor contributing to safer IBS construction site. The psychological factor included the self-awareness and influences from workmates behaviour. Followed by organisational factors, where project management style will encourage the safety efforts. From the procedural factors, it was also found that training was one of the significant factors to improve safety culture of IBS construction site. Another important finding that formed as a part of the environmental factor was storage of IBS components, in which proper planning of the layout would able to contribute to a safer site condition. To conclude, in order to improve safety of IBS construction site, a welltrained and skilled workers are required for IBS projects, thus proper training is permissible and should be emphasised.

- Don't see your idea?I use the term loosely. Okay, so maybe I use it mockingly in this context. This sort of thing really should have no connection to the works of Calder, Rodin or Brancusi. It might be worthy of a few fancy adjectives, such as ‘severe’, ‘unusual’, ‘dramatic’ and ‘bold’. Horticulturally though, we might be thinking more like ‘disgraceful’, ‘abhorrent’, ‘ridiculous’ or ‘just plain sad’.
There is nothing wrong with pollarding, that severe sort of pruning that almost all other arborists will tell you is wrong. It involves pruning trees back to the same distended terminal knuckles every winter. Only a few trees are adaptable to the technique, and technically, sweetgum happens to be one of those few trees.
The stipulation is that once pollarded, they MUST be cut back to the same knuckles EVERY winter. A small stub or maybe two can be left on knuckles to allow them to elongate.

I see WAAAAY to much of this type of tree “pruning” or “topping” around here. When I see this I wonder, “What were they thinking?”. It’s a death sentence and wrong on so many levels. The result is ugly and unhealthy for the tree. These trees often need to come down a few years later.

Most of the problems I find in the trees that In inspect were caused by those hired to maintain the tree.
It’s appalling what some folks do to poor trees, but your photo and explanations are excellent. I always refer to a lousy tree (or anything else) job as the ‘Texas chainsaw massacre’.

Oh, I never thought of it that way. I need to remember that. It is more creative than the terminology my colleagues use, and we are a pretty creative bunch. I want to write about our slang soon, but we have no creative slang for these sorts of techniques.
What a shame. I did enjoy your explanation though! I’d love to see one of your properly trimmed trees to contrast.
Here a tree owner’s first thought is ‘cut it down’, they just might think it needs ‘pruning’ but will usually diy it or get the local firewood merchant to do the job. Always looks awful. Crown-thinning etc are unknown and qualified arborists, occasionally I manage to save a tree.

As an Assistant District Attorney in Kenosha County, Binger has a long career in law, including a 2016 District Attorney, a failed race in the Democratic Party line for Racine County. The sun.
Binger, who argued the case with Prosecutor James Krause, was frequently consulted by Judge Bruce Schroeder during Rittenhouse’s trial.

Schroeder, who was appointed to the bench by Democratic Governor Patrick Lucy in 1983, advised Binger at one point of “brazen” – arguing that the silence following Rittenhouse’s Miranda-protected detention should be further explored.
Rittenhouse told Tucker Carlson tonight that there was a “ridiculous” amount of “prosecutorial misconduct” in his case.

“They knew I was innocent but they still decided to bring these charges to make a name for themselves – they wanted my head on their shelves,” he said.
Directly addressing Binger’s behavior, the 18-year-old called the prosecutor “a corrupt person who just wants to make a name for himself and doesn’t see the facts.”
“I am a fan of prosecutors, not anymore: I believe there are better lawyers out there. Tried to place. “
“This is a case that has nothing to do with politics – but politics is brought in for people’s own agenda,” he said.
Kyle Rittenhouse: God is on my side
Rittenhouse criticized the FBI after calling on operators of an Airborne camera drone to capture imagery of shooting incidents.
According to Rittenhouse, he credited his own consultant, Mark Richards, for asking the operators the tail numbers for the FOIA request to be submitted – but Binger and Krauss described the question as a welcome Letter of desire By the State of Wisconsin Attorneys.

Because of Tauhi’s letter, “We couldn’t ask for his tile number, so we can submit our FOIA requests – which are still being requested so we can get a full version of that night in the drone video,” said Rittenhouse host Tucker Carlson.
“[The federal witness] Don’t give us a tail number. We couldn’t ask what the tail number was.
Rittenhouse said the government claimed that his other lawyer, Natalie Wisco, had received the Tauhi information but in reality the lawyers did not accept it.
“It magically disappeared from her email. The state said she emailed it, but we never got it,” Rittenhouse said.Wow, where did the week go? Where did this month go?! I actually haven't spent as much time on the old computer as I've needed this week with the little girls being sick and all:( Hopefully this is the last of the winter bugs bothering us right now though and we'll have a reprieve here very soon:)
Even with little browsing time however I still managed to pull a few things from here and there. My problem is probably that I'm a little too easily inspired in one way or another by almost everything I see. Oh well! Enjoy.

These current and future Bulldogs have been virtually recruiting the America’s top high school prospects to come join them at UGA. This all started with 5-star quarterback commit Brock Vandagriff Tweeting at recruits with their picture in a Dawgs jersey.
5-star UGA tight end commit Darnell Washington, who signed as a member of Georgia’s 2020 class, is joining in on the fun, replying to 4-star 2021 tight end and heavy Dawgs prospect Brock Bowers via Twitter.
Washington replied to Bowers’ tweet of an old practice video of him running through tackles to open grass.
“Looks like a UGA DAWG to me,” Washington said.
Bowers, the Napa, California native, is listed as the No. 3 tight end in the 2021 class, according to 247Sports.
Georgia looks to be the leader for Bowers, who has a top eight of Cal, Georgia, Notre Dame, Oregon, Oregon State, Penn State, UCLA and Washington.

Auditing of insurance transactions to ensure their compliance with the environmental, social, human rights and anti-corruption requirements is a high priority for SERV.
When assessing insurance applications, SERV observes the international guidelines of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the principles of Swiss foreign policy according to Art. 6 para. 2 SERV Act (SERVG). These relate in particular to the peaceful co-existence of peoples, respect for human rights and promotion of democracy, conservation of natural resources, alleviation of poverty and destitution in the world, but also to preserving Switzerland’s independence and protecting its national welfare. Further requirements may arise as a result of Switzerland’s obligations under international law. Where necessary, on-site visits are also carried out to assess larger, environmentally relevant projects. Due to travel restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, these site visits and meetings with project participants were conducted virtually.
Climate strategy
SERV has joined the federal administration’s environmental and resource management system (RUMBA) and, as a result, reports its own greenhouse gas emissions to the federal government. SERV implements the requirements of the federal government’s climate package and offsets all its greenhouse gas emissions. SERV is therefore a certified carbon-neutral company.
SERV developed a climate strategy during the 2020 financial year. The three cornerstones of the strategy include the handling of SERV’s own greenhouse gas emissions, integrating climate risks into business operations and SERV’s contribution to decarbonising the economy. SERV is not free to design its climate strategy, as it is obliged to adhere to the specifications of the federal government in addition to those set out in the SERV Act (SERVG) and the SERV Ordinance (SERV-V). Its statutory mission does not allow SERV to exclude certain sectors, such as fossil fuels, a priori. Instead, it is obliged to examine each insurance application on a case-by-case basis. SERV does, however, have the ability to take a cautious approach to projects that involve high greenhouse gas emissions and specifically promote climate-positive projects. The precise elaboration of these two points is an important first step in the implementation of SERV’s climate strategy. The Board of Directors will examine the climate strategy and the implementation measures in detail at the beginning of 2021.
Transparency
All projects with a contract value of CHF 10.0 million or more will be published on the SERV website, subject to the policyholder’s approval.
SERV also maintains a regular dialogue with interested non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Within the framework of this NGO dialogue, SERV provides information about its business results and specific current projects, as well as developments at SERV and in the OECD export credit group. In 2020, this dialogue was conducted digitally, with representatives from SERV and from the organisations WWF, Public Eye, Pro Natura and Transparency International taking part. This exchange of views is very much appreciated by all participants, and the NGOs expressed their satisfaction with SERV’s high level of transparency.
Anti-corruption
When presented with allegations that applicants or parties involved in an insured transaction are complicit in bribery, SERV must carry out extensive investigations (due diligence) based on its compliance policy and OECD regulations.
In 2020, SERV carried out enhanced due diligence on two applicants. In both cases, it was able to determine that the applicants currently had a robust anti-bribery system in place and that there were no irregularities in the transactions that SERV had been approached to cover.
Sustainability Audit
Monitoring for a new urea factory
The Swiss company Casale, based in Lugano, is acting as general contractor for the construction of a urea factory in Tolyatti, Russia. This will increase the production capacity from about 2 800 tonnes per day to 5 000 tonnes. Benefits of the new factory: the operator can integrate the new factory into its existing infrastructure and thereby minimise additional environmental pollution. Construction work began in October 2018 and is scheduled to be completed by March 2022.
Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP)
The transaction is classified as a Category B project under the OECD Common Approaches and is therefore subject to an in-depth assessment of compliance with sustainability requirements. This assessment took place at the beginning of 2018 and, as is customary, was carried out by an independent consulting firm. The assessment resulted in a plan of action. In this Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP), the consulting firm specifies the measures that must be undertaken to comply with the environmental, social and human rights requirements. The definitive criteria are the environmental and social standards of the International Finance Corporation and the World Bank.
The consulting firm prepared the ESAP in close collaboration with SERV, the financing bank, Casale and the local operator. In this project, the measures for the current construction phase primarily concerned occupational safety on the construction site and collaboration with sub-contractors, alongside measures to ensure that the local population is not affected by noise and odour emissions.
Monitoring under special conditions
Compliance with these measures is generally monitored and the project is currently in this phase. This was, however, made more difficult by the epidemiological situation in 2020: on-site visits were no longer possible due to travel restrictions and lockdown regulations.

I am going to discuss the best ways to train a child and this means children from ages approximately 10 to 12. These athletes are too young to start lifting heavy yet you want to keep them active throughout the year.
Athletics are becoming more and more competitive at younger ages, so give your athlete the edge they need to be the best. Keep training fun, and your athlete will fall in love with training as many of us have already fell in love with the iron game.
Bodyweight Exercises
Children of all ages can perform bodyweight exercises and the best for an athlete are pushups, pull ups, and sit ups. These exercises will help young athletes build a strength base so they can safely transition into a successful weightlifting career. I suggest doing sets of 10 for each of these and once that is too easy slowly increase the amount of reps or the amount of sets.
Make this into a contest or a game; give rewards to the athlete that does the most pushups. You need to keep this sort of training fun, many young kids do not care how strong they are but they are competitive. Use this to your advantage; athletes want to win, so this is a great way to make training fun.
Plyometrics
Plyometrics are also great for building strength and also flexibility. Use plyometrics to focus on athletic skills such as balance and hand-eye coordination. Jump training is the best way to help your athlete build strength and speed, this is true an athlete of any age. Some good exercises for this is jumps onto a box, squat jumps, lateral hurdle jumps or lateral jumps onto a box.
Squat focused movements are very important to athletes; this is how you can build lower body strength and increase speed and lateral quickness. Sprinting is also a key in athletic development, at their young age they do not need to do as much endurance training. Sprinting will also build the lower body muscles while improving athletic abilities.
Using a medicine ball for various throws is also an effective to build strength while having fun with your athletes. One way would be to do a chest pass with a medicine ball, or throw across the body then switch. This will hit the core and other upper body muscles.
Stretching
When athletes are young it is a great time to teach them the value of the warm up and cool down. Stress this every time you train your athletes and you can reduce their risk of injury throughout their entire career. Before each workout take a short jog with them and do other activities to loosen up their bodies. At the end of workouts make sure that they stretch for at least 15 minutes so their bodies develop into athletic machines.
Whether you are a coach working with your entire team or just a parent trying to make your child the best these methods will be very effective. Not only to you get to spend time with your child, performing these exercises could help your own exercise career. The key to training any young child is to keep it fun, make things into games and reward the athlete when they improve. Children are spending too much time watching television and playing video games so get them out there and get them on a fun exercise program so they can live a long healthy life.Sale Items

As we struggle with an uncertain future and a tragic present marked by mass death, we discuss the brutal nonchalance of the Trump administration’s kleptocratic core. Counter to everyone else in the US, the Trump Crime Cult is not acting as if they’re unsure of what the future holds. They appear very assured of their future. They are behaving, in fact, like people who knew this was coming.
We discuss the exploitation of the crisis by the Trump regime, their ominous long-term plans to remain in DC while they let New Yorkers die,
and their hoarding of necessary medical equipment for personal profit. We also remind everyone that Trump is a Kremlin asset and that his current destruction of the United States — in which he pits states against each other in a literal life or death battle for medical supplies – fulfills a long-time Putin fantasy. The collapse of the Soviet Union and its separation into independent states was the worst thing that happened to Putin, and he would love to replicate it in a fractious US. This is one of many, many reasons that we need to support each other as Americans.
Finally, we conclude with a special interview with Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian filmmaker from Crimea who was kidnapped from Crimea during Russia’s invasion and imprisoned by a Russian court for his activism. Sentsov was released in 2019, and Andrea got the first interview with him in the US after his release. Sentsov’s story of persevering under brutal conditions, and never surrendering his commitment to his art and his principles, is one that we need to hear in these dark times of self-imposed isolation.
We encourage you to listen to our March 2019 episode about Sentsov’s inpsiring story of making a film from a Siberian prison. That film, Numbers, recently premiered at the Berlin Film Festival. As Andrea mentions in her interview, Sentsov’s book of short stories, Life Went on Anyway, is worth reading, especially for fans of Hemingway. For the full coverage of Sentsov’s recent trip to urge the US to support Ukraine and not underestimate Putin, check out his chilling remarks in this write-up from PEN America. Sentsov also calls on us not to forget Ukrainian political prisoners kidnapped during Russia’s invasion: .”

Kuban State Agrarian University named after I. T. Trubilin, 13 Kalinina str., Krasnodar, 350044, Russia
Corresponding author: prihodkoigor2012@yandex.ru
Rice cultivation is the most resource-intensive production in the Russian agro-industrial sector. Historically, the technology of flooded rice cultivation in thу Krasnodar Territory has remained virtually unchanged for more than 90 years. This is due not only to the biological but also to the technological features of its cultivation. In this connection, the issue of optimizing the production process of rice cultivation is becoming increasingly important every year. Global experience in rice cultivation has determined a further direction of research on optimizing rice cultivation technologies, namely the development of a resource-saving technology for drip irrigation of rice. The pioneering research done by domestic scientists to test drip irrigation of rice in Russia has proved the feasibility and effectiveness of their use. This article proposes a modern resource-saving drip irrigation project for rice, which was tested in OOO “Chernoerkovskoe” in the Slavyanskiy District of the Krasnodar Territory. The authors have proved the efficiency of the proposed rice cultivation technology, resulting in the reduction of irrigation norm, material, labour, energy and technical-technological resources in rice production and crops of rice rotation. The introduction of the new technology has improved not only the biometric indicators of rice, but also the ameliorative condition of soils. Drip irrigation technology makes it possible to cultivate rice outside the rice irrigation systems on land previously used for rain-fed agriculture, which will increase not only the potential area under rice cultivation, but also the geography of rice cultivation in Russia..Thursday, July 20, 2017

- Benjamin Hawkins Company (1850)
So I started for the Rocky Mountains in the spring of 1850. I went to Council Bluffs and found my mother in Plum Hollow on the east side of the Missouri River. She packed up and I took her with me. We then went to Council Point where I found Uncle Levi Gifford and family who were getting ready for the journey. We staid a few days for them to get ready and then we drove down to the lower ferry below the mouth of the Platte River. Here we found a great many had gathered to be organized for the journey. We were organized into Brother [Benjamin] Hawkins’ hundred, Thomas Johnson’s fifty. My team consisted of one yoke of oxen, one yoke of three year old steers and one yoke of cows. We crossed the river in a flat boat and camped at the mouth of Salt Creek on the Platte bottom. Here I consider a miracle was wrought for the benefit of the companies that were about to cross the plains. The Pawnee Indians made their appearance by hundreds, and I believe by thousands, for they could be seen standing on the bluffs like a thousand stumps. Quite a lot of them came into camp and commenced begging and stealing, and stole more than they begged. One finally stole a sack of crackers, and got caught at it and brought it back. The old Chief, quite an old Indian gave him a number of heavy licks with his riding whip over the head and gave him a terrible talking to. I suppose it was for getting caught and not for stealing. About this time it was discovered that a Gentile who had come up on a steamboat and got into our company to cross the Plains was nearly dead with the small pox. This word was soon conveyed to the Redmen who disappeared like dew before the searching rays of the sun. The Cholera also commenced it work in camp and soon we burried. All believed what he said and did accordingly and the strange promise was literally fulfilled, for just five and no more died. While the gold seekers ahead of us and the Saints behind us were dying at a fearfut rate. I will now tell about the water. The Platte water being muddy, there had been wells dug all along the Platte bottom to get clear water. The wells were about six feet deep with steps dug to get to the water. The council was this, “To not go near those wells for water but get their water out of the river and drink none without boiling and to fill their churns, teakettles, and everything that they had that would hold water with boiled water to use while traveling. There was in the camp a kind of a fearful looking for the Small pox, as quite a number had been exposed, but no one had it. The Lord had respects to the words of his servant and preserved the camp from farther sickness and death.]1×1 Meetings

Guests looking to swim can visit a free public beach found just outside of the campgrounds themselves, while dog enthusiasts can enjoy the over 20 miles of trails found in the area while they tucker out their canine for the evening.
Camping is done here in 42 total sites, all of which provide ample space for a family with a pack of canines in tow to grill out and enjoy the stars at night. Picnic tables and fire pits are provided, as well as the option to rent a group site for an additional $52 per evening. The group area sleeps up to 35 individuals comfortably but features no extra amenities. Drinking water taps can be found just outside of the public restrooms. Although these sites provide some additional breathing room for guests, it's still crucial that you keep any visiting canines on a leash and inside of your tent overnight. Bears are a regular concern in the Idaho Panhandle National Forest, which Beaver Creek is a part of.
Beaver Creek offers some great chances for dog walking and hiking. If you're a guest who's looking for a bit of a challenge, perhaps try the Navigational Trail, an almost 10-mile stretch that leads guests to the nearby Upper Preist Lake. There's also the shorter Lakeside Trail, which is more well-known for its scenic mountainside sights and easier terrain. Whichever of these you choose to explore with your dog, make sure to keep Fido on a strong restraint and pack emergency essentials for your journey in case you stumble off the beaten path or twist an ankle. Occasionally, these trails see riders on horseback, which makes consistent leash use doubly important here.
Whether you want to reconnect with nature or just need a weekend getaway from the daily grind, Beaver Creek Campground is the pawfect place for your next vacay!Recruiting Mailbag: 17th Edition

It’s even important to have disinfected utensils and a clean and orderly space in your house so as to clean your skin well prior to waxing. This will prevent infection or an accident.

How to Remove Hair Naturally? Wax at Home!
There are different types of skin, and therefore, not all waxes are good for everyone. This technique has advantages and disadvantages.
Wax has a lasting effect and should therefore only be applied once or twice a month at a maximum. This allows the skin to rest and the hair to grow without the cutting interruptions of razors, which make the skin more prone to irritation.
Another advantage is the feeling of silky and healthy skin. When the hair is completely removed from the root, it leaves the skin impeccable.
Besides that, this method is very affordable and effective. It also comes in different shapes and sizes today; there are hot, warm, and cold types of wax for different types of skin and tastes.
The first disadvantage to waxing is that this method of application could turn out to be very painful for some people. However, the skin does get used to it with regular waxing and the pain tends to fade into the background.
Wax could cause ingrown hairs if not properly applied. Irritation and allergies could also become more common in some people.
If you have extremely sensitive skin, and the pulling motion could cause bruises and small bumps.

The latest figures from Morgan Mckinley’s London Employment Monitor, reveal that the city’s Financial Services industry is having a strong third quarter. The Monitor, which launched today, suggests recruitment activity has surged again across the quarter amid reports of greater demand for staff and the return to normal business conditions as London fills up again.
According to the Monitor the number of jobs available in London’s Square Mile have grown to 10,059 since Q2, while applicant numbers have also grown quarter-on-quarter to 21,100. The figures are a strong indicator of the sector’s resilience against the labour shortages seen elsewhere in the UK with 2 potential applicants for every job.
Hakan Enver, managing director, Morgan McKinley UK commented: “The Square Mile is back in business – socialising, commuting and face-to-face meetings are back on the cards as Londoners return to the office. Professionals looking for a new job were at their highest level since pre-Covid-19 wiping out the effects of Brexit, pandemic uncertainty and the furlough scheme. Candidates are now confident to seek out new opportunities and not worry about being last in, first out.”
Year-on-year, the figures are also very positive. The number of jobs available have grown by 164%, while job seeker numbers have also seen substantial growth with a 52% increase on this time last year.
Hakan continued: “Despite the strong uptick in both vacancies and job seekers, the sector can’t afford to become complacent. The jobs market is overflowing with opportunities for candidates and employers are fighting harder than ever for the right talent. The challenge of hiring and hanging on to the best people continues to be a top priority for many businesses as they realise that the cost of losing an employee is more than offering a salary increase. Candidates can be difficult to find in certain areas with an increasing skills shortage especially in cybersecurity, software development and data which has seen huge demand over the last 18 months.”
“This period of time has made us think about what our colleagues do when they are together. Networking, learning, career progression, brainstorming, fear of missing out and friendships will bring people back to the office. If businesses want to retain the loyal talent they need to stay competitive and adapt quickly. The office has a very important role in the future but it’s going to have to be much more flexible,” said Hakan.
The UK remains an attractive hub for tech entrepreneurs and one of the best destinations to start and scale a tech business. Despite the challenges being faced both globally and nationally in the UK, there has been a surge in applications for the UK Global Talent Visa in the past year, which will help the sector gain further momentum.
Hakan concluded: “There is still a long way to go, but the last quarter has really felt like it’s back to school. We hope to see a continued steady rise as we move into Winter. Staff shortages will put constraints on the economy, restricting growth and innovation, so it’s vital we solve them quickly.”
Average Salary Change
The average salary change for someone moving from one company to another in Q3 rose to 22%; the highest since Q3 2018. In July 2021 alone, it peaked at 27%, the highest month since Morgan McKinley’s records began.
Hakan commented: “There is no doubt the post-Covid recovery has created competition for talent and therefore, resulted in salaries increasing. That said, a number of individuals are choosing to stay in their current roles, until at least bonus season has concluded, but those that are more open to moving now, are benefitting from considerably higher compensation packages.”Do you ever miss the stories that started “back in my day”?
I used to spend weekends at my grandpa’s house helping with chores like mowing the yard or running around the chicken coups. We’d watch black and white western shows on television and then he’d tell me about how things were different in his day. They were always positive stories about appreciation for advancements in different things that made life easier or opened more opportunities for him, his family, etc.
So here’s my “back in my day”…
When I got involved in technology and computers, the primary objectives of the technology were to share files and printers. Most IT organizations were networking some servers together with the client machines, which were relatively simple so that data could move faster than the old sneaker net. At that time, we didn’t worry much about antivirus because the systems and data were simple. Fast forward, and like my grandpa, I’m appreciative that technology has made so many advancements for better patient care, faster sharing of information, predictive models for catastrophic weather, and so on. However, along the lines, this has also brought forth security problems as the data we are now storing, processing, and sharing has become increasingly valuable to threat actors ranging from nation states to unscrupulous thieves.
Due to this evolution in technology, and other world events such as the pandemic and a shift to hybrid workforce, the perimeter of most organization networks have vanished as endpoints are geographically dispersed, and more-and-more systems are connecting to resources through VPN, over the Internet, and so on. This means that the computer you are using right now may very well be the perimeter or edge of the network even though it’s not physically attached to the organization’s location. This is where the alphabet soup of acronyms come in these days with Antivirus (AV), Next-Generation Antivirus (NGAV), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and finally Managed Endpoint Detection and Response (MDR). Let’s take a quick look at why these each provide a unique and valuable security layer for your systems.
Antivirus (AV) / Next-Gen Antivirus (NGAV)
Antivirus and Next-Gen Antivirus are considered the base layer of most systems these days. These provide signature-based protection against known attacks. This means that someone in the world was infected by a virus or malicious software (malware) and this was reverse-engineered by a security analyst who then created a definition file to identify and stop this same attack in the future. Next-Gen Antivirus (NGAV) takes this one step further by learning the normal patterns/behaviors of the system to detect anomalous behavior. This leads to greater efficiency and often reduced performance impact on the machine while maintaining a similar level of defense.
Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)
So, it sounds like NGAV does a pretty good job and is a smart solution, so where does EDR come into play and provide additional valuable security? EDR is primarily focused on gathering and analyzing security threat-related information from workstations or other endpoints to find indicators of compromise (pre-breach indicators). This information usually comes from data sources such as log files, performance monitoring sub-systems, file details stored on disk or in memory, running processes, and configuration data. With all this information gathered and processed EDR can combine this data with behavioral analysis (or what’s normal) of the system and therefore be more effective, protecting against emerging threats such as novel malware, exploit chains, ransomware, or advanced persistent threats.
Managed Endpoint Detection & Response (MDR)
As the name may indicate here, MDR is an improvement over EDR because it is a managed solution, which means there is an additional layer of intelligence behind the solution usually in the form of a 24/7 human Security Operations Center (SOC). MDR utilizes the information gathered via the EDR system and provides active 24/7 threat monitoring, detection, and some level of remediation service such as guidance or system isolation to contain and prevent the spread of cyber-attacks. The data collected from the EDR system is usually anonymized and fed into a machine learning system that can compare this data against other threat intelligence to enrich indicators, validate incidents, and then the MDR provider can take appropriate actions like threat containment and support.
The graphic below from Sophos depicts from left-to-right the evolving solutions related to AV/NGAV to EDR to MDR. Note that Sophos refers to MDR as Managed Threat Response (MTR).
“Back in my day”…there were fewer acronyms because the technology was simpler and the stakes were lower. In today’s rapidly evolving tech landscape, businesses need a trusted partner to help them make sense of the ABC’s and the XYZ’s. A managed service provider like us at Axxys can determine which new technologies will actually help achieve your business objectives.

In this guide, I will discuss how to react if you discover that an I-9 form has only been partially completed.
How to Deal with Problems in Form I-9 Uncovered By an Internal AuditAt times, incomplete I-9 forms will surface during an internal audit. While it may feel stressful to discover them, it is better to deal with it within your organization before submitting a form that may cause disruption down the line.
For some application processes, it is common knowledge that one needs to finesse a form in a certain fashion for an application to be accepted -- for instance, backdating. This is not the case with Form I-9.
How to Handle a Missing Form I-9If Form I-9 is missing, the current version of the form should be filled out as soon as possible. Do not backdate it.
Instead, you can attach a note to the new Form I-9 explaining the situation. To be clear, you can acceptably state that the new form is the result of an internal audit. There is no need to obfuscate the new form’s additional nature.
What About Missing Sections?Perhaps you have the original Form I-9, but certain sections have not been filled out. How you respond depends on the section missing.
If Section 1 was not completed or lacks pertinent information, it falls on the employee to finish this part. You should reach out to inform them of this need as soon as possible.
In the case of a missing or incomplete Section 2, this lands in the employer’s jurisdiction. HR should have the proper person in management fill out the remainders of the section.
Note: For the certification portion of Section 2, the employer should make the actual beginning date of employment clear.
Is It Ever Appropriate to Backdate?To reiterate, if you correct a Form I-9, neither the employer nor the employee should backdate the form. Ever.
Instead, rely on that signed and dated note to explain when and why the correction took place.Item Notes

Things are ... what they are these days around Juventus.
As the post-lockdown schedule has progressed and the opposition has gotten tougher, Juve’s form has not exactly gotten all that much more convincing. In fact, the last three games Maurizio Sarri’s squad have played have been highlighted mostly by what they were unable to do rather than what went right.
So, you can probably guess where the conversation started and centered around on this week’s episode of The Old Lady Speaks. The usual four horsemen of myself (Danny), Sam, Sergio and Chuks — who was smarter than the rest of us and went off the grid for much of the last week — discussed this issues that have prevented Juventus from doing much of anything right in a pair of draws against Atalanta and Sassuolo.
Then again, those issues are essentially the same kind of issues we’ve been talking about for pretty much the entire season. Good times, right?
On this week’s episode of The Old Lady Speaks Podcast, we discussed:
- The current issues that are hampering Juventus’ post-lockdown performance.
- The hot seat that Maurizio Sarri currently finds himself on and just what might need to change for Juventus to actually achieve the desired brand of football with their current manager at the helm.
- How much of the blame of what’s happened this season fall on Sarri and how much of it should fall on the likes of Fabio Paratici and the rest of Juventus’ front office?
- What the hell has happened to Juventus’ defense lately?
- As always to wrap things up, your Twitter questions!

The original Nottingham Delilah was opened in 2005 by Sangita Tryner, Welsh by birth, of Indian extraction, and a refugee from multiple-grocery industry!
“I didn’t always love food the way I do now, and I'm still teased by my husband Rick about my pre-Rick diet of eggs and toast. But my career in the food industry, marketing into the Supermarkets for several large food manufacturers both trained my palate and opened my eyes.
I worked cheek by jowl with some seriously talented development chefs, learned about the finest ingredients from around the world, and a serious foodie was unleashed!
But I rapidly became disillusioned by the compromises of mass production – recipes pared back to hit price points, and techniques driven by the need to work on a production line – and worked out that good food is produced by people, not manufactured in a factory.”
So Delilah was conceived, as a place to be packed with amazing products and exquisite flavours, which people leave having not only tasted foods like never before, but also having had a food ‘experience’ to remember: an anti-supermarket, i.e. the opposite, a place where every space is filled with special products, artisan-made with a real passion. (Even if that means some things are only available some of the time, or in small quantities, or that they change with the seasons: that is the whole point, you taste things that are natural and not forced or homogenised). Artisan producers are a mix of magician and obsessive: a cauldron of passion, a zap of dedication and not forgetting a pinch of inspiration and their creations are magical….
In July 2005, the dream was realised, as Delilah was opened in a small store on Middle Pavement, Nottingham by Sangita and 5 other staff, rapidly establishing itself as a beacon for local foodies. It also rapidly became clear that Nottingham had an appetite for great food, and that the place was way too small! Every nook and cranny was used, indeed crammed, and a patio, then conservatory were opened.
In 2009, Nik Tooley came on board as General Manager of a team now 9 strong, while Sangita briefly stepped back to start a family, but the aim was clearly now to move on up.
Ironically it was the deepest recession in a generation that provided the opportunity, as Nottingham’s property market cooled off, and Delilah came of age, securing its current home at Victoria Street, in a stunning former HSBC bank: a venue nearly 5 times the size.
The space may be bigger, with more people needed to run it, but the ethos is the same, great service, passionate people, great products and ingredients both to buy and to eat in: just a lot more of everything!This story is a part of Christmas Guide 2021, our list of ideas, by topic, by recipient and by price, to help you find the perfect gift.

Rajeev Satav, a senior Congress official and MP, died this morning in a private hospital in Pune, just days after recovering from a coronavirus infection. “It’s a huge loss for us all,” Rahul Gandhi wrote on Twitter, referring to Mr Satav as “my friend” who embodied the Congress’ values.
“On May 9, 2021, Rajeev Satav’s RT-PCR swab was negative. After a long illness, he died on May 16 at 4:58 a.m. from secondary pneumonia and multi-organ failure “The Congress leader was admitted to Jehangir Hospital, according to a statement released by the hospital.
According to Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope, the 46-year-old Congress chief was in critical condition after being diagnosed with a new viral infection.
“Rajiv Satav was on the mend, but his health has worsened again, and he is now in serious condition. He has a Cytomegalovirus infection, according to the doctors “On Saturday, news agency PTI quoted Mr Tope as saying.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to Twitter to say:
Sonia Gandhi expressed her sorrow over the death of the party’s patriarch, describing him as “a valued comrade and a friend to all of us” in a condolence letter. She also said that it is a personal loss for her.
“Despite the fact that Rajeev Satav was just 46 years old, he rose from the bottom to hold several responsibilities in a short period of time due to his unfailing loyalty, honesty, and hard work,” she said.
Mr Gandhi, who was next to Mr Satav, tweeted, “I’m very saddened by the death of my friend Rajeev Satav.”
Mr Satav, a Maharashtra native, was in charge of the Congress’ affairs in Gujarat, where the party had fought hard in the recent assembly elections.
K C Venugopal, general secretary of the All India Congress Committee, said the Congress had lost a frontline fighter, a member of the Congress Working Committee, a member of Parliament, and a talented young leader. “Sh. Rajiv Satav, Congress’ frontline fighter, CWC Member, M.P., most promising young leader, and a good friend, passed away today. The irreversible loss has killed me. His indelible loyalty, connection, and overwhelming success would be sorely missed by the group. Please accept my heartfelt apologies “Mr. Venugopal sent out a tweet.
The defeat has made Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala speechless, he added. “I lost a friend today who took the first step into public life with me in the Youth Congress and marched with me all the way to today… Rajeev Satav will be remembered for his humility, constant smile, connection to the grassroots, commitment, and friendship. My mate, I bid you farewell. “Shine brightly everywhere you are,” he wrote on Twitter.

“My young colleague Rajeev Satav passed away from COVID-19 complications,” said party leader Jairam Ramesh.
He was the president of the Youth Congress and a member of both Houses of Parliament. He spoke with authority and was still well-prepared.
“I have not discussed the matter with the doctor yet,” Thorat said later to the media, “but Varsha Gaikwad is still here. She has discussed with the doctor. Satav was returning to normal. He is experiencing pain again. But he’ll get better soon.” Rajiv Satav had tested positive for COVID-19 on April 22 and was on ventilator support at a private hospital in Pune city after his health deteriorated. Varsha Gaikwad, the Education Minister, has been on leave since yesterday and is holding a close eye on his health. Satav’s body was reacting to therapy, according to Thorat.The Swedish-German duo Hansan released their debut album “Nattflykt” in May 2020.

At you will see men coming out of norae bang (karaoke r ms) and staggering through the streets, laughing, singing and arguing night. Be sure that you steer clear of the puddles of reddish-vomit often left behind, which are also underst d as kimchi plants.
Koreans have actually strict consuming etiquette never pour your very own beverage, and whenever pouring for somebody over the age of you, put one hand to your heart or your pouring arm as being a sign of respect.
Just like the Japanese, the Koreans eat rice with nearly every meal. It is so ingrained inside their culture that certain of the most greetings that are common Bap meogeosseoyo?, or вЂHave you eaten rice?вЂ™

Korea is just a crowded country. ItвЂ™s a cluster of stony mountains with merely a valleys that are few plains on which to create.
The end result will be a lot of people in little areas, and folks will perhaps not think about pushing and jostling in order to get onto a coach, into an elevator, or to those perfect onions at industry.
DonвЂ™t even bother with вЂњexcuse me,вЂќ and beware of the older women, referred to as ajumma. TheyвЂ™re deadly.

Medical assistants serve as key players on a medical team, and employers need more individuals trained specifically for this role.
What should you know about medical assistants? These professionals perform many duties within a medical office or healthcare organization, from administrative tasks to clinical work. Most work with primary care providers, but the field offers opportunity for specialization.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that about 725,000 medical assistants were employed in 2019, with 57% working in physicians' offices. Most medical assistants completed postsecondary certificate programs requiring a few months to a year to graduate.
What Is a Medical Assistant?
Medical assistants do not perform diagnostic duties — that's left to nurses, physician assistants, and physicians. So what is a medical assistant? These individuals support physicians and other medical professionals to ensure high-quality patient care and to help the office run smoothly.
Medical assistants provide patient customer service. They may take patient histories, measure vital signs, and enter information into electronic medical records. They may also assist physicians during patient exams or prepare samples for laboratory testing.
Medical assistants must have good communication skills, critical thinking abilities, and professionalism. Medical assistant training programs or medical assistant associate degree programs help develop these skills. Associate degree programs typically take 1-2 years to complete, but some training programs take far less time, often less than a year.
Medical assistants may also focus on a specific role within a medical office. Administrative medical assistants, for example, may fill out insurance forms and record medical billing codes. They may also schedule appointments and answer telephones. Clinical medical assistants may need additional licensing or certification, but they can take on responsibilities such as preparing patients for X-rays and drawing blood.
What Training Does a Medical Assistant Need?
Training programs for medical assistants include courses in medical terminology, anatomy and physiology, and electronic health records. Many schools also require hands-on learning through internships with local healthcare providers.
Many employers look for medical assistants who hold advanced skills related to electronic health records, medical scribing, and conducting phone screenings and triage. The 2020 Industry Outlook survey conducted by the National Healthcareer Association (NHA) found 35% of employers reported that medical assistants held more responsibility in their practices than the year before.
Most states have no licensing requirements for medical assistants unless they perform specific clinical duties. However, several organizations offer professional certification for medical assistants. This voluntary process involves passing an exam and demonstrating professional experience. These organizations include the American Association of Medical Assistants, American Medical Technologists, and the National Healthcareer Association.
What Is the Career Outlook for Medical Assistants?
The BLS projects 19% growth in employment for medical assistants from 2019-2029 — about 139,200 new positions. This projected growth exceeds projections for healthcare occupations overall in the same period (15%) and is much faster than the average projected growth for all occupations (4%).
Demand for healthcare services continues to grow as people live longer and seek preventative care to improve their quality of life. Medical assistants can take care of routine tasks within the medical office, allowing practitioners and clinical personnel to spend more time with patients.
What Is the Salary Potential for Medical Assistants?
Medical assistant salaries ranged from less than $26,930 to more than $50,580 in May 2020, with a median salary of $35,850. Junior colleges paid medical assistants the most, with an average salary of $48,720, followed by insurance companies which paid an average of $43,910.
Education, experience, professional credentials, and location all impact medical assistants' salaries. According to PayScale, entry-level medical assistants reported an average salary of $31,440 in June 2021, while experienced professionals in this role earned an average of $38,480.
Alaska reported the highest overall average salary for medical assistants ($46,610) in 2020. The highest-paying metropolitan area in 2020 was San Francisco — medical assistants in this area earned an average of $53,960 a year.
Earning a professional credential can increase your salary potential. NHA found 89% of employers encourage or require medical assistant certification, and 63% of employers report they pay certified medical assistants more than their peers without certification. These voluntary professional credentials require passing an exam that demonstrates skills and knowledge and performing ongoing professional development activities.
Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Assisting
States do not require licensing or medical assistant certification. However, many employers do require or encourage medical assistants to seek professional credentials from an accredited organization. Employers also have a tendency to reward workers with professional certification, with 63% reporting increased pay for certified medical assistants, according to NHA.
Career-focused training programs require a few months to a year to complete. An associate degree in medical assisting takes about two years. A two-year degree may also include general education courses, and these credits can often be transferred toward a four-year degree should you decide to continue your education later.
You can find training programs at community colleges, vocational training centers, and nonprofit and for-profit medical training schools. The cost of a program depends on the type of school you choose.
According to The College Board, students attending a two-year college as an in-state student pay an average of $3,770 a year, compared to $10,560 per year at an in-state public four-year college. Private nonprofit colleges charge an average of $37,650 a year..

Or maybe some of it does, but there’s a big voodoo component and it gets used as a crutch for the more fantastical elements (with its own problems with rationality). But the film opens with a shootout in downtown Chicago–Child’s Play uses its Chicago locations very well, never excessive–between cop Chris Sarandon and serial killer Brad Dourif. Serial killer Dourif who has a sidekick and doesn’t use a gun to kill his victims. My suspension of disbelief can go for the possessed doll out to kill those who wronged him, but a serial killer with a sidekick? It’s a more interesting story than a killer doll.
But the film also has some problems deciding what way it wants to go. The script can’t decide if it wants to convince the audience–or try to convince the audience–six year-old Alex Vincent has snapped and is talking to his doll and killing people… or if it’s the doll. The indecision doesn’t last long, but it does come after the rather literal opening where Dourif recites a spell while touching the doll. The trailer never has the money shot (the animated doll), but it certainly goes far towards suggesting it… so maybe theater-goers in 1988 knew what to expect. Given four sequels, even though I’d never seen the film before, it was hard to imagine it could have been anything but the doll.
The killer doll is maybe not the most ludicrous idea for a slasher movie, but Child’s Play isn’t really a slasher movie. The thriller elements play a lot more–down to the out-of-control speeding car going through Chicago–and Holland never lets Dourif (voicing the doll) go over the top, even after the doll’s got its own scenes. The special effects are great on it too.
Acting helps too. Dourif’s serial killer might not make much sense, but his performance is excellent. Sarandon’s solid as the cop (though I question his sweater for the opening shootout… it just doesn’t seem like something a movie cop would wear). Catherine Hicks is okay as Vincent’s disbelieving mother. She’s maybe the film’s weakest performance, especially since Dinah Manoff (as her friend) is so good. Young Vincent might not give the most soulful youth performance ever or anything, but he makes the film. It isn’t so much his dialogue, but how Holland directs him physically. It’s a strong performance.
Holland’s best scene comes at the end–there’s a quiet Halloween homage–and it’s worth the wait. Early in the film, Holland has to do a lot of sight gags to confuse the viewer (well, to create the impression of confusing the viewer), and he repeats them a few times… The film also cheats a lot, like why does Vincent have money to ride the ‘L’ or how does Hicks know where all the homeless hang out (she visits multiple places). The film skips over some of the post-murder stuff, just to create–first, in the viewer’s mind, then in the characters’–some suspicion Vincent is the guilty party. The omissions get obvious after a while.
But Child’s Play works. It’s not exactly scary or disquieting or uncanny… but it’s entertaining and suspenseful.

Muddy Creek Falls and Swallow Falls are the main attractions at Swallow Falls State Park, but I think that Tolliver Falls is just as interesting as its larger relatives. Tolliver Falls is only a few feet tall, and yet its location in the park is very scenic.
I visited the park in late October, and the trees were beginning to change colors. The fallen leaves created a blanket around the falls, which only enhanced the colors of the rock in the falls. It also helped that while the sun made it more difficult to photograph the other falls, the canopy above Tolliver Falls allowed for better photographs..
- Tolliver Falls is on a side trail that’s very easily accessed. You may have to wander around a little to find it, though.
Accessibility: 10/10 (easy)
Height: 6′
Length of Hike: 0.5 miles round-trip

While the bank had long had the asset and lending power of bigger banks, their capabilities were not recognized fully enough by the general public. Stackpole set out to correct that misperception. Our goal was to create brand awareness and drive interest in new markets while reinforcing the bank’s position and heritage in the region. To do this we built upon their already-established reputation and credibility. A new tagline was devised to reflect upon Lowell Five’s greatest strength—the fact that they are “The Relationship Bank.”
SIA-1 Gold, 2 Awards of Merit
Through a series of strategic deliverables, we successfully enhanced Lowell Five’s brand in the marketplace, creating awareness that they deliver the products, services and technology-based conveniences of a large regional and national institution, along with the local knowledge, expertise and extraordinary customer service you’d expect from your local bank.
“Real relationships make every day better.” “Real relationships allow you to be you.” “Real relationships make things easier.” These headlines, crafted to get at the heart of the benefits of banking with Lowell Five, appear in an integrated digital, radio and print ad campaign—all crafted to highlight the bank’s best-in-class mobile banking experience and high-touch customer service.
“Real relationships get things done.” “Real relationships make things happen.” “Real relationships build things that last.” A thoughtfully-conceived campaign aimed at business banking prospects and customers highlighted Lowell Five’s innovative products and their deep investment in the greater Lowell community.
All advertising was tailored to drive Lowell Five prospects and customers to a website landing page highlighting the new and invigorated branding and offering quick and easy access to the bank’s personal and business banking products.
Working with Stackpole, Lowell Five was able to build upon its already proven strengths and notable reputation to empower efforts to reach and influence newer, more diverse audiences seeking greater flexibility, personal attention and innovation in banking relationships.

If you were to read our review of The Ville, then maybe you saw this coming from a mile away. EA has filed a copyright infringement suit against Zynga, claiming that the developer's newest Facebook game "copied and misappropriated the original and distinctive expressive elements" from The Sims Social, Playfish and EA's social game release last year, Joystiq reports.
EA's Maxis label GM Lucy Bradshaw made the announcement earlier today, with this to say: "Infringing a developer's copyright is not an acceptable practice in game development. By calling Zynga out on this illegal practice, we hope to have a secondary effect of protecting the rights of other creative studios who don't have the resources to protect themselves."
The news comes not only as a spate of bad news surrounds Zynga, but as EA releases its own answer to the developer's most successful game, CityVille. Of course, EA and Playfish leveraged Maxis' storied SimCity brand, which could protect it from a likely retort from Zynga. We've reached to Zynga for comment. In the meantime, take a moment to read the release below:
Today, on behalf of Maxis, EA filed a lawsuit against Zynga over their game, The Ville. I thought it would be useful to draft a post to explain the substance and background of this.
Update: Zynga has issued the following response to EA's complaint:. -Reggie Davis, General Counsel, Zynga

Relatively underrated as far as musicals go, “Chess The Musical” isn’t one that make it to Malaysian shores very often - and is now being staged here by the Bentley Music Academy. Written by Tim Rice with music by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus (of ABBA fame), the musical uses a chess tournament to satirise the politics of the Cold War between Russia and America. We speak with the show’s musical director Kevin Field and vocal coach Nicole Thomson about what makes this show so unique, and what we can expect from this particular staging.

The source of his wisdom, and theirs, is the same. The truth in the Bible, even through a great Scripture, comes to us filtered. Moreover, the teaching in the Scriptures is for everybody. It is not particularized to the needs of the individual seeker. For all of these reasons, a guru is necessary.
The most important reason for having a guru, however, is stated in the Bible itself. It says there, “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God.” (John 1:12) The guru gives his disciple not only teaching and guidance: He also transmits to him spiritual power.
Unfortunately it’s all too common for disciples to act as if the guru were some sort of heavenly slave, always doing them little favors. You find this sort of person saying, “Oh, Yogananda did this for me, or, Yogananda did that for me.” They don’t understand what Yogananda is. They reduce him to the level of a human personality, when he is so much more.
A true disciple should not be thinking of himself and the guru as human beings who reside in time and space. We should think of ourselves in a more impersonal way. We should try always to develop those inner spiritual qualities to such an impersonal degree that our love for the guru is no longer the love of a human being for another human being. It’s the love of the Infinite for the Infinite. We are not just humble little devotees stumbling along making mistakes. We are that Infinite Light. We are that Infinite Wisdom. We are that Divine Soul.
Yogananda’s mission was to show us that we are that. Until we achieve that realization, we will not have fulfilled to perfection this most wonderful of all relationships — the relationship of the guru and the disciple.Pushes boundaries of business apps for iPad and Android tablets
PRINCETON, NJ – Oct. 31, 2013 – Every day employees across organizations must solve difficult problems and make tough decisions that impact the bottom line. Kepner-Tregoe (KT), the global capability development and consulting company, announced the launch of the new Kepner-Tregoe Tablet App, created to help employees manage these business challenges whether they are on a shop floor, in the field, at a remote office or even at home.
Designed for iPad and Android tablets, the Kepner-Tregoe Tablet App’s robust capabilities enable users to gather, analyze, sort and share critical business data from wherever they are. The app integrates KT’s time-tested Clear Thinking process to guide users step by step in evaluating situations, troubleshooting problems and identifying opportunities.
“We asked our clients and classroom learners how we could better support them in systematically applying KT process to everyday situations they face on the job,” explained KT’s Chief Executive Officer Chris Geraghty. “The result is a tablet app that functions more like sophisticated business software that you’d find on a desktop computer—but gives users the mobility and flexibility they need on the go.”
The Kepner-Tregoe Tablet App includes five core modules of KT Clear Thinking process: Situation Appraisal, Problem Analysis, Decision Analysis, Potential Problem Analysis and Potential Opportunity Analysis. Within each module, users can gather, edit and sort information and even insert camera roll pictures into key areas. Once a module is completed, users can then generate and send PDF summary reports via email. Users can also perform live troubleshooting or decision-making facilitations by displaying work through an external projector, all from a tablet device.
The Kepner-Tregoe Tablet App is available for download on iTunes and Google Play. It is free for learners that attend any KT workshop starting October 31, 2013 and those that have attended KT’s award-winning upgrade to Problem Solving and Decision Making during 2013. A video and more information can be found at the Kepner-Tregoe Tablet App webpage..Director, Care Center

How cool is that! More cities are being added daily.
(3) We are preparing a media kit that will probably go out today to help walk leaders publicize their walks, so keep an eye out for that in your email if you’re a Walk Leader.
(4) I just recorded six videos with camera tips, composition tips, gear tips, and a whole bunch more to help you get the most of your upcoming Photo Walk. You’ll get a link to those in a “Walk wide” email newsletter we’ll be sending out each week leading up to the Walk, so keep an eye out for it (the sender will be KelbyOne, that’s our online educational community).
(5) Have your ordered your “Official Photo Walk T-shirt?” Lot of folks wear these on the walks themselves, and so we see them everywhere. Why do so many people buy the t-shirts? Well, beside looking really cool, and being a souvenir from a really fun and memorable day, 100% of the profits go to the Springs of Hope Orphanage in Kenya (and who doesn’t want to help Orphans, right?). Here’s a link to order yours today.
(6) Is there a walk in a city near you? There’s only one way to find out. Go to the official site; click the “Find a Walk” button and search for your city. If there’s not one there, maybe you could lead one? You get a cool prize, and loves of love and affection for leading a way. Click the “Apply to Lead a Walk” button at the same link.
(7) There really isn’t a #7, but just having 6 sounded kinda cheesy. Hope you all have an awesome Tuesday. Don’t forget to spread the word about the walk to your friends, photo groups, online groups, group groups, Groupon, Groovy groups, Gravy groups, etc.
Best,

Kerber literary did nothing to beat the error machine (Keys). Vika will kick her butt hard in 2 sets. Period.
Off topic: WTAaddict you should post up a new article about Madison Keys. I think you can write something about her to amuse us. She is totally useless.
She didn’t need to hit a lot of winners, she was never going to. Would have been the same if Azarenka played Keys.
Kerber can beat Azarenka, it’s an even match-up. We will see
Not doing that kind of thing right now…
Kerber has no chance. You shouldn’t predict her the match based on her performance in Keys’ match. Basically, the results were useless because Keys Handed the match over easily.
Vika will win in 2. No needs to wait and see.
My prediction has nothing to do with the Keys match or any of the results in the last 2 weeks because they are irrelevant.
It’s based on this being an even match-up, and Kerber having the slight mental and physical edge on this occasion
Also I believe you said the same thing before they played in Melbourne, look what happened there….
Also I would like to hear your reasons for Azarenka winning since you are so confident instead of just bagging my choice, thanks 🙂
I can’t see an even match-up, because Azarenka won 4 times in 2 sets against Kerber and Azarenka really was better in all of their matches and Kerber only did well to hang in and didn’t even play poorly (except of Doha 2015).
Azarenka won 2 times in 3 sets and this matches were really close! Kerber was sooo good on this days but Azarenka too…
Kerber won their last match in 2 sets but I think this was her best ever performance against Azarenka.
So: When 4 of 7 meetings are clearly won by one player and this player only lost 1 meeting, it’s even? No…
Kerber knows that she has to play much more agressive against Azarenka. Kerber was very passive in her last matches; the fighting spirit is there but I doubt her level.
They are evenly matched. Please explain to me how Azarenka is so obviously far more superior? No one has done that yet???
Obviously Azarenka is favourite but Kerber is more than capable of winning
Yup, Kerber fought, but wasn’t in her Melbourne form… had to expect that (I said it)
Tried to be more agressive than in her last matches but wasn’t used to it because of her passive play in the last matches.
I wanted to say that Azarenka has the clear edge in this match-up. Now it’s 7-1…
Not all of their matches was close and when you see such a H2H, it’s NOT even at all.
Sad (to say as german) but true.
Kerber was not 100% fit which was quite obvious and meant it was always going to be hard. I don’t think she really believed she could win because of that
Credit to Angie to play and I feel sorry for her. But if you play you confirm that you are ready to play.
Maybe tell something you haven’t said yet? I don’t think that this was the only reason for Azarenka’s win.
No it wasn’t Azarenka played well but Kerber couldn’t play her best.
You lost me when you said mental edge goes to kerber. That’s a joke. She must be one of the weakest mentally in the wta.
Well I didn’t mean in general, I meant heading into this match. Kerber beat Azarenka in their last match, it was a tough loss for Azarenka because according to her she should have won. She will be desperate to win this, perhaps too desperate and also she has played a lot in the last few weeks, might all catch up with her, we will see
Vika was out for revenge and won in 2.
Actually owing to the AO loss , she plays much better tennis than she was in Brisbane mentally.
Kerber wasn’t fit, In hindsight that’s the only reason I would change my prediction.
WTAaddict, I was right again. Period.
haha congrats, I’m not here to side with favourites just because they are favourites. You gave me no reasons as to why Azarenka would win, so you have no right to say anything. I would happily pick Kerber to win again. Bye.
I don’t think you are unbiased as you think. Vika is on a roll here. She wanted revenge she would have died for anything on court this time to get a win. Any other times, their match plays are quite even and unpredictable.
I am biased. I like certain player more than others such as Kerber more than Azarenka. but that obviously doesn’t have an impact on my predictions. I like Putintseva more than Serena Williams doesn’t mean I predicted her to beat Serena when they played. Kerber wasn’t fully fit tonight, she couldn’t play anywhere near her best, Azarenka did nothing special.
Be like that biased and blind! Failing all your predictions….lolllzzzz and behaving like unbiased is so…..
Vika is far superior in offense and have great skills at the net! Kerber hanfs in their only because of her incredible defense. Vika lost the AO match as she was mentally fragile. So there u go:) Anyways u wont change ur views as ur nothing but a pressed hater…lolllzzz
No Kerber beat Azarenka in Melbourne because she was too good, she hit more winners.
Kerber was not 100% which is the only reason I would take back my prediction in hindsight.
Also I’m not sure what you are trying to gain…Now open in Parkland Village is Dragonfly Park, Bridgeland’s newest amenity. Spanning 25-acres, pool with a deep-water element.

Many of my clients are City professionals specialising in Technology, Finance or Project Management. Typically they work for large Investment Banks on a short-term contract basis, due to the nature of their work, and the flexibility this provides senior management. In most cases they will have established their own limited company to operate from, invoicing their employer a daily rate in exchange for their services.
The investment banking sector is extremely segmented, and individuals who possess the right combination of skills and expertise at the right time can command high daily rates. In addition to the earnings potential, the limited company arrangement means that remuneration can come in the form of a dividend, rather than a salary. This can lead to a tax benefits and greater take-home pay.
Be sure to check with your accountant that you don’t fall foul of IR35 and are providing a ‘contract for services’.
We understand your situation
Life is complicated. Working in the highly competitive City environment can be stressful for anyone but Contractors have the additional worries of where their next contract will come from; the ‘opportunity cost’ of taking a well-deserved holiday; the absence of a stable earnings over the long-term; and missing out on the perks their ‘salaried’ colleagues benefit from, such as pension contributions, sick pay, life assurance, and private healthcare etc.
It is not uncommon for clients invoice between £500 and £1,000 per day. They are typically at a stage in their life where expenses are high: mortgage repayments; school fees; holidays; maintaining the home etc. However, even in a particularly ‘expensive’ year they will almost certainly earn more than they spend, which results in cash surpluses building up in the company bank account at a steady rate.
“What should I do with this money?” is a question I get asked every day, and the cause of many sleepless nights. The answer, rather predictably is “it depends”.

Venus Williams, Karolina Pliskova and Roberta Vinci secured semi-final births on day 3, the final semi-finalist will be confirmed on the final day of group stage action on Friday. Elina Svitolina and Carla Suarez Navarro will battle for the final position, the winner will progress to the final 4. Roberta Vinci advanced to the semi-finals courtesy of Caroline Wozniacki retiring against Kuznetsova and withdrawing from the event, essentially eliminating the Russian from the event.
Group B: (2) Carla Suarez Navarro vs (8) Elina Svitolina
Friday’s most intriguing match sees Carla Suarez Navarro and Elina Svitolina go head-to-head for a spot in the semi-finals. Carla and Elina both pick up victories over Andrea Petkovic, the winner of this match will finish on top of Group B and progress to the semi-final stage.
Carla Suarez Navarro routed a wounded Andrea Petkovic 6-0 6-0 in her opening group stage match in Zhuhai. Petkovic was not competitive, offering little to no resistance. Nevertheless, Carla was seemingly playing at a pretty reasonable level.
Elina Svitolina started the week with a 7-6 6-3 victory over Andrea Petkovic. The German was certainly much more competitive in this match, offering much more resistance. Svitolina’s form during the Asian Swing was poor but she seems to be in a better place this week and will be keen to make an impact in Zhuhai, this is a good opportunity for Elina.
The head-to-head record between Carla and Elina is split at 1 win apiece, Elina won their most recent clash 4-6 6-4 6-4 in Cincinnati last year. This should be a good match with both ladies desperate to win, I like Elina’s chances here. Carla and Elina are both great grinders from the baseline, but Elina is more solid and has a greater ability to attack.
Prediction: Elina Svitolina to defeat Carla Suarez Navarro in 2 sets
Group D: (4) Roberta Vinci vs Anna Schmiedlova
Roberta Vinci and Anna Schmiedlova will go head-to-head for the first time on Friday. Courtesy of Caroline Wozniacki’s withdrawal from the event, Anna Schmiedlova has taken her spot as an alternate.
Roberta Vinci started her Zhuhai campaign in style with a commanding 6-4 6-4 victory over Svetlana Kuznetsova. Vinci was on top from start to finish, the Italian’s serve was never broken.
Schmiedlova is certainly a dangerous opponent and is more than capable of competing with the U.S Open finalist, Schmiedlova has nothing to lose and I think she will cause an upset here.
Prediction: Anna Schmiedlova to defeat Roberta Vinci in 3 sets
Group A: (7) Madison Keys vs (12) (WC) Saisai Zheng
The Final match of the day is a dead rubber. Madison and Saisai both lost their opening group stage matches to Venus Williams meaning the American will finish on top of the group and advance to the semi-finals.
Madison and Saisai both showed promising signs in their opening group matches despite being defeated. Keys came particularly close to victory, outplaying Venus for the majority of the first 2 sets but ultimately succumbing 6-3 6-7 1-6. Keys will be hoping to end the best season of he career on a high with a victory over Zheng.
Saisai Zheng pushed Venus Williams much more than expected. Saisai made a terrific start to the match and hung on the claim the first set. However Venus would eventually raise her level to steamroll past the local hopeful 4-6 6-1 6-1.
This will be the first career meeting between the pair and it should end in a victory for the American, unless she has a really bad day.Description

In a game that reveres tradition, the Dunes Club brought immediate credibility to Myrtle Beach, ultimately spurring the area’s emergence as golf’s premier destination. The layout, regarded as one of RTJ’s finest, has been superb since the moment it opened.
Playing along ocean dunes that provide uncommon, natural elevation changes, the front nine is is an inland test. The fairways are wide, as they are throughout the course, giving players a chance to swing away, but the Myrtle Beach golf course rewards precision, particularly on the flawless greens complexes.
The opening side is capped by the par 3, 140-yard (from white tees) ninth hole, which features a green flanked by bunkers and a distant view of the Atlantic Ocean, setting the stage for the course’s most dramatic stretch.
View the 380-yard Par 4 11the hole:
The Dunes Golf & Beach Club goes from very, very good to great on the back nine, highlighted by Alligator Alley – holes 11 through 13. That famed stretch plays along Lake Singleton and the swash from the nearby Atlantic Ocean, highlighted by the par 5 13th, otherwise known as Waterloo.
Myrtle Beach’s most iconic hole, Waterloo is a dogleg right that makes a 90-degree turn around Lake Singleton. As challenging as the water (and the alligators often sunning themselves) may seem, the hole doesn’t begin until players get to the multi-tiered green. Individually the 11th, 12th, 13th, 16th or 18th could be a “signature hole,” but at the Dunes Club they form the heart of one of America’s best courses.
The layout’s impact on the area goes beyond rounds played.
The Dunes Club has hosted the 1962 U.S. Women’s Open, the finals of PGA Tour’s Q-School in 1973 (Ben Crenshaw and Gary McCord earned their cards here), six Senior Tour Championships, and the 2016 PGA Professional National Championship. In 2017 the course will host the USGA Women’s 4-Ball Competition.
When Myrtle Beach was a sleepy beach community, the Dunes Club made the area matter in the eyes of the wider golf world. So before (or after) you enjoy a superior round of golf, take a walk through the clubhouse and soak up a little bit of the course’s rich history.
The Dunes Club – which offers a top 100 experience from golf course to the grill room – has more than earned its place among America’s best golf courses.Cumberland Mining provides solutions for the Bitcoin market.

Quick Take
Cumberland, tech giant DRW’s crypto unit, looks very different from the outside following leadership and API changes, sources say
A number of its gray beard execs have departed the firm and it is taking a fresh approach to engaging with the nascent crypto market
by Frank Chaparro
21 mins ago · 2 min read
DRW’s Cumberland might be unrecognizable to some of its counter-parties as it takes a more modern approach to trading, and as its old-guard execs depart the company. The firm, which is led by trading giant Don Wilson, was one of the first well-known high-frequency trading shops to dive into the over-the-counter trading market for crypto. In 2014, it launched Cumberland Mining, which later rebranded to Cumberland. Recently three members of its senior management have either left the firm or announced their upcoming departure, including its vanguard Bobby Cho, who built out the desk in its earliest days. A source said Cho, who said Wednesday he was stepping down at the end of May, plans to move to the East Coast and has no immediate plans to take on a new role. Prior to this, David Gross, a gray-haired veteran of the Wall Street world, stepped down as global head of relationship management. Gross joined the team in 2018 after spending close to 15 years in convertible bond sales and trading at Credit Suisse and Lehman Brothers. Cumberland also parted ways with James Radecki, its former global head of business development. Radecki, who joined Cumberland last year having been a longtime employee of investment bank Goldman Sachs, was responsible for maintaining and building relationships with Cumberland’s counter-parties. A source told The Block that Gross and Radecki disagreed on the direction of the company. With Gross, Radecki, and Cho out, that leaves a much younger staff helming the ship. “The company has changed, lots of young faces now,” one source said, describing recent leadership changes. To be sure, Jason Leung, a veteran of the FX world, remains at Cumberland as its global head. Justin Chow, according to a memo, has been promoted to oversee business development and relationship management. The former macro trader at DRW and Citadel, joined Cumberland’s crypto desk in 2017
The firm, which trades dozens of cryptocurrencies via its over-the-counter desk, also looks different with respect to the way it engages with the market. Recently, it launched its new electronic OTC platform, Marea, which allows its counterparties to trade with Cumberland via a new graphical user interface. It’s a move that follows its Chicago cross-town rival Jump Trading and other market makers in crypto that have modernized their marketplaces. “One of the glaring things to us is that our counter parties wanted to trade in different ways with us,” Cho told The Block at the time of Marea’s launch. “So we had this historical business starting in 2014 of counterparties wanting to trade OTC with us in chat. That evolved to ‘hey, we actually want to trade with you electronically.’ And that spun out and we started providing an API and now what we are announcing today, Marea.”
The crypto OTC market is known for operating much like FX markets in the 1990s — with much of the trading conducted over the phone or via messaging apps such as Skype. A spokeswoman for DRW declined to comment.

Data Engineer Jobs
You can learn the profession of Data Science from scratch…
Agree that any of us would like to add a little more innovation to our profession, a little more relevance in the future and relevance in the labor market?
And, of course, a salary of $ 10,000 and the prospect of working abroad would be a good addition to the so-called “dream profession”. Big Data Jobs is a good example.
Who is Data Engineer
Data Scientist collects and analyzes data. This profession has become especially relevant in light of the rapid development of services using machine learning technologies and artificial intelligence systems based on neural networks. Analytics experts have the technical skills to tackle complex problems and can transform raw data into actionable information for the business. It is not surprising that the demand for such specialists is growing every year.
A specialist in this field can build a model that will change the entire business. So, a few years ago, Jonathan Goldman, a physicist from Stanford, got a job on the social network LinkedIn and created a model that told the account owner which other users of the site might be his acquaintances. The social network put his model into practice and received additional millions of views and accelerated growth.
How to become a Data Scientist
Many go to this area with a university degree. However, despite the fact that it really gives fundamental knowledge, it is often divorced from practice. This is especially true for the link between IT and business. The best option is to learn Data Science from those already in the field and learn from their experience. Follow trends and participate in real projects, and not just study theory and mathematics textbooks - see the complete list in the Big Data Analyst Jobs overview. All this can be obtained in a special course on Data Science.
As part of the course, you will be taught the basics of Python programming and data analysis, mathematics and statistics for Data Science, Data Engineering and other disciplines. But the main thing is that you will be able to work out the necessary skills that a good specialist in this field needs - to understand how data science works and how it changes business for the better (soft skills). And professional teachers and special machine learning simulators will help with this. In the future, you will be able to work in any industry you like - from retail and travel to medicine and even e-sports. Everybody needs data experts now.
Data Analyst Jobs
You can learn the profession of Data Science from scratch - the main thing is to have a desire to learn and develop. According to the "Big data engineer jobs" post, the direction is really very promising: it is not for nothing that it takes 1st place in the ranking of the most demanded professions in 2021.
The duration of the course "Profession of Data Science" is 24 months. After training 6 hours a week, you will have the knowledge and skills of a Middle-level specialist and expect the average salary in the industry.Glow in the dark acrylic stretching taper. Quebecoise
Why do everyone says that stretching with a stretching taper hurts less? I'm passing from 6 to 8mm right now and it FREAKING HURTS, like my ear is kinda red/purple and there's still 2cm left to enter in my ear... it's the first time I use a stretching taper. I had a lot of spirals before because i found them easier to insert...
Whatever, i must say that yes, these stretching tapers are nice... (:
This blue is cute and, in the dark, they're glowing well.. and even more when you put them on the edge of a window for a day or two before putting them in.. (:
Enjoy!
By Mart44 from -

However, few randomized controlled trials have examined this relationship, and this process is not completely understood.
Objective: This study examined changes in biochemical factors associated with acne among adults with moderate to severe acne after following a low GI and GL diet or usual eating plan for 2 weeks.
Design: This study utilized a parallel randomized controlled design to compare the effect of a low GI and GL diet to usual diet on biochemical factors associated with acne (glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor [IGF]-1, and insulin-like growth factor binding protein [IGFBP]-3) and insulin resistance after 2 weeks.
Participants: Sixty-six participants were randomly allocated to the low GI and GL diet (n=34) or usual eating plan (n=32) and included in the analyses.
Main outcome measures: The primary outcomes were biochemical factors of acne and insulin resistance with dietary intake as a secondary outcome.
Statistical analyses: Independent sample t tests assessed changes in biochemical factors associated with acne, dietary intake, and body composition pre- and postintervention, comparing the two dietary interventions.
Results: IGF-1 concentrations decreased significantly among participants randomized to a low GI and GL diet between pre- and postintervention time points (preintervention=267.3±85.6 mg/mL, postintervention=244.5±78.7 ng/mL) (P=0.049). There were no differences in changes in glucose, insulin, or IGFBP-3 concentrations or insulin resistance between treatment groups after 2 weeks. Carbohydrate (P=0.019), available carbohydrate (P<0.001), percent energy from carbohydrate (P<0.001), GI (P<0.001), and GL (P<0.001) decreased significantly among participants following a low GI/GL diet between the pre- and postintervention time points. There were no differences in changes in body composition comparing groups.
Conclusions: In this study, a low GI and GL diet decreased IGF-1 concentrations, a well-established factor in acne pathogenesis. Further research of a longer duration should examine whether a low GI and GL diet would result in a clinically meaningful difference in IGF-1 concentrations leading to a reduction in acne. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02913001.

The Hook: Sheldon!
Yep. The moment I recognized Jim Parsons’ voice I knew I was watching this movie. It’s that moment, in the car, when Oh is dancing and his hands go up in the air. You could not not know it’s Sheldon. Of course I IMDb’d it to be sure.
Plot: The story is about Oh. He’s an ‘individual’ amongst the many in his alien species. He’s a dare-to-be-different kind of guy in a no-lets-not-be kind of world. He’s the guy everyone pretends to be busy around so they don’t have to talk to. Oh’s species is looking for a new home to escape another alien species who is looking to destroy them. They set their sights on Earth. This alien take over isn’t your typical alien take over though. They scoop up all the humans and actually put them in one section of Earth while they inhabit everything else. During the take over, a human girl, Tip, is separated from her mom and is determined to reunite with her. Oh, meanwhile, makes a huge mistake and sends an invitation to his party with directions to his home to the whole universe, including the aliens who are hunting his species. He runs from the police and ends up bumping into Tip. After a rocky introduction–since, you know, his species took over her planet, they end up working together to get Tip to her mom.
“What is the purpose of your face?” <– Best line ever!
It’s such a cute story! I love it. It’s your typical “I teach you, you teach me, we learn together” plot line, which are found in most children movies, but it’s packed with humor which doesn’t make it unbearable for adults. It also has a moral. I love movies that teach an subtle lesson. Key word: Subtle. And may be this lesson was pretty obvious, but since it’s done in a funny way, I didn’t feel like it was preaching.
Jim Parsons is Oh. He did such a good job for his first voice-acting. Oh is so relatable as a character. Who hasn’t felt, even for a little bit, that they were weird because they weren’t like everyone else? I know I have. And he’s just trying to be friendly. He has a good heart and means well. I get why some of his peers thinks he’s over-the-top, because he kinda is, but, again, good heart. Rhianna also does well as Tip, or Gratuity. How cool is that name?! Gratuity. I love it. The movie focuses on these two characters, a lot, so you don’t see much of the supporting cast, but Steve Martin does great job as Captain Smek, who’s the over-the-top Captain of Oh’s people. And Matt Jones voice-acts for Kyle who is tasked with the mission of tracking down Oh and getting his password to his account since Oh chose to make it unique *gasps!*.
Graphics and camera angles were awesome. I’d deem this movie “visually stunning.” I love the colors they used for this world and I loved how the meshed Oh’s world and Tip’s world (Earth) into one world.
Overall, I’d add this movie to my collection and since it’s visually stunning, I’d get the Blu Ray version. It’s worth the investment. It’s funny and enjoyable. It teaches a lesson. I would watch it more than once, definitely. And on that note, I’d recommend this movie to everyone. It’s a good family movie. The kind you can watch with your parents 😉 .

What do you think?Abstract
The interpretation of high-resolution seismic profiles acquired close the eastern coast of the Bay of Naples offshore Somma–Vesuvius volcano, and calibrated by borehole data, allowed us to recognize a reflection-free seismic facies consisting of a volcaniclastic debris avalanche overlain by pyroclastic density current deposits. Both are associated with the 3.5 ka ‘Avellino eruption’ and are in turn overlain by a marine succession. The top of the volcaniclastic unit corresponds to a deep erosional surface covered by a coarse-grained bioclastic layer with rounded pumice. We argue that these features are related to a tsunami that was triggered by the sudden entrance into the sea of the gigantic (>1 km3) volcaniclastic unit. The onshore–offshore correlation and mapping of this volcaniclastic unit have allowed us to evaluate its distribution west of Somma–Vesuvius. The pyroclastic density current deposits terminate seaward at 40 m water depth; at the same depth the debris avalanche is affected by a gravitational instability. Over the last 3.5 ka the slump has been in constant movement, as documented by the angular unconformities at the top of the chaotic seismic unit and within the overlying marine deposits.

Challenge
ArchPoint Products was challenged to create an engaging pet toy brand from inception to execution in a saturated and competitive pet market.
Solution
Woof & Whiskers Pet Toys was created using every element of ArchPoint Products’ capabilities in creative design, global sourcing and marketing execution.
The Woof & Whisker’s program is creatively executed by ArchPoint Products’ Creative and Sourcing teams designing the toys from the inside out through an extensive product development and prototyping process that ensures the best possible product for the brand. Woof & Whiskers’ products are sourced from five different countries to ensure top quality and expertise from partnered manufacturers.

Website Accessibility for People with Disabilities
Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires that all website content be accessible to people with disabilities. This applies to Web applications, Web pages and attached files.
The frequency of Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Title III lawsuits filed in federal court has increased, including website accessibility litigation. Health centers must practice due diligence in their compliance efforts. There are preventive measures and risk mitigation strategies a health center may adopt as part of its larger corporate compliance obligations to ensure website accessibility for people with disabilities.
Health centers are considered places of “public accommodation” for purposes of the ADA and are prohibited from discriminating against individuals on the basis of disability. This means that all individuals must have equal access to services provided by the health center, including public websites.

First of all, clean the surface of weeds and try to bring it to the same level, and then pour the foundation. For extra comfort, make a roof. A retractable canopy can become compact when you want to enjoy the sun’s rays, and the floor can be made of tiles.
In order to enjoy the fresh air, it would be best to arrange your own terrace. You can do this yourself by following the steps below:
Identifying the space and preparing it
When you are thinking of arranging a terrace, you must carefully choose the place where you will place it, in order to enjoy maximum comfort. It would be best to choose a shady place, so as not to be disturbed by the sun’s rays.
The size of the space depends of course on the place you have available, but also on the available budget. Because arranging a large terrace requires more materials, and this involves a higher cost.
Mark the place by adding 20cm on each side, this representing the workspace. Then clean the soil, removing weeds, garbage, stones and grass. Then level the place so that the entire surface reaches the same height.
Pour the foundation
It is advisable to determine the type of foundation, taking into account the soil you have in the yard. The soft and clayey soil is left in time, so the terrace will not be straight, after a certain period.
Make a wooden formwork, in which you will later pour the concrete. It provides stability and prevents weeds from growing among the rocks. After you have concreted the surface, wait for it to harden, and then remove the wooden edge. If you want a terrace made of another material, place the brick directly on the ground and then put mortar.
Don’t forget the roof!
The roof of a terrace must be built so as to protect you from sunlight, wind and rain. It is best to make holes in the canopy to allow air to circulate. If you have a larger budget, you can opt for a retractable canopy, because it can be tightened when you want to enjoy the sun’s rays.
You can use several materials to make the roof. Specialists recommend using bamboo or cane, because it ensures good air circulation and, in addition, makes you feel like you are on a terrace by the sea.
The wood is resistant over time and retains its appearance, regardless of environmental factors. When you make the canopy, do not opt for the flat version, because the water will be collected on the roof, when it rains heavily. To avoid this, tilt it at least 5 degrees and install gutters to allow water to drain and drain.
Pillars are essential
The columns have the role of supporting the roof. But you must also pay attention to their appearance, because they influence the exterior design of the house. Pillars can be made of wood, glass, aluminum or stone.
The first option is a suitable choice for spaces arranged in a rustic style. You can use ash, cherry, pine or oak. Glass columns are more resistant to environmental and weather factors and even if they have a higher purchase price, they are an optimal option, because they are easier to maintain.
If you do not have a generous budget, you can opt for aluminum columns. They change their appearance over time and are not as durable as the other proposed variants.
You can arrange the floor
The floor can be covered with any material you want. It is chosen taking into account the way you arrange the terrace. Exterior tiles are an option for those on a budget. It is easy to install and at the same time does not change its appearance due to bad weather, so it is an optimal choice for spaces without a canopy. The surface can be easily cleaned and maintained.
For those who love greenery, we recommend the lawn. The roller shutters can be easily mounted, so you do not need specialized help. The floor surface will be soft, so you will be able to walk barefoot. Being comfortable, it is a suitable option for the spaces where you want to arrange a playground for children, because the little ones will feel comfortable.
The floor helps you get a modern design, but it must be properly cared for to maintain its appearance. In order for it to last better over time, you can choose a variant made of fir wood, which has been previously treated with oils and paints to increase resistance.
Another option is solid wood flooring in combination with plastic. Due to the second material, the floor will last longer and will not degrade due to bad weather.
If you intend to make wrought iron furniture, you can build the bottom of the terrace from gravel in combination with sand. This option is cheap and easy to make, and when you want a change, you can replace it without much trouble.
Pay attention to furniture and decorative elements
The furniture you will place on the terrace is chosen taking into account the style in which you want to arrange the space. For a rustic design, you can choose armchairs and benches made of solid wood or wicker, but it is not excluded to make the elements yourself, using pallets.
The modern style is characterized by objects with well-defined lines, which have light colors. They do not have prints, but are simple. In order to finalize the appearance of the terrace, you also need some specific decorative objects.
So, focus on pots, flower holders, colored pillows, but also products that can increase comfort. Among them is the best umbrella for the terrace , which you can use in the area where the roof does not protect you from the sun. In order to be able to move it easily, it should also have a support, and in order not to be taken by the wind, a base is absolutely necessary that helps you maintain stability..

The Cittaslow movement was conceived in 1999 by a group of Town Mayors in Italy. Following a collaboration between Alexandrina Council and community members to establish the Cittaslow credentials of Goolwa and districts, in 2007 'Goolwa Alexandrina' was accredited by the International Cittaslow Committee as the first member town in Australia. The not-for-profit community association Cittaslow Goolwa Incorporated was formed the same year, with the mission to support Goolwa, Alexandrina's status as a proud Cittaslow town.
Cittaslow promotes values in keeping with the philosophy of the Slow Movement, acknowledging that 'good things take time'.
As a Cittaslow town, Goolwa is committed to supporting planning policies and decisions that promote good quality of life and a sense of pride in the community. This means prioritizing cycling and pedestrian friendly spaces, preserving local traditions and heritage, respecting and protecting the environment, supporting local business, ensuring progress is sustainable and defending the rights of the whole community to experience health and wellbeing.

Many thanks –
Ben MyersIn a nutshell, it’s none of your business!
Sorry, my title is somewhat misleading – you’re not going to get a detailed account of why I’m making this decision about the upcoming birth of our little girl, but that is exactly what I want to touch on in this blog post.
I really don’t understand why society puts so much pressure on moms and moms-to-be to do things in certain ways. At the moment, natural and drug-free birthing is all the rage (yes, there are trends in birthing too) and I feel like I have to justify my decision not to do that when people ask me how I plan to give birth. Please, I mean no disrespect to anyone hoping for this kind of birth – I wanted a natural birth the first time around that ended in a c-section – but my point is: have the birth that you want, it’s none of my business!
Let’s quickly take a look at what society dictates for us moms-to-be and new moms… We must put our bodies through hell (whichever way you do it, it’s not easy) and then quickly “get our bodies back” and post on Instagram a gorgeous bikini pic on the beach, holding our few month old babies with some motivating caption about “bouncing back from pregnancy”. We must breastfeed until the baby is at least 1 years old (but not too far past that and try and keep it out of the public eye because that also becomes undesirable for others to see), but also not keep ourselves away from the real world out there and be back at work as quickly as possible to juggle the multi-tasking, pumping, sleepless life of a working new mom. Be sure not to let the nanny raise your child though!
Because that is what people want to see.
Guys, this is nonsense. The pressure is unnecessary.
Stop justifying your decisions about your own body and your own children. Nobody else is going to live your life for you, so you’re the one in charge here! As a mom, you will always do what is best for your entire family and you of all people need to trust your own gut and your own decisions.
Fed is best. A safe birth is best. Your decisions are what’s best and there is no need to justify any of it.
Full stop. End scene. Adios.Hirosi Ooguri, the Fred Kavli Professor of Theoretical Physics and Mathematics and founding director of the Walter Burke Institute for Theoretical Physics, will be the 2016 recipient of the Chunichi Cultural Award. Founded in 1947 by Japanese newspaper Chunichi Shimbun to commemorate the enacting of the Japanese constitution, the award celebrates individuals or organizations who have made significant contributions to the arts, humanities, and natural or social sciences. Other awardees this year include physicist and 2015 Nobel Laureate Takaaki Kajita, poet Toru Kitagawa, and biologist Ikue Mori, each of whom will receive the 2 million yen ($20,000) prize. Previous recipients include six other Nobel laureates and one Fields medalist.
The prize honors Ooguri for the "development of innovative methods of modern mathematics in high energy theory," according to the prize citation. His research focuses on creating new theoretical tools in quantum field theory and superstring theory, which may ultimately lead to a unified theory of the forces and matter in nature. He is particularly renowned for his work on topological string theory, which has had broad applications ranging from black hole physics to algebraic geometry and knot theory in mathematics.
This April, Ooguri was elected as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is also the recipient of the Leonard Eisenbud Prize for Mathematics and Physics from the American Mathematical Society, the Nishina Memorial Prize, the Humboldt Research Award, the Simons Investigator Award, and is a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. He also received Japan's Kodansha Prize for Science Books for his popular Introduction to Superstring Theory in 2014.
Ooguri will receive the Chunichi Award at a ceremony to be held in Japan on June 3.
Nissan Hits All-Time Production, Sales Record in August
On September 29th, Nissan announced its production, sales, and export figures for the month of August 2015, and they are looking good. Like, breaking-the-record-for-all-time-sales-in-the-month-of-August good.
Nissan’s global sales only increased a tiny amount to 0.6% year over year at 406,138 units, but that was still enough to break the record. This is almost entirely due to increased sales in Mexico and Europe, which rose by 10.1% and 9.2% year-over-year, respectively. Both regions experienced all-time record numbers of units sold.
Sales Driver: Check out the redesigned 2016 Nissan Maxima
Meanwhile, though, Nissan experienced slightly decreased sales in the US (down 0.8%), China (down 5.5%), Japan (down 7.6%), and other regions (down 6.5%).
Production also increased year-over-year to deal with this demand, with increases of 0.8% in the US due to demand for the Maxima and Murano, increases of 5.2% in Mexico due to demand for the Sentra, increases of 244.4% the UK due to a change in the length of summer vacation, and increases of 13.1% in other regions due to an increase in demand for the Rogue (or X-Trail, as it is known in Japan).
Production dropped in Japan by 15.1%, in Spain by 28.6%, and in China by 0.1%. Knowing that, it is hardly surprising that Japanese exports dropped by 10.5% year-over-year.
Overall, this report shows a relatively stable output, although where the vehicles are sold and where they are produced seems to be shifting very slightly toward Mexico and Europe.

They are a pleasure to watch and I was very excited to be able to catch their performance at the Wexner Center Mershon Auditorium in Columbus last night.
Kevin Costner & Modern West are in the middle of their “Tales From Yellowstone” tour and when the lights went off, their performance started with an 8-minute video that included scenes from popular Costner movies.
What followed was an almost 90 minute set of music, storytelling, and jokes. They played a great variety of songs from all their releases, as well as some new songs that haven’t even been recorded yet.
After the band left the stage, Costner stayed for a few minutes with a bottle of champagne and thanked the audience for coming by sharing the bottle with fans, who rushed to the stage.
Walking out of the venue, I overheard concert-goers talk about how personable and friendly Kevin Costner seemed and how glad they were they decided to come to the show.

Medicolegal work consists of reports or examinations compiled in the context of potential or actual civil litigation. It excludes any fee-paying work or services.
People are likely to seek medicolegal advice after a non-fault accident or in cases of suspected medical negligence. Many different case types require many different medicolegal services. Independent medical experts are required in criminal and personal injury cases to provide medical reports, explain clinical intricacies and deliver testimony.
Professor Ali Ghoz is a leading orthopaedic surgeon who offers medicolegal services. As a single joint expert, he is available for criminal and personal injury cases. Professor Ghoz’s range of expertise includes minimally invasive surgery, soft tissue hip disorders and knee arthroscopy. He provides medical reports for legal cases and can explain the medical intricacies of physical trauma.
Complication risk factors caused by surgery can be unpredictable and unforeseen complications can lead to patients incorrectly suing for negligence. One such case involved a postman who underwent bilateral total hip replacement surgery. The patient sought advice after suffering from brachial plexus palsy; he and his expert believed this was caused by faulty positioning on the operating table.
Independent experts (including an anaesthetist, neurologist and orthopaedic surgeon) called as witnesses in the case concurred that the operation had followed correct procedure. There was evidence that the patient had suffered a stroke; an unpredictable and unavoidable outcome not caused by clinical negligence.
Medicolegal consultants recommend that patient medical records include details about the decisions made by care givers as well as a patients’ clinical care. Generally, if medical records are comprehensive enough to provide continuity of care, they are also sufficient for legal use.Re: Verse reading–1 Kings 19:1-18 (day six)
The human heart is so fickle. One minute it can swell with confidence, and the next be overrun by fear. That was certainly true of Elijah. Elijah was afraid for his life, not to mention he was depressed over the lack of repentance, so he ran as far away as he could. Interestingly enough God does show up, but he doesn’t console him; he tells him to prepare himself for his next task.
What if the spiritual antidote to fear is movement? What if fear is overcome not through consolation but by obeying God, doing the things you know he wants you to do? Perhaps fear will never be overcome by hiding in caves, but by seeing God at work in our own obedience.Details News Stages Publications Long title A Bill to amend the electronic communications code set out in Schedule 3A to the Communications Act 2003; and for connected purposes.

"[College Station voters] know the value of education," College Station Superintendent Clark Ealy said. "Whether you have a child or you don't, the community is improved when we have an educated citizenry, when we have an educated populace [and] when we have kids that come out of College Station ISD who can compete locally, nationally and internationally."
School board Secretary Jeff Harris said that the next step for the bond will be for the district to identify which projects to prioritize and to begin the process of determining who it will partner with to make the projects a reality.
The bond package includes three new campuses -- a middle school, an intermediate school and an elementary school -- various additions and renovations to existing campuses and funds to purchase new land for future facilities.
Of those who cast a ballot and were eligible to vote in the bond election, only four percent did not make a selection.

Ion Channels in Precision Medicine-Promising Cancer Biomarkers
Cancer is a diverse group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Increasingly, roles for the upregulation of certain ion channels and transporters in cancer is being described and understood. We are actively working with leading scientists at the forefront of cancer and ion channel research in the dual aims of developing biomarker assays and effective and reliable drug screening methods. Ion transport across the cell membrane is an important event found in fundamental tumour cell functions including the regulation of cell volume, migration, progression, proliferation as well as cell death. All these functions are very important for the survival of tumour cells and metastasis. Tumour-relevant ion channels are usually overexpressed/upregulated by hormones and growth factors to a considerable extent. The upregulation of a specific ion channel causes a high demand for its activity and therefore becomes critically important for the survival of a tumour cell. This ion channel, therefore, may be considered as a specific target for the treatment of the respective tumour within the body.
Different cancers upregulate different ion channels and transporters. Specific pharmaceutical targeting of these proteins could lead to effective and safe therapeutic tools.
ICTs as Cancer Biomarkers – Increasing early diagnostic capabilities of cancer would benefit countless number of patients. In many cancers, certain ion channels and transporters (ICT) are upregulated and expressed in much greater numbers than usual. We are actively collaborating with several academic groups to develop high throughput ICT biomarker screens
ICTs as Therapeutic Targets in Cancer Therapy – The upregulation of certain ICTs in some cancers, as well as the roles that they play in cell proliferation and migration, indicates that ICTs may offer a useful therapeutic option in cancer treatment. The ICR is well suited to assays aimed at targeting electrogenic membrane proteins involved in cancer.
The important role of hERG in tumor treatment
Ion Channels are involved in signal transduction of tumor cells like proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis. Ion Channels are related to tumor invasion and metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, tumor chemosensitivity. The expression of hERG in tumor cells is significantly raised, while the expression is low or no expression in normal tissues from which tumor cells originated like neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, adenoma, small cell lung cancer, hypophysoma, pancreatic B cell tumor, monocytic leukemia, endometrial cancer, breast cancer. Specific antagonists to hERG could suppress the expression of hERG in tumor cells that inhibit proliferation. This would be a new target for antitumor drug development.
Ion channels as cancer biomarkers
Inhibiting hERG in different types of cancer cells by using selective blockers that do not produce cardiac arrhythmia is a possible strategy for anticancer therapy. Regarding specific targets of tumor cells and normal cells, different isoforms or spliceosomes would be the breakthrough.The catalog number, CAE-138, dates the release to 1954, during which Flora designed 18 covers for RCA Victor, ten of them 7" EPs for RCA's Camden budget subsidiary (two of which were for the Festival Concert Orchestra, a generic name for an aggregate of stellar musicians who were under contract to other labels). Some were credited to or signed by Flora, others not.
Here's why we think it's a Flora:
• The soldier’s eyes. It's a Flora stare.
• The two-color scheme.
• The soldier’s eyes. Flora was a primary exponent of fried-egg eyes.
• The lady’s boobs.
• The soldier’s eyes.
• The dotted fill in the typography.
• Alternating color backdrop.
• The soldier’s eyes.
• The lady’s dress.
• The lady’s face has a Flora smile.
• The lady is floating in mid-air.
• The soldier’s eyes.
If it's a Flora (as we believe), it's hardly a top-tier Flora, but we'll add it to the catalog.Eight stars
First and foremost, a large thank you to NetGalley, Mark Edwards, and Amazon Publishing UK for providing me with a copy of this publication, which allows me to provide you with an unbiased review.
A long-time fan of Mark Edwards and his writing, I turned to this book to see if it would bring the same psychological thrill. Edwards succeeds in delivering and spins a story with layers that the reader will discover as the plot progresses. Adam and Ruth are housesitting for some friends when there’s a knock at the door one rainy evening. A woman stands on the stoop of this New York home, seeking the owners. After introducing herself, Eden explains that she has an open invitation to visit at any time, but can find someplace else to go. Ruth is happy to let her come in and Adam soon falls into line. A single night under the same roof soon stretches to a week and Eden becomes a third house sitter. While Ruth is out earning a living, Adam and Eden spend more time together. After a hard night of partying at the house one Friday, Adam wakes up to find the place empty. Ruth is not answering her phone and Eden’s presence is all but impossible to detect. When the proprietors return home, they deny knowing any Eden, which only worries Adam more, as Ruth still has not responded. Fighting against time and an NYPD that won’t help at all, Adam turns to an unlikely source. He soon learns of a secret group that may be the key to the entire ordeal, but they are also close to impossible to trace. In order to find Ruth, Adam will have to risk it all. Meanwhile, Ruth is on the other side of this group and the choice to abduct her becomes clear, but there’s a catch and a time limit. With a wonderful twist at the end, Edwards does well to sow some great drama and a few thrills in this piece. The reader with surely be left wanting more, with each page turn. Recommended to those who are fans of Edwards’ work, as well as the reader who knows the fun of unexpected company on the doorstep.
Mark Edwards writes in such a way that I am always looking for exciting twists, yet am usually still surprised by some of the directions in which the plot develops. He has a knack for taking a simple situation and turning it on its head with strong characters and the odd spine tingling. There are a host of characters that could serve as protagonist here, though the reader can enjoy anyone they see fit for the role. From Adam’s panic as he tries to piece things together, to Ruth’s being stuck in the middle of a scenario as a ‘chosen one’, and even the mysterious Eden who turns up on the doorstep one rainy evening. All three propel the story forward in their own way, keeping the reader guessing as the narrative finds itself twisting alongside the thickening plot. With a story that never stops, the reader is treated to another stellar Edwards novel, on par with many of his other pieces of fiction. Not to be missed, this is one novel that will keep the reader from answering the door on a rainy night, especially when not in their own abode.
Kudos, Mr. Edwards, for another winner. I hope many others discover the wonders of your writing and how the mind will race after completing one of your stories.

Whether or not it works for you and satisfies both of your requirements, then it is *right*, it doesn’t matter what people imagine.

This collaborative conference will bring together democracy activists, campaigners, academics and policy makers to explore current challenges and future opportunities for EU public participation. It will build on learning from citizens’ initiatives and petitions, deliberative forums, citizen lobbying, social movements and more. Participants will together imagine new ways and means to develop a more participative and democratic European Union.
Thursday, 5 May 2016, 9:30 AM – 5:30 PM. University of Liverpool – Liverpool, England
For more information and to register:
I remember being sceptical of the ECI process in the past, and sadly, the scepticism has been born out. The reforms won by the UK government ahead of the EU referendum are not about increasing citizen engagement with the EU… is the EC is capable of and willing to create a genuinely participatory opening?
So, I’ll be interested to see what comes of this conference. It should be interesting.

Rick Perry eliminated all “rehabilitative programs” out of the penal system, but this didn’t just occur in these concentration camps, it also occurred in the school systems through the “Lone Star State.”
So the first step that we have begun to take is having educational classes. In these classes, we teach political education, cultural education, and how to utilize the grievance system.
The Capitalist structure that we have here in this so-called “land of equal opportunity” has been built on exploitation, imperialism, racism, and fascism; all the while they continue to oppress their proletarians, whether they be New Afrikans, Brown, or White Brothers.
It is past time for the lumpenproletarians in the confines of the Texas Dept. of Criminal (In)justice System to stand up and form a body of Revolutionaries that will fight for total equality of the oppressed Nations that are in bondage.
This formation will not be easy, but nothing that deals with fighting the oppressor will be easy. Frantz Fanon once stated “Oppressed people kill each other all the time. A glance through any Black Newspaper will prove that Black people in Capitalist amerikkka kill each other with regularity. Angered by the misery of their lives, but cowed by the overt superior might of the oppressor, and the oppressed people shrink from striking out, at the true hostilities, and strike instead of their more defenseless brothers near at hand.”
I have been a political prisoner for 15 years, and this statement by Comrade Fanon is not only true for society, but it can be seen daily throughout Texas’s 100 (plus) concentration kamps.
This is just the genesis of something. We are hoping that this not only starts here, but will spread throughout all of these concentration kamps, and all of us proletarians will kick off a Statewide Rebellion, and fight against the “system”.
We will keep all of you updated on the progress, as well as the struggles of this. All outside support is welcomed.
What We Want:
1) Effective Reading (Political) Material
2) An end to the Mass New Afrikan Male/Female Incarceration
3) An End to Black on Black Violence
4) Access to Rehabilitative Programs
What We Believe:
1) That Knowledge of Self is Effective Education
2) That Each One, Reach One, should Teach One
3) All Lives Matter
Bulletproof luv,
Comrade King D.C.

Well, as the Run Out Groove label proved with its LP reissue earlier this year, the result is one mighty down-home, fun album of country-rock grooves: Down By the Old Mainstream by '90s supergroup Golden Smog.
While their lineup has been mercurial since they first got together in the late-'80s, the core lineup included Kraig Johnson of Run Westy Run, Dan Murphy of Soul Asylum, and Marc Perlman and Gary Louris of The Jayhawks. Their debut EP, On Golden Smog, arrived on Crackpot Records in 1992. Their loose, refreshing country-rock stood in contrast to the grunge and punk scenes of the time, and by 1995, Jeff Tweedy from Wilco and drummer Noah Levy of The Honeydogs had joined. But you won't find any of those names on the record sleeve -- all the musicians used pseudonyms due to contractual limitations.
Behind their new identities, Golden Smog they released their first long-player for Rykodisc, Down By the Old Mainstream. The 14-track CD arrived on Rykodisc and garnered favorable reviews, as well as a lasting cult following among alt-country enthusiasts. Now, Golden Smog fans and newcomers can enjoy the music in a brand-new, 2-LP colored vinyl presentation.
The album of thirteen original songs and two covers is a bit of a contradiction. The songs are at once relaxed and full of rootsy charm, yet impassioned and dynamic. The music harkens back to the '70s country-rock of The Rolling Stones, The Flying Burrito Brothers, and Faces.
In fact, one of the songs Golden Smog chose to cover was Faces' "Glad and Sorry." While the original was rather sparse, propelled mainly by acoustic guitar and piano, Golden Smog takes a more (layered) approach with several electric guitars harmonizing together over the course of the song. It fits well with the other tracks on the album, including "Ill Fated," a Byrds-like rock number full of jangly guitars, crunchy leads, and relaxed, two-part harmony vocals.
Meanwhile, on the opener "V," Gary Louris and Kraig Johnson show off their power-pop prowess. The infectious character study follows a girl who "would wait on us down at the bar" but disappeared "as if in a dream," all to an R.E.M.-esque backdrop of electric guitars and mandolin.
But it's on "Pecan Pie" - an endearing love song to a either a person or a dessert - that Golden Smog are their most down-home. The mandolin and guitar parts mingle as Jeff Tweedy (as "Scot Summit") sings about stumbling and grumbling, only to have his mind cleared by his conclusion: Life is simple - "A piece of pecan pie and you, that's all I want."
On "Yesterday Cried," Golden Smog creates a more atmospheric environment for the relaxed and melancholic ballad. With its two-part harmonies, shimmering slide guitar accompaniment, and strings sounds sampled on the Chamberlin, the wide-open track evokes a '70s production style that complements the emotive vocal by Kraig Johnson.
Another highlight of Down By the Old Mainstream is "Friend." While other tracks on the album retain a straight-ahead, simplistic quality, "Friend" is closer to a small suite with its ternary structure. It begins in laid-back groove featuring blended guitar parts and three-part harmonies. Following the second chorus, the band abruptly switches into a higher gear: jangling rock with driving drums that glides back into the original groove after a brief but incendiary slide solo.
No matter the song, the talent of each multi-instrumentalist in Golden Smog is evident and sweet as pecan pie. The album remains a loose, informal affair, though the production is often detailed and multi-layered, as demonstrated by Run Out Groove's new pressing.
While Ryko Analog issued LP versions of Down the Old Mainstream in 2010, Run Out Groove's recent version offers a much more compelling presentation: Stoughton-printed, tip-on gatefold sleeve, poly-lined inner sleeves, new disc labels, and pecan pie-inspired brown, black, and red marbled vinyl. The music has been mastered from the original source and pressed to 180-gram heavyweight vinyl at Record Industry. The result is an all-around enjoyable listening experience.
Boasting great music, enhanced visual components, and a quality pressing, Run Out Groove brings Down By the Old Mainstream to vinyl for the first time in nearly a decade. Due to its limited nature, the title is no longer available on the label's web store, but copies may be found in participating brick and mortar shops.

European Boxing Notebook: DeGale, Fury, Saunders, WBSS, and more…
By: Oliver McManus
A busy, busy couple of weeks has seen action across Britain aplenty but, for a while, there were relatively few major talking points. Nonetheless here is everything you could possibly need to know from the course of the last two weeks –
Chunky chases the dollar
James DeGale chose to relinquish his IBF super-middleweight title ahead of purse bids with his mandatory challenge Jose Uzcategui to chase fights that will define his “legacy in the division”. The 32 year old British boxer would have been up against a tough, powerful, Venezuelan in Uzcategui and the risk far outweighed the potential reward.
By ridding himself of the IBF title and, therefore, the mandatory situations he is now free to chase huge, money-making fights as he nears the end of his career. Without doubt the ideal location will be in the United Kingdom and DeGale never really managed to take off in America but, back home, there is the potential for some genuine mega-fights.
The winner of the World Boxing Super Series immediately springs to mind with Callum Smith and George Groves both providing stern tests and the appetite for a rematch with Groves has, arguably, never been hotter.
Billy Joe Saunders is another name that had been sounded out with potential for a clash to take place on September 15th but the finances of such a bout were believed to be a sticking point.
Watch this space, though.
Billy Joe Saunders mandated to defend against Demetrius Andrade
Talking of Billy Joe Saunders, the World Boxing Organisation has mandated their middleweight champion to defend his belt against mandatory challenger Demetrius Andrade – ranked number 2, the WBO’s number 1, Daniel Jacobs is facing Sergiy Derevyanchenko for the vacant IBF title – with purse bids expected before the end of the month.
Saunders was scheduled to face Martin Murray on two occasions already this year – April and June – before pulling out with injury both times and with Murray, now, reluctant to sign on for a third bout there was seemingly few attractive avenues for the champion to go down.
Against Andrade, Saunders would be up against a former super-welterweight champion and, you’d say, one of the hardest challenges of his career. We already know September 15th is the date being mooted for Saunders’ next fight, at the O2, and Andrade would provide quite a nice test in anticipation of a potential showdown with the winner of GGG-Canelo.
Saunders has already declared his willingness to take the fight as well as his confidence in beating the American but with Andrade signing with Eddie Hearn and Matchroom Boxing USA we could be set for one tasty purse bids.
WBSS 2018/19
WE HAVE A TOURNAMENT for 2018/19 with the World Boxing Super Series announcing the complete line-up for the Bantamweight division with no less than four world champions – the WBC are the only governing body not represented by a world champion (mainly because the belt is currently vacant) – in Emmanuel Rodriguez, Naoya Inoue, Ryan Burnett and Zolani Tete the belt holders to have signed up.
The other four fighters in the tournament are Jason Moloney (IBF Mandatory), Juan Carlos Payano (WBO #1), Nonito Donaire and, 4-0 Russian, Mikhail Aloyan.
Safe to say this tournament is shaping up to be the cruiserweight equivalent for 2018/19 and Emmanuel Rodriguez vs Jason Moloney will serve as one of the first quarter-finals having been called as a mandatory whilst Burnett, Tete and Inoue will be the other three seeds.
Fury looks to freeze Pianeta
The former heavyweight kingpin will be returning to the ring for the second time since his much awaited comeback kicked off and will face Francesco Pianeta at Windsor Park on August 18th, on the undercard of Carl Frampton vs Luke Jackson.
Fury will be looking for a far more polished and serious performance than the crowd at Manchester Arena witnessed on June 9th against Sefer Seferi with critics accusing him of not taking the sport seriously. Against Pianeta there is, on paper, a far more challenging opponent in the opposite corner with Pianeta a two-time world title challenger.
Those title challenges both ended with the Italian-born German getting knocked out, by Wladimir Klitschko and Ruslan Chagaev and the 40 fight veteran has had a less-than-impressive record over the past 12-18 months having lost to both Petar Milas and Kevin Johnson in depressingly convincing fashion.
Tyson Fury should, then, sweep past his latest challenge with relative comfort.
MTK Scottish card
MTK Global announced their first card as part of the new BoxNation broadcast agreement, to take place at the Emirates Arena on Friday 24th August in Glasgow with an absolutely stacked card of action set to take place.
Ronnie Clark, who sensationally upset Zelfa Barrett earlier in the year, defends his IBF European title against unbeaten prospect David Oliver Joyce – 7 and 0 – with the Irishman coming off the back of a sixth round TKO victory over Jordan Ellison.
Joyce has already proven his natural power with six wins via knockout and he’ll be looking to stamp his authority throughout the course of this, scheduled, 12 rounder. Clark is well aware of the threat posed by his 31 year old counterpart having declared the bout will be “amazing” to Irish-Boxing.com.
And, mark my words, this will be a war. There are no other ways of putting it.
On the undercard, local-legend, Willie Limond will return to the ring to take on MTK’s new signing in Darragh Foley over the course of 10 rounds with Foley fighting for the first time on British shores as a professional having been based in Australia up until now.
Rankin’ Rising up the Rankings
Hannah Ranking, the leading light in female Scottish boxing, will look to put behind her the previous issues in finding opponents when she travels to New York for her world title challenge on August 4th. Fighting Alicia Napoleon for the WBA Super Middleweight title, Rankin is in with a counterpart who has lost just once previously – to Tori Nelson – and is moving up YET ANOHTER weight category having last fought at middleweight and, prior to that, super welterweight.
British purse bids
As is always a busy period in the month, it was time for the BBBofC purse bids and seeing as there is so much to get through, this will be brief;
Cruiserweight – Matty Askin has been mandated to defend his British cruiserweight belt against up-and-coming Lawrence Okolie after the two have been verbally sparring across social media for weeks. The contest will go to purse bids on Wednesday, August 8th.
Light Heavyweight – Following a tempestuous fight for the English title back in February and months of expectation, a date was set for the rematch between Liam Conroy and Miles Shinkwin – slated for Friday, September 14th – but just days afterwards Liam Conroy decided to vacate the title and avoid the fight.
Middleweight – With the English middleweight belt being vacant promoter Errol Johnson reached an agreement with Reece Cartwright and Tyler Denny for the two to go toe-to-toe on Saturday, September 29th in Walsall for the title.
Super Welterweight – An agreement was reached by Eddie Hearn and the respective parties to stage Asinia Byfield vs Ted Cheeseman for the vacant British Super Welterweight title with the fight to take place on Saturday, October 20th in London; Adam Harper and Billy Bird will meet for the vacant English title on Saturday, September 22nd in Ipswich.
Super Lightweight – Robbie Davies signed a three-fight agreement with Eddie Hearn earlier in the month and his first fight will be on Saturday, October 13th in Newcastle for the vacant British Super Lightweight title and he’ll be up against Glenn Foot in a bruising encounter._8<<
Showtime World Championship Boxing Preview: Lara v. Hurd, Truax vs. DeGale
By: William Holmes
On Saturday night Showtime will team up with Al Haymon’s Premier Boxing Champions (PBC) to put on two highly competitive fights live from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas Nevada.
The main event will feature a Junior Middleweight Unificaiton bout between Erislandy Lara and the rising Jarrett Hurd. The co-main event of the evening will feature an anticipated rematch between Caleb Truax and James DeGale for the IBF Super Middleweight World Championship.
Photo Credit: Stephanie Trapp/Showtime
Their first match was won by Truax in what many consider to be the biggest upset of the year in 2017.
The undercard will feature fighters such as Julian Williams, Sergio Mora, and Alfredo Angulo.
The following is a preview of the two televised fights.
Caleb Truax (29-3-2) vs. James DeGale (23-2-1); IBF Super Middleweight Title
The expected opening bout of the telecast will be between Caleb Truax and James DeGale for the IBF Super Middleweight Title. Truax was able to pull off a tremendous upset during their first bout and surprisingly is still considered by many to be the underdog, despite the fact he beat DeGale in England.
Truax and DeGale are the same height and DeGale has a slight one inch reach advantage. Truax has been the more active boxer of the two. He fought twice in 2017 and three times in 2016. DeGale fought twice in 2017 and once in 2016.
DeGale clearly has the better amateur resume of the two. He was an Olympic Gold Medalist in 2008 while Truax was an Upper Midwest Golden Gloves Champion. However, while DeGale may be the better amateur boxer Truax appears to have more power in his punches. Truax has stopped eighteen of his opponents while DeGale has stopped fourteen.
Truax has defeated the likes of DeGale, KeAndrae Leatherwood, Melvin Betenacourt, Scott Sigmon, Derek Ennis, and Donovan George. He has lost to the likes of Anthony Dirrell, Daniel Jacobs, and Jermain Taylor.
DeGale has beaten the likes of Rogelio Medina, Lucian Bute, Andre Dirrell, Marco Antonio Periban, and Dyah Davis. His losses were to George Groves and Truax.
Even though DeGale has the edge in amateur experience and defeated opponents, Truax was able to beat DeGale in his own backyard and rather convincingly the first time they faced each other and it wasn’t by a lucky knockout punch.
Truax will have the mental edge going into Saturday night that may be the difference to help him win this rematch.
Jarrett Hurd (21-0) vs. Erislandy Lara (25-2-2); IBF/WBA Junior Middleweight Titles
This is an intriguing fight between a decorated amateur from Cuba that may be coming near the end of his physical peak and a young upcoming champion looking to make a name for him.
Lara is thirty four years old and will be seven years older than Hurd on fight night. He will also be giving up four inches in height and two and a half inches in reach. Hurd has also been the more active fighter of the two. He fought twice in 2017 and twice in 2016, while Lara only fought once in 2016 and fought twice in 2017.
Lara, however, does not appear to be worried about the size difference. He stated at the last press conference, ” “Everyone knows I love to fight his style. I’ve fought better and taller fighters than him and you’ve seen me dominate them. It’s going to be nothing different on Saturday night.”
Hurd has a slight edge in power as he has fifteen stoppage victories on his record, while Lara only has fourteen stoppage victories.
Hurd was a semifinalist in the National Golden Gloves tournament as an amateur while Lara was a Cuban National Amateur Champion and a member of the Cuban National Boxing Team.
Hurd has defeated the likes of Austin Trout, Tonly Harrison, Ionut Dan, Oscar Molina and Frank Galarza. Nobody has yet to defeat Hurd as a professional.
Lara’s two losses were close and were to Canelo Alvarez and to Paul Williams. He has defeated the likes of Terrel Gausha, Yuri Foreman, Vanes Martirosyan, Jan Zaveck, Delvin Rodriguez, Ishe Smith, Austin Trout, Alfredo Angulo, and Freddy Hernandez.
Hurd appears ready to test Lara and take advantage of his size advantage and his age advantage. He stated, “”Lara is a guy who can’t take pressure fighters well. I have some of the best pressure in the game. I’m younger, stronger, taller and longer. He’s not going to be able to run for 12 rounds. “
Has Lara reached the end of his peak? He hasn’t shown signs of slowing down and Hurd leaves himself open to counters. It should be a close fight, but this writer envisions Lara pulling away by the end of the fight.

James DeGale comes of age in a bloody steak of a fight with Badou Jack – so what next?
James DeGale comes of age in a bloody steak of a fight with Badou Jack – so what next?
By G.E. Simons
Since his split decision loss in a British super-middleweight title fight against George Groves in May 2011, James DeGale has enjoyed an impressive uneaten run collecting wins in the UK, Denmark, Canada and the US, picking up the IBF World super-middleweight title along the way.
DeGale became Word champion by edging out Andre Dirrell almost four years to the day since collecting that only professional career loss against Groves and has successfully defended the strap three times since, against Lucian Bute, Rogelio Medina and Badou Jack.
Whether by design or circumstance, DeGale has made all three defences on foreign soil against opponents that have all given him more problems than he or the oddsmakers had anticipated or predicted.
His January unification fight with WBC title-holder Badou Jack got 2017 off to a great start in New York and is probably one of the best drawn contests that you will see this year. It was a rough, tough and bloody rare steak of a fight, albeit one with a seam of skill and will running right through the heart of it.
Jack walked away from the encounter and almost certainly into a light-heavyweight future, exhibiting more frustration with the majority draw scorecards than he was entitled to, as neither combatant really deserved to win and neither combatant really deserved to lose.
A more pragmatic DeGale walked away from the Brooklyn ring without a couple of teeth but with a perforated ear drum and broken nose, his reputation greatly enhanced through the incredible toughness, machismo and taste for a proper tear up that he showed in a real mano a mano.
Which leaves us with two fundamental questions. Just how good is James DeGale and what comes next for him?
DeGale is clearly a very, very good fighter with quick hands, athleticism, tremendous footwork and real snap in his punching. He is also the first British pugilist to win both an Olympic gold medal (Beijing 2008), before going on to win a version of a professional World title.
Further, he has lost only once against another very good fighter in George Groves and beaten solid operators in Brandon Gonzales, Marco Antonio Periban, Andre Dirrell and Lucian Bute.
But even in these victories and especially in the loss to Groves and the draw with Jack, he has lacked that extra gear, that reserve of stamina or that mercurial divining rod of something unexpected which elevates fighters and invites them to breath that rarefied air surrounding mount greatness.
In the build up to the Badou Jack fight and in an interview with iFIlm TV, James DeGale described his opponent as “A quality operator.” and “a good all round fighter.”
Ironically he could have been describing himself and there’s nothing wrong with that description especially within the context of a super-middleweight landscape where there are a number of other quality operators, if no obvious standout.
Which leads onto what or who is next for James DeGale.
Speaking to The Daily Telegraph and following the Badou Jack decision, promoter Eddie Hearn said “James has just gone through a war and it will take him until the summer to come back. He’ll need that time.”
The Matchroom Boxing supremo is right, but come the summer there are no shortage of interesting options out there, including:
Callum Smit
Badou Jack’s vacation of the WBC title has muddied the waters a little, as had DeGale taken the belt with a victory, a first defence against Callum Smith would already be signed. Instead we will likely see Smith challenge Antony Dirrell for the vacant belt in late spring. Victory there would guarantee a terrific unification civil war with DeGale in the late summer. Likelihood of it happening next 5/5.
George Groves
That DeGale and Groves will meet again is inevitable, whether it is next for DeGale is debatable. The Saint has his own commitments in the shape of a tilt at the WBA Super super-middleweight title against Fedor Chudinov confirmed for early 2017. Get through that and Wembley Stadium could beckon once more for a domestic dust up of the super-middles, with titles on the line. Likelihood of it happening next 4/5.
Chris Eubank Jnr.
Agent provocateur Eubank Jnr. called out DeGale after the Jack fight saying “He (DeGale) came out of a 12-round fight and he’s got no teeth – that’s embarrassing in my opinion.” Middleweight Junior fights Renold Quinlan for an IBO bauble in February and who knows his goading might just draw DeGale into a blockbuster summer payday. Likelihood of it happening next 3/5.
Badou Jack
Jack has now officially vacated his WBC super-middleweight title as he prepares for a move to light-heavyweight, barring a move up in weight for DeGale a rematch seems highly unlikely. An appetite remains however with both claiming unfinished business, a residual interest from Mayweather promotions in James DeGale and more dollars to be made with fighters who match up well. Likelihood of it happening next 2/5.
Carl Froch
Just as Froch was frustrated by Joe Calzaghe’s retirement before they could meet, so James DeGale was frustrated by Carl Froch hanging them up nearly a decade later. The Cobra clearly retains an itch that would be scratched by lacing them up one more time but his head seems to continue to rule his heart. That said, this is boxing so never say never. Likelihood of it happening next 1/5.

DeGale-Jack Shows That Not All 10-9 Rounds Are Alike
DeGale-Jack Shows That Not All 10-9 Rounds Are Alike
By: Sean Crose
Let’s face it, James DeGale got his ass kicked Saturday night in Brooklyn. That’s right, Badu Jack took it to the English super middleweight in a big way. While DeGale, slick and skilled, dominated early, Badu’s hard, grinding style, consisting of body work and hard shots to the head, carried the day. At least it did if we look on the affair as a fight instead of as a boxing match.
Unfortunately for Jack, the title unifier was a boxing match and was judged accordingly, as such. The lighter punching, but faster DeGale escaped with a draw. Indeed, one of the judges had the man actually beating Jack.
I myself had Jack dominating six rounds while DeGale owned four of his own outright. I also had two rounds open to interpretation. In other words, I felt they could have gone either way. So indeed, the final decision wasn’t a bad one if I’m to use my own scoring as a guide. Still, it’s hard for me to get over the fact that DeGale took a beating on Saturday night. Boxing may not be “real” fighting, but it’s real close and there’s little doubt who won Saturday on the “who dished out violence more effectively” scale.
I’ve wondered for a while now if there’s a better way to grade fights than on a round by round basis. It would be hard to find criteria for a successful revision of judging, but perhaps it’s time to seriously consider if such a move is feasible. Not all 10-9 rounds are alike. The proof of that is on DeGale’s face and in his newly toothless smile. Seriously, I was concerned about the guy’s well being on Saturday. He was taking some hellacious punishment and the last thing this world needed was another Magaomed Abdusalamov tragedy.
Again, though, I myself had scored it so that DeGale could conceivably have earned the draw he ended up earning. Still, there seems to just be something off about it. For this was a case where flashy combinations and slick movement couldn’t carry the day. Lots of those DeGale shots landed on gloves. And lots of those Jack shots did some serious damage. As a rule, I tend to admire polished fighters, but when polished fighters get knocked around like DeGale did on Saturday, I have to be honest with myself. Simply put, the scores on Saturday evening did not tell the whole story. And there might be something wrong with that.

DeGale And Jack Ring In Boxing’s New Year With A War On Showtime
DeGale And Jack Ring In Boxing’s New Year With A War On Showtime
By: Sean Crose
This, frankly, was the kind of fight everyone had hoped for. Scratch that – it was better. Although boxing analysts and writers aren’t supposed to act excited (we’re supposed to leave that to our brethren who cover MMA), Saturday night had a lot to get excited about, courtesy of Showtime. James DeGale and Badu Jack met for a super middleweight title unification bout (for the IBF and WBC belts) and certainly delivered. Many analysts thought this fight would be a toss up. Who knew how right they were?
DeGale took the first two rounds simply by seeming faster, sharper and more in control. He even knocked Jack down in the first, though it seemed more of a flash knockdown than a destructive blow. By the third, however, Jack was asserting himself, slowly and steadily moving forward while banging away at DeGale’s body. DeGale, of course responded by tossing off fast, snazzy flurries of punches. It was Jack, however, who was doing the greater amount of damage – at least most of the time. Still, it was an incredibly close affair, which made the whole thing quite suspenseful. DeGale lost his mouthpiece on several occasions and seemed to be getting beat up. The Englishman’s skill level, however, kept him in the fight.
Then, in the twelfth, it was DeGale who went down. He got up, and some way, somehow survived the round. He even had a flourish for himself in the end. There was no doubt, however, that the man had taken some serious damage throughout the bout. It was even reported that he had lost a tooth. Ultimately, the judges ruled it a majority draw; which, although far from a robbery, seemed a bit odd since DeGale was clearly the fighter who had gotten the worst of it. Still, boxing is a sport and not a barroom brawl, and round by round judging allowed DeGale to keep his share of the super middleweight crown.
Yet the DeGale-Jack fight wasn’t the only exciting event of the evening. Junior lightweight Gervonta Davis is a man fight fans most certainly need to keep an eye on if they haven’t started to already. The exceedingly fast, accurate and hard hitting Baltimore native took undefeated IBF titlist Jose Pedraza to school, putting his man away in the 7th round. People are mentioning Gervonta’s name alongside Vasyl Lomachenko for a reason. He may not be ready, yet, but the rising star may certainly be an intriguing matchup for the Ukrainian wunderkind in the future.
On a final, ridiculous note:
Floyd Mayweather made it clear that he’s interested in facing UFC star Conor McGregor in a boxing match. Mayweather also made it clear he’s not interested in facing any more boxers, and that to him, this is all essentially a business matter.
It was certainly a memorable evening.

We share these in the spirit of Ubuntu – we are all united in our humanity. Our health depends on you being healthy. We are all in this together.
1. Focus on treating people in the community.
- During a surge hospitals and clinics may be overwhelmed. Hence it’s a good idea to help people figure out how to cope with COVID at home.
A simple home treatment kit for people struggling to breathe:
- pulse oximeter to measure blood oxygen saturation levels
- Oxygen Efficient Respiratory Aid (“OxERA”, a super efficient oxygen mask with PEEP valve – its 400% more oxygen efficient than high flow treatments and doesn’t need electricity)
- source of oxygen – bottle, cannister, oxygen concentrator if available
- trained care providers who can quickly access medics for advice, supervision, guidance as needed.
2. Equip and train emergency response teams, medics, nurses and people who can monitor and treat people in the community.
- Regular medical supervision is required for people on oxygen therapy. This can be conducted over a phone, internet or other remote access system
- In addition, other medical treatment and nutritional intervention may be needed.
- If possible, please also provide support for the carers as they may be tired, emotional and under severe stress and pressure.
3. Connect people overseas to organisations and people on the ground who can help.
- Many thousands of people want to help India, we just don’t know how. So please, ask for what you want. If it’s money, please be accountable and ensure that funds raised are channelled through reputable and accountable organisations.
- There are other practical ways to help, from providing medical advice to mobilising resources or simply listening to – or entertaining – people who need it.
4. Focus on saving lives and helping people breathe.
- Don’t allow red tape and politics to derail you. Avoid bureaucratic delays. Be entrepreneurial in your response.
- Smaller, more agile responses may be more effective than a bigger more coordinated effort – and in an emergency every minute counts.
We’re all in this crisis together. Stay focused on saving lives.
5. Call on us if we can help.
We love you India. Please keep breathing.

They possibly trust their beloved beautician or hairdresser with regards to modifying their hair. This is the motivation behind for what reason being a beautician or a hair stylist is vital. You need to comprehend that nowadays, a few hairdressers additionally trim ladies and youngsters’ hair, in addition to men’s, which makes their objective client base more extensive and more changed.
Many individuals decide to be a hair stylist since it is an exceptionally remunerating position as far as pay as well as far as the fulfillment that they can get from assisting their clients with working on their appearance.

Fulton Science Academy Private School students have frequent opportunities to personalize and self-direct many of their STEM experiences as part of their learning. We regularly use CER model (Claim, Evidence Reasoning), Engineering Design Method, and Project-Based Learning to create self-directed learning opportunities for our students.
In conjunction, our elementary teachers frequently use both the engineering design method and the CER model in our classes as an introduction to a unit or concept. Students make a claim about a driving question and/or challenge for the unit and through research and experiments they gather evidence to either support or disprove their claim. Throughout this process the students are really in control of the process, testing different theories to learn whether or not their claim was correct and recording all of their findings along the way until they finally reach a conclusion. As an example, 2nd grade teachers used this strategy when they began the study of gravity.
Also, during elementary classroom STEM challenges, students work as a whole group to develop driving questions (using the engineering design model) based on their given challenge and from there they complete the challenge in their own way. After the initial teacher facilitation, the remainder of the challenges are very student-driven where the teacher only gives support and guidance when needed, but leaves students to create, test their theories, and draw conclusions independently. Each group usually approaches the same challenge in very different manners, which supports the personalization aspect of self-directed learning.
To facilitate interest and connect our students in a more realistic way to the standards/concepts that they are learning, teachers will often use videos and media reports of actual events to provide context and meaning to instructional lessons. For example, in 3rd grade, after studying pollution and its effects on the environment, students viewed the real-world example of when a tanker and oil barge collided in New Orleans, causing an oil spill, (video:.
Other examples of self-directed and personalized STEM learning experiences include:
- In 6th grade language arts, students work in groups on a multimedia presentation. They choose a natural disaster of their own choice. Then they research the warning signs/detection (both scientific and natural) of the disaster and how people can prepare for the disaster, what they can do to survive the onslaught, and how they can recover from it. Once they have completed their research, they create a presentation to incorporate verbal explanation, video clips, graphics, maps, and sound.
- In 7th grade language arts, students read Jules Verne’s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Their assignment was to work in groups on a WebQuest, for which they choose a prediction related to science or technology found in the novel, which was written in 1869. Topics included scuba gear, submarine technology, use of electric power and lights, and the existence of “giant squids.” After researching their chosen topics, they created a poster that contains both verbal and visual explanations of the accuracy of Verne’s predictions. Their posters contained parenthetical citations for the visuals and the written explanations, as well as a Works Cited list.
- In AP Language/American literature, students choose a film based on an historical event or historical person from American history. After watching the film, finding a focus, and taking notes about how the event/person is presented in the film, they research historical and other sources to evaluate the accuracy of the film’s portrayal of the event/person. Their product is a research paper comparing and contrasting the film with history.
- In Biology, students have created media using art, animations, and typography, as well as audio/visual elements, to describe and explain various aspects of cell structure and function. Physical science students complete science fair projects in class; additionally they research concepts in physical science and create personalized teaching/learning experiences for their classmates.
- In math, students are provided personalized study plans using their MAP scores and in-class performances. Based on the skills they need to improve, they are guided to focus on those skills as they continue to learn in class. Khan Academy and Study Island also allow us to provide personalized practice and study plans according to students’ ongoing efforts. An example of mathematics self-directed learning is the math animation project, where students work on a project for which they are asked to use all 4 types of geometric transformations using an application or software and create a story for their animation. Students usually use their favorite movie/game characters in their stories and often enjoy creating their projects.
Another way in which we provide opportunities for self-directed and personalized STEM learning experiences is our STEAM Enrichment Program which is offered to students in middle school grades and up. STEAM Enrichment Program students meet four times per week during school hours, so that all students are able to attend. With the guidance of STEAM facilitators, students identify a big idea, issue, or concept that they would like to explore and their essential questions regarding the problem. Then, they are expected to formalize a problem statement and research questions. Using the engineering design model, each group works collaboratively and documents this process in their STEAM binders, as well as, their online portfolio and blog. At the end of each semester, students present their projects (model/prototype, design) using their tri-fold presentation boards and videos at the end of semester STEAM EXPO where all students, parents, and school partnership professional attend.
We approach the STEAM Enrichment Program a little differently for younger students to account for a different level of maturity and emerging skills. Students in elementary grades work together on either a class or grade level STEAM project based on their interests. Last year, our students in these grades worked on the following STEAM projects:
- Pre-K: Back to the Roots Water Garden Fish Tank
- Kindergarten: Sanders – Worm Farm, Irshadullah – Bird Houses
- 1st Grade: Growing and caring for potted plans
- 2nd Grade: Butterfly life cycle and butterfly garden blue prints
- 3rd grade: Market day – Create your own business: budgeting, economics, design process, product (prototype) and art!
Clubs offer another STEM enrichment avenue for FSAPS students to explore their talents and interests. Students have a variety of STEAM related after-school clubs to choose from such as, Nature Conservation, Hands-On Science, Programming, Arduino (an open-source platform used for building electronics projects), MathGeniuses, Scratch, Broadcasting, and so on. By providing a multitude of club options, our students are allowed the opportunity to receive more focused study in their individualized areas of interest.
STEM related academic teams are another big part of life at Fulton Science Academy Private School and a very effective reinforcement tool of classroom knowledge and concepts. The vast majority of our students participate on at least one academic team. We are very proud that our academic teams represented Georgia in seven different national and international academic competitions this past year and are well on our way to meeting or surpassing that incredible feat this year. Annually, at the beginning of the school year, we present each of our academic teams to our students and allow them the opportunity to choose an academic team based on their individual interests. Students meet during club times, after school, Friday nights and on Saturday mornings to study for their academic teams. Coaches organize lock-ins and cabin camps for students to create fun extended study times as a team and further develop team cohesiveness. To outside parties, a Saturday at FSAPS often closely resembles a regularly scheduled school day, since there are so many students, team coaches, and parents at the school engaged in academic activities. As part of our academic teams program, we offer Science Olympiad, Math Olympiad, Future City, Technology Fair, Media Festival, Destination Imagination, Model United Nations, Robotics FLL, Robotics FRC, History Quiz Bowl, and Academic Quiz Bowl. The variety of options provides our students with the opportunity to participate in a team most suited to their personal interests and to have a more personalized experience. During these studies, students self-direct their work as many academic teams require coaches to take the role of a facilitator only.
As part of student’s coursework, they complete many class activities and both short-term and long-term projects, as well. Additionally, we have school-wide projects, competitions, and outside activities to enhance students’ STEM experiences. Some examples are as follows:
- School-wide Science Fair
- STEAM Video Contest
- School-wide Maker Faire
- Georgia Water Tower Competition
- MathGeniuses
- ScienceGeniuses
- Destination Imagination Instant Challenges
- Local STEM Field Trips
Our students also attend and participate in many activities and competitions organized and hosted by other schools and organizations such as the Atlanta Science Festival, Atlanta Maker Faire, various local Math competitions, and so on. We give extra credit in science classes for any student attending the Atlanta Maker Faire and the Atlanta Science Festival. All these STEM related opportunities allow our students to further personalize their STEM experiences, as well.
Lastly, our school offers and/or hosts many STEAM camps to assist students throughout our community with personalizing their summer STEAM experiences and furthering their knowledge in an enjoyable manner over extended vacation periods. These summer camps include:
- STEAM Camp – Two Weeks
- Weekly Robotics Camp
- Math Olympiad Camp
- Wealthy Habits Finance Camp – Two Weeks
- Weekly Kids 4 Coding Camp
- BioIgnite STEM Camp – Two Weeks
- Chess Camp – One Week
Collectively, these programs, instructional approaches, extra-curricular activities, and enrichment opportunities consistently empower our students to personalize and self-direct their own STEM learning experiences through the facilitation, guidance, and support of our faculty, staff, and volunteers.

Using accurate optimisation techniques, the visibility of your website increases for relevant searches and is more likely to appear in the top of their search engine results pages (SERPs). The more visible your website is, the better chances are that you’re going to gain the attention of potential customersGoogle as a company has been responsible for multiple advancements and products, be it the Google search engine, the Android operating system or Youtube, the world's largest content hub. But, one thing that is often swept under the radar is Google's hardware prowess, which is often seen playing second fiddle to the company's immaculate software advancements.
The Pixel series of devices were launched with the aim of showcasing what Google feels Android should look like, given how OEMs tend to apply skins or modifications to the bone stock Android which is the base of the device. But, in doing so, Google has time and again failed to, for lack of a better word, highlight the hardware that it has had to offer.
From the original Pixel all the way up to the Pixel 5, the company has been offering simplistic, basic yet functional hardware. Leave aside the bathtub notch on the Pixel 3XL, the components used for the build and, especially the back panel on the Pixel, which, until recently was a dual-tone affair has always oozed a sense of luxury.
The coloured power button, providing a sense of colour in a rather bland side panel was also something that most people did notice but failed to appreciate. Now, it seems that Google is hard at work to bring it's first foldable to take on the likes of Samsung and, to do so, it might make use of its opponent's biggest strength.
Google's Upcoming Foldable Might Use Samsung's Panel
Whilst not a lot of things are known in regards to this mystery foldable, a recent report has mentioned that Samsung could supply its ultra-thin glass or UTG to Google, as per ETNews. As of now, the only electronics to make use of the UTG are owned by Samsung themselves.
In case you missed it, Samsung debuted the ultra-thin glass for the cover window on the inner screen on the Z Flip, which later got transferred to the Z Fold 2. What this display did was allow for easy flexibility, with slightly fewer creases and higher durability than that found on the older foldables.
Now, if Google does plan to use this display, it could be working on a device that could really take the fight to Samsung, since it can easily keep the company at bay when it comes to software, especially with the new Android 12 UI, which would look fantastic on a foldable screen, which would obviously spread out to provide a larger canvas to that found on a regular 16:9 panel or 21:9 panel.
This, when coupled with Google's aforementioned premium-grade yet ergonomic hardware could result in a product that would be able to undercut its most popular rivals and be slightly more durable and easier to use, as has been the case with Pixels and their matte finish backs which make it a breeze to use the device without any fear of accidental drops.Today we are talking about ways in which you can reward yourself if you hit a milestone or accomplished a goal. My clients know for every achievement we are planning a reward. I am constantly asking, “What are you going to do to celebrate?”
This is really hard for Type A women because for us, achievement is what is expected so the thought of getting a reward for something that was expected is a hard concept for us to wrap our minds around.
What I find is it’s not hard for Type A women to be convinced that a reward or celebration is a good thing. It’s logical when you think that this could be a great way to allow the experience to sink in and to motivate you to do the next thing.
No, where they get stuck is deciding what reward to give themselves. Type A women often put rest, relaxation, fun and enjoyment last on their list of priorities and so it can be difficult to think of something in the moment.
I have a colleague who thinks it’s hilarious to ask me every time we meet up what I’ve been doing for fun. My response every time is, “I don’t have do anything for fun, I bring the fun.” And then I change the subject.
Another struggle can that what is a reward for those around you, may not be something you are interested in. I have a friend whose favorite reward is to have dinner in really nice restaurant. The whole experience lights her up. For me, I can’t fully relax in that kind of environment. The food and drinks are delicious but when the bill comes, I get sticker-shocked and the last thing I experience is that I have been rewarded.
For those of you who might hesitate or balk at being asked “what are you going to do to reward yourself?” I’ve got some ideas for you. These are just ideas to help you start thinking about what would be a reward for you. Ultimately only you know what gives you a sense of reward.
Let me start by saying that the reward needs to bolster the achievement. If you’ve lost weight you don’t want to reward yourself with pizza and ice-cream. If you’ve hit your goal of saving a certain amount of money or paying off your debt you don’t want to reward yourself with a shopping spree.
You want to think about rewards that feel good but will also help you to move forward with your goals. On the podcast Happier, Gretchen Rubin and Elizabeth Craft discuss this at length.
An example I have from my life is, after I released my book which required a lot of long hours of focused attention I allowed myself a day to putter. The definition of putter that I like comes from Merriam-Webster and it is “to work at random.”
I didn’t necessarily take an entire day off from my business but I didn’t structure my day. I allowed myself to do what I wanted to do in any given moment. If I felt like doing my bookkeeping, I did bookkeeping. When I felt like cleaning the bathroom, I cleaned the bathroom. If I felt like reading, I read.
My day was a mix of unstructured personal and business projects. It was aimless and freeing, and by the end of the day I had actually accomplished a lot but none of it was required which is what made it feel like a reward. As much as I love structure I also love freedom so this was perfect for!Much too, the absolutely no put reward are the finest advancement.

A new synthetic strategy for the elaboration of supramolecular species and molecular compounds containing noncovalently interacting components is described, with the long-term objective of constructing highly ordered, wholly synthetic assemblies from readily available starting materials. These could serve as a basis for the future development of mechanoelectrical and photoelectrical communication systems and devices capable of storing and processing information. The approach was conceived against a background of a quarter of a century's experience in supramolecular, alias host-guest, chemistry. It is based on the use of irreversibly interlocked molecular systems that take the form of catenanes and rotaxanes. Such compounds are seen to be the ideal vehicles through which to transfer from supramolecular and host-guest chemistry the knowledge and experience gained from studying complexes between small chemical entities to very much larger molecular assemblies. Once we know how to interlock molecular components irreversibly and efficiently, we shall have a very much clearer idea on how to intertwine related polymer chains reversibly. A number of template-directed syntheses of [2]rotaxanes and a [2]catenane is discussed. They illustrate that there are inherently simple ways of making apparently complex unnatural products from appropriate substrates without the need for reagent control or catalysis. The noncovalent bonding interactions that are used to self-assemble the 1:1 complexes, which serve as precursors to the rotaxanes and the catenane, as well as to the [2]rotaxanes and the [2]catenane themselves, "live on" in their structures and superstructures after the self-assembly process is complete. A variety of methods, including X-ray crystallography, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, ultra violet-visible, luminescence, nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron spin resonance spectroscopies, and electrochemistry, demonstrate the high structural order that is incorporated into these new molecular assemblies in both the solid and solution states.

A huge container ship that has was wedged in the Suez Canal has finally been freed from the shoreline.
The 220,000-ton, 400-metre-long Ever Given – a 'megaship' operated by firm Evergreen – became stuck near the southern end of the canal on Tuesday. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said it had lost the ability to steer amid high winds and a dust storm.
The giant container ship was fully floated on Monday and traffic in the waterway would resume, the canal authority said in a statement.
The blockage had been the source of much worry and frustration for the global shipping industry.
Over the weekend, it was feared that some of the ship's cargo, about 18,000 containers would have to be removed in order to lighten the load.But high tides helped the tugs and dredgers in their work.
Egypt's President declared an end to the crisis of the giant container ship blocking the Suez Canal after its owners revealed it had been freed from the bank.
Abdel Fattah al-Sisi made the announcement on his official social media pages.
“I thank every loyal Egyptian who contributed technically and physically to ending this crisis. Today, the Egyptians have proven that they are always responsible,” he said.
Earlier the owners of the the ship said it had been freed from the bank but was still not floating.
Footage posted on social media appeared to show the 400 metre-long megaship facing the right direction in the water as tugboats battled to straighten it after the vessel smashed into the bank last week.
How much has the blockage cost?
About 12% of global trade, around one million barrels of oil and roughly 8% of liquefied natural gas pass through the canal each day.
SCA chairman Osama Rabie said on Saturday that the Canal's revenues were taking a $14m-$15m (£10.2m-£10.9m) hit for each day of the blockage.
Prior to the pandemic, trade passing through the Suez Canal contributed to 2% of Egypt's GDP, according to Moody's.
The Suez Canal blockage didn't just affect the global shipping industry or the Egyptian economy - countless businesses, from domestic transport providers to retailers, supermarkets and manufacturers were also impacted..."Kalonzo is Not a Leader," Kabogo Drops a Bombshell to OKA Leaders, Hints About His Presidential Bid

Just as ‘The Force Awakens’ launched the little-known Daisy Ridley into the stratosphere, ‘The Last Jedi’ will be introducing viewers to a spunky, instantly likable actor who should be huge in a matter of weeks. Born to Vietnamese parents but California-raised, 28-year-old Kelly Marie Tran can only tell us that she plays a resistance fighter named Rose Tico, and that her character is some kind of space mechanic. That’s all she’s allowed to say. But her enthusiasm on the cusp of fame speaks volumes.
Are you remembering to breathe?
[Laughs] I just took my first breath of the day right now. No—I’m good. I’m truly trying to be present and enjoy every single moment, because I know it’s going to be over sooner than I think.
How did you come into contact with this whole thing?
At the time, I was working a day job but I had an agent. I had probably been pursuing acting for seven, maybe eight years. And this notification came to me, just like any other audition, through email. I remember reading it and being, like, [disbelievingly] “Okay…”
Like someone was scamming you.
Yeah. It’s was like: What is this, first of all? Second of all, there’s no way I’m getting this. There’s no way in hell that they would put someone like me into a movie like that. And that, ironically enough, was the thought that helped me get the part.
You tapped into the crazy confidence of the doomed.
Seriously. I would have bet my life on not getting this. And I was so confident in that, that it gave me this wonderful freedom. I think that really helped.
Your being Asian-American feels like a big deal. The ‘Star Wars’ universe has always featured different species, but to have it better reflect our own species is gratifying. Do you feel the weight of that?
[Laughs, groans] I’ve been carrying it a while now. Yeah, I definitely think about that. I feel like it’s an honour and a responsibility at the same time. ’Star Wars‘ is so much bigger than any single person involved, so you feel like you want to do that justice, and also feel like you want to do justice to that little girl inside me that never saw anyone who looked like her, that person who’s starving for representation – it’s a lot.

How has it changed your life?
What’s crazy is that, apart from doing events, I never get recognised. I run outside all the time, I go on hikes, I go to the grocery store, I go to the bank. I do all this stuff and no one ever stops me or asks me anything. I even bought my own toy, and told the person checking me out that it was me. They didn’t believe me.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
That’s what everyone keeps saying. I feel like I might be able to skate by. I think my hair’s so different than this character. I might be able to have sort of a Hannah Montana lifestyle, maybe for ever. We’ll see. I’ll let you know.
Your years of auditions are probably over at this point?
I don’t know if that’s true. I want to work with amazing filmmakers and tell important stories, and if I have to audition to do that, I will.
Even though you don’t get mobbed in public, you play with that action figure of yourself, admit it.
[Laughs] I actually have it right here [pretends to reach for it under her chair]. I actually haven’t taken it out of the box – I know! I’m weird about it. You know what I did? I built the Lego set that had my character and John Boyega’s character. That was really weird. And cool.2019 CCN Workshop: Semantic processing and semantic knowledge

Conceptual spaces as a model of semantics
Abstract:
The problem in focus is how to identity the structure of our semantic representations. I will begin by presenting three main alternatives that have been proposed within the cognitive sciences: symbolic systems, neural networks, and spatial (geometric) representations. The advantages and drawbacks of these approaches are compared. I present my theory of conceptual spaces as an example of a spatial representation system. Evidence from concept formation and language acquistion supports the spatial approach to semantics. I will conclude by discussing some connections to cognitive neuroscience, in particular the idea that the grid cells in the entorhinal cortex function as a kind of universal coordinate system for conceptual spaces.

Beyond distributional embeddings for modeling brain responses to language
Abstract:
For more than a decade, word embeddings constructed using distributional properties, i.e. how words co-occur across large text corpora, have been the best models for predicting brain responses to language measured using fMRI. These word embeddings are typically used to fit voxelwise encoding models, which separately predict responses in each voxel. Here we will discuss two newer methods that can beat these distributional baselines. First, we show that visually-grounded word embeddings that incorporate information about the visual appearance of the things to which words refer can outperform distributional models in many brain areas. This suggests that the semantic space used by some areas in the brain is strongly influenced by visual information. Second, we show that contextual models that incorporate information about not just which words appeared, but the order in which they appeared, strongly outperform distributional models in nearly every brain area. Although interpreting these contextual models is difficult, these results suggest that much more can be learned about how the meaning of language is represented in the brain using these techniques.

The structure of knowledge
Abstract:
The overall framework in which I’ve been working is called the Parallel Architecture. The goal is an integrated theory of phonological, syntactic, and semantic knowledge, and the relation of this knowledge to the rest of the mind.
The architecture comprises independent structures for phonology, syntax, and semantics, plus interface components that establish correspondences among the three structures. The interface components include words, which link fragments of structure in the three domains. Rules of grammar are stated as declarative schemas, which are also pieces of linguistic structure, in the same format as words, but containing variables. Schemas can be used either to create novel structures (their generative role) or to capture patterns of generalization within the lexicon (their relational role).
I will sketch results in two domains of semantics. The first domain is the human understanding of physical objects – their shapes, spatial configurations, motions, and affordances for action. This is shared between two levels of representation: a geometric/topological Spatial Structure that also serves as the upper end of visual, haptic, and proprioceptive perception, and an abstract algebraic Conceptual Structure that coordinates types and tokens, expresses taxonomic relations, distinguishes perception from imagery – and facilitates linguistic expression.
The second domain is social cognition, which makes use predominantly of Conceptual Structure. Notions encoded in this domain, based on the notion of Person, include kinship, group membership, dominance hierarchies, the value of objects and actions to oneself and to others, joint intention and joint action, reciprocity, fairness, rights and obligations, and exchange. The linguistic expression of these notions encompasses a wide range of interesting predicates.
Unlike syntax and phonology, both these domains have clear antecedents in primate cognition, suggesting intriguing questions about the evolution of human cognitive capacities.

The new science of thought imaging: Applying machine learning and dimension reduction to fMRI to understand the structure of thoughts
Abstract:
Recent computational techniques, particularly machine learning, are being applied to fMRI brain imaging data, making it possible for the first time to relate patterns of brain activity to specific thoughts. Our early work focused on the identification of the neural signatures of individual concrete concepts, like the thought of an appleor a hammer. It progressed to identifying many other types of concepts, such as emotions, numbers, and abstract concepts.
The more recent work is progressing towards understanding the structure of thought in terms of its neural components. One facet of this approach consists of identifying the neurosemantic dimensions that underlie the representation of concepts in a given domain. For example, the dimensions of periodicity and causal motion underlie many elementary physics concepts. Another facet applies the approach to multi-concept thoughts, such as the neural representation of a paragraph or a sentence.
In addition to the theory development, two areas of application of this approach are producing fruitful results. One application is to neuropsychiatry, where it has been possible to identify suicidal ideation in terms of alterations of a normative pattern of concept representation. Another application is to STEM instruction, where it is possible to assess the neural structure of STEM concepts.
The scientific significance is that we are beginning to understand the basic neurocognitive building blocks of more and more types of thought from simple to complex. This research is in its infancy, but it is advancing rapidly and is providing a new perspective on the brain’s organizational system for representing individual concepts and larger constellations of thought and knowledge.

Story maps - How we infer meaning from narratives
Abstract:
Most everyday activities, such as watching a movie or shopping for groceries, require us to remember what has happened before, so that we can correctly infer the meaning of ongoing experiences and, if required, perform relevant actions. To accomplish this, the brain must relate what is happening now to relevant experiences from the past. This is computationally difficult when the environment, and ensuing sensory input, are continuously changing, and the relevant experiences are non-adjacent in space and/or time because of potentially many irrelevant intervening experiences. I propose that we bridge across these non-adjacencies by forming cognitive maps of events which enable us to infer the relationship between individual events and link them together into narratives. I refer to these cognitive maps of events as story maps and will discuss a series of experiments, where we used a combination of realistic stimuli (movies and animated videos), fMRI and across-voxel pattern similarity to examine whether formation of narrative-based memory networks relies on hippocampal mechanisms which are critically involved in formation of cognitive maps in other domains (most notably space and concepts). In combination, these studies suggest that inferences about the relationships between events in narratives may be based on map-like representations in the hippocampus, and that these story maps serve as context for integration of separate experiences in memory and organisation of ongoing experiences.

Estimating a shared response space across heterogeneous naturalistic story-listening data sets
Abstract:
Connectivity hyperalignment can be used to estimate a single shared response space across disjoint datasets. We describe a variant of connectivity hyperalignment—the connectivity-based shared response model—that factorizes aggregated fMRI datasets into a single reduced-dimension shared connectivity space and subject-specific topographic transformations. These transformations resolve idiosyncratic functional topographies and can be used to project response time series into shared space. We benchmark this algorithm on a large, heterogeneous collection of story-listening functional MRI datasets assembled over the course of approximately seven years. This data collection comprises 10 unique auditory story stimuli across 300 scans with 160 unique subjects..

Navigating a novel semantic space with distance and directional codes
Abstract:
A recent proposal posits that humans might use the same neuronal machinery to support representations of both spatial and non-spatial information, organising knowledge of the world in an internal “cognitive map” of concepts that is partially based on spatial codes. However, experimental evidence remains elusive. In my talk, I will discuss the results of a recent experiment where adult participants familiarized with a novel conceptual space composed by labelled categories of multisensory objects: a semantic space. Before and after non-spatial categorical training, they were presented with pseudorandom sequences of both objects and words during a functional MRI session, while performing a non-spatial categorization task. We reasoned that a subsequent presentation of two stimuli referring to different categories implied a movement in the novel semantic space, with specific travelled distances and directions. Crucially, we showed that after learning the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) encoded a reliable representation of the distances between the recently acquired concepts, as revealed by both fMRI adaptation and model-based RSA, and that the activity in the right entorhinal cortex (EHC) showed a periodic modulation as a function of travelled direction, also encoding, to a weaker extent, information about the travelled distance. In both cases, it was possible to recover a faithful bi-dimensional representation of the novel concepts directly from neural data. Our results indicate that the brain regions and specific coding schemes known to encode relations and movements between spatial locations in mammals, in the human species can also be used, or recycled, to represent a bi-dimensional multisensory semantic space during a categorisation task.

Using insights from the human brain to interpret and improve NLP models
Abstract:
There has been much progress in neural network models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) that are able to produce embeddings that represent the meaning of individual words and word sequences. This has allowed us to investigate the brain representation of natural text and begin to unravel the mechanisms the brain uses to make sense of language. At the same time, the brain, being the only processing system we have that actually produces and understands language, could be a valuable source of insight on how to build useful representations of language. In this talk I will describe recent work on identifying brain regions that process language meaning at different length of context. Based on these results, I will also describe recent work that employs brain activity recordings (from subjects reading natural text) to interpret and improve the representations learned by powerful NLP algorithms that were able to beat many performance benchmarks at their release, such as ELMo or BERT. We show that modifications to BERT's architecture that make its representations more predictive of brain activity also improve BERT's performance on a series of NLP tasks. Under this perspective, the cognitive neuroscience of language and NLP can evolve in a symbiotic partnership where progress in one field can illuminate the path for the other.

Mutual information as a measure of "semantic" overlap: Two case studies in the nominal domain
Abstract:
Since Shannon originally proposed his mathematical theory of communication in the middle of the 20th century, information theory has been an influential scientific perspective at the interface between linguistics, cognitive science, and computer science. In this talk, I adopt a guiding assumption that meaningful utterances are those which are informative, i.e., those that transmit a reasonable amount of "information". Recently, powerful state-of-the-art NLP systems have gained in popularity, allowing us to utilize large-scale, multilingual corpora as the basis for measuring information theoretic quantities. More specifically, we can now measure whether linguistic types in large, multilingual corpora significantly overlap in "meaning", i.e., whether they mutually share a statistically significant amount of information between them. In this talk, I present two studies that apply these methods to noun-phrase phenomena that are known to be non-deterministic, by asking how arbitrary are: (i) pairings of classifiers with nouns in Mandarin Chinese (Liu et al., 2019) and (ii), pairings of gender on nouns with adjectives or verbs that share a dependency relation with those nouns in six languages (Williams et al., 2019/submitted). If these pairings are significantly non-arbitrary, we will say that a “semantic” overlap exists between the two linguistic types. In both cases, a significant amount of mutual information was uncovered. These studies can be taken as a step towards a general methodological program which measures information theoretic quantities in ecologically natural, written corpora as a way to shed light on cognitive scientific questions about informativity and idiosyncrasy in language use.Background:
Taking a representative snapshot of physical activity intervention trial findings published between 1996 and 2006, we empirically evaluated participant characteristics, response and retention rates, and their associations with intervention settings.
Methods:
A structured database search identified 5 representative health behavior journals, from which 32 research reports of physical activity intervention trials were reviewed. Interventions settings were categorized as workplace, healthcare, home- or community-based. Information on participant and intervention characteristics was extracted and reviewed.
Results:
The majority of participants were Caucasian (86%), women (66%), healthy but sedentary (63%), and middle-aged (mean age = 51 years). Intervention response rates ranged from 20% to 89%, with the greatest response rate for healthcare and home-based interventions. Compared with nonparticipants, study participants tended to be women, Caucasian, tertiary-educated, and middle-class. Participants in workplace interventions were younger, more educated, and healthier; in community-based interventions, participants were older and more ethnically diverse. Reporting on education and income was inconsistent. The mean retention rate was 78%, with minimal differences between intervention settings.
Conclusions:
These results emphasize the need for physical activity interventions to target men, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and ethnic minority populations. Consistent reporting of response rate and retention may enhance the understanding of which intervention settings best recruit and retain large, representative samples.- Not important at all

Rent-seeking is thus predicted to occur if and only if both of those cost-and-benefits conditions hold. The social welfare loss due to rent-seeking is a lot more than just the deadweight loss due to the increase in price from P to R (Tullock 1967). Besides all the forgone productive activities of the producers that have been eliminated from the market by the regulations, the social cost also includes all the forgone productive activities of the producers that would have involved an efficient use of the resources, but which instead have been employed in lobbying. Last but not least, it includes all the forgone productive government activities, which could have involved the use of resources for providing certain public goods, but instead have involved the use of resources merely for enforcing the privileging regulations and for assuring that they don’t lose power.

Appendix: Adjustments of the standard comparative economic systems framework
Appendix: Adjustments of the standard comparative economic systems framework
The first problem is that the initial classification scheme as advanced by Holesovsky (1977) doesn’t make explicit the “power vs. plenty” criterion, as a separate variable in the classification. However, this criterion is not only used in the classification, but it actually plays a very important part in it. Hence, we amend the “function of the property rights system” dimension of his scheme, identifying four possible functions: economic efficiency, social justice, rent-seeking by domestic interest groups, international political goals (power, national interest). It is also worth emphasizing that these criteria are not mutually exclusive, and when more than one of them is present, it means that there is a trade-off between them.
A second problem is that the initial scheme makes too much of the separation between labor and the owners of capital. The entire body of modern economic theory, from standard macroeconomic growth models (Romer 2011) all the way to Austrian economics (Mises 1946), sees the supposed separation between a class of people who only have their labor and another, entirely distinct, class of people who invest and who own capital, as a mistake. Fortunately, this error is easier to fix than one might think at first glance. Holesovsky uses the concept of “wage labor” to mean two simultaneous things, namely the fact that there exists a free contractual relationship between labor and employers (owners of capital) and the fact that labor owns no capital and does not invest. We are using the term to mean only the first part. As such, the amended classification becomes fully functional and relevant, because it allows for the existence of wage labor that, at the same time, invests and owns capital (in the initial framework, this category was deemed impossible).
Finally, a third amendment has to be made to the way older generations of comparativists have built their definitions. This is necessary because, like most scholars of his generation, Holesovsky (in his otherwise rather sophisticated taxonomy) did not explicitly consider the possibility that, when building models, some of the basic criteria can also be connected by ‘or’ (logical inclusive or) rather than solely by ‘and’. We are hence applying the more elaborated approach to the problem of classification, inspired by the more recent work done by authors such as Ragin (1987, 1994), Gerring (2001) and Goertz (2005).
Despite these adjustments, the definitions in the main text are retaining the spirit and letter of classical comparative economic systems in their essential lines, and draw their justification from that literature. In fact, some of the alternatives connected here by ‘or’ are also presented as such by Holesovsky himself in a rather confusing way which attempts, and largely fails, to put them all together in a single figure. By using Gerring-Goertz logical-combinatorial approach, we can reconstruct and present the initial classification and selected models in a much simpler and clearer fashion (the presence of ‘or’ marking either the possibility of a diversity of systems or the existence of a trade-off within the system).

Rabbits bite by nature, but you have to distinguish two types of bites: those that ruin clothes, furniture or cables and those that they do it to you.
We are going to give you a series of tips for them to stop biting you or the objects that you have at home, but there is a big difference: they bite things to hone their teeth because they are in continuous growth, but if the bites are directed at you, it is possible that it is because of the heat.
If rabbits bite me or my furniture, what can I do?
First of all keep in mind that learning by the bad is not an option, for any living being. So the only thing they will understand is that you are bad with them and that they have to fear you. Even if your rabbit gets on your nerves, even if he bites you in the legs or strips the wires, never hit him.
What happens if I let him bite what he wants?
The problem of not educating your rabbit or allowing him to bite is that he can gnaw the protection of a cable and get electrocuted. He does not know that the thing is dangerous for him, so he will nibble without stopping until he gets hurt.
So, it is better to lock him in their cage so he does not bite anything?
Quite the contrary. A rabbit, like any animal, needs to have a leisure time in which he is able to move freely and interact with you and all the members of your family. He has to feel part of your life and the place where you live, you cannot stop him from biting because it is part of who he is.
How can I prevent my rabbit from biting the wires?
Knowing that your rabbit needs to bite things to take care of his teeth and that you cannot lock him up and that you have to let him move freely from time to time, let's talk now about how to avoid electrocution. To achieve this you have to do two things, the first is to take all the wires from your house and raise them, sticking them to the wall.
You can do this with braces or tape, you can also prepare guides in the form of 'C' through which your cables will run, fixing them to the wall with some nails. Another option is to use additional plastic protections for these cables, your rabbits will gnaw them with their teeth as well, but it will take much longer and you can also put them out of reach.
How do I get my rabbit to not bite my furniture?
We insist, never resort to violence. Be patient and treat your rabbit always with lots of love.
To avoid having the legs of the table, the sofa or the chairs to be bitten, there are two fundamental techniques. The first is that each time he does it you say 'No' in a categorical way and you lock him in his cage for five minutes. This needs to be done instantaneously so that he associates the punishment with what he has just done wrong. Once a few minutes have passed, release him again and give him a caress.
The next thing you can do is take a sock and make a ball with it, choose those chubby ones you have for the winter. Every time you see him nibbling something he should not, throw the ball to him, but remember you do not want to hit him with the ball, just for it to land near him. The objective of this technique is for him to understand that the furniture itself reacts to the contact of his teeth; that the object does not like to be bitten. With a little luck, he will turn away from it.
And if none of that works, what can I do?
In case none of these methods make your rabbit stop biting everything, you'll have to prepare a large space for him to move. You can choose a room that you do not use or build a small circuit free of victims for his teeth. So that he is comfortable and he can exercise his bites you will have to buy toys for him to do so.
There are very nice toys that they love. You can even combine the technique of the "sock" and "saying no" with these toys, so that they understand that the only piece of furniture left to bite is that one you bought for them to do so.
Do not rule out the possibility of contacting an ethologist to help you with your rabbit's education.
My rabbit does not bite the furniture, it bites me!
Rabbits are not violent beings, they are docile and affectionate, but sometimes they may bite you or appear to be angry. If this is your case, contact our online veterinarians as it is possible that he/she needs to be neutered. Rabbits can become violent if their testosterone rises and they are not allowed to find a mate to reproduce. If you cannot accept the responsibility of having lots of bunnies, consider this solution.
We hope these tips have helped you. Do not let your rabbit get close to your clothes, because he will devour them and we do not recommend you to use a repellent so that he knows it is bad to put his mouth there and not to bite it, because it is a torture for them. The best way to prevent this from happening is to buy a nice toy for him to gnaw, pamper him, and control his play space so he does not hurt himself.
Remember that in case of electrocution or poisoning of your rabbit you can count on the online veterinarians of Barkibu, we are there for you ;).VIDEO: Caged 20 days captive in Nigeria — Three Israeli Filmmakers | NN NEWS
The three Israeli filmmakers arrested by the Department of State Services (DSS) — Rochman Rudy, Noam Leibman and French-Israeli journalist, David Benaym, over alleged involvement with the activities of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), have narrated how they were torture for twenty day while in detention.
This was contained in a short video clip titled “Caged: 20 days captive in Nigeria” as they alleged inhumane treatment by operatives of the secret police without being charged to court by the Nigerian government.
The trio, while explaining why they made the video, said they now understand what Igbos are passing through in Nigeria.
Recall that the filmmakers were arrested by DSS operatives at Ogidi village, Idemili North Local Government Area of Anambra State while shooting a documentary titled “We Were Never Lost”.
The documentary centers on Jewish communities in African countries such as Kenya, Madagascar, Uganda, and Nigeria.
A post attached to the video on Rudy’s instagram handle read:
“’We were never lost’ team journeyed to Nigeria to film an episode of their documentary series exploring the stories, struggles and aspirations of the Igbo Jews, but while there, the team got abducted by the Nigerian government and were held in cages for weeks.
“Here is the full account of what actually happened: ‘Our experience has only given us, even more, drive to uncover and share the stories of disconnected communities of Jews around the world.
“We experienced weeks of what Igbo Jews face every day and if our suffering has led to mainstream Jews waking up to the reality of their Igbo family, then we are proud of the sacrifice we had to pay.”
The post further stated: “The ‘we were never lost’ documentary series is a series that is set to tell the stories, struggles and aspirations of lesser-known or disconnected Jews in the world.
“Our first season is to take place in Africa we were in Nigeria to film our first episode and unfortunately after two days, we were illegally held by the Nigerian government security service and we were in cages for three weeks.
“We’re here to set the records straight of what we went through and what actually happened.
“First, you may need a bit of context to understand who the Igbos are and why we went to Nigeria in the first place.
“The Igbo people are people with a rich history, diversity and a lot of cultures and have other similar experiences that other Jewish communities have around the world.
“Whether it is through persecution or overcoming challenges, they are believed to be descendants of the tribe of Israel specifically of Gad.
“There is a large community within the Igbo population that has either preserved elements of their Jewish culture, their Jewish heritage or has come back to their Jewish culture or heritage and some of them have their second generation born and all they know is being Jewish and we were coming to Nigeria to document specifically their stories, where they have come from, their experience, their history, aspirations, culture, do they want to remain in Nigeria? Do they want to come back to Israel?”
It continued: “Starting from the beginning, we arrived in Nigeria and spent the two days filming in a village called Ogidi, an amazing community that welcomed us with open arms, cooked us food and introduced us to their way of living their Jewish life, the way they were praying every single morning.
“Even though we had only two days, we got to experience how charismatic, intelligent and hard-working and knowledgeable in Torah this community is.
”At the end of our second video filming, we were notified that a video was going viral that they used images of us and we can see that they had completely fabricated the stories calling us MASSAD agents, associating us with a movement that is seeking to liberate Biafra and fight against the Nigerian government which of course we had nothing to do with.
“These bloggers had seen we were bringing Sefer Torah as a gift to the community and preceded to make a fake claim assuming we were connected to the separatist movement and that when the Torah arrives, it is a sign of the movement. This claim doesn’t even make sense because there are already several Sefer Torah’s throughout the region.
“The DSS decided to get involved. The DSS is the interior defence of Nigeria. They came to our hotel on Friday morning with about 10 heavily armed men in black ski masks and told us we had to come with them, they took our phones, our passports and they took our freedom for the following 20 days.
“Of course, we were coming in with no bad intentions and we were innocent the entire time. We didn’t think much of it.
“We thought we would be there for about an hour, questions which showed them what we are about and what we were planning to do and we’d be able to continue with our project.
“Eventually, they took us one on one and started interrogating us in ways that they were just accusing us, we had nothing to hide so we told them the truth and we told them our project had nothing to do with separatist movements.
“It’s Friday night and we have realised at this point that we will not be able to get out and do Shabbath and everyone’s sleeping at the weekend so we did the Kiddush over a grape that we found and the multi over some crackers that we had and this is how we spent our first Shabbath in Nigeria.
“We know we have embassies of three very powerful countries willing to fight for us but this is not the case for Nigerians who were arrested.”
Creative director, Kavana Films, Leibman said, ”There was a non-Igbo man initially taken into custody with us and when he asked them not to yell at us, the interrogators threatened him by saying, ‘I can make you disappear’. This is the kind of abuse of power we witnessed first-hand and the realisation that there is no accountability for the injustice.”
Benaym added, “24 hours later, about 7 am after sleeping on the floor, we were pushed into a van, they did not want to tell us where we would be, they just said ‘get in the car’, they drove at a very fast, almost trying to intimidate people by driving in their directions to make them afraid. A lot of them were afraid for their lives. We had no clue if the world knew that we were taken. We could not communicate with anyone.”
Leibman said, “After nine hours of non-stop dangerous driving, we were taken to their quarters in Abuja to a cage holding cell.”
Rudy added: ”When we say cage, we mean, literally a cage, it was a circular room that you can take three, four steps in each direction.”
Leibman continued, “And then we asked our captors, are we under arrest, they said no. Are we being detained, they said no so we said we refuse to willingly enter the cage. For about 20 minutes they were stood around not knowing what to do because they had no authority to put their hands on us. Eventually, a senior officer comes in screaming that they were embarrassing him and orders them to physically throw us in the cage.”
They continued, “First five nights, we didn’t have a seat, it was dark, hot, no furniture, no beds, we were forced to sleep on the tiled floor, we were sweating, there were bugs, urine. The cage looked like what you could imagine in Hollywood movies.
“In the morning, when the sunlight illuminated the room, we saw writings all over the room from previous prisoners, the words written there were, ‘Dear God, allow me to experience happiness one more time in my life’. And another one saying, ‘Please remember me when I disappear’.
“We could see writings on the walls of the people that were counting the days. There were days we didn’t shower, we were eating only bread and crackers, they basically treated us like animals. We became the story and that was absolutely not the intention.
“We didn’t know anything going on in the world, we didn’t have any means of communication. We didn’t understand why we were there.
”Finally, after five days there, the Israeli Embassy Ambassador came and one of the Consulate from the American Embassy.
“We were able to know that the outside world understood what our situation was, they told us they were doing everything that they could to get us out of there. They managed to speak with the people keeping us, the DSS officials and agreed to bring food from Chabad, a Jewish organisation; that was the first time we had a real meal.
“And we were finally allowed to shower and when I say shower, we go into a bathroom with the bucket that they used to either clean themselves because there was no tissue paper or to actually clean the bathroom itself by pouring it on the floor and taking this bucket, we will fill it up with cold water from the sink and dump it on our heads and that is how we showered there for the three weeks that we were being held.”
Benaym revealed, “I take medications daily and if I don’t, my life could be in immediate danger, especially in the kind of situations we were being held in. Medications, all of our equipment and luggage were left in the hotel 900 km away and days without my medication could be extremely dangerous and we kept on telling them that it was essential that I got my medication and they wouldn’t listen.”
His colleague said, “The DSS doctor scribbled down the name of the medication and told us, ‘don’t worry, we will find some’ and we were explaining to him that it is a unique prescription customised for him and it is very expensive, you will not find it in Nigeria, if you don’t take this seriously, you are going to have the death of a foreign citizen on your hands and the response was ‘calm down, don’t worry’.
”He was very afraid that he might catch something so he was taken by the French Embassy and he was also hospitalised and finally able to get his medications.”
”I was sent back every single morning for days to get questioned. The fact that I had to go back inside knowing the way we were treated over there,” Benaym said.
Rudy said, “Me and Noab continued in the room and after that we were sent to another cage that was slightly bigger but we had another two cellmates with us, they were accused of doing a terror attack in Abuja, bombing in 2014 and purchasing weapons illegally.
“We don’t know these people, they could try to harm us, they could try to do something so the first week, we even walked around carrying scissors, we put it in our pockets to make sure that in case one of them or both of them were to attack us, at least we had something.
”This is kind of like the day to day life they went through, we didn’t know anything going on in the world, we didn’t have any means of communication, we didn’t understand why we were there, several times we asked each other how did we got there, accused of some things, not even charged or arrested so we don’t even have human rights lawyers in horrendous conditions.”
Leibman said, ”We knew that Nigeria’s own laws states that when someone is brought in as a suspect, the DSS has 48 hours to release them. They interviewed us for hours on end. Took written and video recording statements, hacked our phones, did literally everything they could to try to find one shred of evidence they could use against us for an arrest.
”Before the trip, we understood that the government is not friendly to the Biafra Movement but we couldn’t imagine how they were unable to differentiate between those who were involved in the IPOB separatist movement and Igbos who just want to live a thorough-based Jewish Igbo lifestyle. In the end, we didn’t receive our freedom for three weeks.
”Almost the entirety of this time, we sit in a blank room doing nothing, no form of mental stimulation, no reading material, no news, nothing other than being trapped and disgusted in a room not knowing when this would end.
“We didn’t know if people were actually fighting for us, we didn’t know if we would get a lawyer if something would happen to us. We lived in a fear of the unknown.”
Benaym added: “I’m a journalist and one of the most important rule is ‘never become the story’ here we became the story and that was absolutely not our intention.”
Leibman noted, ”We were not able to make the film we set out to create; the opportunity was robbed from us and we will never be allowed into Nigeria but if you know anything about the Jewish people, we are not ones to give up on our aspirations, this has only increased our motivations to share the stories of the Igbos and our project will.Chestnut House Sleeps up to 14 in 6 Bedrooms - Wood Burning Fire - Hot Tub Hire - BBQ

The Indian petrochemicals industry's recovery has faltered amid the surge in infection rates in Q221, yet we remain confident that the sector will pick up activity as soon as the government is able to bring the situation under control - a process that is taking longer than envisaged. The impact of the pandemic has been felt largely by imports with some segments seeing a collapse in demand for foreign supplies and even turning to export inventories that had built up. The absence of India, particularly in polyethylene and precursors of polyester, on the regional market has helped depress prices, but a return to import growth will once again make the South Asian market an important source of demand for Asian and Middle Eastern suppliers. In the long run, India will need to address constraints to growth in capacity, which have held the country back from achieving greater self-sufficiency in basic polymers.' India)As a business, you need to build and nurture a strong employee advocacy program to help with your brand awareness, customer experience, and brand amplification. This blog explains employee advocacy and what you can do to help build a strong employee advocacy program for your company.
What is employee advocacy?
Employee advocacy is the process in which employees share information about their employer’s services and goods to their friends and family using any available tool or channel of communication such as email, social networks, SMS (text messages), and even the telephone. The main purpose of employee advocacy is to create more leads and sales. This is a good way for employees to increase the brand awareness of the company they work for. It is also an opportunity for companies to reduce the cost of lead generation and support.
Why employee advocacy is important?
According to recent research, employee advocacy empowers businesses in three ways:
- Because of enhanced brand recognition and good opinions, it has a beneficial influence on growth and sales.
- It has a good effect on “human capital,” or your team, and boosts employee recruitment, retention, and engagement.
- It affects brand reputation and aids in problem resolution.
According to a survey, when an employee shares six pieces of content on LinkedIn, the employer sees big gains. More people trust a regular employee (54%) than a CEO (47%). When employees create a higher degree of brand trust, they create a more positive image for the company. This way, employees also enhance their credibility and position themselves as industry experts.
Essential tips to build an employee advocacy program on social media
1. Make your workplace a happy and engaging place to work.
The Edelman Trust Barometer found that 73 percent of employees expect employers to provide the opportunity to help shape the future of society. To meet employee expectations for social impact, you could – identify your company as an industry disruptor that inspires innovation. Target uses the tagline “work somewhere you love” in its recruiting materials. Develop a high-trust culture and make sure your employees love to come to work.
2. Set goals and KPIs for your employee advocacy program
An employee advocacy campaign should align with at least one of your company’s primary business goals. Don’t get so wrapped up in specific campaigns that you forget about day-to-day employee shares.
3. Identify employee advocacy leaders
The C-suite is frequently the most visible social media presence in multinational corporations. Involve those who are natural social media users in the development of your employee advocacy campaign. Engage people in the development and communication of campaigns and goals, as well as the creation of rewards. They will assist you in determining the types of tools and resources that employees are most likely to use.
4. Establish social media guidelines for employees
A social media strategy for employee advocacy and a style guide remove the guessing out of these questions. Guidelines also aid in the protection of your company’s reputation, as well as the avoidance of legal problems and security dangers.
Involve employees in the decision-making process. Keep in mind that each employee’s degree of comfort with social media will vary. Begin by bringing everyone up to speed on basic social media best practices, as well as corporate policies and procedures. This contributes to the creation of a fair playing field.
5. Create and share valuable resources for employees to post
Employees should be given all of the tools and resources they need to spread the word about your business. Create a broad content library of pre-approved items that your staff can easily distribute with a few clicks or taps.

My "No" List:FUREY: Trudeau's economic statement is all about the Great Reset
My guess is the news coverage about Monday’s economic statement will inform Canadians about the record deficit planned and the extra funding initiatives now on offer courtesy of the feds.
But there’s something else Canadians need to know about the plan that charts the government’s fiscal path for the coming months and even years. And that’s the troubling ideology running through the whole thing.
“Canadians and Canadian businesses can rest assured that for as long as the pandemic lasts, the federal government will provide the support they need,” the statement reads.
This statement isn’t a guidebook on how to help Canadians get out of this historically unprecedented situation as soon as possible and return to normal, which is likely what regular folks were expecting. It’s very much about what sort of economy the Liberals wish to build out of the ashes of the current one.
After all, why would a document that’s supposed to be about seeing us through the pandemic mention the word climate 43 times and green 36 times and have entire sections on green issues?
The introduction explains that: “Key to this stimulus plan will be smart, time-limited investments that can act fast and make a long-run contribution to our future shared prosperity, quality of life, competitiveness and our green transformation.”
Bet you didn’t know that once the lockdowns are lifted, you’re about to be thrust into a “green transformation.”
It continues that: “These measures will help us grow out of the COVID-19 recession, towards an economy that is greener, more innovative, more inclusive and more resilient.” Those last three sound good, but it’s pretty obvious that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is most focused on the first.
These are not footnotes or asides. These are the bread-and-butter statements that explain the guiding principles of the feds’ current plans.
The following is perhaps the most telling line: “When the virus is under control and our economy is ready to absorb it, we will deploy a three-year stimulus package to jumpstart our recovery, worth roughly 3 to 4% of GDP.”
See. When the virus is under control, then the real action starts. It’ll do its thing, but fear not, we’ll help you pay your rent while your workplace is shuttered. Then, once the carnage is over, we have a plan to remake things.
But I think what those downplaying it are trying to say is that it’s a conspiracy to argue there’s a shadowy cabal of Bond villains behind some curtain directly pulling the strings.
What comes to mind when I ponder the Great Reset, though, is exactly what just went down: Our government doesn’t see the urgent need to take our damaged economy and return it to the way it was — which many Canadians were perfectly happy with and eager to get back to — but to use this episode as an opportunity to remake the economy in a way consistent with their longstanding ideology.
Trudeau said it himself back in September: “This pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset.”Tame, condition, and protect your brows with our proprietary blend of high-tech sea minerals. Create smooth healthy brows that are naturally more manageable.

We were there a few months back and during both visits, the restaurant was crowded and the only available seats were by the sidewalk. Jien and I ordered the signature tofu, Guinness pork ribs, butter chicken, stir fried nai pak and salted vegetable tofu soup.
Signature Tofu
Salted vegetable tofu soup
The food did not disappoint – I really enjoyed the salted vegetable soup because Wang Chiew was generous with their ingredients so there was plenty of flavour in this simple soup dish. Almost everyone at the restaurant ordered the signature tofu (it was either this or sizzling tofu) and it went well with rice. A tad on the saltier side I thought, but overall a decent dish.
Guinness pork ribs
Jien’s favourite thing to order here is the pork ribs, which he cites as one of the better ones around. The meat is adequately tender and juicy while the Guinness gravy coating is properly caramelised, so you get that sticky sweet sensation and a very mild Guinness aftertaste.
Butter milk chicken
Could be spicier and richer, in my opinion
I’m on the fence when it comes to the butter chicken as I would have liked it more decadent and spicy. Wang Chiew’s version leans towards the milder side so you’re definitely able to put away more chicken since it’s less cloying.
Deep fried pork knuckle
Star of our meal
On our subsequent visit, we decided to go for a whole deep-fried pork knuckle (RM65 if I’m not mistaken) which we both agreed, was a good move. You get this ultra-crisp exterior with a layer of rendered fat and fork tender meat beneath, served with three different dipping sauces; tangy and spicy. It’s very moreish and I wouldn’t mind having this again.
Fried french beans
Nai pak
Vegetables are tasty at Wang Chiew – both the stir-fried nai pak and French beans we ordered turned out delicious. Perhaps it was the MSG though I didn’t feel that thirsty after my meals. Expect to pay between RM25 to RM40 per head depending on what you order. Reasonable, in my opinion.

Saul ‘Canelo’ Alvarez will move up to cruiserweight to fight Ilunga Makabu for the WBC title in a bid to become a five-weight world champion.
Alvarez’s latest move to cement his legacy as one of the greatest fighters of all time comes less than two weeks after he became the undisputed super-middleweight champion by stopping Caleb Plant in Las Vegas.
“The WBC has approved unanimously Canelo to fight for the WBC cruiserweight championship,” president Mauricio Sulaiman said.
“This is a surprise to me but I’m sure he will continue to make history.”
With just two losses on his 60-fight record, Alvarez is considered by many as pound-for-pound the best fighter in the world, and has already claimed world titles at super-welterweight, middleweight, super-middleweight and light-heavyweight.
Only five men have been quintuple world champions – Americans Floyd Mayweather, Oscar de la Hoya, Ray Charles Leonard and Thomas Hearns, plus the Philippines’ Manny Pacquiao. In the women’s code, America’s Amanda Serrano and Japan’s Naoko Fujioka achieved the feat.
Makabu, 34, is on a nine-fight winning streak since suffering defeat by Tony Bellew at Goodison Park in 2016 and is Africa’s only current world champion.
The DR Congo fighter has held the WBC title since January 2020, and defended it later that year but is yet to fight in 2021.
In comparison, Alvarez completed a remarkable 12 months of action when he knocked out Plant in the eleventh round of their super-middleweight fight this month.
The Mexican kicked off a thrilling period when he stopped then-undefeated world champion Callum Smith in December 2020. Alvarez was back in the ring in February to see off mandatory challenger Avni Yildirim in three rounds before stripping another unbeaten world champion Billy Joe Saunders of his WBO title in May.
Alvarez, 31, had moved back down to super-middleweight after successfully jumping up to light-heavyweight in 2019 when he knocked out Sergey Kovalev to win the WBO title.
Cruiserweight is the final weight class before heavyweight. The division houses the likes of British duo Richard Riakporhe and WBO belt holder Lawrence Okolie, while Latvia’s Mairis Briedis holds the IBF and Ring magazine belts and Frenchman Arsen Goulamirian is the WBA (Super) champion.
Okolie (17-0) was clearly frustrated by the news of Alvarez’s move to cruiserweight as the undefeated Briton works to secure a unification fight in 2022.
“That’s another belt I can’t unify now,” he said on Twitter.
“Madly enough I think he will actually win and go back down in weight. So I can go back to being a fan.”
He added: “Don’t blame me when you see me box [a] YouTuber next.”Horror

Engineer Simon Smith of Smith and Wallwork had worked with architecture students at the University of Cambridge to design and build a footbridge across a land drain in the wood. They used a locally over-abundant source - willow, which nobody seems interested in coppicing any more.
The extraordinary thing about willow is its fertility. Cut it down, stick the end in the ground, and it starts to grow. This has been known for centuries and willow has been used for 'living' shelters and even for growing pieces of furniture - an approach that requires considerable patience. What Smith and his students were doing though was designing a footbridge that the public could use, and so was safe and could carry loads.
It was a tough job. We may have visited in the sunshine, but the hard work was done in winter, when the willow is least likely to be damaged by coppicing.
Having calculated the loads, and designed and constructed a simple arched structure, they then 'wove' a deck from slimmer willow. This was both to provide a walking surface and to prevent the arch elements sliding past each other. It was, admitted Smith, hard work, requiring strong forearms and a specially designed tool. One of the interesting things about projects like this is that volunteers will undertake work freely that most paid workers would refuse to do.
Health and safety required both the addition of a willow handrail, and the addition of a softwood deck to prevent people slipping. Sadly both in some way compromise the initial simplicity of the design.
The bridge is sprouting impressively.
The next challenge will be renewal of the woven deck. Since this is not rooted it will eventually rot. Smith is trying to weave in the new shoots, but this may prove too difficult.
So this is not a perfect solution, but it is a great research project - lots of learning, and vision of new potential for a neglected material. It is great to know as well that a love of learning will galvanize people to undertake arduous work in demanding conditions. And there are even poppies growing on tbe bridge to lift the heart a little further.Identifying snake is

important for treatment
To the editor:
I live next to the Meadows on Edgewood Drive and my husband tries to keep our yard mowed between the showers every week. I thought I would help him make things look neat in the backyard before it started raining again.
As he mowed, I began to pull some grass from inside of the shadow box fence where you can't weed-eat. He finished mowing and as he was coming through the gate I got bit. I started screaming that a snake had bit me on the finger and he needed to take me to the hospital. Dancing around the yard holding my finger and screaming at the top of my lungs, I thought I would have to run up the hill to the hospital by myself and be dead when I got there. He calmly got the metal handled broom off the porch, killed the snake, put it in a plastic jar and told me to get in the truck. When we arrived, I found out just how important the snake's presence was to the doctors. They quickly identified it as a copperhead.
Who would have thought that a poisonous snake would be in a freshly cut yard! I would like to remind people that with this hot and rainy weather snakes are on the move to higher ground even in the city. If a person gets bit then getting the snake to the hospital is extremely important. I learned that people do have some time before they have to take the anti-venom if needed.
The doctors at D.W. McMillan are very aware of how to identify snakes and treat the bitten patient. The doctors and staff took good care of me and I was truly lucky thanks to them. They took a very conservative treatment approach, of which I was thankful because the anti-venom has side effects and you don't want to use it unless it is necessary.
I experienced just another example of why Brewton was designated one of the best 100 small towns to live in even though it has snakes. Also, my husband is definitely a keeper!

I’ve been just existing. I know it’s not good! I saw something today though...and it opened my eyes.
I am going to blame some of my issues are centered around work. Work has been horrible. As in dreaming and nightmare inducing horrible! Yes it’s infringing upon my sleep. Many nights I wake up from dreams about this job. And it’s not good.
I have also been wondering about the fact that EVERY Friday night I have been wide awake most of the night, unable to sleep. I have wondered if it was what I’m eating on Friday nights. I have pondered the fact that on occasion I drink a soda on Friday nights. But I think I have figured it out. It’s none of the above. It is the fact that I am so emotionally whipped at the end of the work week that my mind can’t relax. I was off work today...on a Friday and I was curious about what my sleep would bring...and last night...Thursday night I was awake most of the night...with my mind racing...and dreaming about work. ~sigh~
food wise. I’m not actually doing too horrible. When I do track I find that my food is right around 1500 calories. Not bad. My weight is staying in a 2-3 pound range. And I want the weight gone!!!
I was off work today. It worked out well because I was able to spend an hour or two with my good friends who were traveling through the area! It was a blessing!
Before I met up with my friends, I ran some errands. I was leaving one of the stores and saw a lady laboriously getting out of a truck. She was huge. She was probably my age..or younger. She was struggling to walk. Her partner walked slow but still outpaced her pretty quickly. And my heart stopped. That is going to be me if I don’t clean up my act I’m not going in the right direction. And let’s face it....maintaining at 250 pounds (ok I rounded up...it’s 246-248 most days) is not healthy either. Sure I’m happy with a maintain...but pathing about that weight is healthy.
I am killing myself by my current apathy. Sure, I’m not actively taking a gun to my head...but I am nonetheless killing myself with my actions.
this has to change!With more and more hybrid and electric vehicles appearing on the market, including a new Ford 150 pickup, is it time that we invest in some green parking initiatives?
I know that there is a camp that would rather see people do away with cars and trucks altogether and bike/walk everywhere (active transportation) but for the rest of us, prepared to embrace a compromise to help the planet wean off of fossil fuels, the hybrid or electric vehicle is an attractive option. Thanks largely to the pandemic, demand for gasoline has plummeted and we’ve enjoyed deep discounts at the pumps. Many jest that since Covid, they get 2 weeks to the gallon. But I’m not going to argue the merits of going completely green in vehicle choices because I would not be authentic.
When I was commuting to Toronto daily for a year, I traded in my big SUV for a plug in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) and saved big time – not just the planet but in my wallet.
Since I resumed working more locally a couple years ago, I’m back to my V8 sports car and a little 4 cyclinder SUV for the winter months. In short I’m able to see this issue from all sides. While driving my PHEV, I enjoyed access to commuter lanes, premium parking spots while shopping, virtually free driving around town and in the city and got to know all the charging stations where I could stop, shop and charge up.
As Midland puts together the downtown core and turns its attention to our new parking system, would it make sense to install a couple EV charging stations and track their usage? It could be free or operated simply on cost recovery and not only encourage people to drop downtown for some “juice” and a shop but also to show visitors that among naturalizing our parks for pollinators, we offer green initiatives and climate friendly policies. I’d like to see recycling added to our core services as well, but that’s the subject of another discussion.
What are your thoughts? EV stations in a couple lots for a year or two and judge their usage to see if expansion of the initiative is warranted? Or is this just a fad for big cities and we should let this band wagon pass us by?
Check the usage of the one at Timmies. I have yet to see a car charging there. Get some stats then ask the question again/
Me neither but I’m talking about locations like downtown or sports centre that sees for more activity for the durations needed to get a charge. Parking there and hoofing it to and from Walmart with stuff is impractical and a quick coffee won’t do anything meaningful to your battery status.
Charging stations are a great idea not only downtown but possibly at the rec centre, little lake and other visited park/lake areas. But they need to be cost effective. Charge maybe 10% over hydro costs to recoup energy cost place the initial cost of the machines.The plaintiff shipped 10 laptop computers with Air Canada from Canada to Nigeria.

Episode 6: Our Global Impact
Episode 6: Our Global Impact
Summary
On today’s episode, we’ll be talking about our Global Experience programs and the impact the work is having on our Centennial community and around the world. We’ll also talk about what’s in store for Global Experience at Centennial College.
Our episode host, Jocelyn Babudri, will be talking to faculty member, Rachel Larabee, Success Advisor, Jenita Shah, and Director, International Education - Services and Global Experience, Laura Wood.
Disclaimer
The videos and podcasts were recorded when our campuses were open, prior to March 2020. Centennial College has transitioned to offering academic and co-curricular programs online. We value opportunities to engage with our students to support their learning and professional goals. For all Global experience programs, SaGE will offer Virtual Global Experience programming in the Fall 2020 and Winter 2021 semesters until travel advisories have been lifted and the Canadian government has deemed travel for education is safe. Students can still take part in fulfilling opportunities such as studying virtually with one of Centennial’s international exchange partners, participating in an applied research project with a partner in Morocco, or completing a virtual internship with agencies in Costa Rica and China.
Pearl Vas: Welcome to season four of the Centennial College Podcast: Through A Global Lens. In this season, the International Education, Services and Global Experience team or SaGE, explores topics that affect international students and internationally-minded students, staff and faculty. Whether you've traveled a long way to study at Centennial or you're considering traveling abroad, this podcast is for you. Today's host is Jocelyn Babudri.
Jocelyn Babudri: Hello, and welcome to Through A Global Lens. I'm your host, Jocelyn Babudri. On today's episode, we're going to be talking about a few of our Global Experience programs and the lasting impact their work is having both on our Centennial College community and in the destination communities. We're also going to talk about what's in store for Global Experience in the future. We are very lucky to have two fabulous panelists today, Jenita Shah and Rachel Larabee to share with us what they do.
Jenita Shah: Hello everyone, my name is Jenita Shah, and I'm the success advisor at school of engineering technology and applied science, the author of Global Citizenship Equity Learning Experience that happens in Rapar, Gujarat India.
Rachel Larabee: Hi everyone. Thanks for having me. My name is Rachel Larabee. I coordinate the community development work program at Centennial and I also guide students on a Faculty-Led International Program, otherwise known as a FLIP to the Dominican Republic in the Puerto Plata region where we study community economic development in action.
Jocelyn Babudri: Thank you so much both for being here. It's an honor to have such ambassadors for Global Experience here today to share with our extended college community, the real deep and meaningful impact that we're having in these local communities and the relationships that we've been able to build over the past four years in both Porto Plata and in Rapar, India. So, just to get started, maybe Rachel, can you tell our listeners a little bit more about what your Global Experience program is all about?
Rachel Larabee: Yeah, absolutely. This FLIP, Faculty-Led International Program takes place in Puerto Plata and it's situated within a course, it's a second semester course in community development work all around community economic development. So how do we focus on engaging people in their own community in ways that can empower themselves economically? So, we traveled down to Puerto Plata and we meet the stakeholders and the community members who are involved in a regional Community Economic Development program. So there's about 14 regions that form something called a Community-Based Tourism Network. It's really interesting because we've been tracking this program for about 10 years now.
Rachel Larabee: It's fascinating to see how the community develops, so every year we take students, they're a little bit further along in their development process, and of course they're influenced by what's happening in the globe and the rest of the world. It's amazing, it's just amazing to see the different stakeholders pull together. Our partner down there is the president of this network and this whole movement was spawned by, probably everybody has heard of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. So, Puerto Plata used to be the heart of traditional sun and sand resort tourism, and with the birth of Punta Cana on the opposite end of the Island, Puerto Plata saw it's tourism business, I guess, or field industry go from a million visitors a year to about 30,000 visitors.
Rachel Larabee: So imagine the economic impact that had, it was devastating for the urban communities, but also the rural communities. So we've started to see people having to leave the land of their ancestors that they've shared for generations and generations to migrate to urban centres to find a better way of life. So, what's happening now is this community-based tourism has formed a way to rejuvenate their tourism industry by both revitalizing their traditional resort tourism, but also engaging and initiating this process of community-based tourism, which is an alternative to an all inclusive. So it encourages people to get off the resorts and to travel into rural communities and see all of the assets that they have there.
Rachel Larabee: So, it's really asset-based community development, and so you can plot your journey where you want to go and you see all generations of people in these rural communities, all of a sudden realizing, "Wow, we have these amazing things in our community that people want to visit." So, seeing everyone get involved in that and seeing it evolve is really what the students take part in.
Jocelyn Babudri: So when you mention about community-based tourism, can you describe a couple of things or projects that our students have been able to work on in Puerto Plata?
Rachel Larabee: Yeah, yeah, for sure. So the methodology is broken down into three parts and we fill in the details as we go. So the first part is to go there and analyze, to put on the lens of both tourists, but also a community development worker looking specifically for things that happen to empower community economic development. So, we start by looking at traditional tourism and then we travel into the rural communities and look at the alternatives, the community-based tourism, and each day we debrief those experiences, and that brings us into our second phase where we assess.
Rachel Larabee: So, analyze, assess, and then create, create or evaluate after students have taken in the experiences, had some presentations and lectures from key stakeholders, met the community members themselves, there's some kind of either evaluation process or a creation process. So for example, one year we did a SWOT analysis and offered our feedback to the community on what the experiences were like, another year we worked with a cruise ship who was focused on social responsibility. So people who are visiting the location, but want to get in to the rural areas to take part in a meaningful experience that works with communities in their own development.
Rachel Larabee: Then this year we're actually engaging in a design process, so the students are going to, like I said, analyze and assess what's going on and then design a community-based experience in the area where we're staying, and they'll have some of those key stakeholders in the conversation, almost like a think tank and give them feedback like, "Yeah, this is a really great idea, this could take off, we're going to talk to the community members and see what they think, or this wouldn't work, and here's why." So students will be able to learn the viability of their own ideas and also create our think of some ideas that the community members might be interested in implementing as they continue to go along.
Jocelyn Babudri: What's amazing to me to hear about the development of your FLIP and the progress that you've been making, starting from analysis, and now you're building towards a complete design project, but why you've been able to do that is because you've been building trust with the community in Puerto Plata over these years. Can you talk a little bit about those relationships and why they're so important to the continued success of this project?
Rachel Larabee: That is the skeleton, the bare bones of community development work, really nothing happens without relationship building. So, I'm really proud to work at an institution that has committed and invested in a project like this for almost 10 years now, maybe a little bit ... Yeah it's 10 years exactly, the first GCELE was in 2010 and here we are in 2020. So, really the community values, Centennial College, Centennial College is a name that they talk about. It's only because of those relationships over time that they do trust us, and they know that there's integrity and that this is a learning process, this isn't a Mickey Mouse act of feel good, go home and bring some donations and think that ...
Rachel Larabee: It's not patronizing to the community at all, it's really collaborative, and it's only because of those relationships that he would even give us the opportunity to do a design project like this. So at first it was evaluation and they really valued our feedback we presented. On our second year, we went down, we presented the feedback from that SWOT analysis to the director of the chambers of commerce in Puerto Plata. It was really official, like they had everything set up. It was like a UN delegation, all the students had their own glass of water with a portfolio to look at, and it was all recorded and the feedback was presented.
Rachel Larabee: It's really official, and students feel important and they often say, "You Know I really didn't get exactly what community development was until we came here." It's one thing to be in the classroom and read about it and look at case studies, but to see it happening and to talk to the people from all different levels of society and see how they're collaborating and working together, to see the children involved, the elders involved, it's really powerful, and so students come back and they're like, "Okay, I get it now." Sometimes they say, "I know what I want to do within this career field now as well." So those are really special moments when we hear that.
Jocelyn Babudri: Wow.
Jenita Shah: Wow.
Jocelyn Babudri: That's amazing. Yeah. We had the same reaction there, Jenita, "Wow."
Rachel Larabee: Impactful.
Jocelyn Babudri: For sure. It's interesting that we're talking about these relationships and the power of that, because that's really how your project started, there was a Centennial connection. Can you share a little bit about how that all got started and what types of things have you been working on these past four years in Rapar, India?
Jenita Shah: My journey about being an author from India started from my trip to Jamaica on a Global Citizenship Equity Learning Experience. That two weeks in 2012 made a huge impact on my life, because at some point you get so busy with your own life, school work, family, social responsibility that you don't realize that you need to take that time off your routine and see the world outside your cube. When you try to explore the world outside that cube, you realize there is so much potential of building a community, holding hands, being the change that you want to see in the world, because you always think you grew up with a lot of changes happening around you, but you never self consciously think about it. Like, "Is this true?" Like, "Can it make the significant impact?"
Jenita Shah: But when I went for Jamaica, I felt it, it's not about just building a school, but it's building that hope, building those relationship, building that little bit of brightness in the darkness that we all live in. That little work, that little five hours of your life that you contribute to a community makes a huge impact to a community, which is even broader than your thought process. So, when I came back, I vent into my childhood and in my childhood, I used to be part of the stage drama. So in India, there's a lot of literacy issues all across India. India is definitely growing economically, but there are still that parts and parcels of India, which needs a significant change, and that change you don't see it when it comes to Bollywood, you don't see it when you talk about Mumbai and Bangalore, but you see it when you go into the rural part of India.
Jenita Shah: While growing up, my parents always used to volunteer me to be part of those little stage dramas that have social messages attached to it, and I would be like little that tap talking about saving water. I would be the little girl crying to go to school, and at that point I thought it was just a joke. For me, it was like, "Oh, I get to travel. I get to skip school." I never realized that, and when I came back from Jamaica, I'm like, "There was a reason why my parents involved me in such activities." That's when like another there was a rebirth. You know what? I started it, but I lost it somewhere while growing up, too busy and makeup in high school. I went back to the people that I used to work as a child volunteer and see what's happening. That point they told me about the project happening in Rapar.
Jenita Shah: The Rapar is located in Gujarat, bordering Pakistan, but it's also desert area. So it's considered as waggered meaning there's no livelihood. So people don't get their daughters married there, people don't like to go in that community because they see no future. So, years ago when that place was considered as just a wagger mean, good for nothing, they came up with a system called exchange marriages, barter of girls. That system over the years has evolved to an extent where girls have no place to go, but have to be part of that social barter exchange of marriages.
Jenita Shah: I found it very interesting because this project talks a lot about women empowerment, the socioeconomic factors that women get impacted by, the importance of education, and that's when I thought about project Rapar and I started writing it, it's a lot to show the difference between the rural India versus the urban life in Toronto. The difference between being privileged and being not privileged, women domestic violence, inequalities all across the world, it's probably happening next to us, but we never have the lens to view it or to understand it.
Jenita Shah: So, my project talks about more connecting students to being global advocates of women empowerment and understanding the role of women in the society from a global standpoint of view, not just because they went to India, but just connecting it with their experience in India versus how they look at it in Canada. So, in my trip, we go to Rapar for two weeks, the student work with the local community, we are working to build a safe space, or we call it a shelter home in Toronto, of women affected by domestic violence, women sexually abused, or women who just want to get out of this circle of life that they have been attached to unwillingly, and they see no hope like because they don't see that they can be economically responsible for themselves or their children.
Jenita Shah: So, this is a place where they come, they can be who they are, we have activities that goes on for every day. We do organic farming, we do life skills, which talks about women empowerment and self-sustainability just from being a farmer to being a woman who can sew their own clothes. So, from past two years, we started actually, it started in 2012 and I initially wrote it, and then international loved the project, the GCELE team, the global citizenship, and then one of the managers of India recruitment Mark Coote came to analyze the whole project, and it started in 2014.
Jenita Shah: We started with the land that was barren donated to us, which was one acre, had bushes all over it. So our first trip was basically cutting down the cactus, the bushes, layering the land and starting with the little office, which is one bedroom, though today we have a working office, two libraries and four residential buildings, like four residential apartments, and it's all because our first students hard work we started and they finished it.
Jocelyn Babudri: Wow. Jenita, you've certainly painted a lovely picture of the kinds of lasting impact that we've been able to create in Rapar, India. Can you share a little bit about the impact that this project which has been going on for about four years now has had on the Centennial College community, students, faculty, and staff?
Jenita Shah: So I recollect two impactful stories, which has always touched my heart. One is from a recent trip in 2019, there was a student, and when he came to India, we all have our own little expectation and mindset of how India would be, or how Rapar would be, talking about domestic violence here, talking about impact of education. Doesn't actually make any sense to students, they think, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." It's just about how they show it. You know how will Slumdog Millionaire movie is, but when they go to India, when they talk to these people who have been empowered, when they talk to kids who come and they show them projects that they have done without even attending school, is when they realize that the world is not what they thought it is. Education is necessary, but education is just a part of life, but there's so much social development that comes through the community.
Jenita Shah: So, what this student did before leaving India, he made a promise to all the kids, to send them books every year, to send them stationary supplies and get a letter saying how much they have educated themselves in that year. So, because we provide education, which is outside of school profile because they are different age kids, they are basically kids of the labourers or saltpan workers, we bring them and we train them at least to attain a high school diploma. So, they can be eight years old, they can be 15 years old, they can be 14 years old, but we provide this open learning as we call it adult learning in Toronto, and based on that, we prep them to do a high school exam.
Jenita Shah: We have about 35 students right now, and all of those 35 students, at least five of them who now can write pretty well and connect with the student, and he comes and tells me, "You know what? One of the student's name in India is Hiroh. He's like, "Hiroh told me he did this." I was surprised when he told me that Hiroh made his own bicycle headlight after Shah giving him some directions and YouTube videos on how ... do your own, DIY, I think, sorry, I'm not that YouTube person.
Jocelyn Babudri: DIY bike light.
Jenita Shah: Yeah, and he showed a picture.
Jocelyn Babudri: Wow.
Jenita Shah: This was pure self learning, and just the sharing of a YouTube video. I think hat's impactful. The other story that is always in my heart is of late Mark Koot, he was the manager of International South Asian region. He was part of the first two trip of GCELE. He's the one who encouraged me to write this GCELE after he visited India. When he got diagnosed with cancer, he called me, and he's like, "Hey, I need to talk to you." I went, and to my surprise, he told me that he would like to donate a certain percentage of his asset to Rapar to build a school because he sees a significant impact that the school would make and how this trip had impacted him, and how he visions education like lifelong learning and the life of this woman and children in Rapar.
Jenita Shah: So we have a centre called Learning Centre, it's SRT learning and experiential science centre, which is ... thanks to Mark. We have Centennial alumni, Carleton University alumni, a McMaster student funding the operational of the school. So, the two alumni of Centennial, one was part of the trip to Cuba. He was part of GCELE to Cuba. The other was part of the equity learning experience in Peru, and they didn't just want to leave the experience there, they wanted to make a change. So they all decided to donate $100 every month to the school, and now we have about 10 students giving their earning every month to educate this kids in India.
Jocelyn Babudri: What an incredible legacy, and what a great way to honor Mark Koot's memory is to continue to invest in that community and see them invest in themselves, and everyone soon in Rapar is going to be building their own bike lights.
Jenita Shah: It's impressive when you see, and we also started a workshop of woman where we have started making table mats. Then we have also made scarves and we will be soon bringing it here. That's part of the women empowerment program that we have started in Rapar.
Jocelyn Babudri: Keep us warm.
Jenita Shah: Yes.
Jocelyn Babudri: And I know Rachel, you have some impactful stories over the years. We've probably sent about 40 to 50 students from community development on the faculty, that international program, but we also do placements, field placements there and over an extended period of time, two to three months, do any stories come to mind?
Rachel Larabee: Although I have a bunch of questions for Jenita now. So fascinating, there's stories from students. I mean, it truly does define transformative education. When you have these experiences, like you said, stepping out of your box, your cube and realizing like, "Oh my God, there's this whole other world and this whole different way of doing things." My experiences of being in the Dominican Republic completely transformed the idea of poverty for me. I realized that poverty is not just an economic thing, right? You could have all of your material needs met and still have a poverty of the heart, you could have a poverty of the spirit, and which one is worse, right? I'll let you think about that for yourself.
Rachel Larabee: But I think exposing students to different ways of life and different lifestyles where the material things that are just a part of our everyday life are not present, and yet there's this joy in this community and this vibrancy in their lives, it brings hope. Right? I hear that in your story too, Jenita, there's so much hope that happens when you can get out of that narrow view of the routine, the mundane of our everyday lives. So I see students like light up with this hope like, "Oh my gosh, when I get back home, I'm going to look at my community differently, I'm going to look at my presence in this classroom differently, I'm going to look at my teachers differently."
Rachel Larabee: It's really cool, I've been able to bring two different colleagues specifically on this FLIP trip, but also when it began as a GCELE, as a Global Citizenship and Equity Learning Experience, which is a mouthful, it's easier to say these acronyms, but at the time the vice associate academic came down, the registrar came down and another chair at the school of business. So all of these people also are impacted by this. They go down and they experience new place, they experience how this thing, community development work can evolve. It gives them a little bit of inspiration on how they're going to do their work when they come back to Canada differently, it helps them think about their own communities, both here locally in the GTA, Centennial, or the communities where they live.
Rachel Larabee: But also like we have such a diverse population of staff here at the college, it inspires them to think differently about their communities back home as well, which is what I hear you saying you went to Jamaica, but then you thought of these incredible experiences you had as a child that you didn't realize at the time. But then that made all these connections, which I think is like every parent's dream to know that that time you invested in bringing your child, which is so meaningful, probably for your parents later on as an adult, you put all the pieces together and now look at the work you're doing. It's incredible.
Jenita Shah: Exactly. Adding to Rachel's point, the students have this relationships with the community partners even after they come back from the trip. You are amazed when you go back to the community to hear that they have been in touch with what's happening in Canada. I think it's building relationships. I think the purpose of Rachel and I is, we don't want to make a change overnight, but we are just here building that bridge that will eventually lead to the change that we all are hoping for. Were just holding hands and just hoping that this hands connect to eventually be a chain of thought process, which trains them to see the world that we all want to see being a global citizen at the end of the day.
Rachel Larabee: I think that is so important to understand that it's a process.
Jenita Shah: It's a process.
Rachel Larabee: There's no way you could have that impact in a one, two week trip, right? There has to be those relationships built so that when you come back to Canada, stuff is happening-
Jenita Shah: Happening, the footprint are still there.
Rachel Larabee: ... on the ground. One of the things we do because there's academic outcomes attached to the FLIP, students have to create this presentation of their learning journey in the class when they come back. We're connected with, I'm going to use an acronym again, GCEI, the centre for global citizenship education and inclusion. We connect with the office there, and they're really promoting this thing called globally networked learning, where they bring in people from all over the world into the classroom.
Rachel Larabee: So when students do these presentations on what they understand now, that Community Economic Development is as a result of having gone to Puerto Plata and experiencing it, we bring the stakeholders into the classroom via satellite, via Skype or WhatsApp video or whatever works really. It's like whatever method work we bring them in. They're down in the field doing the work every day. So, as you can imagine, development is a very slow process. You're not only like changing economic or social outcomes, but you're changing minds, you're changing culture. Those things don't happen overnight.
Rachel Larabee: So, one of the most powerful feedback we received after our stakeholder via satellite, watch these students presentations because they infuse the theory into it. He's just doing it. They're just doing it, they're not studying it, they're just doing it. They know there's a need, it's their neighbors, so they do the work. But to see the theory mixed with the practice together in this presentation by the students, he said, "Wow, li sometimes I don't know if what I'm doing has any impact and to see you all present it with images and video of our community and what we're doing, I feel totally rejuvenated in my mission to keep doing this work." Because a lot of it is volunteer work. Right? You do it because you care about people and you're addressing a need.
Rachel Larabee: So sometimes you wonder if it's in vain, but then for our stakeholders to see how it has impacted students and how they've taken that experience and situated it within their career development field, it makes the stakeholders, or what they shared was that, all of a sudden I see this renewed value in the work that I do. So, I might think it's frustrating and it's not working and it's taking so long and what is this worth, but then to see it come together in that package in the student presentation gives them hope too, right? It's like some little, some gasoline to keep the car moving. That at the end of the day is what we want to do, what I hear you saying, just keep the car moving, just keep it going because new generations will get involved and it'll keep sustaining.
Jenita Shah: I think it's not about the materialistic satisfaction you get, but it's just that you don't realize, but when just a hug makes a huge difference in your life, like smile is just when you see that smile, it's like you have attained all the things you have ever dreamed of, and that's students when they come and say like, "Thank you. I never knew it was like this, or I never felt like this." Those little words, they sound small, but when they touch your heart, it's a feeling that I think you will never feel no matter how rich you are, but you will never feel that content that you feel when you see those students coming to you and saying, "I'm blessed to be part of such an experience."
Jenita Shah: At the end of the day, we thank Centennial for giving us opportunity to write projects like this and thanks to our student and our leads for helping us execute this. Because it's not a small thing to go across the world and take 15 students. No, it's a huge planning process, commitment that goes into it, a lot of academic, the global outcomes that goes into it and putting all of this thing together, it's a huge teamwork. I think we would also like to thank everybody who has helped us over the years planning and putting these pieces together because we just write it, but there's a team that helps us execute it. So, I think it's a learning experience all across Centennial.
Jocelyn Babudri: We certainly want to thank you because without your leadership, without your inspiration and your continued commitment, which is the most impressive, your continued efforts to do more with that one partner or to find ways to allow our community to contribute to the ongoing success that you have in both of these destinations. You've clearly given us a lot of hope. I think sometimes when we're faced with these global challenges, us global citizens can be really overwhelming, how am I just one person going to make a positive change on the world when there's so much I feel so helpless, but what you have shown through your work in these communities and with these partners is lasting change as possible.
Jocelyn Babudri: There is hope, and the impact is deep. It's deep, it extends far beyond just like you said, Jenita, just a material impact. It can change people's lives in ways they expect or don't expect. So, it's been a real honor to hear you share these kinds of stories. I'm curious, maybe Jenita, you could share with us. What's next. So as we're talking about the future, where does the future of your project take you? It's coming up in October, what's going to happen?
Jenita Shah: Yeah, it's our fourth GCELE happening in October at Rapar India, and this time we're going to work to create a clinic, in our clinic, we are planning to have a psychologist on campus and also a nurse. So in case of extreme emergencies, we are not running around to find resources because it's a rural area, and a lot of things are not easy to get. The hospitals are like a 100 kilometers away. That's our next target. So we want to make it a one shop stop, maybe we can assist, make that little difference, and we can give them a hope of having a better future. But at the same time, professor Hemmer who was part of our trip last year is doing a research project on the dropout ratio of girls from the age of four to 14 in this part of India and the impact of the dropout and the social economic factors that has resulted in the high girl dropout.
Jocelyn Babudri: Wow, that's fantastic, and she participated in the GCELE to India last year and she's taken that on. Wow.
Jenita Shah: She was really moved by the project and she was always pushing to do something outside the GCELE to keep the legacy, to share the experience on another level, and she was approached for a research and she got approved.
Jocelyn Babudri: That's fantastic. Wow. And Rachel, you've mentioned about the next level is the design project, but maybe you can speak to some, I know you're thinking two, three years ahead in the future always, maybe you can share some of that with us.
Rachel Larabee: Yeah. I'm really excited. So we have the FLIPs that we take students to, but we also have an opportunity for students in the community development work program to do their final semester as an international placement. So, last year we had three students placed in the same area that we work with. Two of them are community development work students, and one of them was a Social Service Work student. So, we started doing some research last year as well, and so we started a participatory action research project that the students implemented and upon the request of the president of the Community-Based Tourism Network, who noticed that as I mentioned, a lot of young people, and I'm sure this is a global thing, a lot of young people leave rural communities to migrate to urban centres for better opportunities, whether it's better education or employment.
Rachel Larabee: So, students actually stayed for one month, they stayed in the home of a community development worker in an urban centre. It was one of the poorest barrios in Puerto Plata. So they literally got to experience barrio life. While they were there, they did a census of all the community members. There was over a 100 interviews that this student did and just ask them, "How long have you lived in this community? Where did you come from? What are your reasons for leaving that place? What were you hoping to experience when you came down to the city? Have you experienced it? What are some of the challenges you now experience?" The overwhelming response was that a lot of these people came from rural communities seeking a better way of life and then got, for lack of a better word, somewhat trapped in an urban barrio where poverty had a different face, and it was a lot more intense, and it was a lot more crowded, and some of the social determinants of health were a lot more challenged.
Rachel Larabee: So the research became the study of what happens when young people leave rural communities to migrate to urban centres, do they always achieve that dream of a better opportunity or what some of the outcomes where there is greater rates of diabetes, greater rates of mental health issues, to the furthest extreme suicide, depression, anxiety, teen pregnancies, drug addiction. So just so many more things to throw you off track. It doesn't always have to be that way, but this is what the research showed.
Rachel Larabee: So, then students spent their last month in the rural community where our partner is, and then talking to young people up there, "What do you want to do after you graduate from high school? Where do you want to go to school?" And overwhelming, "I want to get out of this community, I want to go to this city, I want to go to that city, I want to go to this country because everywhere else seems like a better place."
Jenita Shah: Yeah, and it's economic drive that drives them to take such decision, whether it be India or the place Rachel works for, it's the same, it's all about where they can see themselves having a better living, but they don't see the other side of it and the sacrifices that they end up doing, which doesn't hit them later.
Rachel Larabee: So now, as a result of that research, we're working with the community on how do we get young people in that rural community excited about where they are, what are some of the assets? So in the Yasica Arriba, which is the rural community we work in, they have a really important river, and that river brings the water down the mountain and provides water to the whole city of Puerto Plata. So, conserving that river is a really important job, but also it has the potential to be an incredible tourist attraction, and these young people can become the guides and the designers of these experiences.
Rachel Larabee: So, now we're working on developing a youth development centre, can be a training facility of young people to become educated on their local assets and then employment opportunities to become guides and small business owners, et cetera, to, again, bring hope back to that region because what ends up happening when young people leave is all the elderly people are left in these rural environments without support of their family. So just trying to change those intergenerational dynamics that people stay on this beautiful land, where they live with fresh air and clean water and rivers to swim in and connection to nature, it really touches on all three elements of sustainability, it's environmental, it's social and it's economic.
Rachel Larabee: So, getting young people involved in that, and I'm really excited that this community is going to be the focus of our next year's global capstone project, because in order for us to achieve this, we need to bring in more skillsets than community development work. So, we'll be partnering with the sustainable tourism program and the school of business to have students working on creating design and support systems for these young people to have a centre. So those are some of the benefits to the Yasica Arriba community, but for students in all three programs, again, these students get to have real world experience implementing the skills they're learning in the classroom in a global atmosphere, which improves their resume when they graduate, because they can say, "I worked on this project. I have global experience skills, which is one of the most employable skills you can have. I have critical analysis skills, which is one of the most important skills employers are looking for today."
Rachel Larabee: So, not only does it benefit the development and the whole happening for young people in that rural community, but it also leverages a strong portfolio for our graduates moving forward, looking for meaningful work to do in the world.
Jenita Shah: I think the most important thing it teaches is resilient, very important. Inclusion and definition is one thing, but an inclusion and feeling is different, I think, and that's another big factor that we teach our graduates to have, is resilience and inclusion.
Jocelyn Babudri: You've certainly both given us a great example of the kinds of deep and meaningful work that's being done every day at the college, but that also illustrates where we're trying to go as SaGE and what our future looks like is we are looking at ways about how do we maximize or optimize the relationship that we've already built there instead of it just being a one of, "Okay, we'll go for two weeks and donate some supplies." That's not the direction we're going because of the examples that you've led, you've really, really demonstrated the lasting benefits and positive change that can happen when you continue that partnership and you deepen those relationships, and that's certainly where we're going, but also we're not just looking out anymore, we're really starting to look inside Canada as well, and we're looking at creating more indigenous programs in the future as well.
Jocelyn Babudri: Something we've also been exploring too, is how do we use technology to really continue these relationships and these partners. So something we're exploring is virtual internships. Technology allows us to really keep that personal contact without actually traveling. When it's interesting that you're already using that, Rachel, with hosting your partner on Skype and allowing them to be part of that final learning outcome without actually physically being there. So, really technology has the power to really keep us connected in this world.
Rachel Larabee: I'm also exploring right now with Laura and faculty member from the school of engineering and Nimo Kaur who has a strong relationship to educational empowerment in Pakistan, and so we're starting to create a project where it's a virtual internship, where a student can work with educational leaders in the area because something like 60% of kids in Pakistan never at formal schooling. Then even the schooling that's there because a lot of it is private, depending on the institution can be a little questionable in terms of what students are getting for or what they're paying for, and this is what Kaur tells us from his travels there.
Rachel Larabee: So we're creating this internship where students won't have to go to Pakistan, they can virtually meet and interact and collaborate with the educators down there and pedagogically support them and empowering a more dynamic educational facilitation. That's in the dream process right now.
Jocelyn Babudri: Wow, you've given us a lot of food for thought today. It's been an inspiring conversation, but there's still also lots for us to learn and think about, and there is an ever-changing landscape of internationalization and student mobility, and I think Centennial is on the forefront of that. So there's some definitely some exciting things in our future. That brings us to the end of our episode today. I would really like to thank Jenita Shah and Rachel Larabee for sharing this time with us and for talking so passionately about your projects in India and the Dominican Republic.
Jocelyn Babudri: We are so excited at SaGE about the next phase of our global experience programs and also about what's next for you in these individual projects. So, thank you both so much for being here.
Jenita Shah: Thank you for inviting and keep inspiring us to do this amazing work, and keep supporting us. So then we can come up with even better ideas, make SaGE a global platform.
Rachel Larabee: I 100% agree, and one of the things I enjoy so much of working with you and your team is how collaborative the process is, and it's just amazing to work on these great ideas, but then to actualize them and to work with a really professional team of people who care about the integrity of actualizing it and sustaining it. So, thank you. Thank you, Pearl. Thank you, Laura. Thank you, Marla. Your whole team is fabulous.
Jocelyn Babudri: Oh, that's so sweet. Thank you so much.
Jenita Shah: Thank you for dealing with all our tantrums while planning the trip. It's like, "Okay, last minute change." But your spirit keeps us going. We can deal with all because our vision is the same, we all want to see the change. Thank you very much.
Jocelyn Babudri: No, no, no. Thank you. So we've been talking today about our global impact and this episode wouldn't really be complete without a few words of inspiration and wisdom from our director, Laura Wood on the future of Global Experience. Hi, Laura, welcome.
Laura Wood: Hey Jocelyn. Thank you for having me today.
Jocelyn Babudri: So, Laura, we've really started to grow our indigenous programs at the college, and I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit more about that, and where we're headed?
Laura Wood: Well, we've always dabbled in with indigenous experience programs, but it was only in the last year that we thought, "More and more people are coming forward, wanting to engage in these kinds of activities, it really aligns with our new book of commitments." So as a team, we came together and developed a proposal that we brought forward to the executive team asking for funding to specifically develop and deliver indigenous experience programming, leveraging the programs that we have for our global experience projects.
Laura Wood: The great news, exciting news is that we did succeed in getting that funding, and so we have launched a new phase of global experience that really focuses on engaging with indigenous communities. We've done a little bit internationally through a project in Morocco that we've just run working with an indigenous group with Berber women's bakery. We've run a FLIP to Costa Rica for several years now to share knowledge and traditions with some indigenous communities there.
Laura Wood: Moving forward, we are going to continue some work with a group in Manitoulin Island and addictions and mental health community centre, where the students get an opportunity to actually see land-base therapy in action, and we've developed a case study out of it, and now that case study has been delivered to students within the Social Service Worker program and addictions and mental health program every year, and we have students going up and actually engaging in land-based therapy as part of a 10 week internship on Manitoulin Island, every winter, two very exciting projects there. And of course, most recently we've developed a partnership with Qaggiavuut cultural hub up in Iqaluit, Nunavut.
Laura Wood: This project has been quite exciting. It launched in the fall of 2019 with a performance from the Inuit artist, dancers and throat singers here on campus. That was very exciting. Then it led to a project that was up in Iqaluit for our arts management and business school students in February of 2020. The exciting part was the students got to work together on this project with the professionals from the cultural hub, they developed a marketing strategy, and that was really just the start of what is going to become a very long and prosperous relationship where we will likely have interns go up and spend time at the cultural centre and likely a few projects will come out of it as well.
Jocelyn Babudri: So we're talking a lot today about the positive impacts that our Global Experience programs we're having around the world and in Canada, but there's also the carbon footprint that is associated with some of these programs, and I'm wondering if that's something you've been thinking about, and if you could share some of your thoughts?
Laura Wood: It's interesting that you ask about the carbon footprint because it's not the first time we've been asked that question. A number of people who are very conscious of the impact we have on the environment and that our activities have on the environment have come forward to say, "What are we thinking about it? What are we going to do about it?" We have to obviously take some action on this as well. When I first came here, the goal was to get 20% of students abroad by 2020, and that's when I started colouring my hair because of all the stress of coming up with that plan. I think at the end of the day, though, what we realized is for a variety of reasons, for funding reasons, for the personal situations of our students, for the impact that we have on the environment, we were never actually going to get 20% of our student body abroad by 2020.
Laura Wood: So we figured we had to be a little bit more creative in how we did that. So, I think what we've done is come up with new and different ways to leverage the existing Global Experience programs, increase them a bit, but actually figure out a way to maximize the impact from those who actually get to go abroad. Part of that would be leveraging the existing programs in the sense that we're going to ask more from the faculty, we're going to ask more from the students who do get to go abroad, every time a project is developed, we want to make sure that it has some kind of lasting impact for the college. So we're not just going to send people away for a couple of weeks to have fun, we want to make sure that that learning is brought back to the college through the development of curriculum or development of case studies that can be incorporated into curriculum at a later date.
Laura Wood: In addition to asking more of the students and faculty who get to participate in these activities, we're also looking at new and different virtual opportunities. Can we partner with our Suzhou campus in China to create a global classroom environment where the students in business programs there and the student in business programs here get to be in the same class together and work on projects with students from the other campus. We are looking at virtual research projects and virtual internships for our students. So they get to engage in an activity that has a global flavor or a global topic at the core of it, but there isn't actually any travel involved.
Laura Wood: So, we're looking at these new and different ways of making sure that our students get access to working on projects and concepts and working with technology to work with partners around the world so that they have that experience without actually having to go abroad, and I think that is the way that we will actually reach our 20%, maybe not by 2020, but maybe by 2020.
Jocelyn Babudri: Thank you so much, Laura, for sharing such inspirational words of wisdom with us, and we're really excited about the new direction that global experience is taking. So thanks for being here today.

To maintain a healthy credit score, you will want to avoid certain home loan mistakes at all costs that might risk qualification problems for that brand new mortgage down the road.
You could end up getting declined, or with a higher-than-necessary mortgage rate that results in you paying more than initially intended.
What are the home loan mistakes you should avoid?
1. Taking out other loans before you apply for a home loan
Your financial history and outstanding debt will be evaluated thoroughly by the bank. This means that your Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) should ideally not exceed 60% of your income. Otherwise, you will be risking tipping over the TDSR with other loans before applying for a home loan.
2. Trusting a friend’s recommendation blindly
Your friend might mean well by recommending the “best” home loan deal from months ago, but it will by no means guarantee the same for you. Earn the benefits of asking our friendly Mortgage Specialist for the best home loan interest rates available for free!
3. Failing to shop around
It is a deadly mistake to go along with a bank just because it pre-approves you, especially if it has a high interest rate. Instead, you will benefit from shopping around and seeking pre-approval from multiple banks, while keeping in mind that you can expect to borrow a similar amount across banks typically.
But shopping around is tedious, isn’t it? That’s why we have our in-house mortgage broker to do all the legwork for you. He will do the ‘shopping around’ for the best home loan rate across all banks suitable to your needs.
4. Choosing Internal Board Rate (IBR) loans
With not much transparency going on, IBR loans means the home loan interest fluctuates based on the bank’s internal decisions. In this case, you would fork out the interest rate decided by the bank, which is generally not visible to the public, and regulated only by the bank in question. Despite the lack of transparency, the Board rate packages are sometimes recommended only if they are competitive. But ideally, you want to choose other options such as the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR) based loan, that are not subjected to the banks’ discretion and provide more transparency.
Don’t let the excitement of taking out a new home loan for your new place rush you in without the proper planning in place. When you apply for a home loan, always make sure to keep an eye on the interest rates before and during the home loan process. Want to secure the best loan package across all banks? Call 6886 9009 and talk to our mortgage specialist. Learn more about Ohmyhome’s free mortgage advisory service, where we can value add by advising on the several types of packages pegged to Sibor, board rate, Fixed deposit, Fixed rate and more based on your individual needs.

Love is what you make it
I’ll give you my heart if you promise that you won’t break it
I’ma keep it real with everyone, it ain’t no fakin’

Don’t care what people say, especially when they talk crazy
Don’t play with me, I’m BabyCP-led group to take over airport link
published : 22 Oct 2021 at 09:00
writer: Post Reporters
A consortium led by Charoen Pokphand Group will take over the operations of Airport Rail Link (ARL) services on Monday, according to the Department of Rail Transport (DRT).
DRT's deputy director-general Pichet Khunathamrak recently held a meeting with Asia Era One (AERA1) to discuss the hand-over to ensure a smooth transition.
AERA1, formerly known as Eastern High-Speed Rail Linking Three Airports Co Ltd, is CP-led consortium that won the bid to build a high-speed rail linking three airports of Don Mueang, Suvarnabhumi and U-Tapao airports with a plan to take over the ARL's operations this year.
ARL services are currently operated by SRT Electric Train Co, under the State of Railway of Thailand. The consortium is expected to pay about 10 billion baht for the take-over.
Train operations, safety and customer services are among issues discussed at the meeting ahead of the take-over.
ARL passengers have about six months from Oct 25 to April 30 next year to replace their rail cards without being charged.
Meanwhile, the SRT's board has greenlighted the signing of a memo of understanding (MoU) between SRT Electric Train Co and AERA1 to allow the consortium to delay transfer payments for three months with the handover scheduled to proceed as planned, according to a source at the SRT.
While the consortium can take over the train operations, ownership rights remain with the SRT until the payment is made.
Under the contract, AERA1 will pay a lump sum of 10.6 billion baht on Oct 24 to complete the operation transfer.
"The firm has asked to make the payment in instalments while taking over the operations as scheduled. So unless the payment is made, ARL is still owned by the SRT.
"The company can move their staff in because the SRT will shift theirs to the SRT's Red Line. The train services won't be affected," said the source.
The consortium is also seeking to break up the payment into 10 instalments over a period of 10 years.Hello again, everyone! I hope you are all having a wonderful Sunday. I awoke this morning with the sun streaming through my window, and after a week of rain, I was overjoyed. Then, I saw the white frost blanketing my gardens. We have officially had our first hard frost here in northern Michigan. Today, I said good-bye to summer and another growing season. This inevitable day is always hard for me every year, so today I want to celebrate what was my summer garden, and share one last look at it with you.
This is my little metal chandelier I have hanging from the tree branch above my rose iron bistro table and chair set.
An old bicycle with a burlap-lined basket is packed with impatiens. Clematis vine twines around the bicycle wheel.
A Carpet Rose variety. Although very thorny, it is hardy and blooms all summer long!
I picked up this chippy, wicker plant stand at a garage sale for a couple dollars! The pink impatiens match my pink porch chairs.
Thank-you for joining me on one last stroll through my summer garden. I hope you have enjoyed yourself as much as I have. Although bittersweet, today turned out to be a beautiful fall day.
Maria ~Rusty Hinge
your garden is beautiful~ thanks for sharing~ xo
Hi Maria- I wish I had such a sprawling yard!! The benefits of Michigan:) Here is in Southern Cal...not a chance! It is so lovely.
Have a great day!
~Cheryl
What a wonderful garden you have! I love the way the vines are taking the bike. So fresh and natural, I can almost smell it. Great post!

This forward can be said to be very strong and one of the best in the Asian team.,Chris just wanted to be alone, and relied on speed to open a loophole in the two defenses, and a short pass to Mordred's feet.,Happily, he was finally able to compete with Anthony . The last time Real Madrid's Betis was limited by Anthony's strength, the two of them did not show their wits and bravery at all. pornhd',When he heard that he was fouled, the captain who had been spoiling Mordred angrily wanted to drag those people out for a fight.

Real Madrid fans: "It is a kind of happiness to have Mordred, even if you are in the dark, he will pull you out of the abyss." After the guidance of the narration, everyone saw Mordred pulling the guard, the two people in a strange state of motionlessness.,porn 3some., jap tubes And he was going to get the autographs of Chris and Lord Shui today. As a fan, he was squeezed in the crowd and the two people didn't even notice it.Although Mourinho said he wanted to teach Mordred a lesson, he actually picked it up and put it down gently, punishing him three times for not being on the big list.Kaka's first reaction was to help Mordred up quickly. Just as he put his hand on his arm, Mordred clutched his waist and shouted: "Don't! Don't touch me!",mad porn At first I found out that there was something wrong in my heart and physiology, but if I observed it carefully, I would find that these two people only called each other.
Chris didn't have to hesitate when he returned to the hotel. This unscrupulous conjecture immediately made Mordred blush. What Mr. Madman did not do, let Mini easily do it.,pusy porn "Sir, I will protect myself, don't worry about me." Mordred looked at Mourinho deeply, as if he was saying something. But Caroline's various behaviors make it more and more difficult for Kaka to do at the Bernabeu, and now Kaka's locker room is simply embarrassing, all thanks to Caroline.Mordred smirked and said he was innocent. "Yes.", lola taylor Mordred came to the pile of "teammates" and whispered something with the arms of two people. ?zil, who came back from sunbathing, after knowing the ins and outs, looked at them with the expression of'Are you stupid' for a long time, and then said: "Then both of you are going to have trouble doing women's clothing?"It happened that Chris came with a mini at this time. This energetic dog seemed to be more excited. He ran back upstairs and downstairs. Chris and Mordred couldn't catch it at running speeds like Chris and Mordred.,pornktu Mourinho hesitated rarely, he was not sure whether such a detailed approach would be good or bad for Mordred.

",Chris showed a plan-tong smile where the other party could not see, and when he turned his head, his face was still blank, with a slight expectation in his eyes.I wanted to stop it, but found that I couldn't move at all. Before he could study it thoroughly, he discovered that the bullying below had become completely different. Mordred sat relaxed on the chair. This was the first time he went to a game without any purpose. An imaginary enemy who has never known before becomes a teammate. It is really difficult for him to have a good impression of someone who has no impression., bellesa sex seans As the mouthpiece of Barcelona, ??the Daily Sports lost today, and the root cause of today's loss was Mordred. As the mouthpiece of Barcelona, ??he certainly wouldn't make Mourinho and Mordred too comfortable. Mordred was irritated by this scene and remembered the gentleman he met at the autograph meeting in China. boobsdesi If one more goal is scored, then two away goals will be scored. It is also 2:2 that Manchester United have an advantage over them. In any case, this goal must be shot.The author has something to say:,xossips.com Mendeszhang knew he had made a mistake this time, and his thugs covered Mordred's blond hair, "No, they won't laugh at you, trust me."
xxxnxsex After a reception, Mourinho was still the madman who made reporters love and hate , but he had a deeper understanding of the teenager Mord." "I will choose Chinese nationality! Because my mother hopes that I can win honor for China, I am very sorry that the American coach helped me, but I want to help my mother realize her dream.",Mordred listened to his complaint like this, rubbing his right hand with his left hand. .

It even makes me feel that I should be ten years old, not eighteen.", سكس مص But Real Madrid also has a Buff, that is, anyone in the defense can kick two feet, and sometimes they can score goals..i am cumming hd xx sex Chris's running didn't even stop, he was taken directly into the penalty area, and he violently scored a goal with an elevator ball. There was no time for the opponent's goalkeeper to adjust the time.,carter dane The corners of Mordred's mouth rose up while thinking about it, without even looking at the phone, "Hello? Who."
sex bro sis.But depending on Mordred's usual performance, his wish is almost zero. Then I started talking with Kaka about football, about religion, about where to play during the winter break, just not talking about the agent.,Then he turned his head to look at Mordred to see that he had already drunk half of his glass, and said helplessly: "You should drink less, this is not a good thing."But it's all here. If he hasn't bought all of them, is he going to run a second time?,The son of the wind merged into the wind in this way, and the ball was like a part of his body. The author has something to say: This action, not only the referee did not expect even Chris they did not expect, they are the dominant side naturally will not explain anything, watching the Mallorca players jump like a beam clown. Mourinho has never been afraid of challenges, so he has to make a perfect plan before the game., sex site hd The players on the court are also infected by this joy, and the smile on everyone's face can't stop it. The powerful opponent that he has always regarded as a mortal enemy is suddenly annihilated by the little cousin that he didn't pay attention to. This kind of psychological gap is hard to imagine.,Of course Chris didn't mind this while waiting for such a long time , watching him quietly , giving him all the initiative.Before Mordred came, he made a detailed body plan for them and sent it to everyone. Like when they saw Chris's material in the Real Madrid locker room , each showed his big eyes.,desisex tubeWhen we return to Real Madrid next time, he and Chris will also try the same.
ro89 If it is not for certain that he does not have the slightest negative emotions, Mourinho will almost doubt whether he has been beaten up with a psychological problem. Mordred and Benzema high-five each other and start the game again. Mordred stands on the turf, staring at the opponent Gotze and Bender, these two midfielders are really soulful.,So with Mordred, a highly conscious player, he didn't bother to talk to them every day, and it seemed that he had a bad temper. Luo Sansui even posted Mordred's horrified look with his hands folded just now on Twitter,'This kid is quite cute. ' For Mourinho's surface, then , all the reporters scoff , worthy of praise you do not bring them out to get us or harm? There was a full court press. He was there wherever there was the ball. Sweat ran down his neck into the jersey, but his speed still didn't slow down., free pornhd "Oh, my god. Real Madrid's alien star is mixed with Atletico Madrid's defender?" Just kidding, Merris has experienced a broken leg. He knows how to protect himself, and it is inevitable to bump into the football field.How to react when facing opponents , no one knows better than a star who has experienced all kinds of things.,sex vedeios But it is not so kind to the rest of the Chinese team. sex in a gym
xfantzy The author has something to say: If it could, Mordred was unwilling to use such extreme methods, but now there is not much time, so he should simply go slant. Although it's an exaggeration, anyway, boasting that it is not taxable, the defeat will not boost morale. Mordred was once again arranged in the Copa del Rey by Mr. Madman, this time they were still playing against poor Merila.,Just watching the grand occasion of one person and one dog running, they couldn't help but stand on the side of the road with a smile. More than 5,000 words can be regarded as compensation for the change in the past few days. I hope everyone will be happy to read it. There may be a lot of typos. I will revise it tomorrow. Everyone should rest early. Love you guys. Kaka looked serious and changed his gentle image before, "Chris, have you really decided? It's not that no one has walked this road, and few people have gone through it." A football player to endorse luxury goods...Who thinks fans will buy jewelry?, xxx ww sex It's just that he just hung up the phone, and Mordred's phone rang in seconds. He just finished saying that Yang Zhi hangs on his back like a koala, "Where to eat is different for you? It's still the third one anyway."Paul, who had originally wanted to tackle the ball, still didn't make a shot at Mordred, and when he was about to touch him, he pulled back., Mendes ended the advertisement without discussing it with him, also because he agreed to Mendes some time ago. Just as Mordred was gloating, a clear voice suddenly came from behind him. porn vedoes Mordred...has been used to it for a long time, and even feels good after smelling it for a long time, but in the eyes of people who don't like fragrance, Chris is simply a walking poison sprayer. zoey foxx Di Maria winger , Chris winger , Benzema returned to the center position.
porn kerala As soon as the last commentary was finished, I heard a friend next to me say: "Hey, this news of you is old. Now it is said that Chris and Merris are a pair." This advantage must be maintained, so defense is the top priority. Mordred, as a rare defensive player who can be pulled from the front line, is naturally dragged behind by Mourinho as a defensive player.,The home game is in front and the away game is behind.. Thanks to their preparation in advance , Mendes had just greeted the public relations department, and pictures of Mordred and Chris appeared on the Internet. It can be said that he has lived with football for both his life. He can't understand what Cao Jingwei said. In his opinion, football is life. Why would anyone not like football?, porn message Not only did the coach realize it, but the fans also realized how terrifying Mordred's strength is. Otherwise, these self-defeating aristocrats, Mei Lingge, would fight for him to roll up their sleeves? "This kind of thing is not difficult. Although it is a bit arrogant, there are only a few teams that can compete with each other now."Although there is only Mordred, Mendes is also very happy. So the talented Real Madrid couldn't catch anyone for a while! Especially the defenders they have been missing have directly injured two. The commentators found that Mourinho's approach touched their knowledge blind zone, and they could not even guess the benefits of Mourinho's approach.,sex in a gym If Mordred heard this sentence, he would have smiled bitterly. He wasn't okay just now, but he didn't dare to have anything to do with the goal just now. Once this time the counter-blocking, it will definitely be a blow to morale.
f-best porn. It is said that Kaka accompanies him to clean, but in fact the room is very clean, even the sheets and quilts are newly replaced, so they can move in at any! Lin Yue has never given up on introducing Modred into high-end brands. Anyway, dealing with these luxury goods can also increase his popularity and bargaining chips. The basis of a star is to play well, but commercial packaging is equally important. "If it doesn't affect my competitive state... I am willing to receive some advertisements appropriately." As soon as this was said, Mordred regretted it. Obviously there was not much time to contact him between the two games, and Anthony told him more than once that it was very difficult to restrain his instincts., xxx prank The Football Association personnel, who have been harassed by Mordred, have completely forgotten that they are doing this for Mordred's own body. So I often use his small problems to tease him, every time I can get a lot of fun.Weirdly coming and going, the relationship between the two people turned out to be better, and when Mordred was chatting with a weird smile, he suddenly called.,So Royce raised his foot to shoot, Captain Casey shot the racket out, and his body fell to the ground because of too much stretch. As the picture turned, a kind-looking old man sat in front of Mordred with guilt in his eyes and said: "Merrys, your commercial value is indeed very strong, but the club has found a more suitable person, I hope you...".

rent men "This child has also suffered a lot abroad." Zheng Zhi watched the scarred body in Mordred's photo album on TV. Chris around him didn't notice the excitement of Kaka, and said proudly: "That is, you don't look at the apprentice who taught him.",From his position, the effect of passing to Benzema would be better, but out of feelings with Mordred, Kaka still passed the ball to Mordred. Before the last four words could be spoken, the other side hung up the phone, Doyle looked at the phone and shook his head helplessly. Cassie, who originally wanted to keep someone by her side, found that his guards... were all gone. The intense and exciting second half began . The whole stadium was filled with Madrid's diehard shouts . They shouted a name together , "Ricardo! Ricardo.", sex by bus "Is this a trick created by Merris! Oh my God, what kind of spirituality is this 18 -year-old creating skills! What kind of talent is this!" Anyone can see how much the arrival of Anthony has brought to Atletico Madrid, if Simeone only turned Atletico from the mud into a dirt road at that time.Even if also the elegant gentleman on the court, carefully calculate all little red-faced and others , I can not imagine him as a child and a fight look.,hentai pirn The lover's name was revealed in this way, and a warm satisfaction rose from the bottom of my heart.zoey fox!?" One of the strong rivals came online. The Japanese team was really strong back then. Now Shinji Kagawa's body is declining too badly. I refused them once, and it was a bit too shame to refuse this time. Mordred nodded, "It's troublesome."

Can a promised to pay be enforceable against an estate?
If a person promises to pay someone’s mortgage but dies before doing so, is
the promise to pay the mortgage enforceable against the estate?
Asked on June 17, 2018 under Estate Planning, Georgia
Answers:
SJZ, Member, New York Bar / FreeAdvice Contributing Attorney
Answered 3 years ago | Contributor
If it was a written contract to pay and the other side honored its obligations, then it can be enforced against the estate. But if it's not a written contract, the promise is unenforceable.
There are three things required for enforceability:
1) It must be a contract. A contract requires mutual "consideration"--that is, each party must give or promise something of value to the other. For example, say that A agreed to pay B's mortgage while B in turn either paid A money for that promise (e.g. A needed money now, and agreed to pay a mortgage later in exchange for money now) or gave A something else of value (like some other property; like a patent or trademark; like the right to collect or receive money from a third party; etc.), then you could have a contract. But if A simply promised to pay the mortgage without receiving anything in return, that is a "gratuitous" (or freely made) promise and does not form an enforceable contract: A, or A's estate, can simply decide to not honor it at will. Contracts are enforceable; non-contractual promises are not.
2) It must be in writing. Agreements to pay another person's debt must be in writing--oral agreements to pay another's debt are not enforceable.
3) The person whose mortgage is to be paid must have complied with all his or her obligations under the contract. If A promised to pay B's mortgage in exchange for B paying A money now, then if B failed to make the payment when he or she should have, that failure or breach would absolve A (or A's estate) of their own obligation(s). You can't enforce a contract unless you are in compliance.#33 - Stop Trying to Leapfrog the Relationship

As often, unfortunately, the press knew a few weeks before the harvest that the vintage 2008 would be bad.
In our distant countryside, we do not know if such comments are related to the 13 moons or to the capitalism virtual crisis that currently pollutes the real economy. Probably both…
More seriously, it is true that 2008 was a complicated and difficult vintage because of a very humid spring and early summer. Mildew pressure was high and the flowering unequal, causing a steep “coulure” on older vines or on the most fragile.
Despite this bad cycle start, July was dry and sunny (22 ml of rain), giving a first run-up. However, the following month was rainy and cold between the 11th and the 22nd of August; before a good weather coming back on the 24th. September was largely dry, especially between the 21st and the 1st, but with temperatures often below the seasonal average.
8th of October: last rainy day, we can finally breathe … What happiness! Analysis showed that berries had lost 20 to 30% of their weight between the 20.09 and the 10.10, and therefore gained 20 to 30% of concentration.
Saint-Emilion had to wait then. Work in the vineyard was intense (stripping, destemming, sorting up during the véraison), but essential to maintain quality.
We started the first harvest on the 10th of October at Château Canon La Gaffelière, to end up on the 24th at La Mondotte and Château Aiguilhe.
This vintage was surely late, but no more than some 80’s vintages such as 1983 or 1986.
The latest tanks have just been finished, and we can enjoy a wonderful quality. The wines are powerful and have an exceptional depth color. The tannins, very mature, offer a beautiful structure to this vintage.
To summarize, in my opinion, the 2008 appears to be a beautiful vintage which will exceed 2007, 2006, 2004, 2002 or even 2003 (successful on the cooler regions such as clay and limestone), although it is still too early to give a definitive opinion (our friends, journalists will do it for us).
Nevertheless: one flaw concerning the quantities produced (sometimes less than 30 hl / ha). But in the actual context, it is still better to produce less but well! We must not leave the crisis pollute this vintage 2008.”

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
[06:30:00] DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): True that back in 1918 the population was a third of what it is today. But that entire population was at the mercy of the pandemic because there were no vaccines. But today, a different problem in the United States. A reluctance to use the vaccines, the very tool our ancestors wish they had had. DR. HENRY BERNSTEIN, FORMER MEMBER, CDC ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES: It's the unvaccinated that are driving this present surge that's resulting in many hospitalizations' need for intensive care unit, and also the record number of deaths that we're seeing. DR. KIERSTIN KENNEDY, UAB CHIEF OF HOSPITAL MEDICINE: We have had some capacity open up, and it is not because these patients are miraculously getting better and going home. It's because they're dying. GUPTA: Federal health officials now say we're in a pandemic of the unvaccinated. XAVIER BECERRA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: When 99 percent of the people who are dying of COVID today don't have a vaccine, that's the -- that's perfect proof that you need to be vaccinated. GUPTA: It all raises an uncomfortable question, what are we willing to accept when it comes to deaths? This is the death toll over time so far, 1,000 in March of 2020, 300,000 by the end of last year, twice that many by this summer. Some now ask, could there be a million tragic deaths before this is all over? DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, CHIEF MEDICAL ADVISER TO PRESIDENT BIDEN: I certainly hope not. I hope not. I don't believe at all that that is something that is an inevitability by any means. If we get the overwhelming proportion of our population vaccinated, we're not going to see that at all. GUPTA: But that means getting most of some 70 million eligible adults vaccinated, an effort that's been poisoned by politics and misinformation, the worst it has been in a hundred years. DR. HOWARD MARKEL, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN CENTER FOR THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE: It's never been this level of anger and politicization and distrust. GUPTA: 2021 isn't 1918. They lacked the science to prevent 675,000 deaths. Whereas we, to a great extent, have lacked the will. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN, reporting. (END VIDEOTAPE) JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: Our thanks to Sanjay for that. This morning, the White House is condemning disturbing new video that shows law enforcement charging migrants at the border. BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN ANCHOR: Plus, Republicans say their new election laws are designed to prevent fraud, but brand-new evidence out of Florida shows that is not the case. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [08:37:14] KEILAR: This morning, some stunning new images that show California's famed groves of giant sequoias wrapped in a fire retarded aluminum foil as crews are desperately trying to save them from fires that are burning through the rugged Sierra Nevada Mountains. That includes one of the largest trees in the world, the General Sherman. Meantime, rain is on the way for the Midwest and the Northeast. Chad Myers joining us now with a look here. I mean those pictures out of California, that is just, you know -- especially as a Californian, Chad, I will tell you, I've never seen anything like it. CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Yes. No, and we had a wind event there yesterday and a little bit more today. That will, again, increase the fire danger out there. We've had 86, 87 days in a row with the fire danger being the highest number possible on the fire rating category. So, here we go. But, yes, cold air is coming into the northeast, along with rainfall. And a beautiful -- unbelievably beautiful weekend. This weather brought to you by Servpro, making fire and water damage like it never even happened. So, here we go. Here comes the rain. It's going to come through the Midwest. It's going to eventually go all the way through the Northeast. Now, there's going to be some heavy rain, two to four inches in some spots. So that could cause some problems, especially if you have saturated ground. But it's the rainfall. It's going to come through with the cold front that you will remember it's the cold air that you will remember. That cold front's going to get all the way down to New Orleans. The high in New Orleans by the weekend will be 78. Won't that feel good for the people that are still picking up the pieces down there in Louisiana. Cooler air all across the Great Lakes and the Northeast. Look at it, 70s -- 70s by the weekend. And the same story all the way down across the Gulf Coast. We'll take this weather for sure. Brianna. KEILAR: All right, Chad, we will. Thank you. BERMAN: So, the White House says images of border patrol agents on horseback confronting Haitian migrants are horrific. And the Department of Homeland Security is investigating. Footage shows them twirling something at migrants who crossed the border near Del Rio, Texas. The agents trying to corral the migrants. Some 10,000 are living in desperate conditions under the international bridge in Del Rio, awaiting processing as the U.S. accelerates deportations. For many, the journey to the southern border begins in southern Mexico. And that's where Matt Rivers joins us live. And, Matt, I think it's so important to point this out. This is a continental problem. It's not just one place or one town on the U.S./Mexico border. MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, John. I mean what we're seeing at the U.S. border didn't start there. I mean you've got migrants who have made a very long journey to get to that point. That's the end. The thousands and thousands and thousands of people that you see at the U.S. border right now, just ten days, maybe two weeks ago were here in southern Mexico, and moving through this area in a way that immigration activists tell me they've never really seen before. [08:40:06] (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RIVERS (voice over): A packed street in southern Mexico resembling something out of Port-au-Prince. Hundreds of Haitian migrants fill the sidewalks of Tapachula. This city is often a stop for those traveling north to the U.S. But the amount of Haitians making that journey right now, both government officials and activists say, is unprecedented. We've seen lots of migration before, says Ruben Figueroa, but we have never seen this many people from Haiti. It's unbelievable. Nearly 19,000 Haitians and counting have applied for asylum in Mexico this year. Already three times higher than all of 2020. But for many, asylum claims won't keep them here. They will head north, arriving by any and all means. Here, a few days ago, dozens of migrants, many of them Haitian, take a ferry to cross a river, the only way to get across. Most will then pay a few dollars to a motorcycle taxi to take them along the next leg of the journey. RIVERS (on camera): He's basically saying that he's never seen this amount of Haitian migrants come through here before. RIVERS (voice over):. The U.S. says it will deport these people by the thousands, but there are more coming. RIVERS (on camera): So this space in southern Mexico, up until just a few days ago, was actually a place where hundreds of Haitian migrants were staying on a temporary basis every single day. This community actually set up this shelter because of this recent influx. As you can see now, though, it's empty. All the Haitians that were here, left. They're headed north to the United States. RIVERS (voice over): And this surging migration has every chance to continue after a devastating earthquake struck Haiti six weeks ago. Hundreds of thousands were displaced and immigration activists say many could leave the island soon and eventually end up right back here in southern Mexico, U.S. bound. (END VIDEOTAPE) RIVERS: And what government officials are telling us is that the vast majority of Haitians that have come through here to southern Mexico, going to the U.S., they're actually Haitians that have left the island years ago, after the earthquake in 2010, Hurricane Matthew in 2016. These are people who had been living in South America but chose to make this journey all the way north, up to the U.S., due to economic hardships, primarily, throughout this pandemic. Kind of amazing when you think about the fact that even though there was this major earthquake, John, just about six weeks ago now, those people who will be leaving the island, and make no mistake, people will migrate as a result of the earthquake, they haven't even made it here yet. So this is the kind of scene that we could see again in the future. BERMAN: It's not even this disaster in Haiti that's driving people to the border today, it's ten years ago, five years ago. Such an important reminder. Matt Rivers, thank you so much for your reporting. New text messages show what motivated some Republicans in Florida to craft new, restrictive voting laws. It has nothing to do with fraud. KEILAR: Plus, just in, Johnson & Johnson says its two-dose vaccine provides protection at a 94 percent rate, putting it on the level of Moderna and Pfizer. We'll have details about that ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [06:47:49] BERMAN: New this morning, internal text messages between Republican lawmakers in Florida undercutting the claims that the state's new, more restricting voting law was not politicly motivating. According to "Politico," Republican Senate Senator Joel Gruters defended a senate proposal to cancel all existing mail-in ballot requests, saying that it would be devastating to Republicans to keep them valid heading into the 2022 election, when DeSantis and other state Republican officials are up for re-election. That proposal did not ultimately make it into the final bill, but Republicans did shorten the time the ballot requests would be remain valid. Joining us now, Florida man, Gary Fineout, his is the political reporter who broke this story and obtained this information. Gary, always a pleasure to see you. And great reporting here. Very revealing. What did these text messages show that these Republican leaders were worried about, and how were they trying to remedy it? GARY FINEOUT, REPORTER, "POLITICO": Well, what it showed is that the concerns about mail-in balloting were also tied to partisan advantage, to political gain, as opposed to just, it's a concern about election integrity and security. BERMAN: They were specifically saying that keeping the rolls open, basically people who apply for mail-in ballots last time would get them new again this time no matter what, that allowing for that would help Democrats too much? Am I reading that correctly? FINEOUT: Well, right. And basically in the 2020 election, as the effect of the pandemic, you know, caused a change in electoral behavior, the Democrats really pushed to get people to vote by mail as opposed to voting in person. And going into the 2020 election, they had a significant advantage in the number of people who were getting their mail -- who were getting their ballots through the mail. So what the legislation was about was basically one of the things that it did is, it basically said, well, if you hadn't gotten in your request by -- if you already had an old request or a request from the last cycle, it was automatically going to be canceled and you were going to have to apply again. [06:50:00] The Florida law had been that your mail-in ballot request was good for two election cycles. The law that was ultimately passed changed it from two to one. But the text messages show that part of the discussion about this was, how is this going to impact Republicans going into the election? Not, is this a good idea or a bad idea because of election security. BERMAN: It's bad for us as Republicans, not, it's bad for us in Florida because, dot, dot, dot, of security issues. And just a reminder, this is a reversal of the political situation in Florida from five, ten years ago when more Republicans used to vote by mail, correct? So -- so they only became worried about this type of mail-in balloting when more Democrats started doing it. FINEOUT: No, I think it's important to note that in Florida, Florida has what's called excuse-free mail-in balloting, or what used to be known as absentee balloting. That was put in place by the Republicans following the debacle that was the 2000 recount. So all of these things that have happened in mail-in balloting over the years had allowed the Republicans to do a good job and to keep their control over state government. What has happened is in the last couple of cycles, as you've seen more and more Democrats have been voting by mail, whereas Republicans have been going more to early voting and to voting on Election Day. BERMAN: So, tell me, besides intrepid reporting, how you came upon these text messages, and what the long-term impact might be. Do Democrats or interest groups have any recourse here? FINEOUT: Well, basically, how we were able to obtain these -- these text messages and some emails was basically that there are groups that have sued the state and the legislature and the governor over this new election law. And there was discovery that went on in the case. So, what I was able to do was I -- I made public records requests to the governor's office, to the house and senate, to find out what they had delivered to the lawyers. And as for the ramifications, well, I mean, the lawsuit is ongoing. And we'll see how that -- how that plays out. There's several groups. There were multiple lawsuits that were filed right after this was signed contending that the new law, which has a lot of different things in it. It's not just this that's in that law, that this could effect, you know, voting of the elderly, and minority groups and things of that nature. So that lawsuit's going to play out over the months ahead as we -- as we head into the 2022 elections. Now, I would say as to the overall impact, I mean, I don't know. I mean what's interesting is, as you pointed out, Republicans used to be really good at mail-in ballots. And I guess we're going to see is, was what happened in 2020 sort of a one year situation where, because of the pandemic, or are all the changes that they've done with mail-in ballots, will it wind up hurting Republicans in the end? BERMAN: Gary Fineout, I should not have said besides intrepid reporting how did you come across this, because it was only intrepid reporting that let you get those text messages. Always great to have you on. Gary Fineout, great to see you. Thank you. FINEOUT: Thank you. Thank you. BERMAN: So, is the crisis that the United States is going through right now as bad as the Civil War? One of America's most prolific documentarians says yes. KEILAR: Meanwhile, the United States facing the possibility of economic catastrophe amid a showdown on Capitol Hill. We'll break down what's at stake. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [06:56:13] KEILAR: Ken Burns, one of America's most prolific documentarians, recently went on a podcast where he made this claim about really the context of the state of America right now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILL ARNETT, "SMARTLESS" PODCAST: You've been making films about the American experience and about America for the, you know, whatever it's been, over 40 years. Do you have a cynical view now of where we're headed and where we've come from? Is it -- is it doom and gloom or are you -- do you feel OK? KEN BURNS: Well, I don't think anybody has the luxury at this moment of being cynical. Cynical's a, you know. Like just debauchery is just a luxury of too much time and too many things that you're not doing with your hands that you begin doing with your hands. ARNETT: Yes. BURNS: It's -- it's -- it's really serious. There are three great crises before this, the Civil War, the Depression, and World War II. This is equal to it. (END VIDEO CLIP) KEILAR: Wow. So joining us to discuss is CNN political analyst Natasha Alford and CNN political commentator and the host of "Smerconish" on CNN, Michael Smerconish. Michael, do you agree with Ken Burns? MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Brianna, I can't match his historical analysis. I can only say that I've been paying close attention for the last three decades and I'm not accustomed to having the level of concern that I have today about the security of the United States. And I don't mean from foreign threat, I mean from domestic threat. I worry about the stability of our country in ways that I never have previously. I've grown up politically worried about things like will Social Security be there and what should be the tax rate? And, yes, to an extent, the Cold War. But I think we face real crisis from within. So, sadly, my answer is, yes. KEILAR: Natasha, what do you think? NATASHA ALFORD, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, Brianna, I think the level of political polarization that we see produces casualties that amount to what we would see in a war, right? Think about that 675,000 COVID death number. It's a really gruesome milestone. And yet, if you go on any mainstream social media site today, you will see that there are people who question that that number is real. Can you imagine? There are people who have died, and there's so many Americans who are falling in the camp of saying, we just don't think the number is real. And so when we can't agree on basic things in a society, like what the facts are, then you get the result of only 54 percent of Americans being vaccinated, which is not how we end a pandemic. So it does beg the question of, where do we go as a country when people are willing to both die and put others' health at risk, all for their sense of what personal liberty is. KEILAR: I -- you know, Michael, I think one of the reasons it's -- I -- well, a couple reasons that what Ken Burns is saying really raises eyebrows is because, you know, he mentions the Civil War, which, obviously, he is very familiar with, right? He has the -- the documentary on it. But, of course, you know, slavery and the context of what life was like for so much of the country during that time. But also the fact that these things he's highlighting are existential threats, which means that's what he sees right now as. SMERCONISH: True. And -- and I think Natasha's on to something. Truth has become an elastic concept. We can't even agree on basic facts. And one of the reasons that I think we can't agree on basic facts is that there's such diminished confidence in our institutions, in government, certainly in the media, the police, even in the military. And so it's -- it's hard to know where you can go for information on which you can rely. And I think that technology has proven to be an accelerant on this fire. [07:00:04] Things won't get better until people start drawing on more sources of information as they decideJUSTICE INITIATIVE
Samuel Pieh on WRFG-Atlanta -
descendant Amistad leader Sengbe Pieh
Along with quotes from the Amistad Case before the Supreme Court by John Quincy Adams and a letter from the
former Amistad Captives to Adams
Note: In the past few years I have been fortunate to establish a friendship with Samuel Pieh, a descendant of Sengbe Pieh who was the leader of the Amistad Mutiny in 1839. Samuel obtained his university degree in Michigan and has subsequently been engaged in development work in Africa. In July 2016, while visiting Atlanta, Samuel Pieh was interviewed on
WRFG-Atlanta's
"African Experience Worldwide" with producer Mfon Ufot. Please see the interview below.
I am also including excerpts of the testimony of the former US President John Quincy Adams made in 1841 before the US Supreme Court on the behalf of the Amistad defendants. Included also is a letter of thanks from the former Amistad captives to John Quincy Adams.
If there was ever a time to reflect upon the integrity of some US presidents it is now. Read the narrative from John Quincy Adams that contains substance, humanity and fairness.

Samuel Pieh - July 2016
Samuel Pieh on WRFG-Atlanta
From Samuel Pieh
amistad.tai2013@gmail.com
As a descendant of the enslaved Africans who became poster children of the USA Abolitionists in 1839, I have great respect and appreciation for former President John Quincy Adams for defending the human's rights of the Amistad African in the Supreme Court of America. I am also very grateful to all people of conscience... President Kennedy took great political risks by intervening to release Reverend Martin Luther King from prison in 1960, using National Guard to desegregate southern colleges including the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) where my own son graduated with the BSC degree in Criminal Justice/Sociology and Law Enforcement in December 2015. President Kennedy's oratory skills remind me of John Quincy Adams, especially the quote in his June 1963 civil rights address"...we have a right to expect that the negro will be presensible, will uphold the law, but they also have a right to expect that the law will be fair, that the constitution will be color blind..." I have learned that every partnership must be mutual commitment for the transformation to be effected in a sustainable manner.
From my humble beginning in Taiama, Sierra Leone and the deep and abiding faith in God and fellow human beings including my parents, I believe that I have life experiences that can trigger partnerships for peace and appropriate capacity building and strengthening. Like Sengbe Pieh of the Amistad Saga, I believe and practice honestly helping others while helping myself...."leadership with stewardship for public good is highly recommended for civic transformation".
John Quincy Adams Defends the
Amistad Captives before the U.S. Supreme Court
Annotation:
Abolitionists persuaded former President John Quincy Adams to represent the Amistad rebels before the Supreme Court. Adams accepted the invitation, stating that "there is in my estimation no higher object upon earth...than to occupy that position."
The 74-year-old Adams argued that the Africans had "vindicated their own right of liberty" by "executing the justice of Heaven" upon a "pirate murderer, their tyrant and oppressor." Adams, the son of one of America's founders, was the only surviving stateman who had been on close terms with Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe. In the end, the court ruled that the Africans had exercised the right of self-defence since they had been illegally transported as slaves from Africa to Cuba. As it turned out, private donors returned 35 surviving rebels to Sierra Leone almost a year after the court ruling. While this outcome signified an extraordinary victory for black and white abolitionists, and for John Quincy Adams in particular, the Supreme Court made it clear that the Amistad case was highly exceptional and that slaves in general had no right to rebel or escape their bondage.
Cinque, the revolt's leader, returned to his Mende homeland only to find his village destroyed as a result of a war with a neighboring people. Apparently, his wife and children were sold into slavery during this conflict, and he never saw them again. He later worked as an interpreter for the American Missionary Association (

House leader, MP William Amos press Speaker to investigate nude photo leak Back to video
He suggested there could be serious implications for the person who took and shared this intimate image on Wednesday.
“Taking a photo of someone who is changing clothes and in the nude and sharing it without their consent could very well be criminal,” Rodriguez said.
A screenshot shows Amos standing unclothed behind a desk between the Quebec and Canadian flags with what appears to be a phone covering his private parts.
During virtual House of Commons sittings, only those who speak are shown on the public feed. Therefore, Amos’s fellow MPs could see him on camera but he did not appear on the main screen.

Bloc Quebecois MP Claude DeBellefeuille, the party whip, raised the incident in a point of order after question period Wednesday, as she called for parliamentary decorum.
“It may be necessary to remind the members, especially the male ones, that a tie and jacket are obligatory, but so are a shirt, boxer shorts or pants,” DeBellefeuille said in French.
“We have seen that the member is in great physical shape, but I think members should be reminded to be careful and control the camera well.”
In a statement Wednesday, Amos said he had returned from a jog and was changing into his work clothes, and did not realize his camera was on.
“This was an unfortunate error,” said Amos, parliamentary secretary to Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne.

“I sincerely apologize to my colleagues in the House of Commons for this unintentional distraction. Obviously, it was an honest mistake and it won’t happen again.”

Thursday morning, Rodriguez opened the House of Commons by blasting the unidentified person who leaked the nude photo of Amos to media, asking if they had given any thought to the ramifications on Amos’s personal life when they shared it.
He called it a case of “callous disrespect.”
“Did they think of (Amos’s) family, children, friends and the fact that the internet is forever? Are we really at the point in our politics that it is acceptable to try and destroy the reputation and humiliate a colleague because someone finds an unfortunate error and unintentional mistake to be funny?” Rodriguez said.
“Our politics have taken a very dark and destructive turn if this is the case.”
Neither MPs nor staff are allowed to to take photos in the House of Commons when it is sitting — a rule that has been extended to include virtual sittings.

This includes taking screenshots of the public and non-public video feeds, Speaker Anthony Rota ruled in September 2020.
“For taking screenshots, it is the same as being in the House. If a member takes a picture, they are taking a picture, and posting it just adds to that. Members are not permitted to take photos in the House,” Rota said in an exchange on Sept. 29.
Rodriguez has asked Rota to launch an immediate investigation to determine who took the controversial photo so the House of Commons could then decide on a next course of action.
Rota said he would take the matter under advisement.
In another statement posted to Facebook on Thursday, Amos thanked people who “sent messages of moral support and encouragement in the aftermath of this most regrettable situation.”

He described the past day as having been difficult, both personally and professionally.
“It is most unfortunate that someone shared, without my consent, a photo in which I was changing my clothes,” he said, adding that he expects the Speaker to investigate.

Procurement Minister Anita Anand also expressed concern over the shared image.
Amos was scheduled to appear at an announcement with Anand Thursday morning, but she said he is instead “taking a day” and noted that he has apologized for the incident as an accident.
“I do, as a member of Parliament, have concerns that we should all, as members of Parliament, be respecting the rules of the House of Commons as well as any additional applicable law,” Anand said when asked about the incident.
‘AN HONEST MISTAKE’: Liberal MP William Amos apologizes after appearing stark naked during video conference
Naked MP leads to questions, speculation and jokes
Amos was described by Liberal government whip Mark Holland as an “upstanding member of the House” who made an honest mistake.
“His screen was on while in the middle of getting dressed. It could have happened to any of us,” Holland said in a statement.
“We must know who is responsible for leaking non-consensual images from a private video feed. We must also be assured that the video taken by this person is deleted so that further violations of privacy and decency are not possible.”@booklet {2775, title = {Solution Three}, year = {1975}, note = {

Tuesday 2nd November. Overseal led by MIke G
With a dry sunny day in prospect, an exceptional 19 enthusiasts turned up at the Robin Hood Inn, Overseal, to undertake the 7+ mile (precise measurements differed!) "Overseal’s Emerald Necklace" heritage walk, with a 20th joining us at the half-way stage. The route took us through Gunby Lea Wood, skirted the Grangewood Airfield, along Green Lane, through Wadlands Wood, and on to the site of Wadlands Wharf, the original northern terminus of the Ashby Canal. From here, we broadly followed the Hooghborough Brook, which marks the Derbyshire/ Leicestershire boundary, via Gorsey Leys and Short Heath, then past a 5GW solar park and Seal Wood, picking up the ancient Church Way towards Netherseal before heading back to Overseal via Dead Danes Bottom. At various points, walk leader Mike Gibson waffled about nearby heritage features, noting the contrasting effects of mining subsidence: the “overnight” disappearance of Barratt Pool in the 1950s, and the equally sudden appearance of Broomfields Lake in the 1980s. Back at the very hospitable Robin Hood, which had opened specially for us, we enjoyed a well-deserved drink with our packed lunches, plus some chips (supplied by the pub).

For those interested in operations management, I highly recommend reading his work. I read his first book, The Goal, a few years ago and it remains one of my favourite books of all time.
The book is a novel, but what makes it interesting is not the story itself but the operations concepts the story helps bring to life. The main character runs a factory that is going out of business thanks to conventional concepts of efficiency and productivity.
With the help of a consultant, however, the manager learns a number of unconventional and counter-intuitive concepts that slowly help improve overall performance. It's a quick read, so much so that I recently read the book again since I enjoyed it so much the first time.
Inspired by this book, I also read the sequel, It's Not Luck. While the newer book does introduce a number of interesting new concepts, it's not nearly as illustrative as The Goal in my opinion.
Have you read these books? What did you think?

A shadowy right-wing nonprofit is helping coordinate coronavirus response strategy and promoting the lockdown protests.
Working alongside close allies that have helped coordinate the protests, including Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation and FreedomWorks, Council for National Policy Action (CNP Action) has been hosting conference calls and publishing action memos around reopening states' economies.
CNP Action is the 501(c)(4) nonprofit affiliate of the Council for National Policy (CNP), a coalition of far-right political advocacy and think tank figures that has worked largely behind the scenes since its founding in 1981. CNP’s membership includes conservative Republicans and right-wing extremists who work together to shape policy. Trump allies, including senior adviser Kellyanne Conway and former chief adviser Steve Bannon, were CNP members as of 2014. Vice President Mike Pence and Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow have also been members, according to a recently published book by Anne Nelson.
Since last month, CNP Action has hosted weekly conference calls to coordinate coronavirus response tactics. The first call featured Moore, who founded the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, the Heritage Foundation’s Ed Meese, and Al Regnery, chairman of CNP’s Conservative Action Project and the cousin of prominent white nationalist William Regnery.
Moore has called the lockdown protesters "the modern-day Rosa Parks" for "protesting against injustice and a loss of liberties."
The email announcing the second call, which featured ALEC CEO Lisa Nelson and State Policy Network CEO Tracie Sharp, links to information about an April 21 car protest at the Alabama Capitol Building in Montgomery, organized by the anti-LGBTQ group Eagle Forum. The forum's founder, the late Phyllis Schlafly, was a CNP member, and several current staffers are part of the CNP-connected "Save Our Country Task Force."
The announcement directed readers to the private Facebook page of the group ReOpen PA, which was one of three groups that organized an April 20 lockdown protest at the Pennsylvania state capitol. The other two groups' Facebook pages have been deactivated.
In an announcement of the third call, CNP Action directs allies to send links to op-eds, articles, and social media posts to a TeaPartyPatriots.org email address, indicating that the group is involved in CNP's organizing efforts. "The Save Our Country Task Force will send it out for others in the coalition to share and cross-promote for a multiplying effect," the announcement says.
"We need to share the stories of people who have been affected by the lockdowns, to show that we must be concerned with both sides of this crisis," states the Tea Party Patriots Action website.
The Save Our Country Task Force is an overlapping group, tied closely to ALEC, that's chaired by Trump economic adviser Art Laffer and includes Moore and CNP's president Bill Walton, a trustee of the Heritage Foundation, in its leadership. Laffer sits on ALEC's Board of Scholars and co-authors ALEC’s annual “Rich States, Poor States” publication with Moore. Last year, Trump gave Laffer, a former Ronald Reagan adviser and a supply-side economics evangelist, a Presidential Medal of Freedom.
On the May 4 call, Robert Alt of the Charles Koch-funded Buckeye Institute spoke, and his remarks were posted online.
An announcement for the fourth weekly CNP Action call links to the ReOpen PA Facebook page as well as to a "Zoom Grassroots Briefing on #ReOpenAmerica with Steve Moore and [conservative pollster] Scott Rasmussen." Moore and FreedomWorks have been helping coordinate on-the-ground lockdown protests.
The announcement links to the Open the States website, a project of Convention of States Action, which has also helped coordinate protests. "Check out the Open the States online community to connect with other Americans concerned about how the COVID-19 response is affecting our communities and liberties," it states.
The call took place on May 11 and featured Mercedes Schlapp, a lobbyist and senior advisor to Donald Trump's campaign, and her husband, Matt Schlapp, a lobbyist and the head of the American Conservative Union. No one mentioned the protests, but the speakers disputed the severity of the coronavirus. In one exchange, Walton and the Schlapps tried to downplay the risks of the deadly virus.
WALTON, introducing a caller's question: We're now discovering, as the science rolls out, that there are tens of millions more people infected with this virus than previously imagined.... It's decidedly reduced the lethality of it.
MERCEDES SCHLAPP: ...I think that the reality is, is that when they looked at the modeling...it depends what assumptions you put into the modeling to see, and so I think the thing is, let's go from millions of deaths to having more like, if you can get it down to not millions of deaths we're in better position.
MATT SCHLAPP: ...Even if you’re in some of these really, really serious demographic categories, the survival rate is so high, so we should feel optimistic about it instead of pessimistic.
The call largely revolved around what the Trump campaign is doing to win the election in the face of the current crisis.
CNP did not respond to a request for comment.
Extremists at the Center for National Policy
The Southern Poverty Law Center published a leaked full roster of CNP from 2014, which identified 413 members. "The list is surprising, not so much for the conservatives who dominate it," wrote Heidi Beirich and Mark Potok, "but for the many real extremists who are included."
At the time, populating CNP's executive committee, board of directors, board of governors, and general membership were a number of extremists from hate groups such as the anti-LGBTQ Family Research Council and Liberty Counsel; the neo-Confederate League of the South; and the anti-Muslim Center for Security Policy.
On the board of governors was Michael Peroutka, who was on the board of League of the South and appeared on a white nationalist radio show. Also involved with CNP were Liberty Council’s Mat Staver, who has tried to re-criminalize gay sex; Alan Sears of the anti-LGTBQ hate group Alliance Defending Freedom; Tim Wildmon, president of the anti-LGBTQ hate group the American Family Association; and conspiracy theorists Jerome Corsi, who was investigated in the Trump-Russia probe, and Joseph Farah.
The recent CNP Action announcements link to a Liberty Counsel initiative led by Mat Staver called ReOpen Church.
CNP's founders include multiple members of the conspiracist John Birch Society and Paul Weyrich, co-founder of the Heritage Foundation and ALEC.
As of 2018, the most recent tax year on record for CNP, the board of directors included Tony Perkins, who was president at the time, and Kenneth Blackwell of the Family Research Council. The current board of governors and general membership rosters are unknown.
Perkins will be a speaker during next week's CNP Action call on May 18.
Billionaire Funding
In 2018, CNP Action had a small budget, having spent $127,000 and received only $95,000 in contributions. Bill Walton was chairman, and Blackwell, Adam Brandon-the president of FreedomWorks-and Perkins were directors.
CNP is a much larger operation, having spent $2.9 million and taken in a total of over $3.2 million in 2018.
Richard DeVos, the father-in-law of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, is a former president of CNP, and his family foundation has funded the group. DeVos's parents' family charity, the Edgar and Elsa Prince Foundation, are regular donors, having given money in the 2018 fiscal year, the most recent on record.
The family foundation of Robert Mercer gave $75,000 to CNP from 2013-14. Another right-wing political megadonor, Foster Friess, has been part of CNP and likely funded the organization.
Tim Phillips, a Tea Party organizer and president of Koch's Americans for Prosperity, was listed as a member of CNP's Board of Governors in 2014. The Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, which is now defunct but was run by the Koch family, donated $75,000 to CNP from 2011-12.
Institutional donors include the Family Research Council, the Heritage Foundation, and Judicial Watch, as well as from the donor-advised fund sponsors the National Christian Foundation and National Philanthropic Trust.

Been There, Done that? Share your Experience!Efforts to reform global pandemic preparedness and response are happening too slowly, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response said on Monday.
Presenting the findings of a six-month accountability report, Co-chairs Helen Clark, former Prime Minister of New Zealand, and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former President of Liberia, warned that “uneven” progress in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause illness, deaths and economic losses.
Calling for Heads of State and Government to come together to make faster progress, especially at the UN General Assembly, the two leaders pointed out that with much of the groundwork done, now is the time to end the pandemic and prepare for the next global health threat.
We are encouraged to see movement to address some of the major gaps..— The Independent Panel (@TheIndPanel) November 22, 2021
But the world is losing vital time against a virus that continues to thrive when we don’t work urgently together.
Read the former Co-Chairs' 6-month accountability report pic.twitter.com/ZDhqFBEEad
Immediate action needed
In assessing the progress made since last May, the report covered the areas of leadership and governance, financing, equity, a new legal instrument, and a stronger WHO.
Since May, the report noted that 90 million more people have contracted COVID 19, and 1.65 million have died.
Following the deep-dive into COVID-19 responses, immediate action was recommended for a package of international, interlinked reforms to stop a future outbreak.
“Given the scale of devastation from this pandemic and its continuing impact on people across the globe, the Panel resolved to document fully what happened and why, and to make bold recommendations for change”, said
The former leaders pointed to a speech delivered by Secretary-General António Guterres in September calling for the panel’s recommendations to be a starting point for urgent reforms to the global health architecture.
The co-chairs highlighted a growing momentum for a UN global summit as well as increasing support for a new top-level political leadership Global Health Threats Council to mobilize the strong collective commitment required for global health security, which should provide “much-needed leadership and accountability”.
New financing
The report stressed that “governance without finance lacks teeth; and finance without governance lacks accountability”.
The Independent Panel noted that the Global Health Threats Council should also allocate and monitor funding from a new financing mechanism that supports pandemic preparedness and responses.
At least $10 billion in new financing annually and up to $100 billion in a pool of response funding is needed for a pandemic threat, the report said.
“Our message is simple and clear: The current system failed to protect us from the COVID-19 pandemic”, said Ms. Sirleaf. “And if we do not act to change it now, it will not protect us from the next pandemic threat, which could happen at any time”.Choose a charity and enter your details.

Interactional features in construction grammar(s): a case study on Spanish insubordinate quotative constructions
Abstract
One of the main contributions of constructional approaches to language is to have shown that conventional pragmatic information is not only tied to (simple) discourse particles but also to complex (semi-)schematic patterns (Fillmore, 1996). In this light, the Spanish form que ‘that’ constitutes an interesting case study. In addition to its function as a subordinator marker (1), que can head a main clause (2). This behaviour is consistent with the phenomenon of insubordination (Evans, 2007), i.e., the use of typical resources of subordination in independent clauses.
(1) a. Este es el libro que te recomendé. / This is the book (that) I recommended you.
b. Me dijo que vendría hoy. / He told me (that) he would come today.
(2) - Tienes que llamar al banco. / You have to call the bank.
- Que ya he llamado. / I have already called.
The literature has identified several meanings/functions for complement insubordinate constructions in Spanish, such as third person imperatives, optatives, evaluative modality, signaling relevant information, and quotative evidentiality, among others. This presentation will address the formal and interpretative features that give rise to quotative interpretations of complement insubordinate constructions, as in examples (3-5):
(3) - Voy a cenar.
I’m coming to dinner
- ¿Que vienes a cenar?
That you are coming to dinner?
(4) - Voy a cenar.
I’m coming to dinner.
- ¿Qué?
What?
- Que voy a cenar.
That I’m coming to dinner.
(5) Ha llamado tu hijo. Que viene a cenar.
Your son called. That he’s coming to dinner.
Focusing on quotative interpretations, recent generative approaches (Etxepare, 2008; Rodríguez Ramalle, 2008; Demonte and Fernández Soriano, 2009) have related quotative meanings with the specific position that the initial complementizer occupies in the left periphery of the sentence. However, as I will argue, quotative interpretations only arise in specific interactional contexts. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to identify the relevant interactional and formal features that give rise to quotative interpretations of complement insubordinate constructions in Spanish.
This study is based on the analysis of manually extracted examples (aprox. 130 tokens) from the Val.Es.Co. corpus (Corpus de conversaciones coloquiales, Briz & Val.Es.Co., 2002), containing spontaneous conversations among adults from Valencia (Spain). Each occurrence is analysed taking into account grammatical (TAM, person and number, sentence modality), semantic-pragmatic (modal values, illocutionary force, connective value) and interactional factors (initial vs. mid position in the intervention, initiative vs. reactive intervention, preferred vs. dispreferred response). The results are modelled within the background of constructional-interactional approaches to grammar (Fillmore, 1989; Linell, 2009; Gras, 2011, 2012, in press; Gras & Sansiñena, 2015), which incorporate interactional information in grammatical constructions. In particular, I will argue that specific quotative interpretations (echoic, self-repetition, indirect speech) inherit part of their form-meaning from an abstract quotative construction, while at the same time need to be represented in the grammar due to its conventional interactional properties.

In order to maintain a happy, healthy society, we must evolve with the times, no matter how confusing they may be.
The novel coronavirus has upended the way we do business. Interior gathering spaces must limit their attendance, which puts undue stress on the planning and preparation that goes into any trade show. Last month, we discussed the safety protocols to keep in mind while gearing up for your next expo, and now we want to take a closer look at how exactly that will take shape.
THINK BIG AND SHOW OFF
Your booth design makes a statement, but what is it saying? If you have a complicated message to convey to consumers, you may want to save it for an email blast to your contact list. Trade shows are a visual space, and you want to rule it with the best, brightest images on the floor.
Creating a socially distanced booth means keeping visitors at least six feet away from your display – and one another. Think about the math. If the first attendee is six feet away from you and the next individual is six feet further, you are already playing to an audience that stands 30 feet away if there are only five people in line. How do you reach that respectfully sprawling audience? Make sure your graphics, iconography, and logos can be seen from (social) space.
One important question to ask yourself: Does my booth hold someone’s attention for more than eight seconds? It is an additional metric, assuredly, but it taps into the way your client’s mind works. Studies indicate that the average human brain gets distracted in the span of only eight seconds, so your visual messaging needs to be bold enough to overshadow the din of displays surrounding your booth for at least that duration of time.
Give them a reason to wait in line. Create larger than life imagery that intrigues the entire queue and gets more detailed as they slowly (and safely) make their way to the front of the line.
DOUBLE YOUR IMPACT
One way you can rise above the noise of a “new normal” expo is to literally elevate your design. Create a double deck exhibit and put your most epic messaging at the top to project out to the crowds as they stay at arm’s length.
Use your ascending space wisely. The upstairs lounge can become a wellness center. Stock it with hand-washing stations, masks, bottled water, and socially distanced lounging space where your team members can decompress before maneuvering their way back to the trade show floor.
PROVIDE AMPLE SPACE AND TIME
Traditional marketing strategies sought to create an event around the release of a new product or initiative. The bigger the crowds, the better the reception. But now, crowd sizes are irresponsible and disrespectful. You want your clientele to be happy, healthy, and confident that you respect their wellbeing.
To emphasize your efforts, you need to give your guests not only six feet of space but also plenty of time. Spread out your showings to allow smaller groups to enjoy your exhibit in select pulses. You can customize your messaging to the specified demo represented by each pared-down audience. Post your attendance times online and make it a must-see event without creating a must-avoid crowd.
Time is valuable. An estimated 78% of attendees at a given trade show have traveled over 400 miles to be there. Make the best use of their schedule by being conscientious. Be sure to explain the time limits you are designating for your booth. While you always want interested parties to ask plenty of questions about your product, you can usher them to a nearby area to chat while your teammates hold down the proverbial fort.
The longer one visitor loiters at the front of your queue, the longer your other guests must wait in a line spaced out at six-foot intervals. Waiting is already a chore; don’t make it even more laborious for your clientele.
FLOOR THE COMPETITION
Even though we all love the thrill of a productive trade show experience, it can be tough on the feet. Standing all day takes its toll on the arches, so your choice in flooring should consider your guests’ comfort and safety.
While you may immediately think that carpeting is the best way to welcome visitors, a red carpet can also be a red flag. Carpets are more difficult to keep sanitized, and cleanliness is job #1 in a COVID-era expo.
Consider the benefits of vinyl instead of carpeting. The spongy texture can be forgiving on tired feet, yet it is easier to clean than rugs. There are pros and cons to each flooring approach, so it is advisable to explore your options with a team of experts.
GET ON THE TRAIN
Now that you have designed your booth in the most socially responsible ways possible, it’s time to staff it accordingly. Train your team to understand your distancing protocols, cleaning regimen, and visitor engagement strategy.
A common mistake is to assume that the customer is always right. Wrong. If your staff allows one unruly client to loudly parade around your booth without a mask, their instinct may be to leave him alone to avoid offending a potential sale. But now look at the situation another way: that unmasked client is driving away dozens of other customers who see your booth as a potential threat to their health.
It is vital to train your staff on the proper protocols to defuse a tense situation and keep your clientele safe. For help maneuvering the complexities of the current trade show industry standards and practices, contact the experts at Patriot Exhibit Services. Let’s get social… at a respectful distance.Thompson Recipient of Four Awards at The Road To Indy Championship Celebration
Thompson Recipient of Four Awards at The Road To Indy Championship Celebration
MONTEREY, CA
After a dramatic 2019 Indy Pro 2000 season, Parker Thompson may have missed out on the overall championship title, but his accomplishments on and off the track are receiving strong recognition. On Monday night at the Road to Indy Championship Celebration, the young Canadian was awarded Third Place in the Overall 2019 Indy Pro 2000 presented by Cooper Tires Championship. He also brought home the Hi-Tide Kids On Track Spirit Award, the Tilton Hard Charger Award, and was the winner of the AiM Sports Move of the Year.
Third Place Overall Indy Pro 2000 Championship
After winning the opening two races of 2019, Thompson and rookie team Abel Motorsports were challenged to establish a rhythm in the mid part of the season. Disappointing finishes at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Freedom 90 were a serious blow to Thompson’s championship hopes. As the season progressed, the team re-discovered much of the pace that it had shown on opening weekend. Thompson’s final record for the 2019 Indy Pro 2000 Championship showed two wins and eight podiums. Earning a total of 300 points, he finished third in the overall standings.
Tilton Hard Charger Award
In races throughout 2019 Thompson repeatedly demonstrated an ability to navigate upwards through the field during race action. Most notably, in the final race of the season, he started from the 10th position after a mechanical issue in qualifying. Thompson would move up eight spots during the race to finish 2nd. With a total of 35 passes (seven more than any other competitor), he earned this year’s Tilton Hard Charger Award.
Hi-Tide Kids on Track Spirit Award
Recognizing his involvement both on and off the track, Thompson received the 2019 Hi-Tide Kids on Track Spirit Award as the Indy Pro 2000 driver who most embodied the spirit of hard work and a positive attitude throughout the Road to Indy season.
AiM Sports Move of the Year
AiM Sports nominated the three best overtake maneuvers from the Indy Pro 2000 season for this award, with a fan vote choosing the overall winner. For his exciting pass around the outside of Rasmus Lindh in Turn 4 at the Honda Indy Toronto, Parker Thompson captured the most fan votes and the award trophy.
Parker Thompson
“When Abel Motorsports and I got together at the beginning of the year, we had our sights set on a Championship win. Anytime that you don’t take home the top prize, there is going to be a hint of disappointment. That said, I’m proud of what we accomplished this year as a new team on the Road to Indy. Here at the Championship Celebration, it is great to see our hard work get the recognition it deserves. Bill Abel, Mark Gibbs, my teammate Jacob Abel, and the whole crew at Abel Motorsports were an absolute pleasure to work with all year. I’ve proven that I have what it takes to continue on the Road to Indy, and I’m excited about what opportunities I will find to move forward.”

planted trees not only to provide shade for protection from the heat of summer but also to provide beauty and comfort to
a harsh environment. Farmers planted miles of Osage Orange trees, commonly known as hedge trees, to serve as
fence barriers to keep cattle enclosed and also to help prevent soil erosion. Today with large scale farming and
the elimination of cattle, most of the hedge trees have been dug up. Large stands of Cottonwood trees were also planted
because they were native to the area and easy to transplant growing near the creeks and riverbeds that were protected from the prairie fires.
Today the cottonwood is not planted because of its huge size making it vulnerable to lightning strikes and also because
of the cotton buds that litter the area around the tree in the summer.
By far the most popular tree planted in Minonk when it was established was the American Elm tree. It was a huge
stately tree with a vase type form. Its enormous limbs would stretch out over the streets to form a cathedral type canopy over the
streets of Minonk. The American Elm tree grew fast and provide quick shade for the barren environment. Unfortunately, in the 1950's
the Dutch Elm Disease was imported from Europe and quickly spread among the American Elm killing millions of trees in its wake.
Today there are hardly any American Elm trees left in the Minonk area. There are now some new disease resistant American Elm trees developed
that you can order from online nurseries. The Princeton Elm is one of the few native American Elm trees that are disease resistant.
The lesson learned from the American Elm tree disaster was to plant a variety of trees and not to depend so much on one
tree. Unfortunately, many people planted the fast growing Chinese Elm tree to replace the American Elm. This tree proved
to be short-lived and also lost many branches during windstorms and proved to be a dirty and unsightly tree as it aged.
After a life time of planting trees in the Minonk area, I learned which trees are suitable for this climate. The trees
that I recommend are broken into the following classifications: Deciduous or shade trees, Evergreen trees, and ornamental
trees. Click on one of the categories below to learn more about the trees in the category.>><<

Because there is no such thing. There is no such thing as an objective best, even a subjective best, that can warrant, whichever place of genuine and selfless intentions it is coming from, the simplification of cinema that allows a selection of films to be interpreted neatly, flounced into one cozy corner and asked to wear the most sparkling smiles, and described in brief annotations that render them on near-absolute, holy terms. Even the most seemingly foolproof set of criteria for inclusion cannot wash away the danger carried by this yearly tradition of canonizing.
In the overlay of feeling a sense of community and picking up worthy recommendations from countless lists is the enabling of the inequitable politics of access, which leads to a canon formation that is determined mostly by each film’s marketability, if it is even put on the market long in the first place. It is no surprise that many year-end lists, even those posted by local writers, include films about and by white people. Post-colonialism can never erase the colonial. Post-colonialism is still colonialism. And even if it is not primarily about race, it then becomes an issue of class and gender and ableism, ideologies that those in power hate to be told about.
For what it’s worth, all year-end lists are overt expressions of capital. The ritual is not in the slightest bit different from posting newly purchased items or sharing travel pictures on social media: The tuning of appearance by the author comes with an actual expense. Evidently, there is nothing wrong with that. People are simply enjoying themselves. They are entitled to do it. Let them live. Life on the internet, over the years, has been largely about finding ways to display economic capacity, and capitalism, over the centuries, has been the poison responsible for killing culture and motivating its population at the same time.
But in the process of relentlessly consuming cultural capital, dimly reassured time and again that the rewards of knowledge cannot be quantified, the middle-class might as well acknowledge the power structures underlying their sources of pleasure. For how else can they see over 100 films a year on the big screen without the ability to afford increased costs of movie tickets, food, and transportation, as well as the privilege of being constantly away from work and family, and still have time, at the end of the day and year, to post about them? And since films nowadays are no longer confined to the cinemas, the middle-class, pushed to every direction of the zeitgeist, are also pressured to exhaust other forms of capital to keep up — Netflix, iWant, HOOQ, The Criterion Channel, MUBI, etc., not to mention the dearly beloved torrent sites, offering an endless stream of content beyond one’s lifetime, a library of films downloaded for intellectual security, all of which require wherewithal. Neoliberalism has turned the present-day cinephile into a machine that is given infinite time to consume and less and less time to reflect.
But then again: Why not? The middle-class always feel empowered whenever they ask this question. Because yes: Why not? Why not make lists as a reminder of insufficiency? Why not make lists as a reminder of futility? Why not make lists at a time when human extinction is made certain and celebrate with the little time left? Why not recognize the films that illustrate courage and resistance in an era when the reach of the past is getting wider and the promise of the future narrower? Cinema, however, cannot only be about celebration. There will always be someone who will clean up the mess afterward, who will be mere spectators to the spectacle. “Criticism,” to reiterate what I said in my book, “to be considered indispensable, must first be accountable.” And accountability requires the swallowing of bitter pills.
Nonetheless, we are here. We have dressed up. We have had pre-drinks. We want to have fun. We want to see falling bodies. Like in “Midsommar,” the bloody ritual will be performed no matter what. Given special attention are the local films that have resisted being mere content, those films that have been difficult to contend with and hence have been useful as points of discourse, those films that could have only been made now, and which in the end, in the grand scheme of things, and in my opinion, aware that opinions today can cost lives and futures, make up the hull of essential cinema.

1. “For My Alien Friend” (dir. Jet Leyco)
“For My Alien Friend,” the new film by Jet Leyco, should not come as a surprise considering the terrains explored in “Ex Press” in 2011 and “Bukas na lang sapagkat gabi na” in 2013, both tantalizing in their visions and visuals, films whose heartbeat can be felt in the quietness of the screen. But a surprise it is. “For My Alien Friend” is anything but quiet. It is a tapestry of vigorous sounds and images, tints and textures, stillness and motion, confessions and manipulations, whose raveled threads extend from the most mundane to the most philosophical, from John Torres’s Oulipian wedding vow (“Ito na ang pinakahihintay ko sa buhay ko”) to a comical allusion to Slapshock and Bergman (“God exists 360 degrees like unsolved mysteries and wild strawberries”), from the tenderness of tone whenever the narrator talks about his mom, his sisters, and his nephew in Masbate, to the hilarious personas recorded by his video camera: Reneng Ilaya, Joshua Garcia, Joy Viado, Timmy Harn, Tsarlyboy. For a film so deeply personal it refuses to be exclusive — every second of it burns with life, every moment suffused with color.

2. “A for Agustin” (dir. Grace Pimentel Simbulan)
“A for Agustin” follows Agustin Tiburcio, an Aeta in his late 30s earning a living by making charcoal in Cabangan, Zambales, as he decides to go to school and enroll in a grade one class. His boss cheats him out of wages, he is in debt, and he dreams big for his son. “I told my mother,” he confesses in the beginning, “I want to learn how to read and write.” His mother has died, but his dream has lived on. In class he learns not only how to connect letters and words or add and subtract numbers, but also about the harm his work does to the environment. But what can he do? What other life can he live? The director Grace Simbulan paints a portrait of a man persevering to improve his situation, and she puts on canvas not just his face or body but also his surroundings, the system that continues to oppress him, the chains that continue to tie him to poverty, the hopes that keep him going. After several months, Agustin quits school. He needs to work to support his family. He compares his mind to a setting sun, deteriorating as time goes by. But the film tells otherwise: He is a man whose greatest wisdom is his spirit.

3. “Edward” (dir. Thop Nazareno)
The muffled crying at the end of “Edward” is a most affecting image of despair as much as it is an exhibit of utterly effective simplicity. The scene is executed in three successive shots — a close-up of Edward hugging his bag; a wide top shot revealing he is crouched on a carton that separates his body from the floor; and a wider shot from a different angle showing more crouched bodies in a cramped space — before it cuts to black. All throughout Edward continues sobbing, realizing the certainty of his father’s death. And the people around him, with their dirty feet and tired bodies, the relatives of hospital patients sleeping and awaiting their own certainties, allow Edward this release, understanding his grief by letting him be. It is a short, decisive punctuation to a film that gauges a myriad of high emotions, sliding from a biting commentary on the hopeless public healthcare system to a depiction of a teenage boy’s conflicting relationship with his family and experience of first love, and the movement between the exterior and interior/central and peripheral/social and individual hardly comes across as strained and absurd. Edward’s story, steeped in the harshness of poverty and negligence of the state, feels less a coming of age than a leaving of age, and it is only fitting, at the expense of an audience also reduced to tears, that it ends in kindness.

4. “Cleaners” (dir. Glenn Barit)
When I think of “Cleaners,” the most immediate thought that comes to mind is the experience of seeing it with the high school students from Tuguegarao, Cagayan, at the premiere in Manila. To almost every scene of the film, they responded with the most candid and heartfelt emotion, from hushed delight to raucous laughter, expressing every degree of elation as though they were seeing themselves on the big screen, euphoric as though they were encountering cinema for the first time. They hadn’t for once mentioned how it looked different — how the images were, frame by frame, photocopied and “highlighted” to create the desired appearance and effect, how each visual changed visibly every second — for they were drawn to the stories of the characters on-screen, to the frustrated dancer who shits herself onstage, to the three emo boys and the class president who share an unusual friendship, to the couple who have always felt excluded, to the young politician who has his first taste of corruption. What to us, the learned moviegoer, is the achievement of the film (the process of making it, the boldness of its experimentation, the long history inherent in its production and reproduction of the image, etc.) is to them something integrated into, and not separate from, their idea of cinema. “Cleaners” is not a different film, it is not a film whose form supersedes its content. It is cinema, containing its past, present, and future. As the seven cleaners thrash about the room and “Apoy ng Kandila” starts playing, as they scream one after another and the colors begin to bleed, it struck me how lovely it is to live in this alternate universe where smallness is celebrated, where unknown actors are applauded, when people sit through the entire credits to show appreciation to every single person who worked on the film. And how Glenn Barit, the tiny writer and director, has led a village and brought this universe, this heroic film, to immortal life.

5. “Sila-Sila” (dir. Giancarlo Abrahan)
In my review of “Dagitab” in 2014, I wrote: “Despite the tendency of its characters to talk a lot, there is a quietness that keeps its story steady while in motion, gently peeling away its many layers until it reaches the core.” In my short note on “Paki” in 2017: “[Giancarlo].” These same words, these same sentiments could apply to his third film, “Sila-Sila,” written by Daniel Saniana, and I wonder, the way writers foolishly wonder about the arcana known only to their trade: Could Abrahan have been doing the same film all along? Changing actors, tweaking lines, altering plots? Devising characters with parallel fates who, after a while, realize that they are merely orbiting the same circles right from the outset? And the film concluding cursorily, after a long, distressing course, as they finally grasp what has long been eluding their grasp? Abrahan understands, perhaps better than any other Filipino filmmaker working today, the costs of miscommunication. He shows surfaces, and he shows how surfaces become faces. One can suppose that “Sila-Sila” is a straight film with gay characters, or a gay film with straight characters, simply because it is concerned less with straightness and gayness than with detachment and delusion inherent in any relationship built on love. It is a tragicomedy, a painful one, that demonstrates the predicament of smart people who keep choosing the wrong thing all the time, and when they finally choose what is right, it hurts them the most.

6. “Isa Pa, With Feelings” (dir. Prime Cruz)
One workable theory is that mainstream films abide by a calculated measure of erasures. These erasures must not be confused with ambiguities, because they leave visibly hollow spaces in the narrative, unexplained to not spoil the intended dramatic turn of events, and are expected to be forgotten to appreciate the film fully. In “Isa Pa, With Feelings,” for instance, the crucial trajectory of passing the board exam suddenly disappears and its significance is diluted to pave the way for the romance. One also wonders: How can a car accident be forgiven easily? More pressingly, how can these two millennials, an apprentice and a teacher, afford living in a condominium in the city and go to places conveniently with their cars? Where are the storylines that untangle this? Yes, magic. And the film has loads of it, most of which coming from Maine Mendoza and Carlo Aquino, individually and as a couple, each exceeding the roles given to them. Thankfully, the story opens credible scenarios involving the anxieties and difficulties faced by Deaf people, circumstances that are given depth and vulnerability, although still riddled with tropes of toxic masculinity and the sacrificial woman. Whenever the director Prime Cruz tries to hit the mark — with those Christmas lights, with the use of Unique Salonga, with the dancing that inevitably reminds one of “Sleepless” — he hits it gently. Those short and poignant moments when the hearing audience is put in the Deaf person’s shoes work like a current passing on skin. Literally electrifying.

7. “QCShorts”
The six films in the 2019 QCShorts program resemble stars of varying brightness, flickering in their understated luster, and as a whole make up a vivid constellation. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, with a distinct voice and personality that translate into an absorbing experience. Each also finds a way to rupture facades of realism and discover fresh ways of telling old stories. The worlds contained in them, and the key visuals that define them — the disorienting moods and motions in “SPID” (dir. Alejo Barbaza and Mervine Aquino); the close-up of scars and the ear cleaning in “Here, Here” (dir. Joanne Cesario); the uproarious jingle and Phyllis Grande’s poker face in “Excuse Me, Miss, Miss, Miss” (dir. Sonny Calvento); the heartbreaking conclusion of “Judy Free” (dir. Che Tagyamon); the smell of objects in “Isang Daa’t Isang Mariposa” (dir. Norvin De Los Santos); and the television falling from the sky in “Tokwifi” (dir. Carla Ocampo) — are rooted in the disquiet of and discontent with the present. In some instances, there is joy. In most, there is defiance. In all, there is wonder.

8. “No Data Plan” (dir. Miko Revereza)
“Fuck, this is it,” tells Miko Revereza. “This is where they catch up to me.” An undocumented Filipino immigrant traveling on the Amtrak train from Los Angeles to New York, he recounts, through his Instagram stories and shaky voice, his close brush with the border patrol officers in Buffalo. He shares how this fear has been hovering over him for more than 20 years, not the moment of his death like the man in "La Jetée," but just as intense: the moment of his arrest. This happens near the end of “No Data Plan,” his feature-length debut, and is the second time in the film when the audience hears his voice and the first time it bares his face, as though he has finally come to terms with being identified. For the remainder of the film his stories are told through subtitles, “voiceless,” perhaps similar to the way he sees himself in a foreign country. Train tracks, container vans, the light from the window, bodies getting on and off the coach, people walking and waiting, tickets wedged in corners, a broken lightning cable — these quiet images populate the screen, occupying his thoughts on a tense journey. In brief moments when voices are heard, they are not Revereza’s. The ticket officer demanding identification, the train driver speaking, the aunt narrating stories from the Philippines, a girl talking about Drake being a Scorpio, fellow passengers thinking of home — these sounds teem with life and fill him with hope and anxiety. For the rest of the trip, we hear only the motions around him: traffic, passing, silence, the vessel containing him, the skittering of his thoughts. The nowness of “No Data Plan” does not only come from the present when people document nearly everything with their devices; it also emanates from the crises experienced by every Filipino forced to find their place and forge their identity in hostile lands.

9. “Babae at Baril” (dir. Rae Red)
Gender is never an easy conversation, and films that rise to the challenge of discussing it run the risk of raising the ire of particular audiences, including the community they seek to represent. The online reviews of “Babae at Baril” as well as conversations with friends about the film, many of whom view it negatively, suggest the large-scale strain on independent female directors who, on top of having fewer opportunities to produce films, struggle with relatively intolerant reception to their work (something, if it must be pointed out, most male directors, regardless of the stories they tell, do not experience). “Babae at Baril” does not set out to be strictly about female empowerment, yet because the woman is put at the center and is being violated on many levels, the narrative is expected logically to set things right. The film doesn’t, for it can’t — How can it? The language of narrative cinema is male. Certainly it is a problematic film weakened by overstated genre devices and flimsy execution. But it is able to capture the spikes and labyrinths of any serious gender discussion, how problems breed more problems, how there is no way to solve the problem of violence if the woman seeks to solve it within the framework of patriarchy. Because of the preconceived notions of what a female-led film should be, one casually overlooks the attempt of “Babae at Baril” to historicize and locate her experience of aggression on the larger social scale. One casually overlooks the sleight of hand performed by the music and sound design and editing. One casually overlooks the magic that happens when Asin’s “Magnanakaw” stitches the seams. One casually overlooks the voice of Rae Red, rightfully angry and angered, raring to learn and do more.

10. “Spring by the Sea” (dir. Aleia Garcia)
The title, “Spring by the Sea,” is the English translation of Yanbu’ al Bahr, a city in western Saudi Arabia known for being a Red Sea port and the residence of many expatriates working in the oil industry. This is where the director, Aleia Garcia, grew up, along with her 11 siblings, as one by one, starting from her then-21-year-old father (who was part of the large number of labor exported during the Marcos era) they left the Philippines and built a home of their own in the Middle East. Whereas the audience does not see any of Miko Revereza’s family in “No Data Plan,” with the absence functioning as a significant articulation of his migrant experience, Garcia is very generous in showing her own, whether through old home video footage shot by her father over the years and decades, birthdays, farewells, parties, anniversaries, or through Garcia’s own recording of her trip back to Yanbu, greeted by her siblings at the airport. With a cheerful simplicity that cuts deep in its compassion, “Spring by the Sea” delivers a picture of Garcia’s big family and their understandings of distance, intimacy, and home, profoundly moving in its depiction of love and affection in the mundane. It contributes to the discourse on the ever-shifting concepts of diaspora, particularly the idealization of homeland, and through a study of the self it turns into an illuminating piece of historical essay.<<

New York City
NYC boasts the oldest St. Patrick’s Day parade, which might be the oldest parade of any kind. First held in 1762, it’s the largest as well. While there are loads to do in New York City during St. Patricks’ Day, the parade is the pinnacle event. Find it along 5th Avenue between 44th and 79th streets.
In 2021, there will be a small and symbolic parade on March 17th, but expect to watch it virtually this year through the NYC St. Patrick’s Day Parade Facebook page here.
Where to Stay: Omni Berkshire Place
San Francisco
Until I started doing my research, I had no idea that San Francisco was a top place to visit for St. Patrick’s Day. According to Visit USA, more than 100,000 people attend the San Francisco parades and festival the weekend before the holiday. And, just like in New Orleans, don’t miss the St. Patricks’ Day Block Party by the Irish Bank.
Where to Stay: Hilton Union Square
Boston
There’s no doubt that Boston also shares in. the St. Patrick’s Day festivities. Head to South Boston for authentic Irish festivities include a parade. Also, plan to get your Irish history on with a guided walk along the Irish Heritage Trail, with over 200 years of Irish History in Boston.
As with the other cities, there is no parade in 2021. However, walking the trail is a popular St. Pat’s Day activity.

Where Can you Celebrate St. Patrick’s Day?
A few other cities I found where you can celebrate St. Patrick’s Day in style are Denver, Kansas City, and Philadelphia.
Do you have a favorite place to celebrate? Let me know in the comments!Howdy Ram Fam and coffee lovers alike, how are we feeling today? With Fall having arrived I know the seasonal colds are upon us like ghosts in the night and so a nice hot cup of coffee might take the chill away. Today I recommend trying the hot Salted Caramel Mocha from Starbucks or even a cup of homemade coffee with a splash of your favorite creamer and this magical ingredient called sweet cream foam with caramel drizzle over the top ( Both of which can be found in HEB).
Have you ever sat down to complete an important task and then found yourself washing the dishes or digging deep into the YouTube rabbit hole? Today let us talk about procrastination! To be perfectly honest this episode was also put to the side for some time and I'm here to talk about why that is okay. No, I am not supporting procrastination every day all day but I am trying to remove the stigma of procrastination being commonly associated with shame or guilt. The feeling that the entire world is judging you and there is no escape from your “bad habit”. The truth of the matter is that some of the most successful people in the world procrastinate and yet remain at the top while there are still others who procrastinate and fail. Why this is, is more closely related to negative emotions and how we choose to react to it rather than repeated bad habits. In fact, chronic procrastination is more closely related to perfectionists rather than those who are lazy. In cases such as these, Sirois, a psychology professor at the University of Sheffield in England, said that perfectionists should strive to understand that it’s OK if the completed task isn't perfect, and having that mindset will quiet anxiety that might otherwise lead to procrastination. Those who procrastinate often are found to have very clean and tidy rooms because the menial task of cleaning is less unpleasant than whatever other task needs to be done. In order to combat this one should try to focus on the pleasant outcome of the unpleasant task to replace the negative emotion with a more positive one. As well as avoiding trying to see too far down the road of the future since that is the recipe for procrastination.
The opposite of procrastination is motivation. Unfortunately, motivation is a lot harder to come by than procrastination so the question is how do we keep a hold of it and harness it? To some extent, motivation is very personal to the individual so what may work for one may not work for someone else. Start by asking yourself what is the root of your demotivation? It could be fear, setting the wrong goals, lack of clarity or blurry values, lack of challenge, and burnout.
When you are facing fear it slows you down making you hesitant and more cautious and while this can be considered a good thing at times in this instance it could be rooted in an over-exaggeration of your imagination. Try facing your fear head-on and asking yourself what you are afraid of and if it is something that could really come true.
In today’s world, we are motivated by goal setting so much that it has almost become somewhat of a trend so it’s easy to get lost in everyone else’s goals that we think we should be setting for ourselves as well. Remind yourself of what is essential to you and what you want to accomplish for your own benefit.
If you lack clarity or have blurry values try straying from the familiar because sometimes this is caused by becoming too accustomed to what makes us comfortable so when faced with something new it is unfamiliar and unclear to us. Look to understand not only what you do not want but also specifically what you do so that you can familiarize yourself with that outcome and feel more comfortable in the journey to achieve that goal.
The lacking of the challenge is not as common, since fear is created from too large of a challenge but if the challenge is too small it is easy to grow bored of it so it may be time to re-evaluate the goals you are setting and try to make them more difficult, as the saying goes if you shoot for the moon and miss you will still land among the stars.
Lastly and most commonly, burnout. This is when you have lost all your energy for your social life, professional life, and/or academic life because you have been pushing yourself past your limits and there is no more fuel to burn. Listen to yourself, if you need to sleep, sleep. The work will be there for you after. If you do put yourself first then it will be even harder to accomplish what is important to you in the long run. Life is a marathon not a sprint and even the greatest athletes need to rest and drink water before.Did you download Citizens 2 perhaps?

villages, rivers and lakes--would form one of the largest objects which the eye, or even the imagination, can steadily grasp at one time. But such an object, grand and extensive as it is, forms no more than the forty-thousandth part of the terraqueous globe; so that before we can acquire an adequate conception of the magnitude of our own world, we must conceive 40,000 landscapes, of a similar extent, to pass in review before us : and, were a scene, of the magnitude now stated, to pass before us every hour, till all the diversified scenery of the earth were brought under our view, and were twelve hours a-day allotted for the observation, it would require nine years and forty-eight days before the whole surface of the globe could be contemplated, even in this general and rapid manner. But, such a variety of successive landscapes passing before the eye, even although it were possible to be realized, would convey only a very vague and imperfect conception of the scenery of our world; for objects at the distance of forty miles cannot be distinctly perceived; the only view which would be satisfactory would be, that which is comprehended within the range of three or four miles from the spectator.
Again, I have already stated, that the surface of the earth contains nearly 200,000,000 of square miles. Now, were a person to set out on a minute survey of the terraqueous globe, and to travel till he passed along every square mile on its surface, and to continue his route without intermission, at the rate of thirty miles every day, it would require 18,264 years before he could finish his tour, and complete the survey of “this huge rotundity on which we tread :”.
--so that, had he commenced his excursion on the day in which Adam was created, and continued it to the present hour, he would not have accomplished one-third part of this vast tour.
In estimating the size and extent of the earth, we ought also to take into consideration, the vast variety of objects with which it is diversified, and the nume
rous animated beings with which it is stored; the great divisions of land and water, the continents, seas, and islands, into which it is distributed; the lofty ranges of mountains which rear their heads to the clouds; the unfathomable abysses of the ocean; its vast subterraneous caverns and burning mountains; and the lakes, rivers, and stately forests with which it is so magnificently adorned ; the many millions of animals, of every size and form, from the elephant to the mite, which traverse its surface; the numerous tribes of fishes, from the enormous whale to the diminutive shrimp, which "play" in the mighty ocean; the aerial tribes, which sport in the regions above us, the vast mass of the surrounding atmosphere, which encloses the earth and all its inhabitants as
" with a swaddling band." The immense variety of beings, with which our terrestrial habitation is furnished, conspires, with every other consideration, to exalt our conceptions of that Power by which our globe, and all that it contains, were brought into existence.
ISAAC ASHFORD.
Rey, GEORGE CRABBE.
To pomp and pageantry in nought allied, A noble peasant, Isaac Ashford died. Noble he was, contemning reflexion's sigh: A friend to virtue, his unclouded breast No envy stung, no jealousy distrest; Yet was he far from stoic pride removed ; He felt humanely, and he warmly loved: I marked his action when his infant died, And his old neighbour for offence was tried; The still tears, stealing down that furrow we knew None his superior, and his equals few; But if that spirit in his soul had place, It was the jealous pride that shuns disgrace; A pride in honest fame, by virtue gained, In sturdy boys to virtuous labour trained; Pride in the power that guards his country's coast, And all that Englishmen enjoy and boast; Pride in a life that slander's tongue defied, In fact, a noble passion, misnamed pride.
In times severe, when many a sturdy swain Felt it his pride, his comfort, to complain; Isaac their wants would soothe, his own would hide, And feel in that his comfort and his pride. I feel his absence in the hours of
prayer, And view his seat, and sigh for Isaac there; I see no more those white locks, thinly spread Round the bald polish of that honoured head: No more that awful glance on playful wight, Compelled to kneel and tremble at the sight, To fold his fingers, all in dread the while, Till “ Mister Ashford" softened to a smile;
No more that meek and suppliant look in prayer, Nor the pure faith, to give it force, are there; But he is blest, and I lament no more, A wise good man, contented to be poor.
THE COMMON LOT.
JAMES MONTGOMERY. woe—a smile, and tear!-
Oblivion hides the rest.
The bounding pulse, the languid limb,
The changing spirits'.
The rolling seasons, day and night,
Sun, moon, and stars, the earth and main; Erewhile his portion, life and light,
To him exist in vain.
He saw-whatever thou hast seen;
Encountered-all that troubles thee : He was,—whatever thou hast been;
He is, -what thou shalt be.!
SORROW FOR THE DEAD.
