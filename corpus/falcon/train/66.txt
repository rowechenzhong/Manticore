The 3 Biomes
App Name: Boundless Biomes
Mentor(s): Aman S.
Team Members: Minh-Quan, Thanh
App Description: The 3 Biomes team created the ‘Boundless Biomes’ application to increase the knowledge of a young audience about different types of biomes and the many animals that inhibit them. We wanted this application to be fun and easy to use, all the while being educational. We have many different aspects to this game. This game includes 3 different levels, which take place in different biomes (forest, ocean, and desert) and different animals that inhibit those biomes. Each level has its own challenges. For an additional challenge, we also included a trivia aspect to this game in which users can select to answer questions about different biomes and animals. Our goal was to create an environment where the user feels like they are in the biome that they are playing in. Therefore, we put an emphasis on audio and images. We created all the images ourselves using pixelating software to create an old, classical feel to the game. This is the type of creativity that we hope sets us apart from our competition. We spent our 10 weeks working hard on this application and hope you have fun learning from it!
Technical Components Used: The team used a software called Piskel to create our own background and sprite images in a pixel form to create a classical feel to the game. We were inspired by games from older generations like Mario and wanted to be set apart from our competition using our creativity. Therefore, we spend a lot of time creating all the images that went into this application. We also carefully hand-picked audio files that created the illusion that the user was in the biome that they were playing in so that we could make it as life-like as possible. These audio sounds included background audio for forest, ocean, and desert biomes.

App Name: Monster Math Go
Mentor(s): Andrew S. & Max R.
Team Members: Sierra, Javier, Leon
App Description: Monster Math Go is a mathematics-based educational app to teach elementary school kids addition in a fun way! The game consists of 10 levels with the player having 3 lives to complete them all. Like the popular app Pokemon Go, players are faced with a math problem and a monster to capture with three different balls (that correspond to answers) used to capture the monster. Balls can be flung towards the monster to capture it; if the answer is incorrect or if the timer runs out, a life is lost. But if the answer is correct, the player moves on to the next level. When all the lives are lost, the game is over, but if the player makes it to the last level and correctly answers the question, the player wins the game and the final score is shown. In both cases, players can go to the main menu or play again.
This app will surely be beneficial to students who want to practice their addition skills while on the clock, so we hope you see the educational benefits in it and enjoy the game!
Technical Components Used: The technological components utilized were multiple timers (to account for screen changes and time limits when answering questions), movable images in the app, and buttons to switch between screens.

The game starts by showing an introduction screen and will give users two options: 1) start playing the game and 2) pull up the information page to learn how they can play the game. Once users press the play button they will be navigated to another screen will they’ll find a dice in the middle of screen, which let them roll the dice and start one of the Math practices by chance. If the dice rolls to multiplication, a new screen pops up and shows a Cheetah and bunch of animated answers on the screen. There are four buttons allowing user to navigate the Cheetah and to catch the correct answer based on the provided question. To make the game fun and more competitive we create Pacman characters and make them follow and catch the cheetah wherever it goes. As the time goes on and they answer more questions there will be more Pacmans appearing on the screen. Eventually if one of the Pacmans catch the cheetah, user loses and will be navigated to the level screen (the screen with dice) to play again or close the application. If they answer all the questions correctly, they win and will be navigated back to the level screen. If the dice rolls to division, a screen pops up and shows a basketball court, a basketball player and bunch of hoops with different answers in them. User supposed to answer questions (which will be displayed on top of the screen along with the current score) by making a fling movement on the ball. They should shoot the ball with their finger to the correct hoop and answers and once they answered all the questions correctly, they will get switched back to the level game.

What this means in everyday terms is that these are exploits out in the world RIGHT NOW that allows an attacker to gain access to your phone. Access to things such as:
- A device’s camera
- A device’s microphone
- Messages
- Text
- Call history
- And more
The scariest part of this, is that you don’t have to do anything at all to fall victim to it. Nope, NOTHING. No clicking on a suspicious link, or opening a bad email attachment. That’s what “zero-click” means: no user interaction is required. The “zero-day” term in the article means that this vulnerability was being active exploited even before Apple knew about it.

CenterPoint Energy is an electricity distributor that delivers energy to customers in Texas and stresses the importance of being safe, accountable and respectful. For more than 130 years, according to its website, CenterPoint Energy in Texas and its parent companies have strived to be at the center of consumers' lives and the core of the energy value chain.
In CenterPoint Energy service areas in the state of Texas, residential and commercial business consumers can count on competitive energy supply rates, advanced technology and a committed customer service team. CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries maintain and operate 5,000 miles of electrical wires and poles that connect power stations across the country to more than 5 million residential and commercial customers in metropolitan areas, including Houston and Minneapolis, and states such as Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Minnesota.
Browse CompareTexasEnergyProviders.com or call in to discover options for energy supply in your neighborhood. Find a city below to read more:
CenterPoint Energy began as Houston Gas Light Company in 1866, and after a series of mergers became the company that customers in Houston and surrounding areas in the state of Texas know for energy distribution. The company distributes metered electricity to roughly 2 million residential consumers on behalf of 85 retail electric providers, a majority of which call Texas home.
In 2002, the energy market in Texas became deregulated and retail electric providers began competing to offer the lowest rates on the supply of electricity. As a utility, CenterPoint Energy in Texas does not sell electricity; it delivers electricity to homes or businesses and utilizes a growing intelligent grid to help customers become more educated on their consumption of energy.
Along with electric distribution, Texas CenterPoint Energy gives its customers the tools they need to better understand their electricity usage and to prepare themselves for situations such as power outages, natural disasters and electricity theft.
CenterPoint Energy rates cover the cost of transmitting and distributing energy to your home or business. You can't compare CenterPoint Energy rates to any other company because no other company in the Houston area performs these duties. You also need to remember that you can't compare CenterPoint Energy rates with supply rates from retail electric providers – these two entities provide completely different services for electricity customers!
Customers who reside in the CenterPoint Energy territory should know when it is appropriate to call the CenterPoint Energy phone number for assistance. Because the utility operates the poles and wires that run through your yard, if you experience a downed power line or power outage, you should use the CenterPoint Energy phone number to request service.

Personal Injury Law Firm – Law Offices of Ramtin Sadighim

Personal Injury Attorney Near You
Redondo Beach, a city in Los Angeles County with some 70,000, is indeed a region of inter-connected beaches and a surf-and-sun lifestyle.

Yes, motor vehicle accidents involving autos, motorbikes, cyclists, trucks, buses, and, of course, pedestrians range from minor dings all the way to personal injuries that often includes wrongful death.

In addition, Joe Ellis has been appointed as the team president.
A press conference announcing these moves is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. MT this afternoon. As vice president of football operations, Elway will lead the search for a new head coach and will oversee the coach and general manager Brian Xanders.
This move had been speculated for some time and gained steam around the time the Broncos fired Josh McDaniels. While much remains to be seen how well Elway will work out as an executive in the NFL (he had experience with the AFL's Colorado Crush), from a PR standpoint this is a huge win for the Denver Broncos. The quarterback who led the Broncos in their glory days in the 1990s to two Super Bowl championships returns to save a team that has foundered for the last decade. The guy who led "The Drive" will now attempt one in the front office.
Elway should be in Atlanta on Friday to conduct an interview with Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator Mike Mularkey for the Broncos' head coaching position.Teleportation spell teleports the caster and hisher companions to a location.

The pair—along with four members of their secret service detail, riding Cannondale hardtails—cruised around the paved trails of Cape Henlopen State Park in Delaware, before a meeting with Biden’s transition team. Members of the media and photographers took videos and photos of the group—in this video, you can hear Yahoo News reporter Brittany Shepherd asking, “Are you any closer to making a cabinet decision?” to which Biden responds, “Yes.”
Sign up for Bicycling All Access, and we’ll let you know every time Biden is spotted on a bike
Biden appeared to be riding a Trek FX hybrid, and a well-loved one from the looks of it. From what we could see in the photos, it had a Bontrager cockpit, linear pull rim brakes, and a rusty chain well past its prime. He came prepared for the ride with a headlight, and all of the bike’s reflectors are still intact (he’s the president-elect, he can do what he wants)..
We can’t tell exactly what bike Jill is riding, but it looks to be similar to Biden’s—something functional and affordable. Affixed to her handlebar is an Axiom Seymour Handlebar Bag created with fabric made out of recycled fishing nets, as well as a small headlight. While Biden’s bike has a rigid fork, Jill’s is equipped with an RST suspension fork, leading us to believe she likes to get a little more sendy than the president-elect.
Jill is wearing a Liv Rev Comp MIPS helmet and a jacket with the logo of Pelotonia, a charity ride in Ohio that raises money for cancer research, at which Biden gave a send-off speech in 2017. And everyone riding in this group is wearing a mask, which is important, given the rising cases of COVID-19 around the country.
The last time the media was shouting to Biden on a bike was in August, when he was riding the same Trek in Delaware. Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked the then-candidate if he’d chosen a running partner yet. Biden said he had, and when Doocy asked who, he jokingly responded “You!” (spoiler alert: it was not him).
We’re stoked that our president-to-be and future first lady are into cycling, and will be on high alert for any more #RidinWithBiden in the news.2010 is nearing… just a normal rant and nothing much I really hate to put so much words in a blog. I hate being long winded and am trying to see what is in store for me next 2011. I am glad I have plans but not for so in the time being. My search has ended. I know what I want to seek out in life. Time is essential to your very own being. Don’t let time steal your dreams. Do it and worry about it later. ;)
I am here to feel what I ought to write it down. I have seen many bonds, relationship, friendship come and go and it is really seriously a fleeting moment because they are leading their own lives one by one and are soon dispersing in their very own world. As the years goes by, we age, we grow, we think alot of stuffs ahead but should put into action to see what happen next or just forget it and move on.
I shall end my rant here and there are alot of plans for me this November and December months to come. Preparing for 2011. How about you all guys and ladies? I hope you have found something in life.
Till then have a great months that is nearing 2011.I traveled to Mexico for my dental care, and this is what happened. Spoiler alert, it went better than expected.
In 2016, some 1.4 million Americans crossed the border into Mexico for dental care, and the market has been growing at a rate of 15% to 25% a year, according to BuzzFeed. And 2016 was a year when the Affordable Care Act was in full swing, so more people had health coverage. We can anticipate those numbers growing exponentially.
I am at the age where I have to start replacing fillings, and sadly, my kind family dentist sold his practice to become a missionary. I don’t care for his replacement, a real corporate fellow whose recommendations usually involve extracting a tooth, putting in a post, and taking out a second mortgage on my home to pay for it all.
Why is it so Expensive?
It is never anything like a simple filling — ever. It is always doom and gloom, dire warnings that I am going to have to have a root canal and crown because my tooth is going to shatter “very soon”, but the promised giant crack never materializes. It seems all my teeth have invisible faults the size of the San Andreas that only he can see. In fact, I have gone my entire life without a root canal, I am the rare breed of individual that flosses daily, but my doctor is convinced that I am just six months away from needing major work on every tooth he examines.
I called practices in my area looking for a new doctor and the experience aptly demonstrates one of the more subtle issues I have with American healthcare. They treat you like you are a problem — not a customer — and taking your money is doing you some sort of favor.
The front desk staff, obviously hurried, rapid fired off the first available appointment, as in take-it-or-leave-it. “Your initial consultation will be $150, is that a problem?”
“Oh, I don’t think I mentioned that I just had a cleaning and x-rays,” I said. “I need the doctor to look at one area and tell me if this is something he can address with a laser. If he can, I will gladly have him do the work, but some dentists have said they couldn’t. I am pretty sure this is only going to take 15 minutes of chair time based on other visits I have had.”
If not a free consultation, I was expecting it to be about $50.
Silly me.
“Yeah, I got that, but it is still going to be $150 for him to look at it and give you an opinion,” she snapped back. She sounded very annoyed, like this was an objection she heard dozens of times a day, and obviously, the patient’s unwillingness to fork over their demanded ransom was the problem. Like how unreasonable was it for me to object to paying the equivalent of $600 an hour for someone to diagnose a problem that I didn’t even know if they had the proper equipment, much less skill to do?
Let’s just stop here.
I wouldn’t mind paying so much for dental care if the costs were reflected in the technology.
I would gladly pay $150 if the doctor was going to perform some sort of tooth MRI or mouth CAT scan and give me a definitive answer as to what would solve the problem. But I know his staff will take a $15 x-ray and the dentist will spend 5 minutes sticking my gum with a pointy metal probe until he draws blood and then will make an educated guess which will be the most profitable procedure for his practice. Those guesses have cost me visits to five specialists, two crowns, about $8,000 and the problem has never been fixed. No one is willing to guarantee their work, either.
Short of flagrant malpractice, the consumer has no recourse for ineffective treatment when it comes to healthcare.
The appointment was wasn’t going to result in any laboratory tests or treatment, $150 was for 15 minutes of the dentist’s time. The average doctor doesn’t earn that kind of money.
Why hasn’t technology in American dentistry made this the standard for diagnostics? This is a shot of a screen in Mexico. I didn’t get anything like this in the US the last time I was diagnosed with a sinus infection, much less by my dentist.
Venture Capital Increases Costs
American dentists are still doing most things pretty much the same way they did 20 years ago. The equipment has not changed. The techniques are the same. Why have costs increased so much?
According to an article in The Huffington Post, steep increases are the result of compensation that have resulted in dentists earning more money on average than many physicians.
I blame the “corporatization” of dentistry, franchised Managed Service Organizations or Dental Service Organizations owned or backed by venture capital or equity firms which have sought to maximize profits. It’s like the mortgage industry and insurance lobby formed an unholy alliance and the resulting offspring was Dr. Gordon “Greed is Good” Gekko in a white lab coat.
“Um, $150 is what I just paid for a cleaning and x-rays,” I said, shocked that they weren’t trying to entice me into the office for what would be at least $700 in work, and I am assuming that would be on top of his consultation fee.
And let’s face it, “consultation” in the US usually is a euphemism for a hard sell that would make a used car salesman seem like they were giving free puppies to orphans. For every uninsured American adult, an estimated three will not have dental insurance, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation and perhaps this is because ultimately they can’t afford the treatment even with the scanty coverage offered by most providers.
“Do you want the appointment or not?” Her customer service skills were amazing.
I have friends who have family in Mexico and they sing the praises of dentists in Mexico as being more professional, better trained and a lot less expensive. They wait for trips back home to have any work done.
I decided to give it a shot. Let’s go to Mexico for Dental Care!
Going to Mexico to see the Dentist?
There is this idea that everything south of the border is third world. To many Americans, the idea of going to the dentist in Mexico evokes pictures of a sweaty guy in a lean-to with a hammer and chisel. As it turns out, going to Mexico for dental care was the best decision I have made in a long time!
More than ten years ago, I had eye surgery in Mexico. Nothing as mundane as laser surgery, but cutting edge implants by the best cornea surgeon in the world who saved my vision — using a procedure that was at that time not only unapproved in the US by the FDA, but also unheard of by my American physician who was also the chair at a prestigious teaching university. Every American doctor I saw, including specialists, were unaware of treatment options abroad. There are advancements in healthcare that are unknown in America and unless patients do their own research, they likely will receive whatever is considered standard in the US which is often times sorely lagging behind the rest of the world.
I was impressed by the advanced technology, level of care I received in Mexico and the way the doctor seemed so relaxed and. . . well. . . kind. Perhaps this can be attributed to the culture, or maybe it is a different way of training doctors, but I have noticed a stark difference in attitude south of the border.
The big issue blocking me from returning for healthcare was the idea of driving my vehicle there and crossing the border alone.
Coyote Dental and Dentists in Mexico
I signed up with Coyote Dental, a service that arranges your appointment with vetted, quality dentists in Mexico. They even have a shuttle to drive you from Tucson to Nogales, Mexico, and they escort you across the border. The company is owned and operated by a semi-retired American dentist, Dr. Mark McMahon, which seemed like another unstated recommendation to me.
What was most important about Coyote Dental’s service is they escort you across the border, make sure you get back, and then return you to Tucson regardless of how long your appointment takes. This was a big issue for me being a female and traveling alone to Mexico. I also wouldn’t have to wait months for an opening and I could get an appointment in a week. As I quickly learned, going to Mexico for my dental care was going to be an easy process.
Having an escort is key if you don’t know the extent of the work you need done and whether you will need pain medication following a procedure. And if you don’t have extensive work, you can get tacos around the corner. The fee I paid for transportation was $50 and even though I had only one filling replaced on my first visit, all in all it was still about half the cost of the so-called American consultation. Plus, they suggested a new treatment they felt would permanently solve my nagging gum problem.
While I felt it was a reasonable price for a round trip to Nogales, and I saved a ton of money, I must point out though that the fee does not include a shot of tequila and I intend to discuss this with the company on my next trip.
How Visiting the Dentist in Mexico Works
When my appointment day arrived, I gathered my driver’s license and birth certificate and met the van at a restaurant in Tucson. From there, I enjoyed a leisurely drive to the border with two other passengers. We were on our way to getting our dental care in Mexico
The clinics are located right across the border to Mexico, so even those with limited mobility won’t find the trip particularly arduous. Everything was wheelchair accessible.
The clinic was more upscale than any clinic I have visited in the US — marble, cherry wood, the kind of expensive details you would find in a cosmetic dental practice. The staff was friendly, unhurried, dressed professionally and everyone spoke English. I have to tell you, everyone looked like they were wearing brand new scrubs.
The place was spotlessly clean, including the restrooms. That is something about my American dental office I didn’t like. When the new doctor took over, I noticed there was dirt in the corners of the rooms, the bathrooms were not clean and it made me wonder if they approached sterilizing their equipment in the same slipshod manner. *Shivers*
In Mexico, no one treated me like I was an inconvenience. There were no lectures, no disapproving looks, no exasperated sighs. I did not wait more than a few minutes to be taken in the back. It didn’t feel like the appointments were overbooked, either.
What Happens at the Dental Clinic in Mexico
My first stop was a small room where a panoramic x-ray was taken. Rather than jamming sharp pieces of film into my mouth, I was instructed to bite down on a small piece of plastic between my front teeth. It was fast and hassle free and we ended up with a complete image of my smile.
I was led to an examining room and a dentist entered immediately. The x-ray was on a large video screen in front of me. The doctor did a thorough exam, offered his suggestions, and then patiently explained all my options. “We can try a filling, but you should be prepared that I could get in there and discover you need a root canal.” Luckily I didn’t. When does that happen in the US?
I was told the price for each procedure up front, then my doctor wrote it down for me along with my treatment plan spanning the next two years. He also told me how long I could wait to have the work done and in what order I should do it. There were no hysterical warnings of imminent structural failure. Then they replaced my filling and I was done.
The cost was about 1/3 what I would have paid in the States. For comparison, my former dentist charges $150 for a filling and in Mexico, it was just $45. There was no upsell, no trying to get me to agree to “smile brightening” treatments, no telling me I should replace my bridge work.
A Lab on the Premises
The other benefit of going south of the border is that they make all porcelain crowns on site so you don’t have to wait weeks while walking around in a temporary. You can actually watch your crown being produced in the office. They use a computerized system so no impressions with a gloppy mold to make you gag — everything is the finest state-of-the-art equipment.
I found the equipment interesting and I asked to see their on-site lab. My American dentist could not use his laser because he misplaced some part to it and couldn’t be bothered to get a replacement.
Now, I want you to imagine what you think a dental lab in the US must look like before we move on to our tour. I was so impressed, I took photos.
The lab in Mexico was nothing like anything I have ever seen. First, there was a staff of about eight people working in various areas, like a clean room and a computer lab. They were busy, but it was neat and orderly. They had technicians that looked like dental graphic designers creating prosthetics on a computer monitor. They had a big 3D printer that made models of skulls and teeth. There was enclosed equipment churning out partials, another for veneers, and people were quietly working. Management was on hand directing the staff and overseeing the work.
Going Home
After paying with a credit card, we all gathered a few hours later and crossed the border together. I showed my driver’s license, chatted with the border guards long enough to prove I was an American and we drove home. I did not have to show my birth certificate.
Would I do it again? You bet!! I have several fillings that need replacing and I plan on returning.
But next time, I am getting the tequila.Nevada

+ Special Bonus Presentation – 3 Sisters on 7 summits
Growing up with their family in the remote Rolwaling Valley in Northeastern Nepal, Nima Jangu, Tshering Namgya and Dawa Futi Sherpa watched their father and brother pursue a life of climbing supporting large expeditions in the Himalaya but they couldn’t have imagined a life of climbing for themselves. As a result of encouragement from their brother Mingma, a few crazy conversations amongst themselves, and some quick planning, in May 2021, Nima Jangmu, Tshering Namgya and Dawa Futi found themselves summiting Chomolungma (Mt. Everest) together as a team. In doing so, they set a new record as the first three sisters to reach the highest point on earth.

the us Environmental Protection Agency (epa) (hc) and oxides of nitrogen (nox) emissions by about 54,000 tonnes a year.
"The new rules considerably advance pollution standards for motorcycles. (These vehicles)...will run cleaner than ever before, and America's health and environment will benefit," asserted epa administrator Mike Leavitt. In December 1999, the agency had formulated some of the world's most stringent norms for other passenger vehicles as well.
The current norms will also include previously unregulated motorcycles with engines of less than 50 cubic centimetres (cc), and new evaporative emission standards to control the loss of gasoline through walls of fuel hoses and fuel tanks. Unlike in the past, nox levels too will be regulated. At the same time, manufacturers have been given the flexibility to balance out more polluting motorcycles with cleaner ones so long as the overall fleet's limit is within the emission norms.
The standards will be implemented in two phases. While tier 1 would come into force from the 2006 model year, tier 2 will take effect in 2010. Significantly, the norms are being put in place despite two-wheelers accounting for a fraction of the total mobile source emissions in the us. The country's motorcycles are currently responsible for 0.6 per cent of the mobile source hc emissions, 0.1 per cent of mobile source nox and less than 0.1 per cent of mobile source of particulate matter.
This is primarily because the total number of highway motorcycles in the us -- at approximately 4.3 million units -- pales into insignificance when compared with the 8.4 million passenger cars sold in just 2001. However, bikes produce more harmful emissions per kilometre as compared to a passenger car. Hence the need for standards.
In stark contrast, two-wheelers in India constituted 81 per cent of the total vehicles sold in 2002-2003. To be sure, the country's emission norms for this segment were among the strictest till now. But the future standards being set by the us and European countries are likely to be more severe.
For the period beginning 2005 and up to 2008, two-wheelers in India -- irrespective of vehicle size -- have to meet the hc+nox limit of 1.5 grammes per kilometre (g/km). epa has stipulated a level of 1.4 g/km from 2006. This will be optional for bikes up to 279 cc because very few motorcycles fall in this category. The same limit will, however, be mandatory for bikes in the 280 cc and above segment. The us also has separate norms for hc as opposed to India. Further, in the us standards' next phase, the hc+nox level for 280 cc or bigger motorcycles will be 0.8 g/km. The eu, too, has fixed a 0.8 g/km limit for hc and a 0.15 g/km level for nox for 150 cc and above vehicles from 2006.
These figures illustrate the resolve of governments across the world to promote environment-friendly technological development even in a sector which is a non-issue for them.
For its part, India is yet to notify norms beyond 2008 though they have been proposed in the country's Auto Fuel Policy. All that the Union government is willing to state is that "progress in terms of meeting the proposed emissions standards for 2008 will be reviewed in 2005". Clearly, some revving up is in.- Features

The same sentiment is found in verse 9 which is tied directly into the death of the plant that was made by the Lord. While discussing this verse with Sergio, he said, “It doesn’t seem to make sense. How could it be good to destroy something the Lord had just made?” His question immediately resolved the enigma of Jonah 4 for me, and thus the intent of the whole book.
I spent that entire night laying on the couch and thinking through chapter 4, verse by verse and word by word. The next day, I called Sergio back, we talked, and I asked him to read verses 5 and 6 and see what problem might be perceived in them. He read them out loud as I listened, and then he said, “I never noticed that before.” He had made the realization that there is a seemingly contradictory thought in them. I needed to tell him nothing.
From there, I simply asked a few questions, not intending to reveal the mystery, but to see if he could figure it out on his own. If he could, then my thoughts would be confirmed. He did, and they are. His face lit up, and he said, “This is amaaaazing” the way that only Sergio can. Today, you are going to hear a completely different translation of several key verses than you have probably read before, but they are in line with the Hebrew. Why is this so?
Text Verse::5-7
A man of understanding will attain wise counsel, to understand a proverb and an enigma, I often seek Sergio’s wise counsel. He understands Hebrew far better than I, and he has valuable insights into many things.
But the question for us today is, “Why has this passage not been evaluated before as we will evaluate it today?” Well, there are a few reasons. First, translators translate passages with the intent of them making sense. A translation that makes no sense… well, it makes no sense. Translators are not always commentary scholars.
Scholars on the other hand look for facts, figures, and details, and will often override translators through a process of explanation, but not normally through a process of translation. What they say may take pages to explain a single verse that translators are limited to. However, what they say must make sense or it is just vain rambling. And there is a lot of that among scholars.
In the case of Robert Young, his translation is correct, but it makes no sense, and so it has been overlooked. It doesn’t explain anything, and it doesn’t even clear up anything. It complicates things. Despite his accurate translation, he does nothing with the rest of the passage, and so the enigma remained.
And finally, there are presuppositions as to what is being said. Concerning verse 11, the final verse of the chapter and the book, there are biases by Jewish commentators which have to be overlooked, and then there are presuppositions about what is being said that have to be ignored.
And so, unlike a translator who is looking to make quick, clear sense out of something maybe cumbersome, and unlike a scholar who is trying to give facts, figures, and historically relevant commentary, and unlike those with biases or presuppositions, there is a fourth group. It is those who use translations as far as they can be used, and who ponder the words of scholars for background information, and then they add in a final element.
This element is the key to all of Scripture; it is “How does this point to Jesus and what He is doing in redemptive history?” Jesus told us that He is what Scripture speaks of, and therefore Jonah chapter 4 is included in that.
And so in order to understand what this chapter is saying, we have to step out of a comfortable translation, and go beyond the logic of scholars. Biases and presuppositions also need to be quashed. We have to look for the key; we must look for Christ. This is how to understand an enigma.
Chapter 4 of Jonah has been so misunderstood, because people have inserted their presuppositions into the text. Because of this, it is a book which ends in a seemingly odd way. Many people say it ends anticlimactically. The Lord goes into great detail preparing object lessons for Jonah, and these object lessons have been misunderstood, leaving the chapter ending with one impression when a completely different one is intended.
I am thankful to Robert Young for having the integrity to translate several verses without presuppositions. And, I am grateful to Sergio for being Sergio. I am blessed that there is someone who also likes to think outside the box. He has helped confirm the intent of many other passages we have looked at together over these past six years. Wonderful things are to be searched out in the Lord’s superior word. And so let’s turn to that precious word once again and… May God speak to us through His word today and may His glorious name ever be praised.
I. Jonah’s Object Lesson (verses 5-11)
5 So Jonah went out of the city
va’yetse yonah min ha’ir – “And went Jonah from the city.” With his prayer complete, with his petition made, and with the question from the Lord now asked, Jonah departs from the city. He has accomplished his mission, even if it was unwillingly. And he went out of the city to see how the Lord would act upon the prophetic utterance he made. The Lord’s question to Jonah was, “Is doing good a reason for you to be furious?”
This leaves just one possibility – Nineveh will be spared. But he does not leave the area and head back to Israel. His hope is that Nineveh will not be spared, and that only he, a picture of the people of Israel, will alone share in the blessings of Yehovah.
5 (con’t) and sat on the east side of the city.
va’yeshev mi’qedem la’ir – “…and sat on east to city.” There is an importance in identifying the east side of the city. If there wasn’t, it would simply say, “…and sat outside the city.” North, south, east, or west – what difference does it make? However, the east is specified. Jonah willingly goes to the east side.
The word is qedem. It is the place of exile, as in the exile from Eden. It is the place of wandering and the place of disobedience to God, as in the time of Cain and in the building of the Tower of Babel. It is the place where destruction comes from, as in the east wind which brought in the withering drought upon Egypt during Joseph’s time, and the plague of locusts during Moses’ time.
It is also the front, or absolute forepart of a place, as in the entrance to the tabernacle. And, it is the time before, the past times, the ancient times as known to the Lord, such as in the prophecy to the King of Assyria in 2 Kings 19. In Habakkuk 1, the prophets asks –
“Are You not from everlasting (mi’qedem),
O Lord my God, my Holy One?” Habakkuk 1:12
The richness of the word qedem, or “east” in Scripture concerns a study of no minor significance, and the word calls out for thought concerning Jonah’s place of sitting.
5 (con’t) There he made himself a shelter
va’yaas lo sham sukkah – “…and made to there tabernacle.” The people of Israel are famous builders of tabernacles, because they were instructed to build them annually during their feast of Sukkoth, or “Tabernacles.” The sukkah is a place of shelter and protection. It can be for livestock, people, or even metaphorically of the sukkah of the Lord in the heavens. Jonah built one for himself there, outside of Nineveh.
5 (con’t) and sat under it in the shade,
v’yeshev takh-teiha ba’tsel – “…and sat under its protection.” Sitting implies abiding and being set. There in his sukkah, he abides, and the purpose of Jonah building the sukkah is confirmed now in that it provides tsel, or shade. The word comes from tsalal which indicates “shadowing” as in hovering over. Thus, he is covered and shaded. However, shade in Scripture is used metaphorically to indicate protection. This is seen in Psalm 91 –
“He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High
Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
2 I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress;
My God, in Him I will trust.” Psalm 91:1, 2
5 (con’t) till he might see what would become of the city.
ad asher yireh mah yiyeh ba’ir – “…until which might see what will come to pass in city.” There, protected by the covering of his sukkah, Jonah watches and awaits what will come to pass. He is safe, but what will happen to the city? Because what happens to the city is what will happen to its inhabitants.
6 And the Lord God prepared a plant
Vay-man Yehovah Elohim qiqayon – “And appointed Yehovah Elohim qiqayon. So far, Yehovah, or the Lord, has been referred to in verses 2, 3, & 4. Elohim, or God, has been referred to in verse 2. Now Yehovah Elohim or, the Lord God, is referred to. It is He who does the preparing. Why the change? And what indeed has He prepared? A qiqayon?
It is a word which is referred to for the first of five times, but all will be in this passage. It is found nowhere else, but rather it is unique to this passage of Scripture alone.
It is variously translated as “plant,” “leafy plant,” “vine plant,” “gourd,” “little plant,” “vine,” “pumpkin,” and “ivy.” It is even footnoted as a castor oil plant. I asked Hideko to see what the Japanese version said. It said togoma, and she had no idea what that meant even in Japanese. So she read the margin note and then said, “Aaaaahhhhh, I know what it is… it’s the gourd.”
Which is correct? The answer is, “Any of them and none of them.” Nobody knows what a qiqayon is. Every translation is speculation. However, translators need to put something, and so they make a best guess. And so, the proper translation would be to simply say qiqayon. It is a name, and therefore a transliteration is all that is needed. However, qiqayon comes from the word qayah, or “to vomit.” In fact, when I asked Sergio to read it in Hebrew, the first thing he thought was, “Why is this speaking of vomit?”
The word qi means “to vomit” (the action). The word qa means “vomit” (the thing), and yon is a suffix which signifies a process, or denoting action or a condition. It is where our suffix –ion comes from. Lexicographers say that –ion goes back to the Latin, but they missed that it goes back further… to Hebrew. An example of this suffix is found in Amos 4:6 –
“‘Also I gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities,
And lack of bread in all your places;
Yet you have not returned to Me,’
Says the Lord.” Amos 4:6
The word “cleanness” comes from naqah, clean. Adding –yon to it causes it to become niqayon, the state of being cleaned, or “cleanliness.” As Sergio noted, “A great example where you add “ion” and it transforms the verb into a noun that describes the result of that verb!” And so with qiqayon, you have a word which, in essence, says “This is the condition of vomiting vomit.” What on earth is this referring to?
6 (con’t) and made it come up over Jonah,
va’yaal me-al l’yonah – “and caused to ascend over to Jonah.” This process of something undesirable now covers over Jonah. How do we know it is undesirable? Because every instance of vomiting in Scripture is taken in a negative sense, with the exception of the result of Jonah being vomited onto shore in Chapter 2. However, for the fish, it was certainly undesirable. After Jonah’s shower, he was probably OK with it though.
6 (con’t) that it might be shade for his head
lih-yot tsel al rosho – “…that it might be protection for his head.” When I asked Sergio to read verses 5 & 6, it was with an understanding that it seemed there is a contradictory thought in them. Without explaining that to him, when he read these words he said, “I never noticed that before.”
He had clued into what was otherwise skimmed over by him in the past. Why does Jonah need shade for his head when he just built a sukkah for the purpose of, and which was realized in the last verse, giving him shade. Verses 5 & 6 are last two uses of tsel in the Old Testament. What is being relayed to us with this repetition of tsel?
6 (con’t) to deliver him from his misery.
l’hatsil lo me-raato – “…to deliver from his wickedness.” The word ra here is variously translated as grief, discomfort, misery, evil, fatigue, evil case, etc. Translators choose based on what they believe the intent of the passage is expressing. The correct word for Jonah may be “misery,” but for us, it is “wickedness.” This is an object lesson for Jonah in which he is miserable, and yet an allegory for us to consider and understand concerning that which is evil. The qiqayon is given to deliver him from his wickedness.
6 (con’t) So Jonah was very grateful for the plant.
Yonah al ha’qiqayon simkhah gedolah – “Jonah of the qiqayon joyful whoppingly.” Despite having built a sukkah which was for the purpose of shading himself, he is whoppingly elated at having the qiqayon which is providing protection. What about this vomiting of vomit makes him so happy?
Can it merely be coincidence that in verse 2:10 there was the fish which vomited Jonah out onto dry ground and then there is this descriptive word being used in an object lesson for him to see and understand? The Lord has used him in this story to teach himself, and thus Israel, a lesson. Will he learn? Will they learn?
7 But as morning dawned the next day God prepared a worm,
vay’man ha’elohim tolaat baalot ha’shahar la’makhorat – “And appointed the God a worm as arose the dawn to next day.” Now another thing is prepared. But this time it is not by Elohim or Yehovah Elohim. Instead it is by ha’elohim, or “the God.” As not one of the 21 translations I referred to includes this, I assume neither does yours. Therefore, please place the word “the” in front of “God” in your Bible. We are being told something.
“The God” appointed a tola, or a crimson grub worm, at the shakhar or dawning, of the mokhorath, or “next day,” to do something. This is, as Albert Barnes notes, “…in the earliest dawn, before the actual sunrise.” Three words are used for the last time here. It is the last of 25 times for the shakhar, the last of 43 times for the tola, and the last of 32 times for the mokhorath.
Why is it so specific about the time of the day? It could have just said, the next day, couldn’t it have? But a specific type of worm is named, and a specific time of day is too. These are specific for a reason. This is some object lesson!
7 (con’t) and it so damaged the plant that it withered.
va’tak eth ha’qiqayon va’yibash – “…and struck the qiqayon and withered away.” This was indeed some tola! That worm didn’t just damage the vomiting vomit, it completely destroyed it until it was dry. What on earth is the God telling Jonah here?
8 And it happened, when the sun arose,
vay-hi kizroakh ha’shemesh – “And happened as rose the sun.” The word “rise” is zarakh, which indicates to shoot forth beams, appear, and thus to rise. At this moment something new occurs…
8 (con’t) that God prepared a vehement east wind;
vay’man Elohim ruakh qadim kharishit – “…and appointed God wind east deafening.” Now we return to the word Elohim without the article. He appoints an east wind, but it is an east wind which is described by a word, kharishi, used only here in the entire Bible. It is so obscure that the great Hebrew lexicographers, Brown-Driver-Briggs denounce the meanings provided by other scholars as unacceptable, and then they say, “…meaning wholly dubious. We make no attempt to explain.”
I, however, have translated it, as did James Strong, from the word kharash, a word bearing several meanings. He chose “scorching” to which I disagree. It means “deafening.” This is connected to the word kheresh, or “deaf.” And this is exactly what is being pictured, as you will see. In the Middle East, the east wind is known as the khamsin. It is an extremely hot wind that is described in the book River God by Wilbur Smith as follows –
“The king’s voice was frantic, but I paid it no heed, for there was a mighty roaring in my ears, like the sound of the khamsin wind…”
Concerning the word manah, translated here as “prepared.” This is the last time it is used in the Old Testament. It means “appointed.” It was used four times in Jonah – 1:17, 4:6, 4:7, and 4:8. He appointed the dag gadol or “fish whopping” to swallow Jonah. He appointed the qiqayon, or “state of vomiting vomit” plant. He appointed the tola, or “crimson grub worm.” And He appointed the ruakh qadim kharishit, or “deafening east wind.”
8 (con’t) and the sun beat on Jonah’s head,
va’tak ha’shemesh al rosh yonah – “And struck the sun on head Jonah.” Without the protection of the qiqayon, Jonah is now struck on his head by the direct beating of the sun. It is an extremely sad state of affairs for Jonah, who has received pain and anguish while waiting for what he thought would be the destruction of the Gentiles there before him.
8 (con’t) so that he grew faint.
va’yitalaph – “so that he veiled himself.” Every single translation of this verse except Young’s says “fainted,” “grew faint,” etc. But, Young’s says, “…and he wrappeth himself up.” He did this because the same word, alaph, is used in Genesis 38:14 this way –
“So she took off her widow’s garments, covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place which was on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him as a wife.”
The word alaph is used here for the last of only five times in the Bible. It comes from a primitive root which means to veil, or cover.” Jonah did not faint; he veiled himself as an Arab would in the oppressive khamsin.
8 (con’t) Then he wished death for himself, and said, “It is better for me to die than to live.”
va’yishal eth naphsho la’mut va’yomer tov mo-ti me’khaiai – “…and begged with his soul to die, and said, ‘Good my death than my life.’” Jonah came to the point where his misery had overcome him. Life had become so miserable, that death was preferred over life itself. It is a repetition from verse 3 even before the object lesson was presented.
9 Then God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?”
va’yomer Elohim el yonah ha’hetev kharah lekha al ha’qiqayon – “And said Elohim unto Jonah, ‘The correct, burning anger to you for the qiqayon?’” As we saw in verse 4, all translations except Young’s say something like, “Is it right for you to be angry.” But this is incorrect. Young’s translates this verse “Is doing good displeasing to thee, because of the gourd?”
However, this seems to make no sense. “Why would the destruction of the qiqayon be good, and why would it seem evil to Jonah?” This is what Sergio asked. Unless one understands the object lesson, it seems mistranslated, but it is not.
Notice here that in contrast to verse 4, which this verse parallels, it says Elohim instead of Yehovah; God instead of the Lord. Why would this be? The answer lies in who God is in relation to the people of the world, and who the Lord is in relation to Israel. The destruction of the qiqayon is what is right, and it is even necessary. Jonah, however, disagrees…
9 (con’t) And he said, “It is right for me to be angry, even to death!”
va’yomer hetev kharah li ad mavet – “And said, ‘good, burning anger to me, unto death.’” He stubbornly confirms that in the case of the good of what he is being presented, he is furious about it. He would rather die than see this good come to pass. It is a sentiment seen to this day with the people of Israel – 2000 years later.
This verse contains the last time Jonah’s name is mentioned in the Old Testament. He was the son of Amittai from Gath Hepher. In picture, he is Dove, the son of Truth of the Lord, from the Winepress of Shame. The dove, the symbol of “mourning love,” is perfectly realized in Jonah here. With the death of the qiqayon, the object lesson is ended. Now the Lord speaks again…
10 But the Lord said, “You have had pity on the plant for which you have not labored, nor made it grow, which came up in a night and perished in a night.
va’yomer Yehovah atah khasta al ha’qiqayon asher lo amalta bow v’lo gidalto sebin laylah hayah u-bin laylah abad – “And said Yehovah, “You pitied on the qiqayon that no did perform, and no magnified, which a son of a night was, and a son of a night perished.’” Only Young’s gives a literal translation of this verse. It says “son of a night,” to indicate lasting only one night.
The qiqayon, the state of vomiting vomit, came up and Jonah did not perform or fulfill in that process. Instead, it came as a son of the night and it was destroyed as a son of the night. This is the last of 11 uses of the word amal, or “labor,” in the Bible. It is used only by Solomon except this one time. Each time he uses it, it is in relation to futile labor, except when it is in relation to what God has done.
11 And should I not pity Nineveh, that great city,
va’ani lo akhus al Nineveh ha’ir ha’gedolah – “And I, no pity over Nineveh, the city the whopping.” Jonah is worried about the qiqayon, even to pity. But the Lord contrasts that pity to His pity over something of true value. The great city whose name means “Offspring’s Habitation,” has human inhabitants; people whom He created who He feels are far more worthy of His pity. Verses 10 and 11 have the last two of 23 times that khus, or pity, is used in Scripture. And what a marvelous use of them to show the contrast between man’s priorities and that of the Lord!
11 (con’t) in which are more than one hundred and twenty thousand persons
asher yesh bah harbeh mishtem esreh ribo adam – “which exists in greater from twelve myriads man.” The translation as 120,000 is to be rejected. The term here is “12 myriads.” In 1 Chronicles 12:37, 120,000 people are noted as meah v’esrim aleph. Here the number is mishtem esreh ribo. Obviously they don’t sound the same because they are not the same. Instead of 120,000, it says “12 myriads.” The word ribo indicates an indefinitely large number. Again, only Robert Young rightly translated these words.
What I will propose to you now is, as far as I know, without precedent. No scholar that I am aware of has come to this conclusion, and yet it is exactly what is being relayed. One has to presuppose that this is speaking of the people in the city. It is not. Scholars have struggled over the number, knowing it is not correct. The size of the city does not justify this amount of people.
And so they back-interpret the words to mean “innocent people” meaning children who have not participated in the sins of the city. That is without basis, and it is not supported by Scripture which teaches inherited sin in all people. When the Lord destroys a city, he makes no distinction between young and old. But how else to explain the obviously incorrect number and translation?
Rather than referring to those in Nineveh, it is speaking of the twelve tribes of Israel. As soon as Sergio said, “This doesn’t say 120,000, but 12 with a descriptor attached to it, the entire passage fell into place. The phrase is comparative, not descriptive. In other words, the city of Nineveh, capital of, and thus emblematic of the great Assyrian Empire, is greater than the 12 tribes of Israel. This comparison continues in the final words of the book of Jonah…
*11 (fin) who cannot discern between their right hand and their left—and much livestock?”
Asher lo yada ben yemino lishmolo u-behemah rabbah – “…which no discern between their right hand and their left; and many ignorant fools.” This verse is set in contrast to Jonah 3:7. It is speaking of the people of Israel, not those in the city. In the giving of the law, the term “to the right hand or to the left” was spoken to Israel, indicating that they were to know what is right and to do it –
“Therefore you shall be careful to do as the Lord your God has commanded you; you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.” Deuteronomy 5:32
This is repeated again in Deuteronomy 17 –
“According to the sentence of the law in which they instruct you, according to the judgment which they tell you, you shall do; you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left from the sentence which they pronounce upon you.” Deuteronomy 17:11
And it was repeated to them in the chapter of promised blessings and curses as well in Deuteronomy 28:14 –
So you shall not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day, to the right or the left, to go after other gods to serve them.”
The people in the city were given the word of the Lord, and they discerned what was right immediately. Israel had been given the word of the Lord for hundreds and hundreds of years, and the record shows their continual failing to discern right from left.
And the record also shows one more thing about them which is realized in the words u-behemah rabbah, or “and beasts abundant.” This is speaking of the foolish people of Israel, not the animals of Nineveh. The entire passage is speaking metaphorically. The animals in Nineveh were adorned in repentance along with the people of the city. However, time and again, in the psalms, Ecclesiastes, and the prophets, the ignorant and foolish of humanity are compared to beasts –
“I was so foolish and ignorant;
I was like a beast before You.” Psalm 73:22
The passage in Isaiah 30 concerning the “beasts of the South” is speaking of the foolish people of Israel, and Peter uses the same term, “beasts,” in 2 Peter 2 when speaking of the foolish and perverse. Paul and Jude likewise use this terminology. Again, this is speaking of those in Israel who were ignorant fools.
The seemingly anticlimactic finish of the book of Jonah is, instead, a strong and resounding rebuke to the people of Israel. Correctly translated, it says, “And should I not pity Nineveh that great city, in which exists more than twelve myriads of man, who cannot discern between their right hand and their left, and many ignorant fools.” Israel failed to heed; Nineveh repented. It is a picture of Israel and the church. One rejected the Lord and His salvation, one quickly and decidedly turned to both.
Now, before we have these verses explained to us, I’d like you to note that in the story, God specially prepared four different things to guide or control Jonah. It says that He “appointed” a fish, a plant, a worm, and an east wind.
Each of these is a different agent of God’s creation – one a sea creature, one a plant, one a land creature, and one form of natural phenomena. In other words, the Bible is recognizing that God is sovereign over each of these aspects of creation. In essence, all of creation is at His bidding in order to accomplish His plans in the process of redemption. With that in mind we are ready to evaluate the meaning of the rather difficult verses found here in Chapter 4.
A fish to swallow a man at sea
A qiaqyon to cover that same man for some shade
A worm to destroy the qiqayon, it withered completely
Thus You destroyed what You once had made
And then a deafening east wind, it rages aplenty
While the sun beat down on the man’s head
There he sat in complete misery
There the man said he was better off dead
But is it right that he should be so upset?
Is it right to be so angry about the qiqayon?
The man says, “Yes!” “Certainly!” And, “You bet!”
But maybe he wouldn’t if he knew what was being shown
And so now we will look into what these things mean
Yes, now we will be shown was is meant to be seen
II. The Object Lesson Explained
Jonah has pictured both Christ and His work and Israel, here he is a picture of Israel, the people. Their history is being depicted in the object lesson given to him. In verses 1-3, Jonah was angry at the repentance of the Gentiles, wishing their destruction. In verse 4, he was asked, “Is doing good a reason for you to be furious?”
In order to wake him up, He is next given a snapshot of their entire history. Jonah, picturing Israel, went out to the east of the city. As I said, it is the place of exile. It is the place of wandering and the place of disobedience to God. It is the place where destruction comes from. Israel stems from Adam as do all people. All are in exile and are separated from God, Israel and Gentile alike.
There Jonah built a sukkah, a tabernacle. It is a dwelling place. Abraham was brought into Canaan by the Lord and lived as pilgrim, as did Isaac, and Israel. They established themselves as a people. Canaan the land, and Israel the people, became their own dwelling place and place of protection.
While there in the land, and even in Egypt, they dwelt as a people separate from the Gentiles. They simply lived and watched what would happen to the world living around them, just as Jonah did from his sukkah. But the Lord had more for them than a dwelling which they established.
In verse 6, Yehovah Elohim, the Lord God, prepared a qiqayon. It is the Law of Moses, prepared by the Lord God. This is why the full term Yehovah Elohim is used there. It is the covenant Lord who is the Creator God who established and oversaw it for them. He formed it as a protection over them. The Ten Commandments were given from Yehovah Elohim, the Lord God.
However, the name applied to this symbol tells all we need to know. The qiqayon, or state of vomiting vomit, was intended as a means of being restored to God, where life would result from death, if the law could be but fulfilled. The Lord said in Leviticus –
“You shall therefore keep My statutes and My judgments, which if a man does, he shall live by them: I am the Lord.” Leviticus 18:5
Paul cites this verse in Romans 10. But nobody could fulfill the law. And so God’s law was only given as a temporary measure, not as a permanent fixture. It was only a protection, a guardian, for Israel. Paul explains this in Galatians 3:23-25 (NIV) –
.”
The qiqayon was Jonah’s guardian; the law was Israel’s. This is why the term tsel, or shade, was used in both verses 5 and 6. Israel has built its own protection, but the Lord built a further one for them, there in the east, or in the place of exile and judgment.
However, the law was never meant to last. It was temporary and found an end in the tola. The question is, “Which is greater – the great shading qiqayon, or the worm?” Well, what does the tola picture. I asked Sergio that, and without batting an eye, he said, “Christ.” He had paid attention to the Exodus sermons. In the 22nd Psalm, a messianic psalm written by David which speaks of the work of the Lord, including His cross, we read this –
“But I am a worm, and no man; (tola)
A reproach of men, and despised by the people.
7 All those who see Me ridicule Me;
They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,
8 “He trusted in the Lord, let Him rescue Him;
Let Him deliver Him, since He delights in Him!” Psalm 22:6-8
Concerning the tola, Henry Morris writes the following –

This is why the term ha’elohim, or “the God” was used to describe the preparation for the tola. The God, the personal God, personally attended to the preparation of the body for Christ to dwell in and accomplish His work. This is seen tola came forth to do its work with specificity. It said, “as morning dawned.” It was “in the earliest dawn, before the actual sunrise.” That is the resurrection of Christ as seen in the gospels. Matthew says the women went to the tomb as the day began to dawn. John says that it was still dark when they saw the stone rolled away. Christ’s work was finished in His work on the cross, but it was proven so in the resurrection. The law was struck and died in that glorious moment.
From that time on, only judgment can result from remaining attached to the law. This is why vomit is always negative in the Bible with one exception, vomiting Jonah onto the dry ground. Jonah pictured Christ in death and resurrection. The grave could not hold Him and it literally had to spew Him out of its grasp.
However, the law, the state of vomiting vomit, still holds sway over those who rely on it. Peter, speaking of false teachers, including those who would set aside the grace of Christ and return to the law, are like dogs who return to their vomit. When they do so, only judgment can be the result.
This is seen next in the lesson with the east wind. This was prepared, not by ha’elohim, or “the God,” but rather simply by elohim. The personal connection to Israel’s God is lost. Now, they are under God’s judgment, and thus the definite article is dropped from the narrative.
This east wind is described with that exceedingly rare word which nobody has been able to adequately describe, but of which I correctly translate as “deafening.” I chose this because the root implies it, and because the symbolism is realized in Paul’s words to the Jews who rejected Christ. At the end of Acts, he cites Isaiah, saying –
“Go
And again, Isaiah, in a passage speaking of the coming Messiah, says this –
.” Isaiah 4:18-20
Further, sent His east wind, the wind of judgment upon Israel. It is the time of their being cursed for rejecting Christ. It is the Gentile-led church age, symbolized by Nineveh’s repentance and turning to God. They are the offspring of God through the work of Christ, just as the name Nineveh means. It is a marvelous picture which is being developed for us to pay heed to and to understand.
The word for the east wind, kheresh, is tied directly to the kharishi, or “deafening” wind which Jonah experienced. The people had grown deaf to the Lord’s call because they clung to the law. The judgment of God’s raging and deafening east wind was a self-inflicted wound. And the next judgment follows along with that, the beating of the sun on Jonah’s head.
In the law, the Lord promised Israel to be the head, not the tail if they were obedient to Him. As they rejected Christ, they brought the curse down upon themselves. The Sun of Righteousness, Christ, instead of favoring them, beat down on their head. In response, what did Jonah do? He veiled himself even further. He wrapped himself in the law and added in the Talmud. Paul describes the veil –
:12-16
After the east wind, Jonah cried out that death was more preferable than life. He had clung to the law, a law which Paul describes as bringing death, because through it sin is made manifest. And when sin enters, death is the result. He explains this throughout his letters, but sums it up with these words –

Jonah, typical of Israel, testifies that he would rather die under the law than live under the grace of Jesus Christ. This is why in verse 9 God, not the Lord of verse 4, asked, “Is doing good a reason for you to be furious because of the qiqayon?” The question is not asked from the covenant Lord Yehovah whom they have rejected. It is asked from God the Creator.
They are outside of the covenant and are being asked directly, “Do you find the ending of the law, which was accomplished by My Son, a reason to be furious?” Their answer, to this day, is Jonah’s response, “Yes, doing good is reason to be furious because of the state of vomiting vomit.” They believe they can fulfill the law and reenter God’s presence on their own.
Christ is rejected by them, and they are out of His favor because of this. This was seen in the contrast between Jonah and the sailors before he had his epiphany. The Gentile sailors had said –
“We pray, O Lord, please do not let us perish for this man’s life, and do not charge us with innocent blood; for You, O Lord, have done as it pleased You.” Jonah 1:14
However, the Jews said this at Jesus’ crucifixion –
“His blood be on us and on our children.” Matthew 27:25
The Gentiles had come to fear the Lord because of Jesus; the Jews had rejected Him because of Jesus. And so, they will have to endure many troubles before they are brought, once again, into covenant relationship through the New Covenant. Thus the object lesson ends and the Lord speaks his final words.
Yes, it is Yehovah, the covenant Lord, who completes the words of the chapter. He signifies that His pity has gone out to the Gentiles, represented by Nineveh, or “Offspring’s Habitation.” The Gentile world has become the Lord’s offspring through faith in Christ.
In His last words to Jonah, and thus to Israel, He notes Israel’s pity on the qiqayon, the law, which he says they have been unable to even perform. The word He spoke, amal, is used only by Solomon, and always to indicate the vain labor of man apart from God. His words concerning the qiqayon were that Jonah, representing Israel, was unable to perform, or fulfill. This is why that word was chosen. None could fulfill the law; none but Christ.
He next said that the qiqayon, the law, came up as a son of the night and it was destroyed as a son of the night. This is referring to its effects. It can bring nothing to light. But Christ can. This is why Paul says this in.”
Only Christ, not the law, can make one a son of the day. The object lesson of the qiqayon, (the law) the tola, (the crucified Christ) and the ruakh qadim kharishit, (the deafening east wind) there outside of Nineveh, indicates that there are far more souls to whom His pity extends than just the 12 tribes of Israel who have been unable to tell their right hand from their left, and among whom are many ignorant and foolish beasts who willingly reject the grace which He has offered through His completed work on Calvary’s cross.
This is the lesson of the book of Jonah. This is what is revealed in the obscure, and wholly misunderstood, words of this precious, marvelous book. For us, it is either the law which kills, or the grace of Christ which makes alive. God showed grace to the Gentiles, the Jews wanted the law which Christ ended. They were angry at the ending of the law, but God’s grace has been extended to any and all who will receive it. If you do, you also will be vomited out of the grave some wonderful day, all because of the work of Christ Jesus.
———————————
But it was evil to [the] Dove (meaning Israel) exceedingly, and he was kindled with anger.
2 So he prayed unto Yehovah, and said, “I pray Yehovah, was not this what I said when I was still in my ground? Because it was so, I hastened to flee to the White Dove (Tarshish); for I know that You, God, are gracious and merciful, slow to get into a huff and abounding in covenant loyalty, and comforting concerning the evil.
3 And now Yehovah take, I pray, my soul. To me, it is for good my death [rather] than my life!”
4 And said Yehovah, “Is doing good a reason for you to be furious?”
AN OBJECT LESSON IN ALLEGORY AND METAPHOR
5 And [the] Dove (meaning Israel) went from the city and sat in the place of wandering and disobedience. And there he made a sukkah and sat under its protection, until he might see what would come to pass concerning the city.
6 And appointed Yehovah Elohim a qiqayon (meaning the law), and caused [it] to ascend over [the] Dove (meaning Israel), that it might be protection for his head, to deliver from his wickedness. [The] Dove (meaning Israel) concerning the qiqayon (meaning the law) was joyful whoppingly.
7 And appointed THE GOD a tola (meaning the crucified Christ) at the dawning of the next morning, and it struck the qiqayon (meaning the law), and it withered.
8 And happened as rose the sun (meaning the dawning of God’s new economy, the age of grace), and God appointed wind east deafening (meaning Israel could no longer hear). And struck the sun on the head of [the] Dove (meaning Israel), so that he veiled himself (meaning Israel had wrapped itself in the law). And begged with his soul to die. And said, “Good [is] my death than my life.
9 And said God unto [the] Dove (meaning Israel), “Is doing good a reason for you to be furious concerning the qiqayon (meaning the law)?
And [he] said, “Doing good is a reason for me to be furious, even to death.”
10 And said Yehovah, “You pitied the qiqayon (meaning the law) that you were unable to fulfill, and did not magnify; which a son of a night was, and a son of a night perished” (meaning the law brought nothing to light).
11 And I? No pity over the Offspring’s Habitation? The city, the whopping? (referring to the Gentile world). Which exists more than 12 myriads of man (meaning the twelve tribes of Israel), which cannot discern between their right hand and their left (meaning transgressors of the law); and many ignorant fools (meaning the willfully disobedient).”
———————————
The book of Jonah, the Dove typifies the “mourning love” which God feels for the people of the world. So much so, that He was willing to step out of His heavenly abode and come walk among us. Let us cling to the grace of God which is found in Jesus Christ our Lord, and may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
Closing
Next Week: Leviticus 1:1-4 We hope you will find this new book fun… (The Burnt Offering, Part 1) Law and Grace – An Object Lesson
So Jonah went out of the city and sat
On the city’s east side
There he made himself a shelter and sat under it in the shade
Till he might see what would become of the city
What would the Lord decide?
And the Lord God prepared a plant
And made it come up over Jonah assuredly
That it might be shade for his head
To deliver him from his misery
So Jonah was very grateful for the plant
But as morning dawned the next day
God prepared a worm
And it so damaged the plant that it withered away
And it happened, when the sun arose
That God, a vehement east wind prepared
And the sun beat on Jonah’s head
So that he grew faint; thus he fared
Then he wished death for himself, and said
“It is better for me to die than to live; I’m better off dead!”
Then God said to Jonah
“Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?”
And he said, “It is right for me to be angry!
Even to death! So, Jonah continued his rant
But the Lord said
“You have had pity on the plant, an insignificant plight
For which you have not labored, nor made it grow
Which came up in a night and perished in a night
And should I not pity Nineveh, that great city
In which are more than a giant herd or flock
One hundred and twenty thousand persons
Who cannot discern between their right hand and their left
And much livestock?”
Lord God, thank You for grace; glorious grace
Thank You for fulfilling what stood opposed to us
Thank You for turning towards us Your marvelous face
As we behold our Savior, our precious Jesus
And Lord, we pray for those who still choose
To cling to the law which is dead; withered away
Open the eyes of Israel, all of the Jews
Call them back to Yourself, this we pray
And for any others who have left Your grace
Clinging to the law in a hope it will please
Turn them away from that terrible place
And to reconciliation through Christ
Who alone can Your wrath appease?
Lord God, thank you for this wonderful book
Jonah! What a marvel to have studied it
Into every detail possible we took a look
And to You our thanks and praise we now submit!
Hallelujah to Christ our Lord!
Hallelujah for Jonah, a marvelous part of Your superior word!
Hallelujah and Amen…The.
“It gives us a strategic advantage,” Mabus said of the Navy weaning off fossil fuel and increasing the use of alternative energy.
Vilsack called the Navy’s “Green Fleet” a “tremendous opportunity” for the biofuel industry that will benefit farmers and rural America.
The officials then boarded a helicopter to watch the USS William P. Lawrence replenish its tanks with a blend of biofuel made by AltAir Fuels from beef fat.
Critics, including environmentalists, say biofuel production is too costly and on a large scale may do more harm than good.
Mabus contends, however, that going green is not just about reducing the Navy’s carbon footprint.
“In 2010, we were losing too many Marines in convoys carrying fossil fuels to outposts in Afghanistan, and the prohibitive cost of oil was requiring us to stop training at home in order to keep steaming abroad, a dangerous and unsustainable scenario,” he said in a statement.
The Navy is aiming to draw half its power from alternative energy sources by 2020 so ships can refuel less often, stay out at sea longer and no longer be at the mercy of fluctuating oil prices and oil-producing nations, which may not all have U.S. interests in mind, Mabus said. The federal government has invested more than $500 million into drop-in biofuels, which can be used without reconfiguring engines.
The fleet also includes nuclear vessels, hybrid electric ships and aircraft powered partly by biofuels.
Vilsack, speaking in Ohio about the rural economy Friday, said the Navy’s efforts offer a huge market opportunity for the biofuel industry. The Defense Department uses 90 percent of the energy consumed by the federal government, spending billions of dollars annually on petroleum fuels to support military operations.
The Navy bought 77 million gallons of the 10 percent..
All military branches are looking to cut their ties to foreign oil as part of a national security strategy. Since 2008, the Navy has cut oil consumption by 15 percent and the Marine Corps has reduced it by 60 percent.
In 2009, the Navy commissioned its first hybrid ship, the USS Makin Island. The ship’s hybrid-electric drive has enabled it to stay out three times longer between refueling than on petroleum alone, and it spent half its normal fuel budget on its first deployment, Mabus said. LED lighting, stern flaps and hull coatings have also helped other ships cut their energy use.
Filed Under: Aerospace + defenseDuring an interview with WINCLY, Aron Stevens spoke on not thinking that his Question Mark gimmick would get over in the manner that it has with the NWA. Here’s what he had to say:
Their reaction to what I’m doing. My interaction with them…With this character, I just want to make it good. People might say that’s a karate gimmick, it will never work. No, it shouldn’t work. My job is to make it work. I think we’re definitely seeing that. Every character we would like to get over. That’s across the board, but I don’t think people were expecting the Question Mark to become the overnight sensation that he is. It’s kind of cool because what I have with the Question Mark is the same thing I had with The Miz where they love one of us and hate the other one. We feed off each other.
I just remember we did a promo. It was like, ‘When I say karate, you’ll correct me in the punctuation of it.’ By the second time he said it, the whole building was saying it with him. Whether you are at an arena or a studio or wherever, when you can do that and people catch on that quick and sudden. You know it’s going to work. Once you have lightning in a bottle, you have to nurture it because if you remain stagnant it will get old. Case in point the Stunt Double. You have to continue to facilitate the development of the character in the right way. If you give fans completely different than what they are popping for or buying, it’s not going to work. But if you give it to them the same thing all the time, it’s going to get old. It’s a fine line. He has been so great to work with, so I think we’re doing a pretty decent job with that. There are so many other people who are doing a great job. It’s definitely a team effort there.

by, 02-Jul-2011 at 02:15 (10470 Views) that there have been a series of articles on the Phoronix web site, which have suggested regressions in the Linux kernel
- during the 2.6.37 to 2.6.38 and
- during the 2.6.34 to 2.6.35
with the 2.6.34 to 2.6.35 being discovered last.
Some quotes from the Phoronix web site posts ...
FIRST, the 2.6.37 to 2.6.28 possible regression was discovered: [Phoronix] Mobile Users Beware: Linux Has Major Power Regression where they state:.During the Linux 2.6.38 kernel development, a regression was introduced causing systems to burn through significantly more power. .... On the particular system being talked about in the article today is the power consumption going up by 14%, which would lead to a noticeably shorter battery life. ... The Linux 2.6.35/2.6.36/2.6.37 results are virtually identical, but with 2.6.38 is where the regression strikes. As far as the Linux 2.6.39 results, it shows the regression still present. ...
Now the above is all from Phoronix.Now the above is all from Phoronix.With this expanded round of power testing, the Linux 2.6.37 to Linux 2.6.38 regression is still shown, but it also uncovered a very noticeable differentiation in power consumption between the Linux 2.6.34 and 2.6.35 kernels too. Under idle on this test system, it equates to a 20% difference in power consumption and then the 2.6.37/2.6.38 regression tacks on another 6% in this particular test profile.
... The pre-2.6.35 kernels are all running at right around the same power level within a reasonable milliwatt range of each other on the various tests. ... However, with the Linux 2.6.35 kernel, the power consumption goes up noticeably.

The Phoronix article is here: [Phoronix] The Leading Cause Of The Recent Linux Kernel Power Problems
Phoronix believe the biggest cause of the 2.6.38 power issue (according to their testing software and the hardware they have been running) is due to a change in behavior regarding ASPM. ASPM is the Active-State Power Management for PCI Express. Namely, they claime to blame is commit 2f671e2dbff6eb5ef4e2600adbec550c13b8fe72 that is titled "PCI: Disable ASPM if BIOS asks us to."

Further articles in Phoronix look at other Power Management issues :
- Ubuntu vs Windows7 power management looking at boot/start-up, basic desktop use, video playback, and gaming. What was interesting was.
.
- open-source Radeon driver power management where Phoronix compared the system power consumption for the open and closed-source ATI/AMD Radeon Linux drivers for a variety of graphics cards (ATI Radeon HD 2400PRO, ATI Radeon HD 4550, ATI Radeon HD 4870, and ATI Radeon HD 5750). Phoronix discovered with with newer hardware the proprietary Catalyst driver consumes less power than using the open-source driver in any configuration. So not only does the proprietary Catalyst driver deliver better performance, but also its power consumption is lower.

- What to do if still seeing poor Linux Battery Life? In this post Phoronix ask user's to try the work around noted above, and then if power management is still poor to provide further information per the links they provide, so that they can investigate the problem further and maybe help come up with a solution.Property Attributes

On whether he's bothered by the fact his work with EMPEROR still outshines his solo output:
Ihsahn: "In many ways, I suppose it's natural. It's how things work. I guess in the past, I was more aware of that fact, but I mean, at this point, I've been doing my solo stuff longer than we ever did EMPEROR. I'm seven solo albums in and people are still interested. I mean, as a musician from Norway, being able to kind of be successful with both bands is one thing, but to be able to continue as a solo artist for this long… I'm on a headline tour now. In between that, we do festivals, sometimes with EMPEROR, sometimes with my solo stuff. I get to do both. What's not to like? [Laughs]"
On fans trying to encourage him to add more black metal influences to his solo work:
Ihsahn: "I think maybe it's like that, I don't really follow. It's not that I don't care; it's just that I think if you compare the first EMPEROR albums, there was no scene. There was no career to be had. There was no money, no prestige to be had. We basically made those albums out of pure enthusiasm for this expression we wanted to make, with no compromise and just head-on. I think that is the only reason we ended up with EMPEROR being what it is. It wasn't trying to fit into some part of the market or what have you. By doing that, I think, not by plan, it just accidently carved out a space on its own. The region black metal came a thing, but when we did that, it wasn't a thing. [Laughs] I like to think that that kind of uncompromising, experimental attitude — some people find it strange that I do more what they call 'progressive music.' They say, 'He's using a saxophone in his music or keyboards or what have you.' To me, I'm thinking of the early black metal scene which was basically teenagers pushing the extremes of what we could do musically. I think it's more strange that more people from that scene are continuing that kind of quest for something."
On whether he minds being criticized for his work:
Ihsahn: "Only very few people have reached through to me, I'm afraid. My wife is probably the only one who can actually get through to me when it comes to my own thing. I know it's a very uncharming feature. We've been working closely and creatively for over 20 years, so she knows me so well and knows my limitations and my strengths and she understands my kind of abstract concepts of things and she can add to that and make suggestions. She's such a invaluable piece of that process. But beyond that, reading criticism, I think it's not like I'm immune; it's very nice to have good reviews. For the most part, people are interested in the album and I get the opportunity to do it again."
On whether people like EMPEROR but not his solo work:
Ihsahn: "It depends. I think a lot of people might assume that what I do is kind of a different version, a cheap knock-off of what EMPEROR was, but I think for most people, it's something very different. Maybe this is from what you're reading, but my impression, I think people after all these years, they differentiate and know what my priorities are creatively. To be quite honest, I don't think my record label would continue to release my albums and do festivals and the promoters wouldn't pick me if people weren't interested. [Laughs]"
On the direction of his latest solo album, "Ámr":
Ihsahn:  'albums.' I want albums to have certain individual songs, but they complete a whole."
"Ámr" was released in May via Candlelight/Spinefarm. The disc was recorded at Ihsahn's own Mnemosyne Studio, except for drum tracking, which was done at Sonic Attic Studios. Mixing was handled by Linus Corneliusson at Fascination Street Studios. Mastering was once again done by Jens Bogren.
"Ámr" was described in a press release as Ihsahn's "most eclectic and challenging to date." Its first single, "Arcana Imperii", features a guitar solo by OPETH's Fredrik Åkesson. The accompanying music video was created by Richard Oakes of Dark Fable Media.Elegant Car Warranty Reviews

LED (light emitting diodes) • Based on semi-conductor physics(more later) • First practical use was in 1962 – Early LEDs were dim and expensive ($200 per “bulb”) – Mostly used as indicator lights and in calculators • A standard 40 W incandescent bulb that lasts about 1000 hours can be replaced by a 6 W LED that lasts 50, 000 hours. – 6 W LED costs about $9. 00. A 40 W incandescent bulb costs 1. 00. Since the LED lasts 50 times longer, the initial cost is recovered by the bulb’s lifetime. By 2015, that same LED should cost about $1. 00. • Still some issues with the technology, but LEDs are well on their way to replacing CFB and they do not have the hazardous waste issue.
Types of Energy: kinetic and potential Energy Kinetic energy of a moving object KE=1/2 mv 2 Potential Energy – Energy stored in a system, for example an object of mass m, a distance h above the surface of the earth has a potential energy given by mgh. g is the acceleration due to gravity = 9. 8 m/s 2
More examples of potential energy Another example is a spring, compressed a distance x from its equilibrium point has a potential energy 1/2 kx 2, where k is the spring constant, a property of the spring.
Chemical Energy that is released via chemical reactions. Often times release is through combustion such as energy generation via coal Another example is a battery
Batteries • • • 3 Parts: Cathode (positive charge), anode (negative charge) and an electrolyte (substance with free ions (atoms with a net charge) Reactions occur at the anode which release electrons, they want to flow toward the cathode. But the electrolyte keeps the electrons from flowing to the cathode. If you create a closed circuit, and provide the electrons an alternate path to flow to the cathode, then they will follow that path. Now the chemical reactions at the anode change the anode and the electrolyte chemical composition, and eventually they can no longer occur. So the battery no longer produces electrons and current. When you recharge a battery , you reverse the flow of electrons through the battery and reverse the chemical process, restoring the battery to almost its original chemical state.
Earliest batteries-Baghdad battery • Also called the Parthian Battery • Artifacts discovered in 1936 near Baghdad. • Terracotta jar 5 inches tall, containing a copper rolled up copper sheet housing a single iron rod. • If it were filled with an acidic liquid, it could produce a current • Use as a battery is uncertain, many different interpretations exist.
Leyden Jars • Device that stores static electricity • Earliest form of what we now call a capacitor • Glass jar with metal foil coating the inner and outer surfaces. A rod is connected to the inner foil and sticks out of the mouth of the jar. • Need to be initially charged
Galvanic Cells • First attempt to derive energy from chemical reactions • Consists of two metals (often copper and zinc) in a solution of a salt of the metal, connected by a salt bridge (really just a porous plate) • Also called voltaic cells or electrochemical cells
Voltaic pile • First true electric battery • Alessandra Volta first showed that when copper and zinc discs are separated by cardboard soaked in brine, they act as a galvanic cell. • He further showed that if you stack several pairs of these, you get a current to flow.
Inside a modern battery
Leaky batteries • • • Alkaline batteries-popular form of battery for many devices Uses potassium hydroxide, which is an alkaline as the electrolyte, instead of ammonium chloride or zinc chloride. All three are acids and can corrode the outer steel shell and leak. In addition, as a battery is discharged, Hydrogen as is formed, which increases the pressure inside the battery. This can rupture the seals on the ends of the battery or the battery canister itself. They create a crystalline structure on the outside of the battery. It can cause oxidation on copper leads and damages circuits. A solution of water and baking soda or vinegar can be used to attempt to clean corroded contacts.
Lithium ion batteries • In these batteries, lithium ions are extracted from the anode and inserted into the cathode to create a current. • The electrolyte is often a lithium salt in a solution of ethylene carbonate • Note: a lithium battery is a different battery, it has a lithium anode-these have a longer lifetime and can produce higher currents and voltages.
Sodium sulfide (Na. S) battery • Require high operating temperatures (300 -350 C) • Molten sodium is the anode • Electrolyte membrane is a solid form of aluminum oxide – does not allow electrons to flow through it • Cathode is molten sulfur • Only useful for storage on energy grids. • 89% efficent
Na. S Batteries
Heat Energy associated with the random motions of the molecules in a medium. Measured by temperature • Temperature Scales: • Fahrenheit – based on the height of liquid (often mercury or alcohol) in a glass tube. • Celsius – another scale using height of liquid in a tube • Kelvin-absolute scale – True measure of energy
Fahrenheit temperature scale • Freezing point of water set at 32 and boiling point set at 212, so there is 180 degrees between them and each degree is 1/180 of the difference between these two points.
Celsius temperature scale • Freezing point of water set at 0 and boiling point set at 100, so there is 100 degrees between them and each degree is 1/100 of the difference between these two points.
Kelvin temperature scale • O K is absolute zero. All molecular motion stops. • Interval set so that Δ 1 K = Δ 1 C • So to convert from C to K K=C+273 • To convert from F to K: K =(F - 32) * 5/9 + 273
Mass Energy • E = mc 2 • Energy and mass are equivalent • C = 3 x 108 m/s. • C is a big number and its squared! So even if m is small, E is big. • A small mass, converted to energy, gives a lot of energy!
Example
Electromagnetic energy • Light displays properties of both waves and particles. • Light is an electromagnetic wave-a wave created by alternating electric and magnetic fields. • “Light” is more than just visible light, it covers wavelengths from radio thru Gamma rays • Light is also a “particle” called a photon. • Photons have energy given by E=hν or E=hc/λ. H is constant, c is the speed of light , ν is the frequency of light and λ is the wavelength of the light.- Canopy Plants Philodendron Golden Malay plant

The Hydroinformatics Modeling System (hms) is a modeling framework developed by the Chair of Water Resources Management and Modeling of Hydrosystems, Technische Universität Berlin, since 2004. See the project page for details.
hms++ is a complete rewrite of hms with the goal of comprehensive performance optimisation.
Table of Content
Software architecture
hms++ aims to provide an efficient framework for the finite volume method on two-dimensional structured and unstructured grids, as well as an optimised implementation of first and second order HLLC Riemann solvers for the shallow water equations (SWE).
As the name indicates, hms++ is fully written in C++, which allows several avenues for optimisation when compared to the previous implementation of hms in Java:
- no Java Virtual Machine being required on the target machine
- allowing machine-specific optimisations by the compiler
- allowing to manually place compiler optimisation directives
- availability of mature high-performance computation libraries
- greater control of the memory layout, which is essential for achieving locality and alignment
- availability of certain advanced optimisation strategies, such as expression templates
- easier interfacing with graphics processing units (GPUs) using CUDA or HIP
Furthermore, the availability of data pointers allows for more efficient and intuitive usage of the MPI standard for distributed computing.
Optimisation strategies
Multiple optimisation strategies are considered.
Code metrics such as cache utilisation (hits/misses), vectorisation and branch predicts/mispredicts are to be investigated for critical code sections. For flow simulations with the finite volume method (FVM), the most likely candidate for a performance critical section is the flux calculation during each time step.
Both cache utilisation as well as vectorisation depend on data locality. Locality is achieved, when firstly, instructions operating on the same data are executed within a minimal time frame and secondly, data operated on in a given time frame is located within a minimally long memory segment.
For flow simulations with the FVM, the relative memory layout of edge-related and cell-related data is the key to locality. As can be seen in the picture, all horizontal edges lie between cells which are neighbours within the mesh, but not in memory (as indicated by their indices). This is the core challenge for achieving locality in FVM simulations. Different indexing strategies for structured meshes, (possibly dynamic) element reordering for unstructured meshes, and edge traversal strategies are to be investigated in this project as candidates for improving locality and thus performance.
Very early in a flow simulation workflow, the mesh type is decided. This has a significant impact on the memory footprint of the calculation: Uniformly rectangular meshes (type a in the picture) only store two integers (number of cells in either direction) and four floating point numbers (origin and spacing) and thus have constant memory requirements, no matter the mesh size. The same mesh can, however, also be represented as an arbitrary unstructured mesh (type d), but with much higher memory requirements.
This is often the case when dealing with the output of external mesh generators. As an example, the widespread mesh generator gmsh outputs all meshes as type d, even if their topology would allow representation as types a-c.
To ascertain that the optimal mesh representation is used, independent of its source, hms++ can detect structured topology and convert any mesh to the most memory efficient type which can represent it.
During the runtime of a shallow water flow simulation, normally both wet and dry cells occur. Dry cells typically produce a lower computational load, which leads to a load imbalance between processing nodes. Intra-node load balancing can be handled by the operating system, but inter-node load balancing must be handled by the program.
In the picture, two strategies are shown. The upper one prescribes a fixed load factor to wet and dry cells, and then arranges node boundaries to achieve a similar load for each node. This heuristic method requires good calibration of the load factor, which may only be partially portable between machines. However, its high resolution down to cell level makes it a good candidate for a precise and efficient method.
The lower method in the picture takes the actual load of the system and partitions the mesh accordingly. With this method, only one load factor per node is calculated, which may require more iterations to achieve an optimal inter-node load balance. However, this method does not require calibration and inherently accounts for unknown factors (such as services running in the background, I/O operations for writing out calculation results etc.)
Both are to be implemented and compared, for both structured and unstructured meshes. The latter will require efficient graph partitioning, e.g. with the ParMETIS library.A thick foggy haze of fuck you, surrounds me,

A TREATMENT for autism could be on the horizon after scientists pinpointed the genetic mutations that raise the risk of developing the condition.
RAINMAN: Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise in Rainman, a film about autism (Wenn)
The new research has been hailed as a “monumental achievement”. An autistic person, as portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in the film Rainman, has difficulty communicating and socialising, and can have very repetitive behaviour and speech.
The roots of the condition are thought to be part of a complex genetic jigsaw which has been a mystery until now.
Three new studies, involving DNA screening of 13,000 people, looked in detail at the proteins involved in shaping the brain’s “wiring” and form the way nerve cells communicate. By comparing the genetic codes scientists were able to focus on a “hotspot” of DNA that contains the genes that create the proteins.
Scientists found that children with autism were significantly more likely to have mutations in this genetic region.
New treatments could now be developed that target these proteins or the genes that provide the instructions for making them. Two of the studies, published in Nature journal, were carried out in the US and a third by scientists at Oxford University, which appears in Molecular Psychiatry.
Dr Margaret Pericak-Vance, from the Miami Institute for Human Genomics, which took part in the research, said: “The identification of a common variant for autism is a monumental achievement.
“Researchers have been looking for clues about the genetic architecture of autism for decades. Many thought that this day would never come.”
Professor Tony Monaco, from Oxford University, said: “This new knowledge allows us to focus our studies on developing new treatments and intervention therapies.”Staff Salaries: EDHA summons LGA chairmen

Hip Hop DX is reporting that Beanie Sigel just got an additional 6 – 23 months added on to his jail sentence for a drug possession charge Beans received last year after his car was pulled over for driving erratically. At the time of the arrest, Beanie was found to be in possession of a loaded gun, codeine, prescription pills and a small amount of marijuana. The gun charges were eventually dropped and Gerald Andrews. who was actually driving the car was charged and convicted for the weapon. He too was sentenced to between 2 – 5 years.
At the current time, Sigel is incarcerated for tax evasion charges dating back to 1999. He is serving out a two year sentence. We hope that after he serves the last few months that have been added on to his stay, that Beanie can get a fresh start and begin a new. The former Roc – A – Fella alum still has fans out here ready to see him get back to what he does best.!

The ongoing crisis in Syria has killed many, endangered the lives of many children refugees and stripped their rights to pursue their education.
This tragedy has been put into the spotlight by the remarks of Deputy Secretary Antony J. Blinken at the State Meridian Global Leadership Summit in Washington DC.
Mr. Blinken highlighted that for nearly five years now, the tragedy of the Syrian crisis has fallen most heavily on the smallest shoulders.
“Children who once looked forward to careers as doctors, as scientists, as entrepreneurs now struggle to find enough food to eat or clothing to keep warm.” – Mr. Blinken
The crisis has resulted in damage to their homes and schools that have been bombed out of existence by Assad’s regime.
In the worsening scenario, the chidren’s lives have been imperiled by daesh and violent extremism.
700,000 School-Age Syrian Refugee Chidren Without Access to Education
According to Mr. Blinken, in neighbouring countries particularly Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan, more than 700,000 school-age Syrian refugee children are living in camps or communities without access to education.
And the saddest part also, the number is even higher inside of Syria, where more than 2 million children are out of school.
“Without school, these children are at risk of being exploited as laborers or forced into sex work.” – Mr. Blinken
Mr. Blinken also highlighted the downsides of not sending the child refugees to school.
For one, without school, children who have lost nearly everything are now literally in danger of losing their futures.
In addition, Mr. Blinken cited that the lack of education is one of the primary reasons families flee onward, not just from Syria, but onward from Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan into Europe-risking their lives on fierce seas or packing themselves into the sealed trucks of smugglers.
Meeting The Challenge
Accomodating the Syrian child refugees in schools in Lebanon and Turkey has been hailed by the United States. In fact, there are more Syrian children in Lebanese public schools than there are Lebanese.
According to Mr. Blinken, global response is crucial to meet this challenge faced by the child refugees.
He said Syrian refugee children need communities, need companies, need individuals to pitch in with extraordinary generosity to help them go to school and forget about war.
“So even as we work every day to end the conflict in Syria and to end the crisis, we are trying to bring our humanitarian and development teams together to get children back into school.” – Mr. Blinken
The United States is scaling up efforts, to answer the huge demand that there is, starting with education. They need new technologies to support vulnerable learners and new innovations to help teachers.
And finally, resolving the challenge of giving back education to children refugees to schools needs new commitments to dramatically expand the ability to reach each and every student. the growing flow of civilians fleeing from conflict,.
There are over growing numbers of refugees in neighboring countries and there are existing refugees, Palestinian refugees inside Syria as well as a hundred thousand Iraqi refugees inside Syria.
The violence in Syria, which began in March 2011 as a protest movement similar to those witnessed across the Middle East and North Africa, has claimed many lives, mostly civilians.Prof Sandip Vijay

Abstract
Thirty-three elite youth ice hockey players wore Bioharness-3 (Zephyr, MD) sensors to compare accelerations (ACC) and heart rate (HR) over four games (G1–G4) in three days, in order to establish changes in cardiovascular stress and physical exertion associated with fatigue. Peak ACC and HR across multiple time frames were quantified and analyzed in conjunction to determine exertion profiles for each game. MANOVAs for peak ACC and HR, at each time point across G1–G4 and multiple games per day (M1, M2) for magnitude and time as main effects were performed. HR beats per minute decreased between G1 and G3/G4 in time segments (3–20 minutes) although ACC were not different. Peak ACC were lower for M2 vs M1 at 60, 90, 120 and 180 seconds. Results concluded the decline in HR, but not ACC, across games indicates a cardiovascular adaptation. The reduced ACC between games M1 and M2 indicate fatigue.

We may not know the confirmed games that are going to be launched, but we know for sure that the PS5 console is about to be released by the end of 2020. The specifications for the new console have slowly started to drop, and the developers are also announcing the titles for the new hardware.
Until there is an event solely held for a game reveal, we cannot guarantee the release of a particular game. Sony has always had an edge in the gaming console market because of the exclusive titles it provides such as the God of War, LittleBigPlanet, Uncharted, and Ratchet & Clank.
However, the Sony gaming console series can be unpredictable. They may not even launch games for a long time. But when they do launch it after a long time, the hardware will be advanced significantly, making the titles look even better.
There are some games already announced such as Ubisoft’s Gods and Monsters, Warframe, Gothic, Rainbow Six Siege, Godfall, Outriders Lord of the Rings: Gollum, WRC 9, and Watch Dogs: Legion. What we would like to see is the recently launched ‘Scrabble Go’ from Scopely available on the console and needless to mention, Scrabble Go Cheat pops up along with any popular launches. Furthermore, we can predict the return of Ghost of Tsushima, Death Stranding, Starfield, and The Last of Us: Part 2, Grand Theft Auto 6, God of War 2, Gran Turismo, and Cyberpunk 2077 in the upcoming PS5.
These are the most popular simulation games that the consoles provide. However, numerous board games can be enjoyed by board game enthusiasts who enjoy strategic depth, storytelling potential, and emergent mechanics. These games also make the console family and children-friendly. There are a variety of board games that you can play depending on your preference.
There are spooky storytelling games like Mysterium or classic games like Ludo, and survival games like Dead of Winter. All these games are available in the PS4 so we assume that they will also be available in the upcoming PS5.
Board games you can expect on the new PS5
The following are some board games available in PS4 and can be predicted to be available in the new PS5.
- Monopoly Plus: Monopoly has been a staple board game in each household since 1935. It has a notorious reputation for being a friendship-ender. The Monopoly Plus has been equipped with 3D visuals that provide a deeper experience of the game. Furthermore, the game supports six players locally and one controller can be used by each player for the game.
- The Jackbox Party Pack: This game does not literally consist of a board. The pack consists of five games such as a comedy trivia game You Don’t Know Jack 2015, a bluffing game Fibbage XL, a fill-in-the-blanks game Word Spud, Lie Swatter, and Drawful.
Guessing the word is always fun and when it comes between friends, it elevates the excitement to the next level. Isn’t it?
- Armello: Armello is a strategic board game that can be played digitally on the console. The game combines tabletop strategies, trading card games, and RPGs. The game is a four-player game where each player is a hero that is to ascend the throne of the Kingdom of Armello.
- Pure Chess: The most classic and strategic game in the world, chess is also provided on the console. The digital chess consists of HD visuals and a variety of DLC packs that the players can choose from.
- Hasbro Family Fun Pack: This bundle consists of family games that have been out favorites for decades. The games included in this bundle are Monopoly Plus, Scrabble, Risk, and Trivial Pursuit Live. You can play these games online and locally both.Remember to take some help from scrabblewordfinderguide.com, but that’s just for beginners.Keep playing and have fun!
Conclusion
Although we cannot guarantee the games that will be available on the PS5, the PS4 and Ps5 are similar consoles. We expect the games carried by the PS4 to be carried by the PS5.2 | Vivid Worlds of sshigaraki Square Pin Badge Collection

Description
As social change sweeps across 1950s America, two boys—one white, one Black—discover the power of friendship and the importance of staying true to yourself
It’s the summer of 1959 at the foot of Bakers Mountain in western North Carolina when 13-year-old Jackie Honeycutt first bumps into Thomas Freeman fishing on the riverbank. They hit it off, and Jackie hopes the two of them can be friends. But Jackie is white, and Thomas is Black—and Jackie quickly learns their growing friendship won’t be easy.
Affected by the growing civil rights movement, Jackie is intent on being Thomas’s friend and, as a result, experiences racism and prejudice first-hand through bullying at school, family turmoil, and pressure from his community. Can Jackie free both his conscience and his voice—and ultimately do what's right?
A touching historical fiction tale about friendship and racial inequality, Equal is the fifth and final title in the popular Bakers Mountain Stories series.

★ "The 1950s...setting allows for the introduction of such topics as soldiers home from World War II and the Korean War coping with PTSD while working and raising families, the Cold War and fears of Russia attacking the U.S., and the resistance to the integration movement. This title can serve to help students understand these aspects of this period in U.S. history, as well as give some additional context to the world of their grandparents and great-grandparents. Given the recent conversations surrounding equality and the BLM demonstrations, this title could also serve to open the door to highly relevant class discussions on bullying, racism, and prejudice." —School Library Connection, starred review

Guaranteeing the air that we inhale and the water that we drink is spotless has never been more significant. At Tradegates, we give metropolitan and modern organizations in the country with ground calcium carbonate items that normally eliminate contamination from the air. As an alkaline product, ground calcium carbonate (GCC) is utilized in Flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) applications to eliminate destructive sulfur dioxide (SO2) outflows from power plant stations.
Calcium Carbonate Plays Important Role in Flue Gas Desulfurization
Calcium Carbonate plays a significant part in different air contamination control applications. The mineral equation CaCO3 joins with fundamentally SO2 from flue gases when items like coal are burned to create power. Flue-gas desulfurization is a bunch of innovations that is utilized to detoxify fumes gases prior to delivering it into the air. These gases can be harmful to plants, creatures and other living beings. These harmful gases come from power plants, oil and gas businesses and major modern and city plants where petroleum products are burned. FGD innovation depends on a substance reaction that comes to pass when warm exhaust gases from a coal-fired boiler interact with limestone. This response eliminates 90% or a greater amount of the sulfur dioxide and changes the limestone into calcium sulfate (CaSO4). The cycles most usually utilized are wet scouring and dry cleaning. having to go to hospitals for air conditioning problems.
The problem is that, despite being very well designed, those air conditioning units aren’t being maintained.
According to an article from the BBC, there are actually several parts in the home that can fail at any time.
That means, if you have a problem with the air conditioner, you can potentially have a leaky unit.
You can also have a defective air conditioning unit, because the part inside of it can fail.
That’s why, in the past, air conditioning companies have been able to use special sealants and chemicals to seal the leaky parts of their air conditioners.
But that’s not what’s happening in the case of the faulty air conditionings in the house in the hills of Australia.
The faulty parts are not sealing the leak, but instead are simply allowing it to happen, and that’s the problem.
In this case, the leak is coming from the gas lines that run the entire house, not just the gas system, but the gas line that runs through the greenhouse, and it is the greenhouse that is leaking.
So, the gas inside the greenhouse is leaking, and the methane inside the gas is being released into the atmosphere.
That methane can then cause global warming.
That could lead to methane gas being released in the atmosphere, leading to climate change.
That leak is also being caused by poor ventilation in the greenhouse.
The house is being designed so that air flow into the greenhouse can only be through a hose that connects the greenhouse to the house, and a hose inside the house.
So the methane is not being filtered out of the greenhouse and it’s also not being released to the atmosphere as quickly as the gas coming from inside the building.
The leak is actually not as big as we might think.
It is a few feet long, but it’s only 1.4 feet wide.
So it’s a small leak, which is why it’s not as bad as it could be.
So what can you do to prevent the leak from happening?
You can try to prevent leaks from occurring by cleaning up the leak.
You should always clean up the inside of your house after you leave, and you should always use the hose that’s connected to the greenhouse with the gas that’s coming out of it.
And finally, you should install a gas valve on the inside and outside of the building to prevent methane gas leaking out of your greenhouse and into the air.
There’s also an alternative way of preventing leaks from happening, which involves using a gas sealant.
In Australia, there’s a whole industry for this.
It costs around $100 a month.
The sealants that are available on the market in Australia, like a carbon dioxide sealant, are expensive, but they’re the only thing that can stop methane gas leaks from going through the house and potentially causing global warming through the atmosphere by emitting carbon dioxide.
It can be expensive, so if you’re looking to purchase sealant or carbon dioxide for your home, make sure to do so carefully.
If you do, you’re likely to have to spend more money than you might expect.
The article also explains that methane gas can also leak out of other parts of your home that are not sealed.
In the past few years, methane gas has been detected from parts of a home’s plumbing system, so you should be very careful with any pipes in your house that are being used.
The BBC reports that if you find that there are methane leaks in your heating system, you’ll have to replace the heating system and replace the pipes that run through your house.
If there’s leakage from a plumbing system that is in the wrong place, you might need to go and install a new one.
And of course, there is a way to seal all the leaks in a home, including leaks in the air, using an air filter.or want to" are based on official English dictionaries, which means you can browse our website with confidence!

Elon Law's Elliot Engstrom speaks
Elliot Engstrom, a practicing attorney and fellow in the Elon University School of Law, recently spoke ... (more)
04.25.2017 • College & Community • College General • Special Events not. One result is what he calls "overcriminalization" -- when government agencies turn relatively harmless violations into far more serious crimes.
He made his case in "Overcriminalization and the Administrative State," Engstrom's presentation on March 29 at the Dennis A. Wicker Civic Center. The event was part of Central Carolina Community College's Liberty Lecture Series, free public talks highlighting ideas that expand freedom, liberty, and well-being for mankind.
Engstrom discussed four recent legal cases to show how criminal statutes have been applied very broadly by federal and state agencies.
He began in the Gulf of Mexico, where fisherman John Yates and his crew were looking for red grouper when his ship was boarded for inspection by a fish and wildlife officer working for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
After being cited for catching undersized fish and told to keep them separated from the larger catch, Yates reportedly instructed a crew member to throw the undersized fish back into the sea before returning to port.
When officials waiting on land couldn't find any undersized fish, Yates was charged with a federal crime under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a law written after a series of corporate and accounting scandals to keep companies under criminal investigation from shredding evidence. If found guilty under that act, the fisherman could have spent 20 years in prison.
Engstrom says the federal agency did it by loosely interpreting one word in the statute, which forbids the destruction of "any record, document or tangible object" to impede a federal investigation. They argued that a red grouper qualifies as a "tangible object."
"Congress did not write a law that says, 'If you throw a fish overboard, you can be charged with a felony and get over 20 years in prison,'" Engstrom said. "And yet, here he is getting charged with a felony."
After being convicted, Yates appealed, eventually winning a narrow 5-4 decision in the U.S. Supreme Court. But, Engstrom said, not all cases end so well.
It's not that people shouldn't be charged when they do something wrong, the attorney repeated often as he discussed the various cases. But he pointed out how such broad legal interpretations can take a minor violation and blow it out of proportion, leaving people with huge legal bills and facing long prison sentences.
But the biggest problem, Engstrom said, is that it challenges the bedrock assumption that ignorance of the law is no excuse.
He said there are more than 80,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations, the set of rules and regulations issued by federal agencies, and applying those rules beyond their intended purpose makes it impossible for people to know what they can or can't do.
"This maxim was written back when everybody would know what the law was," Engstrom said, "because the only things that were crimes were things like murder, rape, theft, larceny, and fraud -- things that everyone already knows are crimes."
Engstrom is principal attorney with Engstrom Law in Greensboro, but now spends most of his time teaching legal methods, communication and administrative law at Elon University. He received his undergraduate degree from Wake Forest University and his law degree four years ago from the University of GeorgABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. -- The view for an Army electronic warfare (EW) Soldier can be daunting. Layers of data pour in from multiple sensors on the battlefield, while Soldiers work quickly to sort through the information, so they can determine what's enemy activity and what's simply "noise." At the same time, new data continues to arrive on the screen.
The complex mission executed by the Army's electronic warfare and Cyber Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) Soldiers - which includes detecting and responding to enemy jamming attempts and other electronic interference - is intensifying. As the Army adds more sensors to its own equipment and the number and type of civilian signal-generating sources, including satellites and cell phones, continue to increase, an EW system's user interface can become crowded fast.
To reduce this cognitive burden and improve EW effectiveness for multi-domain operations, the Army Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) is using artificial intelligence (AI) to quickly and accurately rank the incoming data in order of priority to the warfighter, who then has the option of filtering out the less important signals.
"With the current sensor technology, you end up with a lot of noises on your display," said SFC Steven Schoyen, an electronic warfare NCO for the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team (1st SBCT). "As the operator is attempting to discern what one correlation is, three or four more may begin to evolve. At the same time, noise and erroneous data is populating too."
The RCCTO is partnering with Soldiers from the 1st SBCT at Fort Wainwright, Alaska, who are using the new technology against operational scenarios. Their feedback will help improve effectiveness of the capability as the Army integrates it into EW systems.
The new expert learning AI prototype uses AI that is trained to reduce or eliminate common low-level tasks performed by EW Soldiers, while also simplifying the user interface of their battle management system.
"We know that many of the signals emanating from their display are less important signals, or signals that are known to be friendly or neutral sources," said Rob Monto, the director of the RCCTO Emerging Technologies Office. "Using AI, we can tell with extreme accuracy which signals are not important based on their pattern of life, their mobility profiles, and characteristics. By eliminating these signals, Soldiers can concentrate on those most significant."
The tool saves time by decluttering the user interface and enhancing Soldiers' ability to zero in on whether the emitter is from a "red" or enemy source, is a "blue" or friendly force signal, or just "gray" noise.
"Operating on the complex battlefields of the future or in megacities with dense radio frequency environments, as our EW Soldiers get more sensors, they'll also receive much more data," said Chief Warrant Officer 3 William Insch, an EW Technician with the Army's Project Manager Electronic Warfare & Cyber (PM EW&C). "AI will help translate all this data into information, and ultimately distill it into understanding, so EW Soldiers can better support the commander. And that's the key - we try to help the commander have better understanding of what the electromagnetic environment looks like from a friendly, neutral and adversarial perspective."
The Army RCCTO partnered with PM EW&C and the Combat Capabilities Development Command's C5ISR Center to develop the AI tool, which is planned for an operational pilot with a select forward deployed unit later this year.
Within the last year, the Army has delivered new electronic warfare prototype systems in response to an operational needs statement (ONS) from U.S. Army Europe. Soldiers with select units are using the equipment to implement electronic protection for their own formations, to detect and understand enemy activity in the electromagnetic spectrum, and to disrupt adversaries through electronic attack effects. These systems are interim solutions, designed as a bridge until the programs of record, including EW Planning Management Tool (EWPMT), can be fielded.
As part of the process, the RCCTO and PM EW&C worked with EW Soldiers to get feedback on the fielded prototypes and the soon-to-be-fielded EWPMT to drive design, performance, functionality and training. This approach of using direct user feedback enables the Army to be responsive to Soldier needs and rapidly insert new technology - like AI - as soon as it becomes available.
"The agile, iterative development of EWPMT is an outstanding way for EW and electromagnetic spectrum manager Soldiers to have a direct impact on the program," Insch said. "The engineers and developers are taking feedback from Soldiers, either through the ONS with the prototype equipment or with EW Soldiers visiting Aberdeen Proving Ground, and they immediately try to incorporate that feedback into the next capability drop."
The effort to prototype the AI tool began in October 2018 after the technology was discovered at an industry event. It was assessed by the EW community for scalability, ease of operations and security. In November the RCCTO, C5ISR Center and PM EW&C began a cognitive mapping process with the help of EW Soldiers like Insch and Schoyen, outlining the steps they take as they work through signal detection on the battlefield.
Now, the Army is running the technology through operational scenarios in labs prior to holding live demonstrations and evaluations this year in coordination with PM EW&C. Initial feedback demonstrates a significant reduction in the time it takes to generate the EW Soldiers' common operating picture. It also showed a reduction in the work these operators must perform, which decreases potential errors.
This is the second artificial intelligence and electronic warfare effort for the RCCTO, which recently conducted a Signal Classification Challenge to find an AI/Machine Learning application to help EW Soldiers on the back-end of signal detection. This new effort is on the front-end, applying AI to the user interface as signals are first displayed.

News posted 08:00am on Thu Nov 12, 2020
Virat Kohli, Virat Kohli, Virat Kohli. There’s no hotter name in cricket at the moment – ask any tragic of the sport and they will tell you the confidence and swagger he brings to the park is matched by his incredible sportsmanship for the Indian cricket side.
But he isn’t the only name on the lips of our FOX CRICKET commentary team. As the Australia vs India Dettol ODI and T20I Series and Vodafone Test Series gets set to bowl us over from November 27 for FOXTEL’s summer of cricket, Pat Cummins, Steve Smith, Dave Warner and Marnus Labuschagne are just some of the names commentators can’t wait to watch in action.
Presenter Mark “Howie” Howard grills former cricket greats Adam “Gilly” Gilchrist, Allan Border, Kerry O’Keeffe, Mike Hussey and the woman they describe as the “jewel in the crown of their Motley Crue” Isa Guha on what’s in store from the first ball when Australia goes up against India in their first Test showdown since early 2019 (yes, India may have won that series but do the crew think it will happen again?). One thing’s for sure, king of spin Shane Warne reckons the cricket lineup is set to knock us all for six this summer. “I can’t wait to watch all of it,” says Warne. “The Women’s BBL [Big Bash League], the Big Bash just gets bigger and better every year, [and] the one dayers, but the Test Series – Australia versus India – is operation payback. They beat us last time when they came to Australia. They’ve got the superstar Virat Kohli. There’s lots to look forward to this summer. It’s going to be huge!”
What do you love most about watching Australia play India?
Allan Border: It’s just that rivalry. That rivalry has intensified over the years. [They have a] very healthy respect for each other, but once they get out on the park it’s a given. That’s what I really enjoy. Test cricket really comes alive when Australia plays India.
Mike Hussey: It’s just going to be a fascinating series. If you think back to a couple years ago, we didn’t have [Steve] Smith or [David] Warner. It was a newer-look Australian team who I thought fought hard. India won that series and now have belief they can win in Australia, but Australia are going to be a better team.
Who are you most looking forward to watching from the Indian side?
Kerry O’Keeffe: Two words for you: Virat Kohli. I think he’s the best theatre in world cricket. Every time he walks onto a cricket field, I am magnetised towards him. The swagger, the emotion, the technical purity when he bats. And he doesn’t like Australians! He will again be absolutely so desperate to win this series as they did two years ago. It’s Virat Kohli that holds the key. Tim Paine will test the water on how he’s going and he’ll be aggressive towards Virat and that will be worth being ringside for.
Isa Guha: [Virat Kohli] is the king of the world, he is such a quality player. He is someone that continues to deliver. He has come to Australia and won as captain, but this time around it’s Steve Smith and Dave Warner in the Australian [Test] team. I think that will provide a bit more competition.
Border: Obviously Virat Kohli – talk about a quality class act! The way he goes about his cricket, his passion for the game, his technique you can dissect, he just stands up to all the great players. I just love his attitude. He’s the new India – the confidence, the way he strides to the crease, the way he talks about the game and the passion he shows quite obviously on the field. Family is everything and I admire his decision to go home after the first Test match for the birth of his first child – the best bit is he is here for seven matches and the only place you can watch every Kohli match is on FOX CRICKET.
Which players do you love commentating on most?
Adam Gilchrist: Pat Cummins. You just feel like something is going to happen every time he charges in. He is just a brilliant all-round cricketer – his endurance, it’s just fascinating to watch. He would be a captain’s dream. He is a standout boy there.
Will it be Australia or India that win the Test?
Guha: Australia will take it. I just think the side and the way they look, with Marnus Labuschagne coming into the lineup, there is incredible depth there. The pace attack with the likes of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood – they are going to wear you down. It will be Australia, but it will be a good contest.
Border: Two to nil Australia, depending on conditions. We have the team together now that can beat India in Australia. We are in our backyard.
O’Keeffe: Australia two to one. It’s crucial Australia wins the first Test. India will miss the big crowds this summer because Kohli and those players feed off big crowds. [It’s in Australia’s] favour that there’s not that Indian contingent there as big as it has been. The toss is crucial – India is a bat-first team and Australia is a bat-first team.
Hussey: Australia will start favourites and I think Australia will win the series. Let’s go two to one.
Gilchrist: Australia two to one [without] the gaping hole that was there with Smith and Warner [serving bans] last time. Marnus is a world-class player in the current landscape. They are huge holes the Aussies had to fill from two years ago. And the bowling lineup continues to just be one of the better-performed ones across the world. I think our guys will get it across the line this time.

It is usually, in fact, a lengthy essay that present the writer’s debate, but often the precise definition is unclear, overlapping with that of an argumentative paper, a personal essay, a report, a short story, and even a novel. Essays are traditionally been categorized as both formal and educational or casual as well as popular. In recent decades, a third kind has surfaced -“informal” – that allows for a wider variety of expressive possibilities than would have been possible in previous decades. The”essay format” now identifies a more fluid combination of components that will be broadly constructed in a number of different ways.
The frequent thread in all sorts of essay writing is the capacity to synthesize the arguments presented within the article. However, as we’ve observed, it is possible to do so further by introducing arguments in different ways, creating various stylistic choices that may further refine the presentation of the article. Pupils are encouraged to research these different options in their essays. And there are a number of good reasons why.
One very powerful way to arrange essay content would be always to use the descriptive article format. A descriptive article relies on the pupil’s usage of private details, monitoring, and knowledge concerning specific topics to support and boost the main point of the essay. By way of instance, a research essay may rely on the researcher’s description of the various facets of an experiment. In precisely the same vein, a cultural studies article could utilize the observations and opinions of the writer as a representative of the people depicted in the narrative. These personal details permit the essay to stay topical, even though much of the material is generically based on many distinct regions of research. This is a particularly useful arrangement for research-based essays, in which the personal insights offered up from the essay subject are supported by scientific facts.
Another crucial concept for good essay writing is the capability to connect the different strands of the essay’s argument. The thesis statement of the article reflects the central point of the essay, laying the main focus of this article. But although the thesis is essential, it’s very important to the article to have plenty of supporting evidence to back up the thesis statement. This evidence can come from a number of different kinds of sources, including literary texts, personal stories, or documentaries. After the strength of this evidence warrants it, the essay can employ what’s known as”pep talk” to bring the various strands of the article together.
A story essay is another commonly used format for article writing. Much like the thesis statement, the narrative focus is supported by the truth within the body of the article. However, the potency of the case rests upon how well the essay draws the reader into the narrative. Essays which do not tell a complete and persuasive narrative will frequently lose their general attractiveness.
Finally, an effective essay uses the use of this paragraph. The paragraph is capable of expressing the various points and ideas contained in the essay. The main argument of an article is generally expressed in a paragraph which includes both a thesis statement and a body of supporting evidence. In this manner, the thesis and the remainder of the essay’s argument are closely intertwined in the body of this essay.I try to avoid appearing as one of those self proclaimed experts who compare performances. You know the type. They say things like “I preferred the third grave digger in the ’28 production. Olivier. At the Old Vic. Oh, didn’t you see it?”
Well, the last time I saw Will Eno’s Thom Pain (based on nothing) was in 2009. Luke Mullins. Downstairs Belvoir. Oh, didn’t you see it?
Mullin’s Thom was more aggressive than the current Thom, played by David Jeffrey in this SITCO production, directed by Julie Baz.
Mullin’s was more lash out, than lash in (a play on words I’ve taken from Eno’s brilliant script.) Jeffrey is more inward, more self-deprecating. His performance is touching and very, very funny.
The title is an intriguing entree to the world of the play. The ‘Pain’ is obvious: Thom is disconnected. He speaks of himself in the third person. He refers to a past romantic relationship, but we never get her name.
But Thom Pain is also Poor Tom from King Lear. (Eno’s allusion, not mine.) Like Edgar in Lear, who adopts the persona Poor Tom at a time of crisis, Thom finds in ‘madness’ a type of security. His uproarious ramblings are much more structured than one might initially imagine, and his stories are sharper than any vulnerable tear-laden sharing. This one man show will not leave you feeling you’ve accidentally stumbled into some sort of support group. Thom is very much in control of his narrative. And, with a lot of laughs, you’re going to hear it his way.
Thom Pain also evokes Thomas Paine. (Or at least it does for me. Maybe I’m more nerd than wanker.) Paine was the English/American radical writer responsible for Common Sense, which fired the American independence movement, and The Rights of Man, which defended the French Revolution’s dream of liberty, equality and fraternity. He was a man deeply dissatisfied with the existing order, a man who demanded we could do better. Perhaps predictably, he died estranged from many of his contemporaries. Only six people attended his funeral. Eno’s Thom Pain could conceivably share the same fate.
But I don’t want to push this allusion too far. Eno’s Thom is more existential in his pain. More self centred.
And one of the things that makes this play so very dazzling is its dynamic and endlessly inventive word play. Eno takes simple idiomatic expressions, and inverts them, reverses them, pulls them inside out. (One small example, no doubt misquoted: “I didn’t know where I was, but I know I wasn’t in love.”) Idiomatic language is our companion in the everyday (and so, oddly, an intimation of the eternal). It speaks our common humanity. But Thom is betrayed by this common humanity. Or is he the traitor?
Either way, in this production, the result is hilarious.

Old Fitzroy til 10 MayApple launches its affiliate program before launching the podcast
Last month, Apple announced it would begin allowing podcast makers and publishers to contribute high subscription for their audience. Prior to its launch this month, the company is expanding its Services Performance Partner program to see also podcasts (via Products). The affiliate program offers students the opportunity to earn 50% Commission if they turn someone into a paid recipient.
This is how it works. Say, after connecting to an Apple connector, someone subscribes to a subscription that costs $ 10 per month. The person or organization connected to this site will receive a $ 5 fee once the user pays the first month of payment. Apple will not force the committee, and it applies to all subscribers.
The program of the program is open for everyone in the 170 countries where Apple will offer podcast funding later this month, but being a partner needs to be approved by the company. Apple suggests it is very sensible for podcast makers and publishers to participate. They can use the links they have to earn extra money from their products (and more reduced by 30 percent, and then 15% cut, Apple will take from paid podcast subscriptions). Each student will receive an affiliate link that they can add to their Apple Podcasts URL. In addition, tokens work with third-party broker-dealer services and create visuals for manufacturers to track their costs.
It may seem strange for Apple to set up a social network before signing up for a premium podcast. However, it is one of the things that helps to have a first date to encourage manufacturers to submit subscriptions first.

Coronavirus and Obesity: What You Need to Know
If you or a loved one has underlying health conditions, including obesity, you may be especially worried about coronavirus (COVID-19). Because COVID-19 is a new virus, we are still learning a lot about it. Based on current information and data, it appears that patients who have COVID-19 and are obese are at a higher risk of becoming critically ill than those with COVID-19 who are not obese.
What is obesity?
Obesity is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30.0 or higher. Curious about your BMI? You can use the CDC’s Adult BMI Calculator to figure out your BMI by entering your weight and height. An important note is that BMI does not directly measure body fat, so on an individual level, it can be used as a screening tool but not as a diagnostic tool.
How is obesity linked to coronavirus?
Obesity is a very complicated health issue that results from a combination of causes and contributing factors. People who have obesity are at an increased risk for many serious diseases and health conditions as opposed to those with a normal or healthy weight. These include high blood pressure (hypertension), Type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease. According to a report from the National Health Service’s Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre, two thirds of patients with COVID-19 who required critical care were also overweight or obese. The Louisiana Department of Health’s update from March 27 included a listing of underlying conditions among COVID-19 related patients, showing that 28% of those who died also had obesity.
I have obesity. How can I keep myself safe?
For those with obesity, your safest option is prevention. You should follow the precautions below:

Adrienne Houghton: Got it..It is now after the latest version of the prolific Sober worm was programmed to launch its next round of attacks, and there appears to be little sign that the worm is doing any of the damage it was expected to unleash.
"There's nothing going on with Sober" at the moment, said Joe Telafici, director of operations at McAfee's Anti Virus Emergency Response Team (AVERT.)
All of the Web sites the last version of the Sober worm was programmed to reach out to and download malicious code from have already been disabled, he said. As a result, no malicious files are available for download by either infected systems or anyone else, he said.
Because the worm -- which surfaced on Nov. 22 -- and its variants have been around for a while, many systems are also likely to have been patched or otherwise protected against the threat, according to Mike Murray, director of vulnerability and exposure research at nCircle Network Security in San Francisco.
"From what we are seeing out there, things appear to be very much under control," said Rajat Bhargava, president and CEO of StillSecure, a Superior, Colo.-based security vendor. "People feel like they may have dodged the bullet."
At the same time, it would be a mistake to dismiss the Sober threat entirely, he said.
"Sober is still out there. It's a sleeper threat," he said. "The fact that it can be remotely executed makes it scary."
The worm also contains an algorithm that every few days generates new URL addresses from which it then attempts to download malicious code, Telafici said. As a result, the worm could start spreading again in future.
The Sober worm and its variants are believed to have been authored by German hackers and have emerged as one of most prolific pieces of malware ever. The worm does not target any specific vulnerability. Rather, it requires users to open a malicious file attachment in e-mails or to click on links that contain malicious attachments.
The last version of the worm appeared on Nov. 22, Inauguration Day for Germany's first female chancellor. It was programmed to be reactivated at midnight GMT on Jan 5, when it was supposed to download and run malicious files from certain Web domains. Like other variants, the latest Sober version comes with its own SMTP engine to spread itself. But the code has been tweaked to send out copies much faster than earlier versions.
Even though the latest version appears to be doing little damage to corporate networks at the moment, there is still an enormous amount of e-mail traffic that is being generated by it, said Andrew Lochart, senior director of marketing at Postini, a San Carlos, Calif.-based provider of e-mail management services.
In the last 24 hours alone, Postini has blocked over 53 million e-mails containing the latest Sober variant on behalf of its clients, Lochart said. That number is about 10 times higher than the next most prolific worm and represents close to 98 percent of all e-mails blocked by Postini, he said.
"It really is an astonishingly virulent worm" that has easily surpassed all other worms in history in terms of its propagation, he said. "We've never seen a single worm or virus that has just kept going on and on like this one has."
The director of information security at a speciality retailer in California who wished to remain anonymous said that his company stopped a higher than normal volume of Sober-related e-mails at its network gateways last week. Starting around Dec 27, when the news of the Windows Metafile (WMF) flaw was disclosed, the company began seeing a sharp spike in the volume of e-mails -- from an average of about 1,500 to 2,000 per day to more than 50,000 e-mails that were filtered out by its perimeter defenses, he said.
"The biggest question is whether this represents the high water mark or if it will go higher," he said.Dumbarton Middle School Network

To install an intermediate certificate on a Microsoft IIS web server, follow the directions below. However, to be able to access all of these screens, you’ll need to run the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) with administrator access.
Step 1: Download all certificates mentioned above on the desktop of the web server machine.
Step 2: Click the Start button and search for Run.
Step 3 Type mmc and click OK to access the Microsoft Management Console.
Step 4: Click on File and select Add/Remove Snap-in.
Step 5: Select Certificates and click Add.
Step 6: Select Computer Account and click Next.
Step 7: Select Local Computer and select Finish.
Step 8: Close the Snap-in box, click OK in the Add/Remove Snap-in.
Step 9: Return to the MMC screen.
To install your Sectigo Intermediate Certificate/Certificates certificate:
Right-click the Intermediate Certification Authorities. Select All Tasks and choose Import.
Click Next.
Step 10: Browse and Locate the Intermediate CA SectigoUTNSGCCA.crt and click Next.
When the wizard is done, click Finish. (Note: You can select only one intermediate certificate file at a time.)
Step 11: Go back to the MMC and repeat the same procedures mentioned in steps 9 and 10 to install all of the remaining intermediate certificate files that you got from the CA.
Once you install all of the intermediate certificates, make sure all Sectigo intermediate certificates appear under Intermediate Certification Authorities (specify a location where this would appear).

Messy Pages Make the Most Beautiful Masterpieces
Sharon Jaynes
Today’s Truth
Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I ever did” (John 4:39 NIV).
Friend to Friend
Everyone loves a good story. But not everyone likes their own story. I wouldn’t have written my childhood story the way it now appears on the page. Instead, I would have had a daddy who loved me, a momma who cherished me, and a big brother who was my best friend. We would have spent holidays eating turkey, weekends playing board games, and quiet moments before bed saying goodnight prayers. But that’s not the story I got.
I would have had a passel of children, a calendar overbooked with afterschool activities, and walls full of picture-framed little ones all grown up. But that’s not the story I got.
I would have had best friends who stayed friends for life, and a happy-go-lucky personality that never struggled with discouragement. But that’s not the story I got.
I think we’ve all looked at our lives and wanted to rip a few pages from the narrative. But it’s difficult to understand a story if there are missing chapters. Each chapter helps explain why characters are the way they are—why you and I are the way we are. We can’t tear out a page or skip a chapter and still make sense of our story. But we can learn to embrace the story we got, and to trust God to keep writing our story into his.
The Samaritan woman who met Jesus at the well didn’t like her story at all. Rather than go to gather water in the cool of the morning or evening, she went in the heat of the day to avoid all the other women who met there. She was embarrassed, ashamed, and most likely felt thrown away like trash by husbands numbers 1-4. Hers was not a good story.
But Jesus came to change all that. It started with a question, “Will you give me a drink?” (John 4: 7) And it ended with an astounding revelation that Jesus had not spoken to another soul, “I, the one speaking to you—I am he [the Messiah],” (John 4:26). She dropped her water pot on the ground and ran into town to tell everyone about a new chapter in her story.
When we drop our water pots filled with anger, shame, condemnation, regret, and bitterness, the Living Water cuts a trail in the dust and sends us on a new course for life.
What’s the story you got? Whatever it is, I’m guessing there are pages you wish you could rip out of the narrative. I’ve never met a soul who didn’t. But what I want to tell you is that the whole of it matters. Every crossed-out word. Every worn-thin erasure. Every ripped-out page. I believe that with my whole heart. You can have a better story, even with the marred pages intact. You can change the ending of your story, even if it feels like you’re trapped in a chapter that has come to a dead stop. There is a way to transform the worst parts of your story into a work of art. Your biggest mistakes have the potential to become God’s greatest miracles.
We can wrest redemption from the jaws of brokenness and then allow God to use it for good. That’s what God did with the Samaritan woman at the well. She used her story for good by telling those she had previously avoided about the Messiah who stopped just for her. And because of the change they saw in her—the mere fact that she was running all over town rather than hiding from town—“Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I ever did” (John 4:39 NIV).
It may be hard to believe that it’s possible for God to use your pain for purpose if you’re still living through a bad story, but don’t give up hope. I have experienced it and witnessed it in the lives of others so many times—how God takes the hard things and uses them to showcase his mercy, grace, forgiveness, to create a new beginning. Yes, our worst chapters can become God’s best miracles. Our pain can become a portal of God’s grace. Our ravaged pages can become God’s redemptive masterpiece.
Let’s Pray
Heavenly Father, I trust that Your pen never slips when it comes to writing my story. Help me to give You the messy pages and the broken stages and not to cling to them with an unrelenting hand. I trust You to make beauty from ashes in my life. Give me the courage to tell others about what You have done in my life.
In Jesus’ Name, Amen.
Now It’s Your Turn
What are some pages that you would like to rip out of your story?
How have you seen God use some of your worst chapters for the good of others or yourself?
We’d love to hear your comments! Please click on comment and[Vlog] What is Diagnostics Over IP (ISO 13400) and How it Powers Remote Vehicle Diagnostics
Your vehicle is driven not just by the engine but also by number of software applications residing inside multiple electronic control units.
A lot of such applications such as ABS, Power Steering, Seat Control System, Powertrain Module and more are also safety critical.
This implies that if one of these applications encounters some error, it may not be safe to continue driving.
In such a situation, as a driver, you need Remote Assistance to bail you out. And remote assistance is effective only when Remote Vehicle Diagnostics is possible.
ISO 13400 based DoIP protocol stack is the invisible superhero which makes Remote Vehicle Diagnostics a reality.
Our latest video in the vehicle diagnostics series is about Diagnostics over IP protocol stack and how it powers remote automotive diagnostics.
This DoIP Protocol Video Revolves Around the Following Topics
- An introduction to Diagnostics Over IP Protocol
- What Makes DoIP protocol so Important- A Simple Use-Case
- How DoIP Enables Remote Vehicle Diagnostics
- Important Features of DoIP Protocol Stack
- Where do you find DoIP in Action?
The video depicts a real-life scenario to show how DoIP Protocol Stack helps resolve a fault in vehicle, from a remote location. This sets the tone for understanding DoIP protocol with a clear perspective.
We have tried to be as brief as possible to keep the video engaging. If you are left asking for more, you can check our detailed blog on Diagnostics over IP and how it works.
We will be back with another video in the series with a detailed architecture of DoIP protocol stack. Watch for this space.Special Environment Systems
CES designs, builds and installs special controlled environments for clients requiring spaces with exacting environmental standards.
Special Environments
For over 28 years, CES Special Environments have been found in food storage and food manufacturing businesses, high-tech manufacturing, R&D facilities, life-science labs, biotech firms and educational institutions. In most cases, these are custom designed environments that are tailored to the specific products being manufactured, grown or harvested, or to the unique science or process being employed there.
The big differentiator in our specialty environment business is a greater requirement for risk avoidance. As an example, a biotech application with very expensive medicines or fluids, require additional safety nets that we build within our Special Environment systems.
Built-in redundancy is often employed, like adding an additional refrigeration system in an environment that requires precise cool temperatures. If one system goes down, the second system will start to function. Additionally, the client needs to be alerted when there is a systems failure. Thus we place a great deal higher level of sensing technology into those rooms built around that refrigeration system that function within a custom control system.
There is also a need for uniformity. When working on a produce growing application or storage application, a temperature of 40 degrees plus or minus two or three degrees could be acceptable. But for some types of chemical assay or a medical application, CES often has to deliver a tight uniformity, plus or minus half a degree or one degree everywhere within the space, no matter where they place that product.
The big design drivers for these facilities in the life science space are even more tightly regulated under an FDA versus a USDA protocol. This much tighter protocol brings systems that require a deeper dive into commissioning and validation.
When CES builds these life science applications, they’re laden with sensors and safety devices. Additionally, all of those items require checkout and commissioning. And in short, when the client wants to prove out all the varied levels of performance, we provide the controls and the data collection to satisfy the most demanding needs, whether in the biotech or medical industries. All these applications have to be stable, backed up, and redundant, to avoid risk.
Our Special Environments are typically integrated solutions. We design and engineer the refrigeration system or the mechanical system, and then we will integrate controls and the monitoring on that mechanical system, all bundled as one solution. Everything works hand in hand.
De-Risk Your Projects
Our primary goal is to eliminate the risk for our customers in their special environments. Often in special environments, we are called in by a general contractor where this environment is a small piece of a much larger project for them, yet they need this room to function precisely.
A big part of our sophisticated special environment projects is data analytics and incidence reporting. When something goes wrong, the control systems can send out an email, a text message, or can make a phone call. Once alerted, we also provide the tools to best diagnose and break that problem down. That’s where our data analytics comes into play.
For example, on any FDA regulated facility, all the life sciences need to prove that the product or the process actually resides in the room. If there is an excursion due to some sort of a failure, they need to have the data that documents the extent of the excursion and when it was returned back to spec.
Our clients have a significant need for the data, which is all the electronic logging and data that’s part of our systems, and then certainly we have a deeper set of data that we need to best diagnose and best monitor system performance.
Our Clean Rooms are fully integrated. Because these clean rooms are typically small spaces, it makes the project more difficult and specialized. It is much easier to control a 10,000 cubic foot special environment than it is a 900 cubic foot special environment like many clean
rooms.
The ISO standard in the clean room part is the non-viable contamination. That’s the dust and materials that’s not alive, smoke, and other hard to find particles.
The other components are bacteria, mold, and fungus. That’s what’s called viable contamination. These rooms have both viable and nonviable contamination risk that their special environments need to address. Our project engineers are thoroughly versed in USDA, FDA, HACCP and ISO requirements.
Call CES today to get more information about how we can help you de-risk your special environment.

They’re sharing Latino culture through craft beer.
These breweries are part of a mission to make craft beer more inclusive while educating others about their culture.
"Craft beer needed to become more diverse and needed to include more change and more people," said Sergio Manancero, owner of La Doña Cervecería in Minneapolis.
Manancero grew up in Minnesota, but his family is from Uruguay. He said he grew up around a growing immigrant population, and he was moved to start his own business after serving in the military.
"When I returned from the Marine corps in 2013 and started going to breweries in the Twin Cities, the kids I grew up with weren’t going to them and so I was trying to understand why," he said.
La Doña Cervecería was established in 2016 and opened a taproom two years later. It's the state's first Latino-influenced craft brewery.
"The whole idea and principle was to create a space for Latinos to get entrance into the craft beer scene because they were being left out," Manancero said.
For lager lovers and ale aficionados, La Doña is a place to connect with others, but for a growing part of the population, the brewery feels like a piece of home.
"Anybody can come in here and feel like they’re part of something," said Isa Pucci, a cashier for the brewery's kitchen.
Census Bureau data shows the Hispanic and Latino population in Minnesota grew 38% since 2010.
The brewery and kitchen staff is a diverse mix of people with roots in Central and South America.
"I was born in La Paz, Bolivia, and about 10 years ago, my dad actually moved here to Minnesota," Pucci said.
Manancero said La Doña was an opportunity to welcome the Latino community into the craft beer scene without feeling intimidated.
"You can have a beer and lower that self-consciousness," he said. "Then it’s educating the Latino community on what is an IPA and getting basic with them."
Latino culture is engrained into the brewery from the ingredients in their beers to the art on the walls to the events they offer, like three-on-three soccer games and conversation clubs.
"We’d set up tables - advanced, intermediate, beginner tables - and we invited people that wanted to learn Spanish to come," Manancero said.
"Even if you walk in here and you’re not Hispanic, you can find something for yourself here still," Pucci said.
Manancero hopes other industries will take note.
"I know what I’m doing is making beer and selling it to people, but it feels bigger than it is because of the way that we’re doing it," he said. "Write things in Spanish, host events that are around their holidays that are for them and then you can access them."Alien Srayu (スレイユ星人 Sureiyu Seijin) is an alien race that appeared in Ultraman Cosmos. Despite this, only one appeared, named Lamia (ラミア Ramia).
Subtitle: Super Galaxy Alien (超銀河宇宙人 Chō Ginga Uchūjin)
History
Ultraman Cosmos
Long ago in the past, Planet Srayu was a utopia, a planet with no armies that enjoyed a time of peace. However this peace was destroyed by invaders who attacked the planet. Afterwards the people of Srayu decided that any planet that was deemed a potential threat to them would be destroyed. Discovering Earth, they sent Lamia, a representative for them to brought the planet annihilating robot Guinje to Earth. Upon arrival, the SHARKS attack force attacked Guinje, the UFO vanished but not before it dropped an escape pod that contained an unconscious Lamia. While under the care of SRC, Lamia awoke a week later and escaped. Seeing the heavy military presence in the city, she deemed Earth a threat. When she tried to activated Guinje, a group of youngsters stole the key from her and ran away while unintentionally activating the robot killer. It emerged from a building where it was camouflaged and transformed into robot mode. The robot was proven a challenge as it could withstand the combined assault from Team EYES, SHARK forces and Ultraman Cosmos. Doctor Noboru returned the key to her and asked the alien to deactivate the robot but only for his words to fall on deaf's ears. The military forces approached the girl, as one of them accidentally fired a pistol but Dr. Noboru took the bullet instead to defend Lamia. Witnessing the doctor's bravery in saving her, Lamia embraced and healed him, changing her view towards mankind and deactivated Guinje then departed away from Earth.

Over the last six years or so Chicago’s theater scene has been flooded with literary adaptations. But few have approached the power, polish, and grit of the Theatre de Complicite’s take on John Berger’s novel Pig Earth. Retelling Berger’s earthy, gloomy, violent story of a misfit peasant woman, Lucie Cabrol–from birth to death and beyond–this British company reproduces in unflinching detail the squalor of country life. Early in the play a hog is slaughtered in a bathtub, and in the company’s trademark style the hog is played by a squirming, squealing actor. Artistic director Simon McBurney, who studied mime at the famed Jacques Lecoq School, has his ensemble play not only several dozen peasants but horses, trees, chickens, even furrows of earth being turned by a plow in one magnificent scene. But the mimed whimsy of the hog killing is not meant to soften its brutality. Where one of our local Northwestern-trained companies might have aestheticized the act with long, beautiful red ribbons, the actor’s cries and thrashing terror here make the butchery palpable. The next moment, in a bit of Brueghel-like low comedy, a woman wearing a look of pure boredom dumps out a bloody bucket of guts, showing how much this killing is just part of the daily rural grind. Still, there’s a stark beauty to this unsentimental work, including an image at the top of the show: we see pair after pair after pair of empty work shoes, grave markers for peasants who’ve died in harness. Athenaeum Theatre, 2936 N. Southport, 722-5463 or 902-1500. Opens Wednesday, September 4, 7:30 PM. Through September 8: Thursday, 7:30 PM; Friday-Saturday, 8 PM; Sunday, 3 PM. $10-$36.

10th – 11th Century A.D.
Long have the Norse sagas inspired authors, historians, poets and film makers. The Icelandic and Kings sagas present some of the most culturally rich and elaborate accounts of Viking life. Through them, we learn of Norse customs, traditions, and beliefs. At the forefront of this culture, is the consideration of art as a central focal point in Norse life.
The Vikings raided and colonised wide areas of Europe between the 9th to the 11th century. Whereas the initial motives for the migrations are unknown, historians unanimously agree that their disruptive influence profoundly affected European political history and trade.
Widely recognised as superior craftsmen, the Vikings created remarkable Jewellery, jewellery.

I was lucky enough to be a part of 8 weddings during the months of October and November. Each wedding was so beautiful and unique. I feel very grateful to have the chance to play a role in people's important life events. Upon reflection the past couple of months, I wanted to share some of the feedback I got from my amazing clients!
From Dominic and Quincy:
With so many details to coordinate for a wedding, it is refreshing to know that you may put your trust in DJ Hersch to manage your audio from start to finish. Our requirements were to have a perfect first song and to keep our guests entertained.
Planning the event was made easier by his responsiveness to emails and other communications. Most emails were responded to within an hour if not that same day. This promptness and professionalism spoke a great deal about the level of service to be provided. We had a loose list of songs that we wanted to hear over the course of the event but DJ Hersch guided us through the specifics and managed our expectations well. We asked for our must-haves at certain spots but were comfortable enough to request broad genres and suggestions based on his read of the guests.
Let DJ Hersch manage your audio needs and allow you the time for managing other things. His promptness, organization, and experience allowed our family and guests to have a wonderful time.
From Mike and Christina:
DJ Jeremy Hersch was our DJ for my wedding. Jeremy accommodated all our requests!
From Joanna and Pete
DJ Hersch is phenomenal and so easy to work with. We planned our wedding long distance and he was super flexible and accommodating. He listened to us and played the exact genres of music that we requested. Absolutely no bad wedding songs. We couldn't be happier!
From Darryl and Bonita
All I can say (to Jeremy Hersch) is Thank you! You made the wedding day of Bonita and Darryl so much more! We are eternally grateful and thank you for being part of our family celebration: Bravo-Zulu/ Blessings

Thank you for the picture Kylie Rae Photography!

“A lot of people may be wondering: ‘Wait a minute, what’s going to happen to my photo?"” Benitez asked. “‘Is Delta going to keep my information?"”
“It’s a very valid concern,” Goswami said. “First, we are not storing any photographic imagery at all. All we do is take your photo. And because you’ve uploaded your passport number as part of your Delta profile… we take that passport number and that picture. We just check it against the customs database from your passport photo.”
With Delta expecting more than 5.5 million travelers over the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday, the pilot program will come at the perfect time.
“It’s actually a good congruence of circumstances that we have this technology ready,” said Byron Merritt, Delta’s vice president of experience design. “We’re going to be able to bring it to life before the holidays and hopefully make a better experience for our customers as they come back.”I have always maintained that one of the fundamental responsibilities of the fantasy or science fiction writer is the responsibility to create a contextually plausible setting for the story to take place in. Actually, this is a minimum requirement for a successful story. If the writer doesn’t deliver this, then the events of the story will seem to be occurring in an emotionally detached ether of sorts.
To help gel together the fantastic realm in a fantasy novel, the writer will often create the fantasy map. Now you can give a reference point for the Mystic Tower in relation to the Dragon Hoard. But for the indie author on a budget, this seems to be a potential problem. At least, it is for me. I’m not a strong graphic artist. I can’t really draw, and my design skills are challenged (but it looks good in my head!).
I started my map on a paper sketch pad, and went back and forth on the layout for months. Eventually I digitized it with my Lexmark scanner, and then I imported it into GIMP (open source freeware). Once there, I started trying to clean it up. The image you see above is the result. The problem, of course, is that it’s obviously the work of an amateur. Middle Earth it isn’t.
So now I’m presented with a question: do I continue to clean it up and use it? Do I forgo the map entirely and allow (at least for this first novella) the reader to imagine the world of Maladine? Or has the map become so expected that I need it, and I should be looking for a tool or artist to create it?
Right now I’m leaning toward keeping this one, assuming I can polish it up a bit more. But I’m very curious how other fantasy writers overcome this little obstacle. Any suggestions?
WEL.
Thanks for that Shay! I’m impressed that your friend uses Paint. GIMP is pretty powerful, but it’s limited by me and my lack of experience using it. I share your time restrictions too. I have a greater need to write, but I’d love to get a solid map out there. That’s a great suggestion to have it on the web page too.
I don’t really pay a lot of attention to maps in novels, but yours looks pretty darn good to me. I’ve seen some in traditionally published books that weren’t particularly detailed. Some are the opposite, of course. It’s not my area of expertise, so don’t go by me, just wanted to say I think you did a good job on it :-} Nikki
Thank you so much for that! I appreciate the input, and I especially appreciate the comment on my map. I think it can be usable, but there’s a bit of work that needs to still happen. But thank you again!
I can go without looking at a map in novels, so long as (this is the big thing for me) the author knows where things belong. Building world maps seems to me to be a greater need for the author than for the reader.
Thank you Jeff. That’s a very interesting thought, that the author needs it more than the reader. It kind of echoes other comments I’m hearing. That’s definitely something to think about. Thanks for that!
Good post, William. As a reader I rely on maps for situational context. I find myself occasionally referring back to the map especially in complex stories where events are geographically dispersed. I would argue that maps are useless in Sci-Fi, but that’s another thread. I agree with Jeff, as an author it helps me keep the threads of my story consistent, respecting time and space. I also agree with Nikki. I think your map is quite good and rises above the amateur. I do everything in Photoshop and as you say, we are limited to our savvy of the software.
Thanks very much Jeff, for the input and especially for your kind remarks on my map. I’ve received a lot of good feedback on this topic, and you make a great case for keeping the map. I tend to agree with the scifi comment too, though it has been used to good effect in some books. I know that photoshop is a powerful tool, and I may purchase it one day.
As a reader, I never found the maps to be very useful. In the cases where I’ve referred to a map, it’s because I’m lost and I feel like that’s a failure of the writer to put me in that position. I’m not a writer, but I wonder if having a map might actually become a crutch?
A couple of people have brought up that possibility now. One person on twitter suggested that it is great to have, but the story has to be able to stand without it. I tend to agree. Thanks Ted!
I created a map for my own reference for my story, but never thought about including it in my ebook. Now you’ve got me thinking about it…Hmmm. 😉
I really love a good map with a fantasy story, if only because (if it’s well done) it can add a sense of history to the story.
you have your map so you can write in context. My imagination will do the work for me as I read.
Good luck with the book. Don’t forget to tweet when it’s out.
Thank you Bob! I find it incredible the range of opinions on this topic. I can see that a common thread throughout seems to be that the story, if a map is included, needs to be able to stand alone.

I’d say use a map, if you can. Some readers will find it useful. Even people who don’t refer to it may find that it adds a sense of authenticity to your story. Speaking of which, it seems to me that maps in your world would all be hand-drawn. Maybe your map should be hand-drawn as well.
When I was a kid, we used to use black fountain pens to draw fanastic pirate maps on brown paper – torn from a shopping bag, complete with rough edges. When the design was finished and the ink was dry, we’d crumple them up into balls – smoothe them out, and repeat many (many) times. The result was very cool and very old looking. Sometimes we burned the edges with a lighter, to add to the impression of age.
If you draw your map by hand, age the paper and then scan it, I bet you could get something that looks like it belongs in your fantasy world. Parts of it might become difficult to read or make out, but doesn’t that add to the authenticity?
Fantastic Jeff, thanks! It’s funny because I was trying to use my GIMP software to achieve a similar effect, since my drawing skills are limited (the map in the article started hand drawn). You’ve given me something to think about. Thank you
I love a good map as a reader and tend to refer back to it often as I read. As a writer, I found it essential to at least create a map for my own sense of geography and setting…whether that map makes it to the boook would be up to publishers I would think cause I sure as heck aint no artist.
I’m with you Kate. I originally drew up my map for reference as I started writing stories in this world of mine. But I’d be lying if I said that I didn’t have the idea to include it at some point in my books. It’s just that now that it’s getting to be decision time, I’m not sure the quality is there. Thanks for your comment!
I like your map. I’ve tried making more modern maps, and some of them have turned out alright. I have one on my computer somewhere that I drew a few years ago I think looks pretty good. It could still do with some polishing though. =P
I appreciate your comment Nick, thank you! I’m going to try and polish this a bit more over the next week or two. I’m going to be self publishing this novella shortly after the copy editing is finishing, so toward the end of February. Not a lot of time, but I may be able to get to a point that I’m happy enough with it to share. How have you drawn your maps…freehand or through software/Photoshop?
I’ve drawn them both ways. I usually sketch with pencil, scan it, and then trace over my sketch in Photoshop/Painter. For more “modern” maps, I add grid lines and color and what not.
Hi William. Excellent question. I feel that if you do choose to have a map that it should work the same as an outline. It can be an invaluable guide to the author in moving along a story line, characters, and locations. A map can help you to remember your setting for the present scene in your story, helping you with mood and descriptions. It can also help you to empathize with your characters current situation and plight as well the hurdles they must overcome to reach the next part of the story.
Thanks Brian! A couple people now have compared the map to an outline, and that’s a really good point. I’m pretty certain after all this discussion that I’ll keep the map, because I think (as you say) that it’ll help the reader keep track of what is going on where. Thanks for your input!

I use Campaign Cartographer for my maps, and I love a map in a fantasy book.
I had never heard of Campaign Cartographer before. I just did a google search, and now I’ve saved the link. I’ll certainly explore that more this evening. Thank you!
I expect a map and refer back to it while I’m reading. Even a middle-grade book needs one, and not just for the young readers, but for the writer. My map (Heartland of another Earth, overlaying the US and parts of Canada) is still a little messy but I have it on my website in full color thanks to an artist who sent me the first color version out of the blue because we were both in Rachael Harrie’s Platform Building Campaign. You can see it at through the book tab at the top. I think I left a link to the artist.
Thank you for your comment! A few people now have stated similar sentiments. I tend to agree with you that, especially in a fantasy novel, a map is expected. Thanks for the link. I’ll definitely check it out!Subscribe to the Plaid Crafts Newsletter for craft project ideas, product news, our live events, and more!

Based in Worthing, West Sussex, Bowers & Wilkins is a well-known British firm producing a range of audio equipment, most notably loudspeakers.
Bowers & Wilkins’ diamond dome tweeter loudspeakers contain small, exceptionally delicate parts are very hard to handle, and easily distorted with contact. As a leading name in the industry with exceptionally high standards, quality is very important to Bowers & Wilkins. The tolerance of every component made, therefore, must be met with exceptional accuracy. The components had proven difficult to measure with more traditional methods of measurement such as CMM machines or calipers, as these require the parts to be touched, therefore increasing the likelihood of the component becoming distorted, damaged, or out of tolerance.
As part of the Bowers Group, the team at Baty upgraded Bowers & Wilkins’ existing Baty R14-GXL to the R14-FT2E, meaning that the company now benefits from the Fusion 2D touch screen DRO and optical edge detection not offered on the previous model.
David Naylor, Quality Supervisor at Bowers & Wilkins said: “Highly accurate, perfectly made components are essential for the quality of our products, and the Baty unit enables us to meet those standards by ensuring repeatable and accurate measurements.”
The company previously had an R14 GXL Shadowgraph for over 25 years, but the DRO on the Baty R14-GXL had developed a small fault after decades of use, prompting Bowers & Wilkins to look into options for replacement.
After receiving an email from Bowers Group regarding its retrofit services from the team at Baty, Bowers & Wilkins decided to upgrade its existing machine, dramatically enhancing the functionality, accuracy, and usability of the profile projector without the massive expense of a brand new machine.
“We’re very pleased with the retrofit” said David. “It has completely solved the problems with the old DRO and made the unit function like a new machine. It’s still very user friendly, and the operators are able to use it comprehensively with fairly basic training.”
David continued: “We’d never had the optical edge detection until the upgrade; it has significantly increased the speed of the measurement process, and the touch screen really is easy to use.” It is visually very important that Bowers & Wilkins products are well made, and also very important for the sound quality. Meeting tight tolerances is essential so that components fit together well; both from an aesthetic point of view, and to ensure that the sound quality of the products is perfect.
For example, a Bowers & Wilkins diamond dome tweeter loudspeaker contains voice coils. The dome tweeter is constructed by attaching a voice coil to a dome, which is then attached to a magnet. The dome itself is made from synthetic diamond, which is structurally very stiff, but also delicate. The diamond dome fits into the voice coil, which sits in a magnet. It is absolutely imperative that the coil is within tolerance, otherwise it runs the risk of cracking the dome, or even rubbing on the magnet; distorting the sound and diminishing its quality.
Baty’s Fusion software includes a touch screen DRO which can be fitted to existing Baty, Starrett, Deltronic and Mitutoyo projectors, quickly and easily. As a simple plug and play retrofit, it improves speed, accuracy and ease of reporting for 2D measurement, and the screen mounted optical edge sensor also eliminates problems with operator influence. Time and date stamped reports can be created, including dimensioned drawings generated as standard PDFs.
Founded in 1966 by John Bowers, Bowers & Wilkins is now a hugely successful brand, designing and manufacturing award-winning wireless speakers, wired and wireless headphones, earphones, hi-fi speakers, Bluetooth docking stations, and in-car stereo systems.
“As a premium brand, it is incredibly important that our products look fantastic, but equally important that the quality of sound is absolutely exceptional,” adds David.Relaxations in due date of Filing of GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B-Article also discusses Conditional Date for Waiver of Late Fee and interest payable beyond Waiver Date.

- Description:Purpose We performed an exploratory analysis of data from the National Spina Bifida Patient Registry (NSBPR) to assess variation in the frequency of bladder reconstruction surgeries among NSBPR centers. Methods We queried the 2009–2014 NSBPR to identify patients who had ever undergone bladder reconstruction surgeries. We evaluated demographic characteristics, SB type, functional level, mobility, and NSBPR center to determine whether any of these factors were associated with reconstructive surgery rates. Multivariable logistic regression was used to simultaneously adjust for the impact of these factors. Results We identified 5,528 patients with SB enrolled in the NSBPR. Of these, 1,129 (20.4%) underwent bladder reconstruction (703 augmentation, 382 continent catheterizable channel, 189 bladder outlet procedure). Surgery patients were more likely to be older, female, non-Hispanic white, higher lesion level, myelomeningocele diagnosis, non-ambulators (all p<0.001) and non-privately insured (p=0.018). Bladder reconstruction surgery rates varied among NSBPR centers (range 12.1–37.9%, p<0.001). After correcting for known confounders, NSBPR center, SB-clinical factors such as patient age, gender and treating center are also associated with the likelihood of an individual undergoing bladder reconstruction.

“Just keep it together. It all goes on.”
“At least when they go to Iraq, they give you a gun.…At least you have a fighting chance, not sitting behind a desk….That’s not a level playing field.”
“[The gunman] sucks. That’s what it comes down to. He sucks.”
“I need a smoke break.”
“That’s about as real as it gets, right there.”
—Heard on 105.3 FM driving from D.C. into Blacksburg, Va.
You can pick out the mourners—even at a bar that cranks Lynyrd Skynyrd. A blond woman stomps through London Underground on North Main Street and orders a beer. In her wake are four friends. They form a protective ring around her and/or give one another holy-shit looks. At the center of the ring, you can still see that the woman’s eyes are bloodshot and wet.
Soon, she sees me and my notebook. She hears me interviewing a townie a barstool away.
She wants the notebook to go back in my coat. Now.
I oblige.
On the bar’s TV, CNN has given today a name: “Virginia Tech Massacre.”
Her rage quickly turns to Virginia Tech’s not-quite-ready-for-prime-time president. She leans forward and wags her finger at me. “Ask President [Charles] Steger why they didn’t shut down classes.”.
The Norris Hall crime scene has none of the stuff that has cropped up elsewhere on campus—no homemade signs proclaiming Hokie Love, no spent candles, no bouquets. It is quiet except for the sounds of police tape flapping in the high wind. Along certain sections, the tape has given up, snapped clean from its ties, and sits in the grass next to some crumpled trash and someone’s French homework.
1 a.m.
Four state police officers walk out of Norris and under the police tape.
“Any food, man?” one asks another state trooper just beyond the tape.
In a first-floor classroom, crime scene investigators, detectives, and dudes wearing “security” jackets are gathered. Most of the mayhem took place just above them on the second floor. A French class got hit. So did a German class and an engineering class. The gunman also took out students in the stairwells. Just above the staging room, there’s a broken window where at least two students jumped; one broke an ankle, but both survived.
With the yellow tape rendered useless by the winds, the crime scene is protected at one end by two cops keeping warm in their cruiser.
One trooper came up from Richmond, the other from Fairfax. They kill time by looking at family pictures on a digital camera. The two have been guarding the scene for seven hours.
“It’s just part of the career path,” explains the Fairfax cop.
1:15 a.m.
Scott Werner, 22, shows up at the yellow tape. He’s brought three friends with him. “We’re the ones that didn’t want to watch CNN all night,” he jokes. “I just wanted to check it out. I wanted to see where everything went down.”
Actually, Werner wanted to see where his friend got shot. He says she’s still in the ICU after being hit in the back. The bullet, he says, cut through a kidney and went into her intestines. He says he heard that she’s awake and doing OK. “She was beautiful,” he says. “Anything I had to complain about, she always had a way to turn it around.”
I tell Werner that he is referring to his friend in the past tense.
“I know,” he says.
2:25 a.m.
A red-faced student and his three friends just arrived and are milling about the crime scene. One of the students tells me about the blood stains on the sidewalk just below Norris. I wonder aloud if I’ll be able to find the blood.
“It’s really obvious.”
At the far left corner of the hill, just below Norris, there is indeed a series of blood stains without a perimeter of police tape. The first stain, a series of splatters and blotches, is 24 feet long. A bigger, scarier stain follows it.
It resembles the outline of a body. At the torso, the blood just runs in two streams to the curb and stops.
Ty Biagas walks on it and doesn’t notice. He can’t sleep. He works as a campus minister at Catholic Campus Ministries and officiated a vigil that evening. But it wasn’t enough. He says he knows people who are still missing.
“I had so many classes in that building,” Biagas says, looking at the rooms lit up in Norris Hall. He graduated last December. “I need to get it set in. Maybe this will help me sleep, who knows.”
3 a.m.
The real campus vigil, located at the lip of a lush quad known as Drillfield, is down to two students. One is draped in a dark blanket. He’s just here, he explains, because he has to be. The other is a recent addition. Emily Canis, 19, says she, too, can’t sleep. Her birthday was the day of the massacre.
Canis lives at East Ambler Johnston on the fourth floor. East and West “AJ” are not separate buildings. They are connected by a shared room. The shooting took place on the west side’s fourth floor, a short walk away. She was up when the shooting happened but didn’t hear anything.
Canis went to class at 7:45 a.m. When she returned to her dorm, she saw yellow tape and police. But still, she says, she was told nothing.
Rumors started going around. “We thought maybe a stabbing,” Canis says.
Canis walks up to the vigil and tries to fix the few flowers that are there. They are too battered by the wind to resemble anything but the idea of flowers. But Canis tries her best.
3:45 a.m.
Grafton Peterson and his family have been waiting for nearly 12 hours for word of their freshman daughter, Erin.
They drove in from Centreville, Fairfax County, to Blacksburg, where they’d just been the day before, visiting her for the weekend.
Erin had been a 6-foot-1 center and senior-year captain of the basketball team at Westfield High School, the same high school as the killer, who graduated three years earlier, and another victim—Reema Samaha—who graduated with Erin, Class of ’06.
Erin picked Virginia Tech because it was still close enough to home. This past weekend, she had been accepted into the university’s honor society fraternity and her parents drove down to take her shopping and out to dinner.
“She was just a super child,” says William Lloyd, Erin’s godfather. “Never ran the streets. Her and her dad, man, you couldn’t separate them. He lost a child from cancer —a daughter, 8 years old. A week later, [Erin] was born.”
The only time Erin and her father, Grafton, parted ways was when the Redskins played the Cowboys. “She was a Redskin,” Lloyd says. “He was a Cowboy.”
Erin would call her family every night. It was a ritual.
“Her mom and dad loved her like crazy,” says Pat Deegan, Erin’s high school basketball coach and a social studies teacher at Westfield High. The Petersons came to every game. “And they didn’t just cheer for their own kid,” he says.
An assistant principal stopped by Deegan’s house after word spread about the shooting. “He said, ‘We haven’t heard from Erin.’ That began a long process.”
At first Grafton Peterson says he was told that Erin, 18, was at Montgomery Regional Hospital. So they went there. When they arrived, they were told she’d been transferred to a hospital in Roanoke. So they went there. In a room, they found somebody else’s daughter alone in a hospital bed. They wondered if that girl had a family looking for her.
They ended up at the Inn at Virginia Tech. The faux manor complex, complete with watchtower clock, is serving as a grief warehouse for the incoming friends and family of the dead.
But Erin wasn’t dead. She was missing.
A student shows up at the Inn. He had been in one of the shot-up classes in Norris Hall—a class he shared with Erin. He told the Petersons he hadn’t seen their daughter today. She skipped that class, he said. There was hope.
But at 2:30 a.m. word spread that the Medical Examiner’s Office in Roanoke had stopped working on the bodies. There were five families—including the Petersons—left waiting at the Inn. The medical examiner may have quit for the night. But the Petersons refused to go up to their complimentary rooms.
“You can’t sit around in a room trying to sleep,” Erin’s aunt told me later that morning. “We don’t know where she’s at.”
Erin’s family squatted in the hallway by the elevators. They laid themselves out on chairs and wrapped themselves in sheets. And they waited.
In the lobby, a grief counselor waited, too. On the coffee table were the assembled totems of instant therapy: donated bags of uneaten potato chips and a box of Kleenex. The trash cans were filled with Salvation Army coffee cups. The counselor had been working since noon, when identifications started coming in.
She says she’d sat with eight or nine families that day, mostly listening. Families brought pictures. But they still weren’t prepared for much of it. Soon after she began counseling one family whose loved one had been identified, a Good Morning America rep buzzed the father’s cell phone. “I can’t believe you’d call a parent,” the father yelled into his cell before hanging up.
The counselor was trying to wait out the medical examiner, too. She had a room and was encouraged to take a nap or at least shower. But she wanted to wait, she says, eyeing a raft of friends and family that had been pacing the first floor all night. They were waiting to hear about Minal Panchal, 26, a graduate student getting her master’s in architecture.
Like Erin, Minal, at that point, was still only missing.
4:40 a.m.
Several of the Minal contingent take over the hotel bar, the Continental Divide. They slouch in chairs and on a sofa next to the big-screen television. Two little girls wander around, hands stuffed in their sleeves.
Every few minutes more friends appear either from the elevator area or through the front doors. It’s a lot of pacing, waiting, and lining up in front of the Inn’s entrance. They speak in library whispers. The lobby is quiet except for Salvation Army volunteers warming by the fireplace and talking strategy about what to do when the morning shift arrives.
A Virginia Tech handler asks me: “Did the person come in [the counselor] was waiting for?”
“I don’t think so.”
You just can’t tell who is coming in with bad news and who just needs to take a leak. A man in a suit shows up and is directed to the elevators. He is somber. I think: Is he the one?
Suddenly a friend of Minal’s appears in the lobby. His cell rings. “You will see a blue sign that says hospital,” he says. “It will be 8, 9 miles from that. You’ll see the downtown exit for Blacksburg.”
The somber man reappears and leaves through the front door.
A grief counselor shows up and asks: “Is everyone comfortable?”
5 a.m.
Eight of Minal’s friends cue up in the lobby and stare out the front door, expectant. Two bundles of USA Today are delivered. The front-page headline: “Blacksburg’s Darkest Day.”
Four minutes later, more newspapers are delivered, followed by what appears to be Minal’s mother, who traveled from New Jersey, according to a friend.
Rajat Singhania is part of the Minal group. He says there are between 30 and 40 members of this group, all have done time at the Inn at various points in the night and early morning. They are given a ballroom to sit and wait. Handlers offer them bananas and bottled water. Earlier that evening, families are given meatballs and fried chicken strips and Kit-Kats.
“She was very easygoing,” Singhania says of Minal. “Just the night before she had organized an impromptu party with her friends.” She and her roommates cooked fish and took pictures of one another.
By 6 a.m., Minal had not been identified.
7:30 a.m.
The Peterson family needs to talk to someone other than the Virginia Tech flaks and the understandably worn-out grief counselors. Grafton, along with Erin’s aunt and a family friend in toe, find a CNN producer in the lobby and start complaining. They had been waiting hours and still no word about their daughter.
Suddenly, flaks surround the Petersons. A clergyman. A Red Cross rep. A grief counselor. They lobby them to shut up.
Mary Peterson, Erin’s aunt, won’t have it. “We’ve been waiting 24 hours,” she complains loudly. “No one tells us anything. I’m tired of watching you all drink coffee.”
The three Petersons walk out, leaving the massacre’s honor guard behind. One state trooper sees me talking to Cecil Terrell, the family friend, and grabs a fistful of my coat. He says I’m not allowed to talk to the family.
Once the trooper sees the Petersons holding court with CNN and the Los Angeles Times, he gives up on me. Grafton then recounts his night: the two hospital visits and all the waiting. Of the medical examiner, he says: “They said they were tired.” Officials told him he would be notified at 7:30. It’s 7:35 and still nothing.
Mary Peterson makes her case, too. Erin, she says, is tall. “She would stand out in a crowd.”
Erin emulated Shaq during her high school basketball days. At Virginia Tech, she was majoring in International Studies. When I ask Grafton why she chose this university, he just freezes. He can’t deal with those questions now. He can’t deal with Erin in the past tense.
The last time Grafton had seen his daughter, the day before her death, she’d teased him, Lloyd recalls. She told her father that she had only 25 more days left of school until she was back home to mess with him. Or at least watch basketball games on TV together like they always did.
9:40 a.m.
The Petersons get the awful news. Erin isn’t missing anymore. Grafton Peterson walks out of the Inn sobbing. A reporter walks up to him, waving her notebook.
“Can’t talk to anybody,” he stammers. “Can’t talk to anybody.”$20 Discount Unlocked

With one hand I grabbed the black bottle of Jack Daniels…
With one hand I grabbed the black bottle of Jack Daniels…
With the other a huge handful of sleeping pills.
I washed the pills down with a swig, swallow, and a shiver.
It would soon be over.
Each tear streaming down my face was a reflection of what a miserable failure I was.
My boss said I was his worst employee and
that I was just taking up space.
My father-in-law said
“You’re a sorry excuse of a man and you sure as hell don’t
deserve my daughter
.
”
And my wife…
She had finally joined the accusers.
She and the kids had moved in with her parents.
And she’d just given me 30 days to get my shit together or else she’d file for
divorce.
I was just ready to end the pain and shame of being THAT guy.
You know - the guy who was always
two month’s behind on his rent payment…
and every other payment.
The guy who had to shop at Goodwill
for his kids’ Christmas presents
The guy who had no hope of ever giving his family a better life.
Even though my entire adult life had been spent in service of everyone else…
I always fell short.
And it’s not like I was a lazy, entitled bum who thought the world owed me.
I worked damn hard, but it just never added up to much.
If you’ve ever felt that you were never “good enough”...
Even though you’ve given your all… sacrificing yourself on the altar of what
others expect of you…
Only to fail at every turn…
Then I know you can relate to the strain I was under - every single day.
A
nd I’d reached my breaking point.
As I laid back on my bed waiting for the end…
I had a sudden vision of my kids at my funeral, bodies racked with sobs wondering why their daddy had left them.
It was a vision from who knows where…
But in that moment, something clicked - I couldn’t give up.
I couldn’t leave them to repeat the same miserable cycle I had lived.
I bolted upright from my bed and ran to the bathroom to puke out the deadly poison.
In so many ways I am eternally grateful to God for that vision.
Because that vision opened the door to a miraculous
30-day turnaround in every single area of my life.
As you’ll see, within 30 days my constant shame had turned to liberating pride.
My scarcity had turned into a crazy windfall of money beyond my wildest
dreams.
Within 30 days, I was able to move my family out of our dingy apartment and
purchase a beautiful new house on a cul-de-sac complete with a huge
backyard.
I became my boss’ favourite employee.
I became my kids’ hero.
And my wife fell back in love with me.
All of this happened in those 30 days because I was approached by a total
stranger
A stranger with a story eerily similar to mine.
I became my kids’ hero.
And my wife fell back in love with me.
All of this happened in those 30 days because I was approached by a total
stranger
A stranger with a story eerily similar to mine.
He handed me a letter in an envelope with a strange symbol on it.
And that letter changed my life.
In just a minute, I’ll tell you how you can read the contents of that letter.
He told me that my circumstances weren’t due to my failures at using the Law
of Attraction…
Or because I didn’t have the right subconscious “mindset” shift or ancient
manifestation trick…
Rather… the cause of my scarcity, strife, and bad luck…
Was because of a strange electromagnetic misalignment within my body.
And I know that may sound a little kooky, but as you’ll see, this discovery is
based on the latest research from the fields of physics and neurobiology.
Even though, as you’ll see in just a minute…
This abundance alignment is actually our birthright.
We’re ALL born with it.
In fact, the electromagnetic field of the heart can be heard and measured in
the womb - far before the brain or head even forms.
The heart not only has its own powerful electromagnetic field…
But it also has its own intelligence.
This powerful clue has long been ignored…
Which never let us decode this growing misalignment between the heart and
mind.
Even though, as you’ll see in just a minute…
This abundance alignment is actually our birthright.
We’re ALL born with it.
But unfortunately, life has a way of forcing us out of this natural, wonderful,
and powerful alignment.
But, what I’ve discovered is a simple switch that re-engages this alignment…
Unleashing unlimited abundance…
Simply and easily.
So that your dreams of lounging by the sparkling pool in the backyard of your
dream home…
Your dreams of walking out of the showroom with the keys to that sexy new
sports car…
Your dreams of never having to fret or worry about money ever again…
All that - can finally become your reality.
This simple switch is literally available to anyone and everyone, regardless of
your education, intelligence, or family background.
The story of my fateful “30 days” is proof positive how you can discover how
to create the alignment that floods your life with abundance…
Starting as soon as today.
So, my name is Charlie Gates.
And the STORY about the ATTEMPT TO TAKE my life…
is unfortunately TRUE.
My desperate act that night had come on the heels of a brutally hard 5 years
for me and my family.
It truly felt like the entire universe was against me.
And it came at the end of the most painful day of my life.
Earlier that day, my boss had chewed me out for my low sales numbers - in
front of everybody.
My boss told me if my numbers didn’t go up drastically,
he would “fire my ass.”
And worse, it felt like he took pleasure in my misery.
I was not only struggling with my numbers…
I truly hated my telemarketing job AND my boss…
And it came at the end of the most painful day of my life.
But it also hit me how much I hated the life I was living.
I was the poster child for #FML.
How did my dreams of success as a young man go so wrong?
Here I was, 42 years old, with a wife and two kids…
And nothing I did to try and improve my life ever seemed to work out.
We had mountains of credit card debt from medical bills we just couldn’t get
ahead of.
I was always robbing Peter to pay Paul.
The pressure felt like I had an elephant sitting on my chest.
If you’ve struggled with always feeling behind the “8 Ball”...
Like you can never seem to catch up - let alone get ahead…
Like every new day brings more bad news…
I can totally relate.
The only thing I had going for me was the love of my wife… and my kids
Or so I thought.
When I got home that night after an agonizing 45-minute commute…
My day got a thousand times worse.
I saw a yellow note posted on my apartment's front door.
The electricity had been shut off.
The bill was two months overdue.
And now, in addition to paying for the two months, I’d have a reconnection fee
and a penalty on top.
I just didn't make enough money at my lousy
telemarketing job to make up the
difference.
As I walked into our chilly apartment, there was an open letter from the
landlord.
We had 30 days to move out or pay the back rent along with this month’s rent.
If we didn't pay up, he was going to court to evict us.
Could it get any worse?
Then, I heard a sob from the bedroom.
Why was my wife crying
I walked into the bedroom and I couldn’t believe my eyes.
My wife was sitting on the bed, her eyes bloodshot from crying so hard.
At her feet… were three packed suitcases.
What the hell was going on?
She looked up at me and said in a tear-filled voice,
“The kids and I are leaving.
We just can't live here in this awful apartment anymore.
Now there’s not even
electricity or heat.
I called my dad. He wants me and the kids to come stay with them.
Look, I know you work hard,
but we just can’t live like this for another minute.
I love you, but it’s time for drastic measures.
I’m giving you 30 days to get a better job…
AND find a new place for us to live.
If you don't do that by then, I'm going to file for divorce.
I just can’t do this anymore.”
Then she walked out.
I hung my head in disbelief and shame.
I couldn’t even blame her.
She’d tried to keep it all together for the last 5 years, but she was right
What woman in her right mind would stay with a loser husband like me?
Any other woman would have left me long ago.
As I watched her drive away I felt powerless and emasculated.
That’s when it hit me like a ton of bricks.
I had completely failed my family.
I was devastated.
I’d never experienced a pain this deep in my life.
I had truly hit rock bottom.
I had 30 days to come up with enough money to pay two month’s rent…
Plus two month’s electricity…
AND find a new place to live…???
Or I’d lose my family???
That was IMPOSSIBLE!
I wasn’t just overwhelmed by the thought… it flat out paralyzed me
It felt like I had to find a way to fly to the moon on a paper airplane.
But thank God, my story doesn’t end there.
Because within that 30 days… a true miracle would transpire.
It was a complete reversal of my fortunes.
From scarcity and poverty - to so much abundance, love, and true belonging.
From being poor to being “rich” - for the first time in my life.
And in just a minute, I’ll share with you exactly how you can use this same
secret to completely change your financial fortunes.
Now I’ve always heard that “money can’t buy happiness.”
And while that may be true…
I’m certain that a lack of money can buy unbearable sadness.
Just like it did for me, AND my family.
And in that moment, I saw no way out…
My life felt so pointless.
My dad had always said that strong men don’t cry…
But all my strength was gone… and so I just laid there and wept at all the pain
and emptiness that filled me.
Which is why I attempted the unthinkable.
After I was dead and gone, all this horrible pain would stop.
But in the middle of my madness and despair… I saw this vision.
Through bloodshot eyes, I saw my young son and daughter with tears on their
cheeks.
They were looking at me inside a velvet lined casket.
They were asking, “Mommy, why did daddy have to die?
How could he leave us
all alone? Mommy, please. I want my daddy back.”
That horrible vision hit me so hard. It’s what woke me up.
If I gave up today, what would happen to my wife and kids?
What if my wife marries a guy who’s abusive to her or the kids?
What if my kids hate me and curse me for taking the coward's way out and
leaving them?
What if I was condemning them to a life of endless pain and scarcity, too?
I suddenly knew I couldn’t give up.
I felt something deep inside me stir.
That’s when I vowed I would do anything to get them back- including
everything my wife had asked for - and more.
But then, another thought popped into my head.
I didn’t just want to survive and “make ends meet.”
I wanted to become filthy rich…
and create an amazing life for my wife and
kids.
They deserved it.
They deserved to have a happy life where they’re provided and cared for.
Think for a moment about the loved ones in your life.
Your partner, maybe your kids, your friends, or even your parents.
Don’t you just love seeing them smile, laugh, and enjoy life?
Free from pain, discomfort, or worry?
Doesn’t it just fill you up to see them happy?
It’s truly one of the most satisfying feelings on earth.
But as I thought of how much my family deserved “the good life”...
Another radical thought came to me.
I DESERVE THIS, TOO.
Sad to say, it was the first time I’d had that thought: that I deserved a good life.
I always thought I had a “normal” childhood.
But now I understand how toxic it truly was.
My parents always told me what a loser I was - how I couldn’t do anything right
- how I’d never amount to anything.
I just grew up believing I deserved the scarcity I’d lived with…
Well, forever.
But in that moment, something shifted inside me.
I finally believed that I deserved a career that was satisfying - and that paid me
well.
I finally believed that I deserved to live the life of my dreams.
If you, too, have struggled with feeling “worthy” of the good life…
If you’ve ever been told you won’t amount to much…
If you’ve ever been told you just weren’t worth it…
That’s no way to live.
It can feel so heavy believing every day that you deserve the lowly life you’re
living.
So in case no one’s ever told you before… hear it now - you ARE worth it.
A thousand times over - you’re worth it.
So many amazing things have happened in my life since that fateful day, but
they didn’t start until I dealt with that limiting belief.
I’m convinced that’s what’s about to happen for you, too.
Feeling more positive about myself and my life ahead, I immediately started
applying for different jobs in person at the local job center and online.
I even placed my application on the indeed.com website.
I really put myself out there, praying I’d get an interview for the kind of job that
could turn it all around.
But after two weeks of my phone not ringing and no requests even for an
interview…
My heart started to sink again.
Another week went by…
And still nothing.
By the middle of the fourth week, most of my hope and positivity was gone.
Even though I continued to apply for job after job…
My heart simply believed it was no use…
Because my phone never rang. And there wasn’t a single request for an
interview.
Before I knew it, I was down to my last day.
I had 24 hours to turn it all around, or everything I lived for… would be gone.
And that’s when something weird happened out of the blue.
Have you ever experienced a random blessing?
Nothing could have prepared me for what happened next.
I went to my favorite coffee shop near my apartment.
I got a coffee with some change I had scrounged up from around the
apartment.
Then walked to the park, found a bench, and started to sip my coffee.
Normally, my favorite coffee made me feel better, but not that day.
Suddenly, a massive wave of despair came over me.
My 30 days were up and my wife was going to divorce me and I’d lose my kids.
Big tears started rolling down my cheeks.
Soon, grief had simply overwhelmed me.
Sobs racked my body as I put my head in my hands.
But then it happened.
I felt a hand touch my shoulder and I jerked my head up.
I saw an older man in his sixties.
He had an expensive sports coat, designer jeans, and expensive Italian shoes
I noticed the sparkle of a shiny new Rolex on his wrist.
He carried himself with such confidence.
He reminded me of Sean Connery in a 007 movie.
He looked me in the eye and asked me a question I'll never forget.
“Is it money, health or love?”
I said, “Excuse me. What did you say?”
He said, “You’re crying. Is it because of lack of money, lost love, or poor
health?”
Maybe you’ve had someone ask you a question that reached down to the very
essence of your soul…
But his question rocked my world.
“I'm going to lose my wife and two kids because I have no money.” I said.
“She gave me 30 days to get a better job and a nice place for us to live, or
she’d divorce me.
And in a couple hours, I’ll be out of time.”
He sat down next to me and got a faraway look in his eyes.
Then he said, “30 years ago, I was in the same position as you are right now.
I was crying my eyes out, planning a way to kill myself.
How do WE do that?
Especially when life seems to conspire against us.
This letter describes a secret “Tao” about how to create wealth, abundance,
and prosperity.
Confused, I asked
“What on earth is a
TAO
?”
He asked me if it ever felt like my heart and my mind were at war with each
other.
Since that felt like my every-day experience, I said, “All the time.”
He went on to explain that “Tao” is a foundational principle of the universe.
It represents order, balance, and most importantly, alignment.
And that a life of abundance simply wasn’t possible when the energies of the
heart and mind aren’t aligned.
He held out the letter and told me that it was given to him by a lady 30 years
ago on a park beach, when he was at the lowest point of his life.
“Because of this letter, everything changed for me…
And I’ve never been the same.
Now it's time for me to pass it on to someone who truly needs it… just like I
did 30 years ago.”
“Wait here and finish your coffee. I’ll be back with the letter in a couple
minutes.”
I watched him walk across the park and into a big apartment highrise.
My whole body was tingling with anticipation…
And if I’m honest, a little doubt.
What if he was a con artist…
Or wanted me to join an MLM…
Or worse, never came back after he got my hopes up?
But before I knew it he was back handing me the letter.
He said, “I assure you… if you do exactly what the letter says, you WILL get
your family back.
You will have no problem creating all the wealth you need to live an abundant,
beautiful life with your wife and family in the home of your dreams.”
Then he turned, climbed into his black Mercedes, and drove away.
I sat there stunned. I felt like I’d either just been conned, or had been given a
mighty gift.
Honestly, I was so skeptical about this old guy waltzing into my life and telling
me some letter was going to change my life.
But he had a presence and power I couldn’t deny.
Plus, what did I have to lose?
I was down to my final hours - and the clock was ticking.
Was I holding the letter that unlocked a life of abundant
wealth and
happiness?
After I caught my breath and my heart rate returned to normal…
I suddenly felt a flash of excitement spiraling upwards through my body.
Strangely similar to how I felt 2 weeks ago… when I felt my life could change.
I took the letter out of the envelope and carefully poured over every word of it.
I then tucked it back into my pocket and ran back to my apartment.
I was excited after reading the letter, I couldn't wait to get started.
I did exactly what the instructions in the letter told me to do.
I’ll tell you how you can get a free transcript of this letter… in just a minute.
But here are the details of what it said.
Now, I know this may sound a little woo-woo, because it did to me at first.
But it’s not. It’s physics.
See, the heart and the mind actually communicate with each other through a
very measurable field of electromagnetic energy…
This electromagnetic field can in fact be measured by magnetometers several feet away from the body.
Scientists have assumed for years that the heart gets its instructions from the
brain.
But the most recent research demonstrates it’s much more complex than that. In fact, the heart’s electrical field is 60 times greater in amplitude than that generated by the brain.
It’s the strongest electromagnetic field produced by the human body…
Which means this energy field influences every single cell in the entire body….
Extending out in all directions into the space around us.
But the letter said this energy field goes beyond the mere physical realm.
And that when properly aligned, this energy field can become spiritual,
mystical - even supernatural.
And that it’s the inner alignment of this energy field that’s the actual
mechanism of abundance.
This alignment, or tao, removes all the roadblocks keeping you in scarcity.
It’s this unbridled current of energy between the heart and the mind that
drastically changes any circumstance for the better.
Now here is the kicker…
What this ultimately means is that it isn’t your “mind” that determines if a
person becomes rich or not…
It’s the alignment of this unique energy field between the heart and
mind
that’s
the determining factor.
And once this energy field is aligned…
This tao of alignment pulls whatever you want towards you.
Think of it like a magnet pulling metal.
Your heart isn’t the magnet.
The mind isn’t the magnet.
It’s the alignment of the energy field between the heart and the mind…
That becomes the magnet.
But here’s the thing…
Aligning this energy field has been a mystery to researchers for decades.
But content from the letter I received provided a piece of the puzzle.
You see… there’s a certain “tool” that aligns this energy field for you.
This tool aligns the energy current that runs between your heart and mind.
This puts you into what the letter called a “pulling” state…
Where the energy field creates its own gravitational
force that pulls what you
want into your life.
The letter said that once the electromagnetic current
of the heart syncs with
the mind…
Abundance flows like a river.
Some experts call this process
“HeartSync”.
And in this letter were the exact steps to take to activate “HeartSync”.
Now, I was extremely skeptical, but I was down to my last day and was going
to lose everything if I didn’t at least try it.
So I followed the steps to HeartSync in the letter.
At first it seemed a bit weird, but suddenly, I felt what I can only describe as a
huge shift in the alignment of my energy.
My problems suddenly felt lighter.
Positivity flooded my body.
I felt a clarity about my life that I’d never had.
And I had the sensation of a huge weight lifting off my shoulders.
The biggest change was that I no longer felt like my heart and my head - were
at odds anymore.
They were in complete alignment - perhaps for the first time.
It’s hard to describe but this alignment felt like it triggered an energetic force
within me.
And I didn’t exactly know how or why… but I felt confident I was going to get
my wife and precious kids back.
Since it was a Monday, the 30th of the month, I was back at work making cold
calls.
My standard quota is to sell 25 copies of an online sales product every month.
And like usual, I was way behind on my quota.
I was at 7 sales for the month. I was pathetically behind.
Which meant I had to sell 18 before the end of the day.
All I can say is what happened next is really bizarre.
I’d been going through my typical routine, making cold calls same as I always
did.
But then I remembered the letter…
And the instructions it contained.
So I paused, closed my eyes…
And started following the HeartSync directions before I made my next call.
Suddenly, I started feeling an energy radiating from within me.
Tension, anxiety, and the constant “war” I felt within me disappeared.
I truly felt like an alignment and focus inside me like I never had.
The Tao - was working.
Peace and confidence flooded my body for the entire call.
I had a very clear vision of what I wanted from the next cold call and that my
energies were aligned with what I wanted.
And so I made my next call.
Right after I finished telling him about the product and what it could do for his
business…
The guy on the phone said, “Sounds great. I’d like 32 copies - one for every
member of my team.”
I sat stunned.
In one phone call, I’d more than covered my quota - and more - for a month.
I ended the month with 39 sales at $305 commission for $11,900.
At the end of the day when we reviewed everyone’s numbers…
My boss and coworkers were blown away.
In an instant, I became “the man” at the office.
My boss looked at me with respect… for the first time in a VERY long time.
And I even saw a new admiration in my coworkers eyes when they
congratulated me.
I felt on top of the world.
I drove to my father-in-law's house and told my wife the good news.
She burst into tears and told me how proud she was of me.
With my commission check from that one day I could pay our back rent…
The electric bill in full…
And move out of our ratty apartment.
But it didn’t stop with that one day.
Over the next 3 months, I kept breaking sales record after sales record.
We paid off all our debts and moved into a big beautiful house on a cul-de-sac
with a ginormous backyard for the kids.
And each day, I kept following the HeartSync instructions.
Soon I’d earned enough money to buy the luxury cars my wife and I had always
wanted.
She got a sexy black BMW SUV…
My dream car? A convertible Porsche.
And I was able to take my family to Hawaii for the very first time.
I can’t tell you how good it felt to watch the sunset on the beach as a family.
We were FINALLY “one of those” families…
The kind that got to enjoy the riches of life and love, and not the breadcrumbs
we had grown accustomed to.
I felt so proud of myself as I watched the orange glow reflect off the water, my
wife in my arms and my two kids so happy they could burst.
One year after that, I quit working as a cold caller.
I started my own company selling software to small businesses.
What happened to me made me realize three things.
The first is that manifesting abundance is damn near impossible without
HeartSync.
The second… is that miracles can happen.
And the third… is that there are strangers who care.
And these three things are at the heart of why I made this video.
The contents of that letter shouldn’t be kept under a lock and key.
Everyone deserves access to the
secrets embedded in the Tao of Rich…
And for their life to be changed for the better… just like mine.
I KNOW there are so many people out there, you may be one of them, so down
on their luck, they just need a way out.
And now, my mission is to pay it forward and give back to the world.
But I knew I needed to work on getting this life-changing information into a
format others could take advantage of as quickly as possible.
One day while I was working on this, I specifically went through the HeartSync
process.
Afterwards, I had lightbulb moment.
It came from all the scientific research I’d been doing on aligning the field of
energy between the heart and mind.
I’d come across some new research from Psychology Today in the field of “sound healing.”
I went on to discover that certain tones and frequencies could accelerate the
alignment of energy.
So I started experimenting with combining very specifically researched tones
and frequencies with the HeartSync instructions in the letter.
After several months of research and development and trial and error…
I discovered a powerful combination that completely aligns your heart energy…
Completing the HeartSync process for you - in just 9 minutes.
Once I made that final connection, I knew I was close.
So what I did was combine the step by step guide from the original letter as a
guided meditation…
Then added most advanced sound frequencies based on the latest scientific
research.
This became an all-in-one guided audio that takes you by the hand and
enables the HeartSync process…
All in a matter of 9 minutes.
And I’m so proud to present to you what I now call
THE TAO OF RICH.…
More wealth, more love, more health and more prosperity becomes
magnetized to this aligned energy field.
All you need to do is turn your focus to what you you want in your life.
Then simply listen to the Tao of Rich guided audio for nine minutes.
Your heart and mind will go through the HeartSync process automatically….
You’ll start pulling new abundance into your life, almost instantaneously.
As you relax and listen
The guided meditation and healing frequencies
will help you remove negative forces that interrupt this current.
Then it will help create positive new forces in your heart’s electromagnetic
field.
One of my employees described it like a magical
rope that appears.
The rope is attached to the goal you have in your mind.
And the current literally pulls it into your life with the speed of thought.
You can use the Tao of Rich to literally pull anything towards you.
Not just money.
You can use it to lose weight… find a loving partner… and cultivate excellent
health, too.
I couldn’t be more excited to invite you to join
the hundreds who have now
transformed their lives by incorporating The Tao of Rich into their daily ritual.
It’s the only personal development program based on HeartSync technology:
Aligning the electrical current between the heart and the mind…
To activate your body’s most powerful energy field.
And it’s truly open and accessible to everyone.
You don’t have to have a crazy high IQ, be a manifestation “expert”, or even
work your fingers to the bone in order for your life to drastically improve
quickly.
It is all within your reach, right now.
And The Tao of Rich program is only available on this website as you’re
hearing this presentation.
But, perhaps only for a limited time
Because… let’s face it.
This approach is so powerful, yet quick and simple to use…
That I’ve made some enemies among the ultra wealthy as well as some
manifestation gurus.
They’re out there working right now to take down this website.
Apparently, it threatens their stronghold on manifesting wealth.
Unfortunately, I can’t guarantee this information will even be available
tomorrow.
And it’s also why I’m encouraging you to take action right now.
Now… The Tao of Rich isn’t a big, long program...
All it takes is 9 minutes with the audio to enter this state of HeartSync.
By taking the instructions in the letter as a guided meditation…
And combining it with the world’s most powerful healing frequencies…
This audio program quickly aligns the electrical current of your heart and mind
to create an energy field that pulls what you want into your life… to you.
You can finally correct the misalignment that’s been holding you back from
living the life of your dreams…
And do it without having to figure out “how to manifest” abundance.
The Tao of Rich audio does all the syncing for you…
Which means ANYONE can experience the transformation I did.
Once you enter HeartSync, your heart and mind’s current takes over from
there.
Soon you’ll see a transformation of wealth flooding into your life.
If you’re like me, you probably listened to a boatload of gurus all telling you
how to manifest abundance.
Only, nothing worked, right?
That’s because none of them understood the importance of aligning the
electromagnetic energy of the heart AND the mind.
They’ll rant and rave about mindset…
They’ll talk about rewiring the subconscious mind…
But if you never address the root of the problem, nothing ever changes.
With The Tao of Rich… find a quiet, relaxing place where you can spend some
uninterrupted time with your headphones.
Then, simply press “play” and that’s all there is to it.
Follow the guided meditation from The Letter and let the audio align your
energy current into HeartSync…
And the rest is history.
Which is why I’m on a mission…
To help as many people as possible discover how to quickly and easily align
the energy currents of their hearts and minds…
And finally start pulling everything they want into their lives.
My mission is to help other regular people just like me…
Leave scarcity in the rearview mirror for good…
By using HeartSync to manifest the life of their dreams.
Earlier today I got some hate mail from some Law of Attraction experts.
They’re threatening me with a take down notice and then a lawsuit if I don’t
comply.
I’m literally doing everything I can to make sure this video stays on the
internet.
Which makes it obvious why you should take action today.
Like I said, I’m on a mission to help as many people as possible discover how
to turn their HeartSync ON.
I hate to think about all the people out there who are suffering unnecessarily…
Despairing that things could ever change.
How many hard-working Americans are out there who are clueless to what’s
actually standing in their way of success?
In my mind, it would be almost criminal to have access to the knowledge in
The Letter…
And keep it to myself.
If I had kept it to myself, I would have never heard from people like
Dallas T.
from Milwaikee, Wisconsin who said:
“I’m a pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps kind of guy. But even with all
my hard work, I could never seem to get ahead. I got so sick and tired of
living paycheck to paycheck working for ‘the man.’
That’s when I heard
about The Tao of Rich. I was skeptical at first, but I gave it a try and am
so glad I did. I ended up quitting my job and starting my own
successful online business.
I was able to take my first real vacation ever
- to The Bahamas!”
And people like
Barbara F. from Tulsa, Oklahoma
, would still be struggling. Here’s what she had to say
“Before The Tao of Rich, I always felt I was carrying the weight of the
world on my shoulders.
My career, my marriage, my kids, and my aging
parents filled my life with constant stress and pressure. I didn’t realize
how much I was “at war” with myself until HeartSync technology
changed all that. I’ve never felt so connected and in control of my own
heart.”
Or then I think about
Phillip P. from Seattle, Washington
who said:
“The lockdown hit my family hard.
My wife lost her job, and my hours
and pay got cut in half. And those stimulus checks were a joke for a
family of 5.
A friend told me about The Tao of Rich program and I tried it
out of desperation. Within 24 hours I had a new job that paid me twice
my old job.”
Then there’s
Francine S. from Hartford, Connecticut
who wrote:
“It’s true money can’t buy happiness or love.
But what price can you put
on financial freedom when you’re used to barely scraping by?
What price
can you put on the freedom to do what you want when you want?
The
HeartSync audio inside The Tao of Rich completely changed my world.”
I can’t tell you how many messages I’ve gotten from everyday people who’ve
used this audio to “pull” thousands of dollars into their lives in a matter of
hours.
Because of how life changing that is, I thought I should price it at $900… if not
more.
But I just couldn’t bring myself to charge that much, especially with the
economy being so topsy turvy.
So, you’re not going to pay $900 for this life-changing program.
In fact, your investment in your new life won’t even be $500…
Which, if you think about the cold hard cash you stand to make…
$500 would be an absolute no-brainer.
And then I thought about how this secret came into my life.
How it was a compassionate stranger who passed on this life-changing
information.
So I decided to price it as low as possible so I can reach as many people who
are in the same boat as I was…
Who have felt the sting of working hard, but never get ahead.
TODAY
, when you choose to invest in
yourself
your investment is
ONLY $37

And if that’s not enough…
I’m going to do something so completely crazy, my business friends tell me
I’ve lost my mind for doing it.
More on that in just a minute
But right now...
I want to address the “pain” of paying money
when you don’t feel like there’s
enough to go around.
Especially when spending money feels like you’re falling behind even more.
Can you see how that’s a simple result of mis-alignment between the heart
and the mind?
And that came when my scarcity was squashing me like a bug.
Parting with that $3.50 for a coffee might as well have been giving away a
million bucks.
But, here’s the thing.
I'm so confident in The Tao of Rich.
It’s already helped thousands align their hearts and minds…
And now they’re experiencing bank accounts bulging…
Now they’re enjoying the rare gift of peace of mind…
True inner joy and purpose.
Not to mention the soul liberating gift of time freedom.
Who doesn’t want to do WHAT they want - WHEN they want.
Which is why I want to make it as simple and easy to get it into your hands…
All while removing the biggest, gnarliest stumbling block most people have:
“WHAT IF IT DOESN’T WORK FOR ME?”
Because of that stumbling block…
I’m going to guarantee your results with a 100% no-questions-asked,
money-back guarantee...
For a full 365 Days.
That’s right - you have a full two months to prove me right.
You get 365 days to get the results YOU want out of The Tao of Rich.
If it doesn’t exceed your expectations, you get 100% of your money back with
no questions asked.
But I’m not stopping there.
I’m adding an additional guarantee to the mix.
I call it the “Sign of the Stranger Guarantee.”
Here’s how it works.
Within 30 hours of saying “yes” to The Tao of Rich…
I guarantee you’ll receive an unusual gift from a Stranger.
And that gift will be the sign that you’re on the right path.
I don’t know what the gift will be.
Maybe it’ll be a letter, or an email, or maybe a word spoken into your life…
Maybe it’ll just be a smile that tells you you’re not alone.
But the gift from a Stranger will make it unmistakably clear that you’re ready to
experience the HeartSync breakthrough - NOW.
That way you can get ready to manifest the life you’ve always wanted.
All you need to do is give the universe 30 hours to manifest this Sign of the
Stranger.
I believe you’re here for a reason.
That your heart is finally ready for true manifestation alignment.
And that the Universe has aligned to open that door for you.
That’s why if you don’t experience this Sign of the Stranger, simply email me
and I’ll promptly refund every penny.
Think about it this way…
I’m promising you results within 30 hours - a sign that YOUR HeartSync
alignment is right around the corner.
And… I'm giving you a full 365 days to experience HeartSync alignment in your
life.
If you're not happy with your results…
Or if you don’t experience The Sign of the Stranger…
Then I’ll promptly return your money.
Now, here’s a confession you won’t hear from all those gurus selling
manifestation programs.
Alignment can’t happen - until you’re truly ready for it.
I wasn’t ready until I was sitting on a park bench drinking my last coffee and
the Stranger showed up with a letter.
And I want you to know that if you’re not ready, that’s OK.
No pressure.
But you might ask, “How will I know if I’m ready?”
Questions like that can feel so overwhelming.
Which is why I’ve decided to remove the risk for you on this…
And take it on myself.
That way, you can take all the time you need…
A full 12 months if need be…
To decide for yourself if you’re truly ready.
So, simply say “yes” to The Tao of Rich right now.
Then, if you haven’t received your Sign of the Stranger in the next 30 hours…
Or, if you haven’t seen powerful results from HeartSync alignment…
Then, you’ve truly risked nothing.
I’ve made it so the only thing you stand to lose… is your life of scarcity and
lack.
Your investment in yourself is 100% protected for the next 12 months.
All you have to do is email me and I'll get your refund processed within 24
hours...
No. Questions. Asked.
So... are you ready to experience HeartSync alignment?
Are you ready to finally stop the war between your heart and your head?
A simple
“YES”
will have you experiencing a revolution in what you pull into
your life
I’m talking about a revolution in wealth…
A revolution in your confidence…
A revolution in the peace and love you experience.
Simply click the button below this video right now…
And you’ll get full access to your Member's Area AND the Platinum app in a
matter of moments.
That way, you can start experiencing HeartSync Alignment immediately.
Right now, it’s decision time.
I’m offering you the opportunity to open the “Letter.”
It contains the secretly guarded path to abundance you’ve been praying for.
A proven, reliable way to align the current between your heart and your mind…
So you can pull everything you want into your life.
The Tao of Rich doesn’t just make it possible
It makes your success
inevitable.
I can’t imagine where I’d be right now if I’d scorned the gift of the stranger.
I’m not even sure I’d be here right now.
You might say, “I’m not into taking steps of faith.”
I get that.
In fact, I used to say that all the time.
But it wasn’t until I was so desperate that I almost lost my family, not to
mention my life…
That I realized I had nothing to lose.
And in this moment, you truly have nothing to lose either.
When you say “yes” right now…
I’m turning your “step of faith” into a step of CONFIDENCE.
That’s because you WILL see the Sign of the Stranger within the next 30 hours.
And you WILL see abundance pouring into your life Guaranteed.
If the Tao of Rich isn’t everything I’ve said it is…
Then you’ve risked nothing.
It’s actually NOT taking action today that’s the bigger step of faith - and the
biggest risk.
Because if you don’t take action today on The Tao of Rich…
And just hope your life will get better…
Then you’ll never experience HeartSync alignment…
And you’ll continue to be at war within yourself…
Which means that manifesting abundance remains near impossible.
But clicking the button below…
Represents a step of “CONFIDENCE” - not even a step of faith.
Your new alignment with abundance is as simple as enabling HeartSync by
saying “YES” to The Tao of RIch.
Right now, align your heart to the fact that there’s zero risk to you…
Align your heart to the confidence of knowing you’re covered by an
unconditional money-back guarantee for a full 365 days…
Align your heart with the truth that it’s never been simpler or easier to manifest
the life of your dreams.
Now… for just a minute...
I want you to think back to some of the difficult challenges you’ve faced in
your life.
Think about how the challenges might have made you feel like everything was
against you…
But how it also made you a better person for having lived through it.
Remembering back to those times helps you regain more of your personal
power… because you’re aligning your energy.
But if you’re always struggling with the question “Why do bad things happen to
good people?”
Well, it can only end up in a dead end of misaligned energy.
Negative thoughts and past failures don’t have to run your life on autopilot and
ruin the rest of your life.
Staying stuck in misalignment and negative feelings only gives more power to
negativity… which can only create more negative events in your life.
What you believe you deserve… is what you end up getting.
Right now, you can fix this misalignment by getting your hands on what you
truly deserve:
A simple yet proven way to manifest abundance in your life.
Are you ready for a new reality bursting with abundance?
Are you ready to finally end the head - heart war inside you?
Then say yes to The
TOA OF RICH
right now…
And put your old life of scarcity and anxiety in the rearview mirror - for good.
If that's your heart’s desire...
There's really no other decision that makes sense...
Than to to say yes to The Tao of Rich.
You’ll find yourself powerfully aligned with the abundance of the universe.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
If you’re still around, you may have a few questions...
Let me cover a few of the most common ones that come up.
What if I’ve gone through other manifestation trainings, but they didn’t
work for me? How is this different?
Most manifestation trainings are based on wishful thinking - not on science.
And none of them even know how to leverage the power of the field of energy
between your heart and mind.
This is what the The Tao of Rich does for you.
The majority of personal development programs focus on trying to get you to
change your mindset or reprogram your subconscious mind…
While completely ignoring that your heart and mind are completely out of
alignment.
The Tao of Rich addresses this misalignment - in a matter of minutes. There’s
no “three week” program to try and figure out.
The Tao of Rich is the only manifestation approach that uses HeartSync
technology to quickly align the most powerful and important energy field in
your body.
So for the first time in your entire life...
It’s not only POSSIBLE to manifest abundance, but it’s simple and easy
How is my personal information protected?
We utilize a 256 bit encryption with Secure Sockets Layer Technology (SSL).
It’s military-grade, meaning your personal information could not be safer.
How does the guarantee work?
I want you to know that your decision to invest in yourself today is
completely risk-free. Which is why I’m giving you an entire year to decide if it’s
right for you! If at any point during that 365 day period, you decide it’s not for
you, simply email us and we’ll refund every single penny. No questions asked.
I wanted to make sure you have the time you need to make sure it’s right for
you.
Your satisfaction is 100% guaranteed!
How soon should I expect results?
Since every person’s energy field and background are so unique, the results
can vary. Some have seen powerful results right away. Others experience what
I describe as a slow and steady climb.
But here’s the deal. The results are cumulative. They build on each other.
That’s why it’s important to establish this as part of your daily routine. The
more consistent you are, the more results you’ll see.
Plus, you have an entire year to try it out!
Will this really impact every area of my life?
YES! If you can imagine and focus on an outcome, then there’s no part of
your life that won’t improve. Plus, The Tao of Rich audio guides you step by
step into living the life of your dreams.

Special event:
Conversation between Billy Apple and Hans Ulrich Obrist. Friday 5 October, 10am. RSVP essential: amy@mayorgallery.com
The third solo exhibition by Billy Apple at The Mayor Gallery, following on from the 2010 and 2013 exhibitions; Billy Apple®: British and American Works 1960 – 1969 and Billy Apple®: New York 1970 – 75.
Added to list

His jaunty pop art painted bronzes, offset photo-lithography, xerography and neon works, which challenged the prevailing ideas and material traditions of 1960s fine arts, were reintroduced to London; the next exhibition documented his shift to a thoroughly de-materialized art practice presented variously in a series of aesthetically cleansing art-life and site-specific subtractions and eliminations.
In Billy Apple®: The Artist Has to Live like Everybody Else 1961 – 2018 his practice moves forward to focus on Art Transactions, a new series begun in the early 1980s that reveals Apple’s art-life tactics for everyday living and more broadly examines the means by which art circulates and the network of relationships between collector, dealer and artist. This series has its roots in the small canvas For Sale, 1961 now in the National Galleries of Scotland collection – the signifier which signals Apple’s nascent interest in the implications of brand identity and the commodification of art.
In 1984 Billy Apple showed Leo Castelli a new text-based work, a Promissory Note headed up with I.O.U., next line AMOUNT then ON DEMAND, finishing up with space for a date and signature. Castelli labeled Apple’s work as “pop-conceptual”, arguably the first use of the term, but replied “Billy! We don’t borrow money.” Apple went on to develop his Promissory Notes scaled using the A-paper system which is in effect Apple’s private currency that stands outside the rules and regulations of governmental and banking controls. The term ‘on demand’ moves the works from being a simple I.O.U. to a non-taxable form of financial currency. In contrast to the discounted (because of the effects of inflation) face-value sale of a promissory note, Apple’s I.O.U.s rise in value in accordance with the perceived worth of his art.
The exhibition also includes un-transacted Barters, another series that is a form of aesthetic currency which shortcuts the usual steps in our everyday economy. The artist negotiates or barters with collectors who become invested in the maintenance of his art, life and well-being. For individualised Barters, Apple arranges for the exchange of goods like honey, coffee, café lunches or services with professionals for haircuts, cardiac stents, optometry, hernia repair and hip replacements. Zoë Grey, then curator at the Witte de With, Rotterdam in 2009 wrote, ‘I.O.U. and Bartered are – as the artist puts it – ‘propositions in waiting’, whose exchange value and destination are yet to be decided. They were made…at the boom of the (1980s) art market…In the face of the recent and ongoing economic crisis, these works have a new relevance, but perhaps their original bravado is now replaced by something closer to anxiety.’
The on-going series, PAID: The Artist has to Live like Everybody Else developed from a 1984 project based on the breakdown of cost-of-living statistics which answered the question – How much money does the artist need to live for a year? Invoices from Apple’s daily life are chosen by collectors, paid for and mounted on Apple’s PAID document. Collectively, they profile the life of the artist in the form of a paper portrait of invoices.
In 2015, curator and Apple biographer, Christina Barton, wrote ‘his Art Transactions carry over the graphic identity that had evolved in the printed matter that accompanied his site-based alterations and subtractions. Now, rather than ancillary announcements or documentation, text and work merge with a cool authority that bears little resemblance to the ‘wild’ paintings that were capturing the attention of the art world. Apple tackles head on the various ways in which works of art can function as a form of currency. But his real subject is the extent to which we are willing to believe in the idea of art’s intrinsic value. By so clearly extending an invitation to his audience to engage in an exchange, Apple’s transactions exist as documents of a mutual trust; they remind us of our shared investment in art’s deeper worth.’
Basic Needs, 2014 is part inventory, part signifier sourced from the United Nations list of basic human needs. It was initially produced for e-flux’s global benefit art auction curated by Hito Steyerl and Anton Vidokle for displaced Kobanê refugees and via them then director of Artspace, Auckand, Misal Adnan Yildiz invited Apple to contribute. Basic Needs has since been translated into five languages in 2018 for Mutterzunge: Seeing and Hearing curated by Yildiz for Apartment Project, Berlin.
After graduating as one of the pop generation from the Royal College of Art, London in 1962, Apple moved across the Atlantic to New York and was curated into the groundbreaking American Supermarket, (Bianchini Gallery, 1964) then opened APPLE at 161 West 23rd Street, NYC, in 1969 the second of the seven not-for-profit spaces that established New York’s Conceptual Art movement. His contributions to the history of pop and conceptual art has been recognised internationally, with a major retrospective at the Auckland Art Gallery curated by Christina Barton; a two-part survey at Rotterdam’s esteemed Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art in 2009, his inclusion in International Pop, the 2013 Walker Art Center’s major survey of pop art and Queens Museum’s 1999 Global Conceptualism: Points of Origin 1950s-1980s. His works are to be found in major collections including Tate Britain, the Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, the National Galleries of Scotland and Te Papa Tongarewa Museum of New Zealand. He continues to exhibit regularly around the world, his most recent exhibition is Billy Apple®: Six Decades 1962 – 2018 curated by Christina Barton for Rossi & Rossi Hong Kong.
The exhibition is accompanied by a fully-illustrated publication that includes an essay by critic and journalist Anthony Byrt. Byrt is a regular contributor to Artforum International and New Zealand’s Metro Magazine. His first book This Model World: Travels to the Edge of Contemporary Art (2016) was a finalist in New Zealand’s premier book awards in 2017. He is currently working on a book about Apple’s time at London’s Royal College of Art, and the connections between Apple, David Hockney, Frank Bowling, Larry Rivers, and Apple’s lover at the time – the novelist Ann Quin.

Strategy & Planning
We start by strategizing with you to fully understand the goals of the event – learning the details, understanding the priorities, and defining what will make the event a success in your eyes. Throughout the planning process, we will always make thoughtful and purposeful decisions and put your goals and the guest experience first. Together, we will build a virtual experience that is memorable, easy to navigate, and engaging.
Virtual Build Out
Virtual platforms are the venues of today. They are powerful tools that can turn your online event into a true virtual experience. Our team is skilled at identifying the platform with the optimal set of tools to achieve your event goals and using those tools to their fullest. Once a platform is selected, we will carefully craft an environment to fit your needs. There are many design and functionality choices that go into each custom event.
Platform Selection
We have learned these platforms inside and out so that you don’t have to! Based on your event goals, we work with you to select the best virtual platform to meet your needs. Starting with an in-depth meeting to discuss your agenda, the different functionalities you are looking for, what you want the interface to look like, and so on, we will take you through a comprehensive list of options and help you select the platform that makes the most sense for you.
Platform Functionality
When starting to look at the different virtual event platforms, it may seem a bit overwhelming. There are so many options out there, and it seems they all do very similar things. However, that is actually not the case! Each platform has different capabilities, and the platform you select will be dictated by the functionality you require. For example, if networking is extremely important to you, we might steer you towards a different platform than if a virtual lobby is most important! See below for a list of some of the different features offered.
Enhanced Presentation Environments
We have all become accustomed to seeing speakers in their home office or kitchen, but perhaps for some of your larger sessions, you really want to enhance the experience by having speakers present from a true “stage.” This can be done no matter what platform you select.
Knowing your audience is still critical for virtual events. Corinthian Events can design, implement and manage your digital registration solution. Registration can either be built on the platform you are using for the event, or we can build a separate registration site based on the functionality you need. Whether you require a complex registration with multi-track session selections or basic data collection, our in-house technology and graphic design team has you covered. We can fully brand the registration page to align with the event branding, ensuring the same look and feel is carried through from start to finish.
Digital Registration
& Technology
Speaker Management
Now more than ever, Speaker Management is absolutely crucial when planning a virtual event. This arena is new for everyone, and Corinthian Events will ensure every speaker has all of the details and technology they need to feel completely comfortable presenting in this new fashion.
When hosting a virtual event, it goes a long way for the attendee when you can find a way to break through the screen and engage with your audience. One way to do this is to focus on activating their five senses. By elevating the five senses, attendees will feel more as if they were at the meeting in person versus at home. There are many different approaches to elevating the five senses – the full experience can be customized as well to fit the theme of your event!Bill Gates Donates $15 Million to Campaign Pushing GMOs on Small Farmers Around the World

In an Oct. 6 blog post, The Real Housewives of Orange County alum wrote in detail about the journey she's gone through with the child's health since he was born.
"All the doctors and therapists told me I was just being an overly cautious mother. I thought I was losing my mind, but I insisted upon an MRI," she wrote. "That MRI confirmed a diagnosis of Periventricular Leukomalacia or PVL which is brain death caused by lack of oxygen. This is often a precursor diagnosis to Cerebral Palsy."
Hart is one of the three children the former RHOC cast member has with estranged husband Jim Edmonds.
Meghan also added that she spoke to doctors in Chile, Panama and Egypt, spending "6 weeks in Los Angeles with Hart doing intensive therapy," and another "4 weeks in New Orleans going into an oxygen chamber with him every day."
"I wanted to tell you all of this before I tell you this: yesterday Hart was diagnosed with Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy," the mother of three revealed. "I was expecting this diagnosis. Even though he's the same kid I expected it to hit me hard. But it didn't. It didn't hit me hard at all. In fact I felt relieved."
Meghan also wrote about how important it was for her to push for Hart's additional treatment.
She added, "If I hadn't advocated for Hart he would've lost 16 months of therapy until he got his CP diagnosis." The "therapy mom" also wrote that "Hart is doing great" and purposely wanted to explain his journey to show readers "how far he's come."
The reality star informed her fans in a July 2019 blog post that Hart had "irreversible brain damage" at 13 months old.
"From the minute he was born I knew something was different with Hart," she wrote. "The nurses struggled to straighten his legs to measure his length. He suckled hard, shallow, and often until I bled and he spit up black."
According to a representative for Jim, "Jim is unaware of any such diagnosis and, if it is even true, it is completely unconscionable and absolutely disgraceful that Meghan would announce this on social media without discussing it with him first."
In response, Meghan tells E! News, "Jim's statements are untrue and I refuse to address them further."Find Saatva Mattress Store Nyc … In order to choose the best one, it is necessary to comprehend the advantages of the numerous mattress types and their particular usages.

Transcript:
Per: Hello and welcome to episode 48 of UX Podcast. You’re listening to me, Per Axbom.
James: And me James Royal-Lawson.
Per: And we’re doing this episode over Skype.
James: Yeah.
Per: This morning my bike, my motorbike wouldn’t start and I thought, “OK. I will just take the car,” and the garage door wouldn’t open. The tag – there was something wrong with the tag. So it has just been a crazy morning.
James: I know. For me as well because we’re doing this about 40 minutes later than we booked or planned.
Per: Yeah.
James: And I was just about – I’ve got guests here so I can’t do – I can’t record it from a normal office, in the office.
Per: Yeah.
James: I was just about to go down and set everything up and I heard my neighbour talking to me, calling me. OK. It’s very unusual that the neighbour starts talking to me at 9 o’clock in the morning because we’re all so busy. We’re doing our morning routines and things.
Per: Yeah.
James: What he had done was he had waved – he tried to kind of wave a wasp away when he was getting into his car and he kind of did that with his hands that he had his house keys in. He managed to fling his house keys.
Per: No way.
James: Into my garden just after he has locked the car or before he got into his car – he locked his house but he now went to his car. So he had to come around and me and him, we’re going through my meadow of dandelions that’s outside of the house searching for his keys. So that delayed me by about 10 minutes as well. We found them.
Per: OK. Cool, good.
James: Bizarre morning though …
Per: Very weird morning.
James: Yeah.
Per: Let’s look back – before we start, we were talking about intranet today. But let’s look back at the event episodes we did for UX Lx. We got some feedback.
James: Yeah, we did a few episodes.
Per: And we got some feedback partly about the intro because we do a lot of episodes – I don’t know. How many did we do? Six or seven?
James: Seven because we did a pre-episode as well.
Per: Right. And you have to listen to the intro every time you listen and we do two a day and you have to listen to the intro over and over again and the feedback we got was that maybe we could shorten it.
James: Yeah, it’s about one minute, fifteen?
Per: Yeah, and we realized that probably is pretty long for any episode.
James: Probably, yeah. So we’re – I’ve chatted to Dan Pugh, or Dan Lo-Fi. He’s the guy who composed and created the theme tune for us. I’ve chatted with him and he says he’s going to do a 45-second version.
Per: Excellent.
James: Which I think is a good compromise.
Per: Yes.
James: We’re going to try. We’re going to iterate you see. We’re going to iterate and try.
Per: Yeah.
James: Yeah. But if you got any more feedback because I – we both like to know what you think of the event format. When we go to these events and do seven episodes, quick succession from the actual – than itself, do you like it? Is it good? Is it interesting? Is there another way maybe you would like us to do that kind of reporting from events? Would you like us to do more events? Would you like us to stop going to events?
Per: Are you organizing an event and want us to be there? Then give us a call.
James: Like it.
Per: Yeah.
James: Yeah. And we will happily come there and cover your event for you.
Per: Yeah.
James: So feedback is good.
Per: It is.
James: It allows us to iterate and improve.
Per: OK. Onwards to today’s topic.
James: Yeah, we’re interested to let everyone know it’s the 30th of May today. We’re very nearly at the end of May which means here in Sweden we’re rapidly approaching – well we’re in the crazy bit before the summer shutdown.
Per: It is. I realize today it’s eight days of school left for my kids, eight school days.
James: I’ve got more than that for mine. Yeah. Lucky me. But I’ve got …
Per: You would think but next week is two days off.
James: Yeah, and both of my kids have their birthdays before school finishes.
Per: Ah! Excellent! You have to organize all these parties.
James: Yeah, after you.
Per: Yeah. Oh my god. My birthday is coming up as well.
James: It is. I only know that because you share your birthday with my son.
Per: Exactly.
James: Yeah. In case people think I’m kind of super memory man and can remember everyone’s birthdays. I can remember two birthdays, maybe three if I include my wife. Anyhow, yeah. Last week, if it wasn’t enough, we’re going to Portugal for UX Lx. I went down to – I went across to Gothenburg for a conference called Intranätverk. How do you translate that Per?
Per: I guess you would – because it doesn’t use the A with the two dots over it so it’s …
James: It does in real. On the hash tag and things, he doesn’t.
Per: OK.
James: And by he …
Per: So it’s a word play. It either means intranet work or intranet pain.
James: Verk.. because we’re kind of like …
Per: Hey.
James: No, I’m thinking more of the industrial metal works. It’s like the …
James: So the intranet works as in the place, the factory where you sort out the internet. You smelt things. You make things, the birthplace of industrial products, that kind of thing. When we say he, we mean Kristian Norling who is the organizer of this conference.
Per: Right.
James: Both Per and I know.
Per: And I hear he did a really good job. I’ve heard a lot of people were really pleased with the conference.
James: It was a really good conference. It was really well-organized. I’m not going to talk too much about the performer itself of the conference but he split it up into two days, three actually because there was a workshop day. The first day was Swedish, Swedish speakers, the whole day of Swedish theme. Then the second day, introduction speakers or rather a mix of Swedish and English but everyone spoke English.
Per: Right.
James: Which mainly caused a Twitter flow on the second day. It was different because it pulled in interest from the internet community at large.
Per: Right. I really like that way of setting it up because in other events, I’ve seen where English speakers and Swedish speakers are mixed up and then you – well, it’s unfair to the English speakers because they don’t really get what the other people are talking about.
James: No.
Per: And also you attract a lot more international – oh, the international crowd really for attending a full day in Sweden. It’s just really cool.
James: Yeah, you get a lot more attraction on the internet. Well on Twitter and other channels, people …
[Crosstalk]
James: … easier to follow when you’ve got it all in one language for that day. So that’s why I went on to the English day and took a train really early in the morning to Gothenburg.
Per: Yeah. You were just there over the day.
James: I was. I actually missed my train.
Per: No way.
James: Yeah.
Per: You just told me.
James: No, because I’ve been using the Smart Alarm on my UP to wake me up. I know you have too and I really like it. But it just didn’t work. I set kind of one day, alarm just for that one day and I stupidly – because I had to be up for such a specific thing. I should have just sawed the UP and – oh, language. I should have just kind of used the proper alarm, a real alarm for that morning. So I had to rebook last minute.
Per: So the UP we’re talking about is the Jawbone UP armband that we both are using now to record steps and sleep as well.
James: Yeah.
Per: And as alarms then.
James: Yeah, as alarms. We do it – we’re probably going to do a show about that at some point, about quantified self. But anyway, I missed the train and I had to rebook. But I got there. I missed most – I missed all of Sharon O’Dea’s talk about the mobile digital workplace. But I got quite a good chance to talk to her and chat to her. I was reading all the tweets in the train so I got a good feeling with that. But what was really interesting because I’ve been to a few internet conferences and I’ve worked quite a lot over the years with intranet.
Per: I think the last time I talked at an intranet conference was like two or three years ago.
James: No way.
Per: So for me it has been a long time since I’ve actually been in that area and talking about it and really diving into it.
James: Yeah.
Per: I was looking through the slides because I wasn’t there. I was just looking through the slides yesterday. Kristian has been really good about putting them out and he’s putting out some videos of the talks as well.
James: They’re already out. Yeah, he has released them, I think.
Per: Yeah. And I realized that oh my god, nothing has changed. Same old problems. Who’s the owner of the intranet? Yeah, it’s the information department. They only care about shooting out information. They’re not communicating. People have a hard time finding things. They’re swearing over it, stuff like that.
James: Yeah.
Per: And I see all these examples that I’ve been seeing for so many years and I realize, “Well, why is nothing happening?”
James: I think it was a big difference with the Swedish and English there. You’re right. An awful lot of people, it’s still the same old story of intranet and I think a good way of describing this is that you’ve got – if you look at the internet, although the world of web and things we do with web browsers, we’ve got – on one end of the scale, we’ve got ecommerce and the ecommerce side of things, they’re the ones pushing the boundaries. They’re the ones that are doing all the research. They’re doing real – or the products and ecommerce side of things. They’re doing the research and looking at what’s happening. They’re testing. They’re iterating. They’re tweaking and they’re making money.
Then you’ve got the non-transactional services and sites where it all gets a bit more fussy about why we’re doing stuff and a bit more loose about whether we need to do certain things and we don’t test as much. You don’t research as much and have lower budgets and everything.
So they’re in the scale. We’ve got intranet for the poor younger brother and everything. They have least resources, least money. They do least research. They do least of everything and been stuck for several years behind everything else.
That gives you a feeling of what it’s like to work with intranet in many situations. It’s knowing there is a balance.
Per: They’re behind and there’s no incentive really. There’s no monetary incentive which is why they’re left behind of course.
James: Yeah, exactly. It’s like a non-transactional site on the internet. You’ve now got the direct monetary aspect of ecommerce. The joy there is that you see people put things in the baskets and check out and you see the cash coming in. With intranet it’s all derivatives. It’s all – you enable something to happen and become profitable or do their job.
Per: Yeah, people aren’t really measuring the outcomes of intranets.
James: No.
Per: They may be asking how happy they are with it and people may be, “Yeah. OK.” And that’s fine. That’s a fine answer for a lot of people but I mean it has so much potential to be so much more as a tool in people’s everyday work.
James: Yeah. I mean just looking whether people are finding a webpage or getting to a webpage on the internet. That doesn’t really tell you whether it has all been successful. This is the same theme the last – what has happened in the last year or so, year or two in the world of intranet. We’ve had a birth or talk now of the thing called the digital workplace. It kind of started the same time as we started talking about mobile and how do we deal with mobile for intranet. This is also a digital workplace. The bigger world outside of just your desk computer, integrating all services inside the company into one platform you could call it. You could call it the digital workplace.
Per: Right.
James: Because inside companies there are always multitude of systems. You’ve got time report systems. You’ve got room booking systems. You might have ordering systems, the stock systems, accounting systems, procurement systems, payroll and HR systems depending on what you’re working with. You might have a special system for the client information, customer service. I mean the list of types of systems is almost endless and all of these just sat in silos internally. So the digital workplace talks about how you can work with these as a whole and improve the user experience or the employee experience.
That you could say leads me into what was my biggest take-home from Intranätverk. People were talking about user-centred design. People were talking about listening to users.
Per: Oh my god, listening to users.
James: People were talking about research and researching thoroughly before embarking on an intranet project.
Per: So actually finding out what people would find it useful to have on the intranet.
James: What they need to do their jobs.
Per: That’s really wow.
James: But I mean I know. You’re mocking it a little bit now Per. And I’m actually joining in with you a little bit in mocking that but any of us otherwise who have intranet know how much of a revolution it must be now for this to start happening.
People are talking about conferences and talking about this and actually doing this in some situations. Stora Enso and IKEA were two of the people – two of the companies that did presentations. They’re doing this. They’ve learned and realized that it’s not just about building intranet page for your departments and pushing out the information that you think might be useful for everyone.
It’s about enabling people to do their jobs and they say also includes the social intranet side of stuff and allowing people to communicate, share ideas and so on because it helps people to be productive. It helps people do their jobs. A wonderful eye-opener and we’re quite excited that they’re getting there. I just hope that more companies will realize the value of this and allocate the correct amount of resources to this kind of work because I mean there was a – I had a Twitter conversation with Jonas Söderström, Jonas Blind Hen, who we interviewed just before Christmas …
[Crosstalk]
James: … a lot of music in the background and he said – well, even though that now organizations know in principle that UX is important, what are the excuses? Why don’t they do it? Is it just not enough time now? So I replied. Well, I think it seems expensive and we have the same story with UX on the other side, on the internet side. It’s considered often expensive and time-consuming. It costs time and money.
Per: Right, and this is hard to measure.
James: Yeah, and it’s far, far too easy to plough on without doing it.
Per: And you’re not setting goals. You’re not setting goals for the intranet. You’re not setting …
James: Well, you are but sometimes …
[Crosstalk]
Per: Yeah? What are the goals?
James: Sometimes it’s – I mean there might be things that you can find information easier or I’ve even had intranet goals where I used to – these things like to reduce the number of documents.
Per: Yeah, or something like you said before, like share information.
James: Yeah.
Per: But sharing information is not for everyone.
James: No.
Per: There are different people, different cultures within companies and I’m going to think …
James: Jobs.
Per: Yeah. And of course that’s where the UX comes in, that you have to really find out what are people doing everyday and what tools do they really need. But I find that people are rushing into the social intranet, sharing information, all that stuff, making it sound really cool. But it doesn’t always have to be. Intranet can be boring but still very useful as long as you can find information you really need when you start working with the stuff you work with.
James: Yeah, I mean it’s about being honest. All these projects we do whether it’s intranet or internet, a lot of them kind of – key things are down be honest to yourself and be honest to the project. What are people really doing? What do they really want? What does the organization really want? Can we honestly make this mesh together in a way that works?
I don’t think this is – this is like what you’ve said there about traditional intranet. There’s an awful lot of blah, blah, blah, putting your hands over your ears and not listening and ignoring and even if you do do some of the research. I mean Sharon O’Dea said about you could do – you do some research, maybe a workshop or something like this and then ignore it and write what you think and just say you did some research. That’s the kind of thing that does happen in many projects I think as well as intranet projects. You kind of listen and then ignore it and plough on doing what you wanted to, pretending you’ve done some research.
Per: Yeah, that happens a lot.
James: So yeah, but I think another issue, not only is often the case that intranet projects are considered to be technical projects. This is in part because of the much – when you get into enterprise organization, they’re the bigger organizations, the availability or the choice of system, because everyone wants a system and when looking at the pure internet side of things, then the choices or platforms are very limited.
Nowadays I think it’s like seven out of ten of large organizations are running SharePoint or it may be higher than that. It’s probably even eight out of ten. It’s a ridiculously high number of organizations, large organizations that are running SharePoint in some form. That’s almost always a thing that comes out in the IT department and it’s very rarely done with users’ needs in mind. It’s done with IT needs in mind and pushed out and there’s no choice because maybe the rest of their whole architecture is Microsoft-based so they put SharePoint in there too or they see that everyone else is running their intranet on SharePoint so that must be the thing you should do now.
Per: So what happens then is that people find workaround. They find workaround in the way that they use Messenger or stuff like that, just email.
James: That’s a really good point, Per. Another conversation I had was about Dropbox and just thinking about like well, SharePoint, it’s an awful product when it comes to usability. They clearly have made lots of improvements for this version 2013 and they have I think made something like over 100 user interface changes and improvements. But for any person who has been using the previous versions and gets upgraded, that’s an awful lot of learning.
Per: Yeah.
James: I don’t know. My wife has SharePoint at work and she can swear sometimes. When she’s using SharePoint, the worst of her language comes out, I can tell you. She hates it and I know very few people – do you know anyone who loves SharePoint?
Per: I’m thinking really hard because we had SharePoint at Xcelent before as well. We were really trying hard to make something out of it and we couldn’t and there were lots of smart people working there. We were trying to integrate it with the Yammer. We couldn’t even do that.
James: That’s easy now because they actually bough Yammer.
Per: Oh, yeah, exactly. Right now that should be.
James: Well, it’s getting easier. It’s getting easier but it’s still a parallel product. If you ask normal workers who have to use SharePoint, it is very, very few. I think it’s a dream product.
Per: OK. And then you ask …
[Crosstalk]
Per: … if SharePoint is useful. A lot of people get their work done and they don’t really care that people are swearing over it because they’re getting the work done. But they’re not reflecting over how much better work they could do if they were smiling all day long.
James: You will also get things like – going back to what we said about workarounds. People are like water. They will find the way out. They will find the ways to do stuff and one of the conversations we had was about how people are taking the documents that are officially stored in SharePoint because that’s where they have to be but to make them accessible by their mobiles and other laptops and things. They’re putting them in Dropbox.
Per: Right.
James: And they’re finding ways to get them to Dropbox and it doesn’t matter what your IT department does. It doesn’t matter how much they block it. There are always ways to get these …
Per: Yeah, I worked as a consultant at a big company, no names here, where they introduced a new document management system. I mean they put millions and millions and millions of money into this. Insane. And it was just too slow to work with. So what happened was people came to meetings with USB sticks and they were walking around giving each other USB sticks because that was the best way to share information.
James: Or you email the document to another email account.
Per: Right.
James: Yeah, everyone does all this and it’s what I’m saying about being honest. I mean you’ve got IT and security and compliance and everything and you’ve got these big vendors like SharePoint or so on and what it boils down to, they’re not really doing so for the users.
Per: And there are so many stories like this and it all comes really down to ethnography. I mean if you could just work – be around a workplace like that for a couple of days or a week or so, you would know what the problems are and how people actually do work and you have so much information about what type of intranet you really should be doing.
James: And that’s exactly what Stora Enso and IKEA and some of the other speakers on the second day of the Intranätverk said. Listen to users because you get so much good info and good ideas and you know what they want.
Per: Yeah. And again, a word of advice there as well. I mean it’s not always all about listening to what they’re saying but listening to what they’re meaning.
James: Exactly. It’s talking to them and then recording and interpreting what they’re saying.
Per: OK.
James: And balancing this with business needs because you still got to find the balance there. But no, fantastic that we’re making this kind of progress now. I just hope this – we get a bit more diversity as far as products go for intranet or people don’t get just lost in SharePoint. We’re seeing people are integrating with different products now or using SharePoint for one function and then bringing another product in for maybe social side and oh, there’s one – I’ve got one thing I’ll see if I can dig it out…
One excellent thing that IKEA, they talked about guerrilla research because it’s fantastic. See if I can find what I wrote here about this. I can’t find it quick enough. Now, guerrilla research, what IKEA did, they sent out – well, someone with a camera to a few different IKEA locations around the world. I think there was one in China, one in Sweden. There was one somewhere else and they asked them. Oh, what’s your dream digital workplace? What do you want from a digital workplace? They ask normal workers.
Per: Yeah.
James: And they were doing this …
Per: I’m sort of getting goose bumps here. I’m realizing that if there’s anything you listeners should be doing or both of us as well, if there’s anything we should be doing in our projects, it’s to go out and talking to people and using the camera and showing that around. It’s the best way to communicate.
James: Go and look at the IKEA talk from Intranätverk. I will put the link up to it because Kristian has published it and if you just watch one bit of it, skip to the bit where they show the film. So what they did is they edited all these little clips from when they asked these questions to normal people and put it into – I said normal people, just workers. They put it into a three-minute video as part of the pre-project work and buy-in process for the project.
This three-minute video is excellent. It tells you like it is. Now people say things like, “Oh, well I just want to be able to write an update and do it.” They say this simply as they want it to be. But they don’t say, “I want SharePoint. I want to be able to do massive technical specifications of everything.” They just say things really simply and straightforward and that’s how they – oh, this is my job. This is what I want to do and I think it should be like that.
I was just sat there watching that. Thinking, oh wonderful. User research, going out to talk to people, filming it, sharing it with us to help plan the project but also help educate others about what people think out there and communicate some of the aspirations and desires and needs of the workforce.
They sound like they’re on a – it’s going to take – they’ve also been sensible enough to realize that to move IKEA to a fully modern digital workplace, it’s going to take a long time because it’s not just systems. It’s cultural.
Per: Exactly.
James: Change management is a crucial part of all this work and that’s – it’s always true with these internet projects. You’re dealing with people’s workplaces and how they’re doing their jobs. It’s not just throwing out. It’s not just launching a new design start page. You’re changing people’s worlds.
Per: Right.
James: They sat there three hours a day often …
Per: You’re changing their world but you have to be changing them in a way that oh, I’m using something like that already but this is much better if I use the intranet version of it.
James: Yeah.
Per: And you were also mentioning some stuff about replacing tools like – we have SharePoint but for other purposes, we’re using other tools. I know I saw a slide from Oscar Berg. He had the traditional tools and he just replaced them with Dropbox and Yammer and whatever.
James: Yeah.
Per: And realizing that you can just piece together a tool in a week now that would serve as your intranet but it’s made out of 20 tools that are available online right now.
James: Yeah, there have been a couple of good examples of Swedish councils that have done that kind of thing. Well, they’ve taken basically all open source stuff if possible, all that kind of off the shelf tool and spent their efforts and money just integrating these together in a way that works when they need to, allowing it to be more agile, more flexible, going forward.
Per: Yeah.
James: Because once you’ve implemented SharePoint, you’ve implemented SharePoint.
Per: Exactly.
James: That’s it and you’re going to be – many, many, many years before you leave that world, if ever.
Per: And thinking about that perhaps there are people out there that actually do like SharePoint and can use it in a good way. A point I really like to make about intranet is that it is a lot about finding information but some people are just better at finding information than others and sometimes it’s just better to have someone you can ask that can search for the information for you and you shouldn’t be afraid to implement systems like that. It shouldn’t be about everyone doing everything. It should be about the people that are best at something. Give them the tools to help others as well.
James: Yes, this is something – when I was last working with a social intranet – that’s one thing I preach a lot about is that people like asking people – you learn and you know. If Peter, you know Peter is pretty hot and pretty good on that tool or that process. You ask him. You go across. You walk across to his desk and you say, “Oh, remind me. Where is that document? What do I do with that?” And he tells you because he is the guy who knows that thing.
Why would I sit there at my desk 50 meters away and search for it? It’s much more efficient to ask him. Same as like you pick up the phone. You ring someone or you email them because you know where the source of information is because we’re social creatures.
Per: Right. And the intranet is not just the technical stuff. The intranet is the people.
James: Yeah, exactly. And the kind of searching for information, the Googling internally, that’s a fallback. That’s something you do when you’ve exhausted your social contacts, social channels. I found that quote from IKEA now as well.
Per: OK.
James: My collection of tweets. It’s from a Chinese IKEA worker. We’re talking about the digital workplace, the future vision of it. Everybody just logs in and puts some updates. It would be so much easier. That was it, you see. Wonderful.
Per: Yeah.
James: Yeah. Another bit of – it was Linda Tinnert from IKEA that was in the presentation. She said that showing awareness and understanding is the foundation to digital workplace success, which is a nice insight there. They realize that it’s the people. It’s about the people, stupid.
Per: Exactly. It’s a good realization. It’s a good step on the way but I mean stuff like that, what you were saying what the IKEA is doing, just going out and filming people and talking to real people. I think that’s what we have to realize we have to do next. We have the insights. We know it has to be user-centric. We talk about user-centric but we have to start doing it as well.
James: Yeah. I think because of the way that the world of the intranet is so – even those waking up now are making some progress and a lot of companies are showing how you can do mobile and digital workplace and do it well. We’re still years behind the internet and I think it’s going to hit like a car crash in a few years.
Per: Oh, yes.
James: Because we’re going to have such high expectations and we’re going to see how it’s working and how the internet itself has become much more mobile first or mobile only and people who are non-desk workers who were doing jobs in the field, are going to start to be living in a world where they can do absolutely everything via their mobile apart from their job.
Per: That’s a good quote actually. I like that.
James: And that’s when the car crash will hit because you’re just going to get such a huge amount of stress and frustration and I’m hoping a bit of tipping point. We will really see then that God, we’ve got to do this now. There’s so much money to be made from allowing people to work in a better world. You’re researching how they work.
Per: I can actually relate to that in the project I’m working in right now because there’s one woman who works – well, in a state-owned company, let’s say that, and so funny because we’re a project team and there are four people of us and three of us are consultants and she – her computer, she can’t install the stuff that people have to work with. We wanted to install Dropbox. That won’t work. Google Drive, that won’t work. Skype, that won’t work. So we can’t really communicate with her. We actually meet her and so it’s funny because the rest of us were just all over the place with all these tools and it’s making our lives so much easier.
James: Yeah.
Per: And she’s just not allowed to.
James: Yeah. No. Not an unusual story.
Per: Yeah.
James: But it’s kind of nice that you’re forced to meet her.
Per: Yeah, of course.
James: If it works.
Per: We sit all day working in a small conference room nowadays.
James: Yeah.
Per: Kind of fun as well.
James: But this whole thing about.. Jonas Söderström was saying as well, that there’s a lot of talk about digital workplaces and there’s a lot of focus at the moment about how we can enable – or you do the opposite of your who and enable people to telecommute and work from Starbucks or from home or from anywhere they like. But we’ve got to remember as well that that’s just a proportion of our economy.
Per: Yeah.
James: It might be a very important part of it. It might even be the driving engine for the economist, these desk workers, digital workers. But you still got an awful lot of people out there who are doing field work and managing forests or doing care work or working in stores, shops and things where they have all got mobiles in their pockets and it’s going to be – we’re going to have to have a revolution in a few years.
Per: Yes.
James: I’ve got one more little insight here. When we had our kitchen done, I might have mentioned – did I mention this one to you?
Per: I think so.
James: About the workers that came and they did the building work here and just that fact, that they all had iPads and telephones.
Per: Oh, yeah.
James: They were reading content and doing – they were – during their breaks. They sat there discussing news articles and reading news articles and things on their iPads and it was fascinating to come in and see this. Like three builders sat in my living room all with their iPads and iPhones discussing content, discussing sports and stuff. A few years ago, they would have only sat there with tabloid papers, you know paper papers, reading yesterday’s news.
Per: Yeah. I remember the carpenter who came in to build my kid’s loft beds. He took pictures of the beds after he built them and posted them online on his Facebook page. That was his marketing.
James: Yeah, one of the guys who did my kitchen and stuff did the same thing. He took a picture of one of the best features we have on the kitchen and he posted it and he uses it in his collection of photos or shows when he’s doing sales talks with people.
Per: Right.
James: This is probably very Swedish because there are some other countries where their builders and plumbers and so on don’t sit around looking at iPads or 3D connections. I mean I understand that it is a little bit more advanced in some markets but still it’s an insight into where we’re going and …
Per: I think so.
James: One of the things we heard from – I think it was Luke at UX Lx, Wroblewski. He talked about how in America certain demographics are, mobile is there only way to access in the internet. So they’re all out there. They’re working and they’re doing jobs and they have the mobile and the mobile is their internet, yet they’re not able to do their jobs.
Per: Right.
James: Because their jobs haven’t come that far.
Per: And then I just read the other day which was a study from Australia where they actually realized that the mobile internet usage has surpassed the desktop and the – well, not only desktop but – what do you call it? Laptop computers as well in the use of the internet. So more people are actually accessing the internet via mobile than regular computers now in Australia which is – that says something and it’s probably – they just haven’t done this study yet in a lot of countries but that tells you a lot about where we’re going and it’s just mobile in the future.
James: Yeah. But also we’re entering a bit now – we’re entering a phase now. I think we’re still drifting a little bit but we’re entering a phase now where we’ve got more device diversity than we ever had in the history of personal computing.
Per: Yeah.
James: We’ve got mobile phones that are everything from three inches to six inches now and then you’ve got tablets I got from basically six inches all the way up to – I think Sony to a 24-inch tablet which is madness and then you’ve got laptops which you can remove keyboards and they become tablets. You’ve got laptops that are everything from like 9, 10 inches up to 24 inches or something. You’ve got laptops themselves and you’ve got desktops and you’ve got iMacs or whatever with massive retina screens that are big as football pitches.
Per: I actually found the link yesterday. I will post that as well to – I think it’s called Screensize.es. So Screen Sizes.
James: Yeah.
Per: And they posted a lot of these different sizes. It’s insane. We are drifting but I think the workforce – it’s all about understanding the workforce and I’m realizing that people have so much stuff. They have so many gadgets and they have better devices at home than they have at work which means that people are bringing their devices to work and expecting them to work better for them in their workplace as well.
James: Yeah, and that was one of the things I talked about at the conference bring your own device, that whole – well, bring your own device and also that convenience always wins. I said earlier that people are like water. They will find the way to trickle out and to do what they need to do to do their jobs even if your IT department doesn’t like it or your policies don’t like it.

The announcement was made in a brief joint statement by the Directors Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. No further details were released. Both sides said they would have no further comment. A quick deal by directors could undercut the bargaining power of writers by serving as an industry template for the central issue of new media compensation. The directors guild said late last year that it would delay the start of talks to give writers a chance to come to an agreement with studios. But directors, known for conducting early and efficient talks, clearly lost patience after negotiations between the writers and studios broke off on December 7 and the strike dragged on. The writers guild did not immediately respond to an e-mail request for comment on the start of talks on Saturday. Earlier this week, Jeff Hermanson, assistant executive director of the Writers Guild of America, West, cautioned against expecting directors to be compliant in negotiations. "They're going to be cautious here and I doubt they're going to be as easy to deal with as in the past," said Hermanson, citing the complexity of the "epoch-making issues facing us and facing them." A series of preliminary meetings between the directors union and the heads of some major studios were held in recent weeks to lay the groundwork for the negotiations. The guild had said those discussions were a prerequisite for talks to begin. Directors have only gone on strike once. That walkout in 1987 lasted just five minutes on the West Coast, and because of the time difference, three hours and five minutes in the East. Both sides in the two-month (Dh7.3 million) to research new media issues and the potential revenue from digital distribution through the next decade. Studios have said it is premature to put a value on emerging new media. "We're trying to get a handle on the future," Gil Cates, negotiations chair for the directors guild, said in a previous interview. He also said a media blackout would be in place during the negotiations with studios. The start of talks between directors and studios was lauded by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, the guild that represents 50,000-plus TV and movie stagecraft workers who have been affected by the writers strike. "I hope that the DGA and the WGA can reach an agreement that puts us all on the road to getting back to work," stage employees guild president Thomas C. Short said in a statement. Meanwhile, independent film company The Weinstein Co. said a deal with the writers guild that would allow the resumption of production was still pending. The deal was said to be similar to the one signed by Worldwide Pants to allow David Letterman's late night TV talk show to return with union writers. A spokesman for The Weinstein Co. said there was a delay in finalizing the agreement by Friday, as previously planned. (AP) Follow Emirates 24|7 on Google News.

The nightmare scenario for Canadian politicians today is a successful attack on the U.S. homeland by a terrorist who enters through Canada.
FACED WITH this reality, Canada has strengthened its anti-terrorism posture. Over the past four years, in addition to specific action on the border, the country's Parliament has passed Canada's first-ever Anti-Terrorism Act, a Public Safety Act and a new Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Further, the government has created the Office of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, Canada's answer to the Department of Homeland Security, and has undertaken a foreign affairs and defense review. Canadian law now defines terrorism and designates terrorist groups operating in Canada. It is now an offense to support terrorist groups or any activities related to such groups. And security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies have been given enhanced powers of surveillance, arrest and detention, including preventive arrests or arrests without warrants.
Canada has established common procedures with the United States for the screening of high-risk goods in third countries prior to their arrival at North American airports and seaports, and the Department of Transportation has plans to increase the use of biometric systems and radiological scanners at Canadian points of entry.
Similarly, after 9/11, public pressure to rebuild the Canadian armed forces grew dramatically. In its 2005 budget, the federal government pledged an additional $11 billion to the armed forces over five years, a move supported even by the New Democrats, Canada's dovish social-democratic party. This marked the first substantial increase to the defense budget since cuts in the overall federal budget during the 1990s reduced military spending by some $25 billion.
And though Canada chose to sit out the Iraq War, Canadian special forces joined American units in Afghanistan in 2001 and later assumed the leadership of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. In the summer of 2005, the Canadian military enhanced its Afghan force and set up base in Kandahar. Using language Canadians had all but forgotten, Major General Andrew Leslie, former commander of Task Force Kabul and deputy commander of ISAF, predicted that Canada may be in Afghanistan for a generation: "There are things worth fighting for. There are things worth dying for. There are things worth killing for."
In sum, Canada has indeed acted to improve its overall security posture since 9/11. In keeping with the Canadian realist approach to bilateral continental relations, Canada has endeavored to safeguard its economic interests by satisfying American security concerns, which, according to former Canadian Ambassador Allan Gotlieb, "opens doors [in Washington] like no other key."
But if self-interest was clearly at work in Canada's post-9/11 security decisions, it is less clear whether the Canadian and American governments share the same global outlook. Whether Canada is a trusted ally of the United States--insofar as the latter has defined its global roles and responsibilities--is a more difficult question to answer. For in many disturbing ways, Canada seeks to unify its chronically fractured sense of nationhood in opposition to the United States.
BY AND large, Canadians like Americans. A recent comprehensive study of the country's attitudes reveals that 70 percent of Canadians "value and respect the United States and its citizens", while only 15 percent admit to not liking or respecting "anything that the United States and its people stand for." The problem is that, today, Canada's political reality reinforces the minority anti-American sentiment. the United States..
This pattern shows up in international matters, as well. Canadians are confirmed multilateralists (except when they seize Spanish and Portuguese fishing trawlers on the high seas, bomb Kosovo without UN authorization, and unilaterally claim a 200-milere t seventy of the past one hundred years!
More seriously, despite the promising reaction to the terrorism threat, the prevailing Canadian-values and anti-American paradigm has influenced government policy on security issues. The most recent example is Canada's confused decision on ballistic missile defense (BMD). The government of Paul Martin had given every indication that Canada would sign on to the development and deployment of BMD, even ensuring that NORAD, the joint U.S.-Canadian air defense system, would be used as a key component in the program. However, the opposition--and, again, elite opinion--relentlessly attacked BMD as America's "missile defense madness", as "the weaponization of space", and as something that would "harm Canada's international reputation." Canadians, who had not been asked to contribute financially to the development of the system, and who could one day be protected by it, had been favorably predisposed to join. After the onslaught of negative attacks, however, they changed their minds. The government, fearing that as many as twenty members of its own caucus would vote with the opposition, decided to opt out of the program.
TO UNDERSTAND how this anti-American bias is being strengthened by Canada's current political reality one must begin with Lord Durham's observation in 1839 that Canada was "two nations warring in the bosom of a single state." Some 165 years later, Canada remains a country where, in the words of historian H. V. Nelles, "unambiguous unity and a singular identity" still largely elude its inhabitants. Except that today, Canada is really three nations: Quebec, the West and the multicultural cities.
Quebec is already separate within Canada. To the average Quebecer, the Canadian federal government is essentially irrelevant. Quebecers make almost all their own political and social choices, and international markets are as influential an economic force in the province as is the rest of Canada, perhaps more so. Quebecers are more left-wing and statist than their English-Canadian counterparts and more culturally confident, too. The province has a thriving French-language magazine, book, film, web and TV industry that utterly dominates public tastes, as opposed to the American products that resonate widely in the rest of Canada. No serious people today think that Quebecers want to return to past political arrangements or that Quebec nationalism is a waning fad. The province has never signed the 1982 Canadian constitution (though it is bound by its provisions) and support for independence hovers around the 50 percent mark. Quebecers regularly elect secessionist parties to represent them in both the provincial assembly and the federal House of Commons.
More than one-third of Western Canadians (encompassing the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia) believe it is time to consider separating from Canada, according to 2005 survey data. Western Canadian alienation is nothing new, but it has lately taken a different form with the rise of the Canada's new Conservative Party, which dominates the region and is now the country's official opposition. The Conservative Party's intellectual roots owe more to the American conservative movement than to traditional Canadian Toryism: It is the party of smaller government, social conservatism and rural populism. Alberta, the engine of this new West, is Canada's wealthiest province, home to the country's galloping oil and gas industry, and enjoys a faster population growth than any other region. Nearly 60 percent of Albertans supported the Iraq War, while fewer than a quarter of Quebecers did.
This leaves Canada's increasingly multicultural cities. Five cities are home to 43 percent of Canadians, and Toronto alone accounts for 17 percent of the country's total population. Canada's cities are also the primary destination for immigrants and refugees to the country. About 20 percent of Canada's residents--and half of Toronto's--are foreign-born, compared to 11 percent in the United States, 5.6 percent in France and 4 percent in the UK. Cities are therefore the testing ground for Canada's multicultural experiment. However, multiculturalism rejects the idea that a single set of organized cultural beliefs and political principles are foundational to the nation's public life. So multicultural Canada cannot demand, as other countries can and do, that new arrivals adapt to the country's traditional cultural and political forms because, as the minister of citizenship and immigration has said, "we've developed, as a Canadian value, an appreciation of diversity--if not a complete nurturing of that diversity." Furthermore, multiculturalism has today become primarily an anti-Western impulse, specifically one that sees the United States as the locus of all manner of evil in the world. Therefore, large segments of Canada's urban areas should be seen to be, in effect if not in intention, hostile to the Western political tradition in general and to American ideals in particular.
In truth, Canada is now a country of three solitudes--four, if Canada's ever more assertive native population is included--where each has increasingly little in common with the others. Quebec's secessionist political parties obviously do not believe in trying to bridge these gaps. Significant portions of Canada's Conservative Party probably do not believe in doing so either, though the party will not acknowledge this publicly. This leaves the federal Liberals as the only major party attempting to be pan-Canadian in its appeal. And their only way of appealing to these disparate groups is by reference to the mythical "Canadian values" described earlier.
However, Canada's first-past-the-post electoral system and demographic reality (highly urban Ontario and Quebec represent 60 percent of the country's population) reduces Liberal pan-Canadianism to vote-getting among multicultural city-dwellers and non-secessionist Quebecers. So a typical Liberal election campaign preys on fears of the country's disintegration at the hands of Quebec's secessionists and the loss of its unique social character and diversity at the hands of the Conservatives and their "hidden agenda" of "U.S. style" policies. Ergo, the Liberals believe they are the only thing holding the country together and preventing its inevitable drift into the American orbit. Thus does the Liberal Party confuse its interests with those of Canada's citizens and use electoral politics to heighten anti-Americanism and Canadian regionalism. After all, a (small) majority of Canadians supported the Iraq War until well after the invasion. But Quebecers didn't. Neither, we may safely assume, did multicultural, urban Canadians. After months of delay, the federal government decided against joining the war because the UN hadn't authorized it.
Over the next few months Canadians will head to the polls to elect a new government. (The election was promised last June when a corruption and cronyism scandal over the misdirection of tax dollars to promote national unity in Quebec threatened to topple the Liberal government.) During the campaign, Liberals will tell Canadians that Quebec secessionists are out to destroy the great Canadian dream and that Conservatives will destroy Canada's unique social character and open the door to the country's "Americanization."
The election will most likely result in another Liberal minority government: Canada's regionalism--its solitudes--will see to that. However, given the Liberal electoral playbook and their probable parliamentary alliance with the leftist (and vocally anti-American) New Democrats to stay in power, don't expect Canada to ally itself too closely with the United States on any matter that doesn't directly affect Canada's economic interests.
PAUL MARTIN, the current Liberal prime minister, is fond of saying that Canada "will set the standard by which other nations judge themselves." Politicians are often called upon to say silly things, but it is generally a good idea not to let rhetoric stray too far from reality. But contemporary Canada--with the exception of its competent economic management--leaps precisely that gulf between rhetoric and reality, overcompensating for deep feelings of inferiority. It's a leap that too many Canadians have grown accustomed to hearing and by now enjoy believing. And it will persist until the status quo of Canadian federalism changes: either by devolving much, much more power to the regions and allowing each to make its own political, economic and social choices, or by breaking apart. Either way, the narcissistic and corrosive platitudes of "Canadian values" and "national unity" should cease.
There is no shame in fundamentally altering Canada's political arrangements. Unlike the United States, the country was not founded on an ecstatic commitment to a great cause but on the more pedestrian grounds of being a good idea. Such pragmatism should welcome change, if change is best. Canadians should be mature enough to question whether the country created in 1867 is still acting in the best interests of all its citizens in 2005.
Just as few predicted the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the breakup of Canada also seems far-fetched. Nevertheless, American policymakers should consider the possibility. In 1999 President Clinton said the United States "valued our relationship with a strong and united Canada. We look to you; we learn from you. The partnership you have built between people of diverse backgrounds and governments at all levels is . . . what democracy must be about, as people all over the world move around more, mix with each other more, live in close proximity more."
But what if the "partnership" Canada has built no longer supports America's global roles and responsibilities? What if the essential condition for Canadian unity is an anti-American value system built into the national political process? In that case, it is unclear that Canada is a long-term ally of the United States out of anything more than economic necessity. In that case, is it still in America's interest to support Canadian unity?

A vasectomy is a fairly simple medical procedure that prevents sperm from joining the seminal fluid during ejaculation. Sperm is half of the equation for pregnancy. The lack of this possibility can change the mental outlook of both sex partners.
Vasectomy Basics
Sperm, or spermatozoa, are created in the male body in the testes and leave the testes through two long tubes called the vas deferens. There is one tube leaving from each testicle. But by severing these two tubes during a vasectomy procedure, sperm are prevented from joining into the seminal fluid and never leave the body. Read our earlier blog for a more detailed description of the process.
So Where Do These Unused Sperm Go Instead?
You don’t have to be concerned about your unused sperm. Unused sperm are absorbed by the body in a natural body process. This is true for unused sperm whether you have a vasectomy or not. The scrotum containing the testes does not store sperm for later use. They simply die and are reabsorbed into the body.
Why have a Vasectomy?
For many, the decision to have a vasectomy is not an easy choice. A surgery in such a personal place can be a difficult concept to consider. However, because the vasectomy allows a male to have intercourse without a concern of a pregnancy, this allows a certain piece of mind. The same is true for the female of the couple. Fear of pregnancy can cause the sexual experience to be stressful and therefore less enjoyable for her as well. Thus, the vasectomy can allow both partners a sense of relaxation which allows for a more positive sexual experience.
Studies Support the Vasectomy Peace of Mind
In a study published in the Central European Journal of Urology, a scientifically significant number of men reported better orgasm, desire and sexual satisfaction after a vasectomy. More details from the article are published here on the National Institute of Health website.
Vasectomy: Other Benefits
Vasectomy has more benefits. For a dedicated couple, a vasectomy can be more than a mental relief from fear of pregnancy. They can eliminate other forms of contraception and be more in the moment with each other. While couples should always practice safe sex to stay STD-free, committed, long-term relationships can eliminate messy spermicides, mood-crushing condoms, and hormone-filled birth control pills. This can certainly put some anxiety at bay and relax the bedroom atmosphere.
Reverse Vasectomy
A beautiful idea behind vasectomy may actually be very surprising to some. Vasectomy does not have to be a permanent endeavor! While the procedure can remain in place for the entirety of an adult male’s life if he chooses, surgical technology now allows a skilled surgeon like Dr. Sussman the ability to reverse a vasectomy. So a couple may choose a vasectomy and then later decide circumstances have changed to allow for children. Dr. Sussman can help with that by reversing the vasectomy. The procedure itself is similar to the work time and recovery time of the vasectomy procedure. It is relatively quick and painless with a minimal recovery period.
The Vasectomy Calm
With so many benefits to Vasectomy, you owe it to yourself to look into it further if the thought has even crossed your mind. Find a peace and convenience that isn’t available in an over-the-counter drug store purchase.

(Authorized Signatory)Petition filed against Musharraf's possible exit from country
ISLAMABAD: A petition to restrain Gen (retd) Pervez Musharraf from travelling abroad to receive medical treatment was submitted on Friday in the Islamabad High Court, DawnNews reported.
The petitioner, Haroon Rasheed, who is the son of Lal Masjid cleric Ghazi Abdul Rasheed, requested the court to instruct the federal interior ministry to provide the former president with the best medical facilities in the country and bar Musharraf from exiting Pakistan, according to a spokesperson of the Lal Masjid Shuhada Foundation.
The petition further said Musharraf had several important criminal cases pending against him, including one relating to the murder of Rasheed Ghazi and sought to make the federal interior minister, interior secretary, Islamabad's Inspector General Police and the head of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) DIG Khalid Khattak parties to the case.
Rumours and speculations were rife following the interesting turn of events on Jan 2 which saw the former military ruler being rushed to a military hospital in Rawalpindi after developing a cardiac complication while en route to a special court in Islamabad for the hearing of the treason case under Article 6 of the Constitution.
The former dictator was seeking avenues to exit the country and the arrival of the Saudi Foreign Minister next week was linked to the issue, according to the grapevine.
Other skeptics believed that he was avoiding the embarrassment of appearing in a civilian courtroom.
An active swimmer and former army commando, Musharraf is not publicly known to have had any heart issues. The timing of the heart problem immediately sparked accusations that Musharraf was ducking his trial.
Musharraf's spokesman Raza Bokhari said the former military strongman was conscious and “oriented in time and space” and was being examined by military doctors, in an emailed statement.
Doctors later ruled out a heart attack and said that further tests were being conducted while the former president was kept under observation at the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology.
The court later granted the retired general exemption from appearing before it for the day's proceedings and ruled that an arrest warrant was not issued against Musharraf for medical reasons.
The court had earlier ordered for Musharraf to appear before it and warned of issuing arrest warrants against the former president in case he failed to appear.
The order had come after the former military strongman had missed earlier hearings over the case citing security concerns over explosives found on the route from his residence despite summons issued by the special court formed to try him for treason.Are you looking to celebrate a birthday, graduation, or special social event?

Tottenham are top of the Premier League. That's a saying we're not used to hearing.
Jose Mourinho has worked wonders with this Spurs side and to cap off one year in charge of the Lilywhites, they beat Manchester City 2-0.
It was a fantastic performance full of defensive organisation and ruthless finishing from Heung-min Son and Giovani Lo Celso.
Doubts have been raised about whether Tottenham have the ability to challenge for the title but this was a huge landmark, one that stamped down their authority and told the rest of the league that they are genuine challengers.
Of course, there is still a long way to go before the winners are crowned in May but it's so far so good for Mourinho and his side.
Their front three of Harry Kane, Son and Gareth Bale have the potential to cause immense danger and with them on the pitch, they always have a chance.
Kane may not have scored against City but he was an impressive performer nonetheless.
He was so good that Gary Neville named him the Man of the Match for his performance against the Citizens on Saturday evening.
However, there was probably a more eye-catching appraisal from Neville in the first half.
Speaking during the opening 45 minutes of Sky Sports' coverage of the match, he waxed lyrical about the 27-year-old.
"There’s a bit of Zidane about him, the way he moves inside and holds it. The touch and the awareness, the way he shields it, no one can get near him."
GIVEMESPORT'S Matt Dawson says...
This is quite the claim from Neville and as much as we hate to agree, there are some comparisons to be drawn.
The ball is like a magnet to Kane's feet and the way he drags players towards him is mouthwatering.
The forward has always been a fantastic goalscorer but now even when he's not close to goal, we're expecting something special from him.
The work he's done with Mourinho has been impressive, with the Portuguese turning him from a poacher into more of a false 9, someone who comes deeper and creates chances as well.
Like Zidane, his vision is superb and Kane has been one of the best at finding his teammates in 2020/21.
So far this season, Kane has scored seven goals and collected nine assists, providing 2.1 key passes per match.
For context, in 2019/20, the England striker managed just two Premier League assists and 0.9 key passes a game.
He has taken his game to the next level. Kane is simply world-class.News Now - Sport NewsORIGINAL RESEARCH article
Analysis of Publications on Journal Impact Factor Over Time
- Faculty of Social Sciences, Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS), Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands
In this article, we present the results of an analysis that describes the research centered on Journal Impact Factors (JIFs). The purpose of the analysis is to make a start of studying part of the field of quantitative science studies that relates to the most famous and classic bibliometric indicator around and to see what characteristics apply to the research on JIFs. In this article, we start with a general description of the research, from the perspective of the journals used, the fields in which research on JIFs appeared, and the countries that contributed to the research on JIF. Finally, the article presents a first attempt to describe the coherence of the field, which will form the basis for next steps in this line of research on JIFs.
Introduction
Undeniably, one of the most widely used bibliometric indicators is the Journal Impact Factor (JIF). This indicator reflects the average impact of a journal and is defined as the number of citations a journal receives in a particular year divided by the number of citable documents published in the 2 years previous to the year of publication. The JIF is developed by Eugene Garfield in the 1950/1960s, with first publications on the indicator in 1955 and 1963 (Garfield, 1955; Garfield and Sher, 1963). Journal citation statistics were included in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR), the annual summarizing volumes to the printed editions of the Science Citation Index (SCI), and the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). In an ever more complex world, in which more and more journals appeared on the scene, thereby complicating the life of academic librarians, the JIF was a helpful tool in decision-making on collection management. When the JCR started to appear on electronic media, first on CD-ROM and later through the Internet, JIF was more frequently used for other purposes such as assessments on various levels. This use of the JIF was warned against by Garfield himself (Garfield, 1972, 2006). The JIF is included in the JCR from 1975 onward, initially only for the SCI, later also for the SSCI. For the Arts and Humanities Citation Index, no JIFs were produced. From the definition of the JIF, it becomes apparent that JIF is a relatively simple measure, is easily available through the JCR, and relates to scientific journals that are the main channel for scientific communication in the natural sciences, biomedicine, and parts of the social sciences (e.g., in psychology, economics, business, and management) and humanities (e.g., in linguistics). The bibliometrics community mainly studied the methodological issues related to JIFs (Moed and van Leeuwen, 1995; Seglen, 1997; Archambault and Lariviere, 2009) and other journal impact measures such as the Eigenfactor (Bergstrom et al., 2008), the Audience Factor (Zitt and Small, 2008), and the Source Normalized Impact per Paper (Moed, 2010; Waltman et al., 2013). While this work was of a critical nature on the usage of journal impact measures for assessment purposes, trying to develop solutions for the problems related to JIFs, more recently, we observe many publications in the bibliometrics literature using the JIF in a less critical manner, applying JIF in various assessment contexts. Many studies outside the bibliometrics community examined the possibilities of the application of JIFs in management of research, journals and journal publishing, or simply reported on the value of the JIF for their own journal. This literature is an indication of the growing relevance of this bibliometric indicator for science and science management.
In this study, we will describe the development of the research about JIFs from 1981 onward, until 2015. The focus will be on the development of output related to JIF, looking at the disciplinary and geographical origin of the output focusing on JIFs. Co-occurrence analysis of title and abstract words is used to see how the publications in the research on JIFs are related. This article is a first step in a line of research, describing the landscape in a general sense, followed by research in which we want to follow the development of the research on JIFs, for example, to see whether we can speak of the development of a scholarly specialty and also how the use of JIFs is embedded in evaluation practices in academia worldwide, the actors using these indicators in those evaluation practices, and the role of academic libraries therein, and so on. This follow-up research will also extend the period of analysis to the most recent years, up until 2016, as that will also connect to discussions on actors, specialty development, etc.
Data Collection
We collected from the Web of Science all publications that contain the words “Impact Factor” or the shortening to IF or JIF in their title or abstract. We concluded that “if” or “IF” in itself was impossible to include in the search, because this would include all occurrences of the word “if” in its form of a conjunction in the English language (over 1.2 million hits in Web of Science online). A first search was conducted in November 2012 and resulted in a set of 2,855 publications of various document types and updated in January 2017, adding another 1,772 publications to the set. This set of 4,627 publications was combined with the in-house version of the Web of Science at CWTS, a bibliometric version of the original Web of Science database. This resulted in a set of 3,932 publications, which were present in both versions of the WoS database. The main reason for the difference between the two sets is the gap between the periods covered in both sets, where the CWTS version was up-to-date for analytical purposes to 2015. A detailed manual analysis of the contents of the publications resulted in the deletion of 462 publications, which focused on other topics than JIFs.1
The resulting data set contained 3,470 publications in WoS.
Methods and Indicators
Below we will analyze the disciplinary embedding of the publications selected in the WoS database according to the so-called Journal Subject Categories. As the data collected for the study are collected irrespective of the field to which the publications belong, the set contains publications from a variety of subfields. Information on geographical origin was extracted from the addresses attached to the publications selected. We only looked at country names attached to publications and counted a country name only once when it appears on a publication.
In this study, we use the VOS Viewer methodology, through which structures between publications are identified on the basis of the co-occurrence of title and abstract words, but also other entities in science such as journals, authors, or institutions. The VOS Viewer is an analysis tool developed at CWTS that allows one to construct and visualize networks based on bibliometric information. The relations used can be copublications, and consequently, coauthorship and coinstitution occurrences, as well as cocitation or bibliographic coupling relations (van Eck and Waltman, 2010). We start this analysis of the data from 1996 onward, the year in which WoS publications structurally started having abstracts in the database. The availability of this type of data in our set means that we have 20 years of publication data, which we will analyze divided in 4 equally long periods of 5 years (1996–2000, 2001–2005, 2006–2010, and 2011–2015).
In the part on the disciplinary and geographical background, we use a standard bibliometric impact indicator, namely MNCS, the field normalized mean citation score, to give an impression to what extent publications in the research on JIFs are more or less influential and visible in the fields to which they belong (Waltman et al., 2011). One of the main features of the MNCS is field normalization. Various fields have different citation densities, so to compare across fields normalization for these differences are needed if one wants to know the relative position of the article within the field. Of course, if one is interested in the differences in citation density among fields, one should not normalize. MNCS is an indicator developed by CWTS, but similar field normalized impact indicators have been developed elsewhere as well. Furthermore, in MNCS, age of publications and document types are also taken into consideration.
Results
The overall development of research and output on JIFs is displayed in Figure 1. After taking off in the early 1990s, since 1994 the output is steadily increasing. In Figure 1, we also display the annual overall growth of output in WoS. If we want to indicate the growth in output, we apply a formula for calculation of developments in output numbers. As the analysis will further focus on the 20-year period, we will indicate the growth rate of research on JIFs over that period, 1996–2015, in comparison with a global increase in output numbers in the WoS database. In addition, we will indicate what the growth rate is within that period, by looking at the last 10 years, 2006–2015. We apply the following formula: we take the output in the last year and extract the output in the first year. This is divided by 1% of the output in the starting year. This is interpretable as a percentage, although growth rate in itself is more accurate. This delivers for the world a growth rate of 84, while for the research on JIFs, the growth rate is 1,157, both for the period 1996–2015. The comparison of this ends up with the conclusion that research on JIFs grows about 13/14 times as fast as global science does. Whenever we focus on the last 10 years (period 2006–2015), the growth rate for global science is 39, while that of research on JIFs is 135, which leads to the conclusion that research on JIFs grows three to four times as quick as global science does. So in this last period, we notice some sort of stabilization, which is also visible in Figure 1, from 2010 onward, with a drop after 2012, after which the output again starts to increase.
In Figure 2, we display the trend shown in Figure 1, but broken down into various document types in the WoS database. Normal articles do account for the largest share of the output, as can be expected. Remarkably, the document type Editorial material covers nearly 25% of all publications on JIFs. Editorial material is apparently a popular way to discuss JIFs. Moreover, we hypothesize that editorials function as a way to make public the value of the JIF of the respective journals. The other document types play a relatively modest role.
Figure 2. Trend analysis of output in WoS on Journal Impact Factors across various document types, 1981–2015.
We notice a change in the trends of output numbers of articles from 2009 onward, after which the annual numbers fluctuate, with a recovery of the upward trend in 2015. For Editorial material, we observe this decrease somewhat later in time, in 2012. Finally, Reviews seem to be gaining in importance from 2010 onward.
Given the low numbers of publications involved in the period before 1996, a year in which we clearly observe an increase of the number of publications on JIFs, we from here on focus on the period 1996–2015, cutting this period in four equally long 5-year periods.
In Table 1, we present the publications about JIFs in the period 1996–2015 by journal. We show only the 25 journals that appeared most frequently in the period 2011–2015 and then look back in time to what extent these journals contributed to the overall increase of output in the research on JIFs. Among the 25 journals that publish most frequent about JIFs in 2010–2015, we find Scientometrics as the top ranking journal, with 158 publications, while the journal also published on this topic in the 3 previous periods. A new journal that publishes research about JIFs is the Journal of Informetrics (launched in 2007), with 79 publications in the research on JIFs in the period 2011–2015. Other journals among the top 25 most frequently publishing journals in 2011–2015 are Journal of Informetrics, PLoS ONE, Current Science, and Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology. These five journals actually form the core journals for the specialty. Next in the table, we find two journals that publish about JIFs for the first time in 2011–2015 (Revista Portuguesa de Pneumologia and Academic Emergency Medicine). Learned Publishing is a journal that is shown in Table 1, which is also visible in all four periods of the analysis.
The development of the total number of publications per period indicates the rapid growth in the research on JIFs, as it doubles every next period, with the number of publications in 2011–2015 being 10-fold the output volume compared to the output in the period 1996–2000. In Table 2, the journals are shown that contained publications about JIFs in every period of our analysis, indicative of the stability in the research on JIFs. The first two journals were mentioned in the discussion of Table 1. A remarkable fact in Table 2 is the dominance of biomedical journals (10 out of 17). Another remarkable fact is the relative large number of Spanish journals (n = 4) among these 17 journals. An explanation for this phenomenon may be the strong pressure in the Spanish science system to publish internationally (Jimenez-Contreras et al., 2003), in particular in journals with a high JIF. In the manual selection process, we noted a relatively large number of publications from Germany and German language publications, on JIFs. However, this did not result in a very strong visibility of one particular journal from Germany or in the German language.
In Table 3, we present the distribution of main contributing countries to the research around JIFs. The countries are shown according to the order of numbers of publications in the period 2010–2015. The USA takes a first position in the research on JIFs. Rather surprising is the position of Spain. Although the share of the output of Spain decreases, the absolute numbers increases strongly, and equally interesting, the citation impact of these publications increases as well. This prominent position of Spain in this analysis is mainly due to two reasons, namely the before mentioned pressure, also legally, for Spanish academics to publish in high impact journals, in combination with the fact that most universities in Spain have faculties of library and information science, therefore many scholars are working in the field. China appears in the second period of our analysis, increasing its output in research on JIFs in the last two periods. This development is in line with the overall growth of the number of scientific publications from China (Moed, 2002; Bouabid et al., 2016). And although based on somewhat lower numbers of publications, the citation impact of some of the countries publishing on JIFs stand out, in particular of the Netherlands, Canada, and Australia.
In Figure 3, we compare the output of the countries that are most active in the research on JIFs with their total contribution to global science in the period 2011–2015. Please note that shares are taken among this group only, for both the contribution to global science and to the body of publications on JIFs, so the global shares presented here are not the actual contributions, and these might be somewhat smaller due to the exclusion of some countries from this analysis. Moreover, these scores contain all document types, since editorials seem to be of importance in the research on JIFs. The countries are presented in the order of their contribution to global science. So we expect the USA and China, together with large science producing European countries such as Great Britain, Germany, and France to be on top of the figure. However, among the top three countries, their contribution to the research on JIFs is lower compared to their contribution to global science, while Great Britain and Germany have relatively more output on JIFs compared to their global contribution to science. Spain has a contribution more than three times as high to the research on JIFs, just as Taiwan has a double as high contribution to JIF research compared to the country’s contribution to global science output. Other countries that are overrepresented compared to their national share on global science are Canada, Italy, Australia, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Belgium.
In Table 4, we present the disciplinary background of the journals publishing on JIFs. The social sciences field Library and Information Science plays the most important role. Many journals classified under this heading in the WoS are also labeled as Computer Science, interdisciplinary applications (which explains why that field is so strongly visible in all three periods). The second largest field when it comes to publications on the topic of JIFs is Medicine, general and internal. This field contains next to the well-known general medicine journals such as New England Journal of Medicine, British Medical Journal, JAMA, and The Lancet, many local medicine journals, many of which publish occasionally on JIFs. We see this as evidence for the popularity of JIFs in this field.
Another remarkable phenomenon in the overview of the disciplinary composition of the research on JIFs is the fact that these articles tend to have high impact. Moreover, those publications in rather peripheral fields, as seen from the core of the research on JIFs, still seem to generate high impact scores.
Next, we focus on the way the publications in the research on JIFs are interrelated on the basis of terms (title and abstract words) and how these terms co-occur on the publications in the research on JIFs. For this, we used the VOS Viewer methodology.
In Figures 4A–D, we present the publications related to research on JIF in the periods 1996–2000, 2001–2005, 2006–2010, and 2011–2015, respectively. In Figure 4A, we show the network for the period 1996–2000. Here, we distinguish three loosely connected clusters, somewhat stretched out, in which the most left cluster contains the core of the research field. Here, we find important terms, such as Scientific journal, Journal Impact factor, Evaluation, Institute, and Measure. The other two clusters seem to be containing less relevant terms in the research on JIFs, with some focus on the application in both the geographic dimension (mentioning terms such as Spanish scientific production, but also Germany, British journal, and English) as well as the disciplinary dimension (mentioning terms such as Oncology, Hospital, Anaesthesiology). Here, we would like to recall that in the earlier parts of this study, we have shown that in this period, from 1996 to 2000, output numbers just started to increase in the research on JIFs.
Figure 4. (A) Term map of title and abstract words in output on Journal Impact Factors (JIFs), 1996–2000 (based on VOS Viewer). (B) Term map of title and abstract words in output on JIFs, 2001–2005 (based on VOS Viewer). (C) Term map of title and abstract words in output on JIFs, 2006–2010 (based on VOS Viewer). (D) Term map of title and abstract words in output on JIFs, 2011–2015 (based on VOS Viewer).
In Figure 4B, we show the terms map that represents the research on JIFs in the period 2001–2005. In the graph, we distinguish three different clusters as expressed by the color coding; however, if one takes a closer look, there seems to be two major clusters, one on the right-hand side, in green, and one on the left-hand side, in red. A third, much smaller cluster in purple, is positioned somewhere in the middle, but consists of a small number of terms. The green cluster mainly contains terms related to geographic issues related to JIF research, while the red cluster contains publications that focus on issues such as Research evaluation, Research performance, University, Citation rate. So here we observe a much more evaluative context in the research centered on JIFs.
In Figure 4C, we show the term map for the period 2006–2010. Here, the words plotted in the graph show a dense network, in which we distinguish three different clusters, which are of nearly equally large size/volume of words and density. On the lower left (in red), we observe the cluster that contains the core of the library and information science and evaluation-related topics. The second cluster (in green) contains both elements of scientific publishing and terms from biomedicine, while the lower right part of the figure contains the third cluster (in purple). This cluster contains mainly elements of a geographical nature.
Finally, in Figure 4D, we present the structure based on terms in the period 2011–2015. Remarkable fact is here that for the first time, we can distinguish six separate clusters of terms. The blue and yellow clusters, that are on top of the structure, and mingled, relate to biomedical research. What we have seen in the publications selected for the analysis in this period, we notice an increase of the systematic reviews and guidelines, in the light of a discussion on publishing in high impact factor journals. A next development is visible in the green cluster, which represents the output on research assessment, various country names, indicating the importance of JIF research for the research assessment realm. On the other hand, the light blue cluster represents the discussion on the editorial role, length of citation window, etc. A small pink cluster on JIF research relates to law. Finally, the red cluster indicates the core of scientometric research as can be read from terms such as metric, scholar, impact factor.
As we have seen previously in our analysis, the number of publications grew steadily through time, which means that within the maps displaying the structure of the words used in these publications from one period to another, the underlying relations also become more prominent. The technique used displays a complicated structure in a two-dimensional manner, which is of course a limitation on the cognitive structure underlying the publications. So the increasing density in the four maps reflects the increased density in both terms, as well as the underlying relationships of the words used in titles and abstracts of the publications in the field of research on JIFs.
Conclusion, Discussion, and Future Research
In this study, we applied bibliometric techniques in a descriptive fashion, to understand the developments around the JIF. We first focused on a description of the characteristics of the research on JIFs. We observed a strong growth in output in the research on JIFs, stronger than the overall output growth in WoS. Focusing on the documents in which research about JIFs is published, editorials play an important role in the publishing on JIFs, and they cover approximately 25% of the output. When we shift our attention to the geographical location of research on JIFs, we can conclude that some countries contribute particularly strongly to research on JIFs, such as Spain and Australia. For these countries, we observe relatively large contributions to the research on JIFs, compared to their overall contribution to science. In a follow-up study, we will investigate to what extent this type of geographical focus on JIF-related scientometric research coincides with the degree to which JIFs are used for various purposes in these science systems.
The initial selection of the publications in this study taught us that we can distinguish three different types of publications on JIFs: publications from the field of library and information science that forms the core of the research on the topic (e.g., the critical studies on the JIF and its’ various ways of application, or the comparison of JIF with newly developed journal impact measures); a set of publications in other fields that relate to the popularity of the indicator in research management (e.g., publications that report on the value of the JIF or propose usage in a policy context); and finally research papers on the controversies around JIFs (these can be of a methodological or a more policy-oriented nature).
Some countries seem to be contributing more to the research on JIFs compared to other countries. A possible reason for the fact that Spain, Denmark, Greece, and Australia contribute more than expected given their overall scientific production might be that in these countries library and information sciences are a discipline often separately distinguished within the academic landscape, housed in separate faculties, next to faculties of social sciences. This is a topic for further research, in particular related to the typology of research papers on JIFs, described in the previous paragraph.
The VOS Viewer graphs in this article suggest an increasing coherence of the research on JIFs. However, future research based on citation relations might help to understand the development of the research on the topic in more detail. Does research on JIFs demonstrate the characteristics of an emerging specialty or can we explain the observed coherence in other ways? We are also interested in the question of replicability and redundancies in the literature. Is this area demonstrating scientific progress by building up a more advanced body of knowledge or do we rather witness a cyclical process in which older findings are regularly repeated?2 And how can we characterize the social network underpinning the body of literature? Do we see a fragmented adhocracy or rather a distributed community?
Another interesting topic for future studies is the question to what extent the DORA Declaration (2012), in which the editors of molecular biology journals called for a stop on using the JIF for assessment purpose, as well as the 2015 Leiden Manifesto (Hicks et al., 2015) and the Metric Tide (Wilsdon et al., 2015) that calls for a more sensible use of bibliometric indicators (among which the JIF) in research assessment contexts, influences the global research on JIFs. Trends in the output numbers showed fluctuations around the moments these documents were published, in particular for the DORA Declaration, so further inquiry is necessary to fully understand the influence of these documents on the scholarly communities working on and using JIFs.

Footnotes
- ^“Impact Factor” is a term or a combination of terms that is not only used in relation to journals and scientific publishing but also related to engineering disciplines (e.g., in relation to the construction of bridges and forces working on the steel construction) and biomedicine (where pharmacological research impact factors are used to indicate influences on drug treatment effectiveness).
- ^The issue of the cyclic nature or redundancy in reporting research came to our attention by three publications on the composition of the JIF and more in particular on the nominator and denominator. Publications such as Rossner et al. (2007), McVeigh and Mann (2009), Hubbard and McVeigh (2011) seem to report on the exact same issues as were reported in two publications from the 1990s (Moed and van Leeuwen, 1995, 1996).

April 29, 20180I’ve been reading a lot, but not finding much time to write full-on reviews. So, here are some micro-reviews, all for books that are either just published, or coming out in the next few months.
Daughters of the Storm by Kim Wilkins – New fantasy series get started all the time; some are better than others. This one, my friends, is going to be EPIC! There is nothing here not to love, from the gorgeous cover to the big, fat, luscious story that features women in non-traditional roles (well, at least one of them!) The power held by the women in this story is remarkable, even if some of the characters aren’t always likable. Bluebell is a character to remember. Is there anyone like her in literature today (I haven’t read Game of Thrones, so maybe there is…). Even so, she is the alpha and omega here, the male and female, hero and antihero, and oh, how I love her! Highly recommended.
Publication Date: March 2018
Chord of Evil by Sarah Rayne – Sarah Rayne has become a go-to author for me – I eagerly read anything she writes, and I constantly recommend her to people in the library and friends in my Reader world. Rayne has a remarkable ability to weave history, horror, mystery, and a little bit of romance into can’t-put-it-down books. She succeeds again with Chord of Evil, the second in her Phineas Fox series. Not every author can pull off a parallel narrative with one set of characters in the present day and another in the past. Rayne has mastered this technique in previous books, and uses it again here as we learn the present day story and how it entwines with the past. If I have one issue with this book, it’s Phin’s reaction to actually meeting the fabulous Arabella in person. He’s disappointed? Are you freaking kidding me? At that moment, Phin is pretty much a jerk, but he comes around. Despite this one issue, this is a winner.
Publication Date: December 2017
The Darkling Bride by Laura Anderson – This transported me back to the 1970s, when I would spend hours browsing the Gothics section of bookstore and library shelves. Everything I loved about Gothics is here – the spunky heroine with a tragedy in her past, the brooding but ridiculously handsome “lord of the manor,” his disagreeable sibling, and the forbidding matriarch – all squished up together in a remote castle or manor with a mystery and maybe a few ghosts. If you love Irish folklore, you will love this book. The story here is original and well developed, the characters appealing, and the outcome satisfying. I had a hard time putting this one down. Recommended for lovers of mysteries & family drama, and for the YA audience.
Publication Date: March 2018
Demon Crown by James Rollins – James Rollins delivers another pulse-pounding, action-packed, roller-coaster ride of a story. Once again, we’re dropped down into the world of Sigma Force, and are carried along with the action as Gray and the team race against time to stop a deadly enemy from ending the world. There’s no question about Rollins’ writing ability. He *knows* how to write in a way that grips you by the throat and doesn’t let you go until the very last moment, when you need to breathe more than anything in the world. And that definitely happened here. I’m still having dreams about those effing bees! There are a lot of authors writing action-adventure like Rollins, but where he draws ahead of the pack is in his ability to weave non-fiction elements into whatever global disaster he’s cooked up. In Demon Crown, we learn about bees, a little bit about Imperial Japan, and about amber. Pair that with likable, kickass characters, and there’s no way this one won’t shoot to the top of the charts. Highly recommended.

Reducing Regional Disparities with Integrated Peripheral Zones: Northern Argentina and Zicosur
Abstract
Globalisation has produced different outcomes regarding the convergence of disparities between countries and regions within integrated areas. Automatic convergence mechanisms postulated by classical economics have not always worked as predicted, as seen in the European Union (EU) experience. Further, regional policies within large integrated areas are difficult to manage given their complex planning and management. This article introduces the concept of Integrated Peripheral Zones (IPZ), defined as sub-regional integration schemes of neighbouring - and similar - economies belonging to different political units; and argues that the integration of the peripheries is crucial for successfully reducing disparities within larger areas, as some of these regions can even belong to their own countries ‘periphery‘. An example of these areas is ZICOSUR, comprising some of the least developed provinces belonging to the countries of MERCOSUR. This article argues that permanent and independent institutions are needed in order to formulate long term policies and focus on necessary infrastructure development.

59 out of 60capiton has successfully closed a new top-up single-asset fund for its fast-growing portfolio company KD Pharma Group („KD Pharma“). This top-up fund will provide KD Pharma with the equity financing for a number of additional strategic investments, in particular add-on acquisitions as well as organic growth initiatives to transfer KD Pharma‘s unique technology and service portfolio from its core omega-3 market to adjacent market segments, including the medical cannabinoid market and small molecule synthesis.
The transaction was highly oversubscribed by its existing investors, enabling capiton to raise the top-up fund in just three months.
About KD Pharma
KD Pharma is a worldwide leading CDMO and technology leader for the purification of lipids. In particular, KD Pharma focuses on small molecule synthesis and manufacturing highly purified omega-3 fatty acids for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products.
Since its acquisition in 2013 by capiton IV, a fund managed by capiton, KD Pharma has grown from a single-digit revenue business to one of the industry’s largest players with total sales reaching c. EUR 200m to date. Recent investments include the acquisition of manufacturing assets of Rohner AG as well as manufacturing assets and in-licensing of a novel extraction method from Herbolea Biotech.
In 2019 capiton initiated a GP-led single-asset secondary transaction to provide KD Pharma with the necessary investment horizon and follow-on capital to finance the significant future growth potential expected. Following the successful closing of this GP-led secondary, the company has been held in a single-asset continuation fund structure managed by capiton.
Advisors
capiton was supported in this transaction by CMS Hasche Sigle (asset-level legal advice), POELLATH (fund-level legal advice), EY (tax, structuring) and BMH Bräutigam (notary). The investors were supported by Debevoise & Plimpton (legal advice).Elements of Search Engine Optimization

For emerging economies, emulating the development paths of mature health systems is neither feasible nor desirable. There are tremendous challenges—and opportunities—as these countries ramp up investment in health care in the years ahead. Most important, emerging economies clearly see that health is not a cost center. Rather, investments in health will help economies grow with equity, strengthen social stability, increase people’s well-being, and help them live with dignity. (Click here for a video on the transformation of health systems in emerging economies.)
At the same time, the rise of noncommunicable diseases and the persistence of communicable ones—such as, recently, Ebola—highlight the need for emerging economies to invest in their health systems. Quick, narrow, and funneled solutions need to be replaced by visionary, long-term thinking, and systematic approaches need to be coupled with collaboration between multiple stakeholders to move nascent or maturing health systems toward the ideal. One emerging solution, “leapfrogging,” is a transformative approach to development that can empower emerging economies to achieve their ideal.
In the second of our three-year partnership with the World Economic Forum, BCG is working with a global consortium to explore health systems leapfrogging in greater depth and to develop strategies that can ensure that developing economies are financially sustainable and can deliver high-quality, cost-effective, and accessible care.
Building on the groundwork laid during the first year of the partnership, our latest report focuses on how leapfrogging works and the reasons to be optimistic about its viability as a strategy. Specifically, the last year has provided opportunities to begin testing the initiative’s findings and recommendations in Nigeria and the Republic of South Africa, two emerging economies at different stages of health system development, each with diverse challenges and stakeholders. The results thus far—at the pilot stage—are encouraging.Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol.393, No.1, 101-105, 2010
Up-regulated type I collagen expression by the inhibition of Rac1 signaling pathway in human dermal fibroblasts
Tissue remodeling is known to play important roles in wound healing. Although Rac1 is reported to be one of the key signaling molecules in cutaneous wound healing process, the exact mechanisms of Rac1-mediated tissue remodeling is still unknown. This study investigated the role of Rac1 in the regulation of extracellular matrix in cultured human dermal fibroblasts obtained by skin biopsy from three healthy donors. Protein levels of type I collagen in cultured human fibroblasts were increased by the treatment with Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 in a dose-dependent manner. However, the mRNA levels of alpha 2(I) collagen was not altered by the inhibitor. On the other hand, by the addition of inhibitor, half-lives of type I collagen protein were increased and MMP1 levels were reduced. These data suggest that blockade of Rac1 signaling results in accumulation of type I collagen due to decreased collagenase activity. This study also suggests that controlling Rac1 signaling is a new therapeutic approach to chronic/untreatable ulcer. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Professional tankless water heater installation in Dorchester, WI, providing a wide array of tankless water heater installation services to residential and commercial customers.
Tankless water heater setup is one of the most well-known strategies to increase the comfort and efficiency of your property. However, is it right for you? Tankless water heating can simply using it briefly. That means that even if you only use it a couple of times a year, you're still paying for the electricity used when the central heating system isn't in use. The biggest advantage to tankless water heating is that the unit itself does not need any storage tank. The same as your typical home heating apparatus, it simply.
Along with saving money on energy and costs, tankless water heater setup may also improve air quality in your home. Because the unit heats water only when it's required, it eliminates the need for water tanks that have to be constantly maintained. This means cleaner air in your house, with less asthma attacks because of airborne dust particles.
Besides saving money and saving space, tankless water heaters also lower your impact on the environment. Since they don't save water, there's absolutely no tank overflow or septic tanks to worry about. There are no chemicals used in their production, and no soil to test for pollution. Each of the waste is flushed away into the sewer lines. This is something which conventional water heaters do not supply.
The efficacy of tankless water heater setup is another reason to select them. Because there is no tank to keep or eliminate, you won't see any spikes on your energy-efficient water heater bills. Your monthly utility bills will remain the exact same or decrease slightly, even during peak energy demand. The cause of this is that your unit just heats up to water as it requires at a moment. This saves on space and money, because you may conserve what little space you have by using less water on your components. This also helps keep your water heater units from the way, keeping them from the way of kids and pets.
When you choose a tankless water heater model, you can depend on consistent operation, because the device is not linked to a tank or even a hot water supply. This usually process is very easy, as well. In fact, you can get the unit up and running in just a couple of hours, depending on the size of this system. The tankless heater units are available in many different shapes and sizes, and they're made from vinyl, stainless steel, copper, or aluminum. Many are solar powered, and a few are not. The solar models are the simplest to set up and use, since you don't have to connect them directly to the sunlight. The gas models need an installation company, which means you may not wish to do it all on your own.
Once installed, all you want to do is be sure that your gas or electrical tank is full until you turn it on for the very first time, then you ought to be all set. Your device will draw hot water from either the incoming peak demand of your gas or electric heater, or the storage summit, whichever is accessible. It takes a few minutes to get everything hooked up, and after that, you're going to be prepared to start drinking delicious hot coffee, including cold water, or warming your property.PRESS RELEASE 30/06/21
Plans for the first ever Royal Deeside Motor Show has stepped down a gear as it is forced to move dates following the announcement by The Scottish Government of a three-week delay to easing of lockdown restrictions across Scotland. The Royal Deeside Motor Show was due to take place on 17th and 18th July 2021 at Kincardine Castle and Estate but it has now been moved to 14th and 15th August 2021..
Since its launch in October 2020, the event has captured the attention of many motor enthusiasts both locally and nationally who have signed up to showcase their vehicles throughout the 100,000m2 sprawling estate. Support for the event continues with the Organisers reporting that plans are well advanced to ensure that the event is designed to maximise the space available within the grounds of Kincardine Castle to stage an open-air socially distanced event suitable for all attendees to enjoy some family fun.
Etiom’s Managing Director Gavin Esslemont commented, “Whilst it is disappointing at this stage to move the dates, it is definitely the right thing to do. The vaccine programme continues at an incredible pace and delaying the Royal Deeside Motor Show by four weeks allows the programme to progress to an advanced stage and it gives families across the region a fun and exciting event to enjoy before the kids return to school.”
As the vaccine programme continues to roll out at a pace of knots across Scotland, the Organisers continue to take the lead from the Scottish Government and Aberdeenshire Council to ensure that public safety at events is maintained as number one priority and that the event is promoted as something positive and fun for the area and local economy, whilst supporting the number of charities involved in the event, including, Charlie House, Children 1st, STV Children's Appeal, The Archie Foundation, The Rotary Club of Aboyne and Upper Deeside and The Scottish Men's Shed Association.
Adam Simpson Etiom’s Operations Manager adds, “Our number one priority is public safety and being able to stage an event that people can look forward to as we continue to learn how to live with the current challenges presented by a pandemic. So, we are delighted to have secured such a vast open air space such as the beautiful Kincardine Castle, which is not normally open to the public. Kincardine Castle offers well over 100,000 square metres of open space, as well as an additional 60,000 square metres of onsite parking, that allows us to design the event in a COVID-compliant way, giving us all an opportunity after sixteen months to get out to an event in the fresh air and soak up the beauty of Royal Deeside from the Castle’s vantage point over the valley.”
Organisers will be in touch with all those that have purchased tickets which will automatically be transferred to the new dates. For more information, log on to royaldeesidemotorshow.com.UPVC drainage systems.

After Spyro, Ratchet & Clank, and Resistance, Insomniac wanted to own
Sunset Overdrive became an Xbox One exclusive because Microsoft allowed Insomniac to retain the rights to the game.
Prior to Sunset Overdrive and Fuse, which was a multi-platform game, Insomniac worked exclusively with Sony, where it created hugely popular franchises like Spyro the Dragon, Ratchet & Clank, and Resistance. Though Insomniac was instrumental to their success, it does not own the rights to them.
When Microsoft told Insomniac it could retain the rights to Sunset Overdrive, the companies were on their way to signing a deal.
"We pitched it a few different places, and it was really important to [Insomniac CEO] Ted [Price] that we own the IP, so some of the conversations broke down over that," Sunset Overdrive co-creator Marcus Smith told IGN in an interview. "With Microsoft, they just came in very energetic and excited to work with Insomniac, period."
Last week Insomniac finally released the first gameplay trailer and details for Sunset Overdrive. For more on the game, be sure to read GameSpot's recently published preview and previous coverage.

I have much higher hopes for Rachel’s new movie, “Waiting For Forever,” which also stars Blythe Danner, Richard Jenkins, the adorable Tom Sturridge and “Vampire Diaries'” Matt Davis.
Matt describes his character Aaron as “the crazy boyfriend,” adding that on a scale of 1 – 10, Aaron’s insanity peaks at “an 11.”
Here’s hoping that the film is also turns it up to 11.Description

Star Wars hasn’t been doing so great since the Sequels movies came out, and made a mess of things.
Many of fans, including myself, would agree that the only thing that’s saving the franchise now is the enigmatic Mando and the adorable child Baby Yoda.
Which is why it shouldn’t be that surprising; that as a casual toy collector, I had to get a figure of Mando and the child for my collection from the Mafex line. But I made the mistake of thinking that it was the end of my spending journey.
The Mandalorian ship is something I didn’t plan for…
Over the weekend, Hasbro PulseCon 2020 took place and revealed some fascinating toy stuff, and somehow I believed I would be safe from the temptations of pre-ordering something from it, so I didn’t watch it.
I don’t usually buy much from Hasbro except for the occasionally unique Star Wars Black Series figures like Revan or Kanan Jarrus, to name a few. However, Sal is a massive Transformer fan, so he was up all night watching the reveals as I slept peacefully. Until I received a link to a page and message stating, ‘Oh you’re soooooooo screwed’, early in the next morning.
The link directed me to Hasbro’s HasLab, and I saw the crowdfunding campaign for the Razor Crest, the ship from The Mandalorian series, which costs $350 in US dollars! I knew I wanted it immediately, but I also knew that it was an insane amount of money for a plastic toy! So in the hopes of deterring myself from buying it, I proceeded to read the specifications of the ship to find something to nitpick and convince myself to say no to myself. That was a big mistake.
The stunning Razor Crest.
The more I read the specifications, the more I knew I had to get it. The ship itself is 30 inches long with the main cannons, 20 inches wide, and 10.5 inches tall while it’s sitting on the landing gear. Compared to the X-Men Legends Sentinel from HasLab, the Razor Crest is much longer than the Sentinel height! And on a side note, Sal, believe it or not, ordered two of those Sentinel figures for his collection!
The Mandalorian ship is highly detailed and is capable of opening up in many ways. It comes with additional parts that allow you to recreate almost any scenes from the series and it also comes with a 3.75-inch The Mandalorian Figure in Beskar armour, that fits perfectly into the ship.
The crowdfunding campaign of the Razor Crest required 6000 backers to kick start it with a deadline of 40 days plus to go. However, to no one’s surprise, the campaign was fully funded by the end of the first day itself and is currently backed by 7000 plus people and still growing.
Seeing that HasLab is probably never going to be doing something like this ever again and that it’s going to be a one-time exclusive product of the Razor Crest, I have to get my hands on it one way or another. If nothing else, it will be an excellent investment down the line even though it’s going to blow a hole in my bank account. It’s time to make some shelf space at home for this massive ship.
You can put in your order for the Razor Crest directly at Hasbro Pulse or through BBTS, however, shipping the product to Singapore is going to be a killer. So it would be wiser to wait and see if any of the local toy stores are taking orders for it.ceramic weight for tubehigh temp ceramic tubes

Evaluating Weather Impact on Sensor Performance by Combining Ansys Solutions
CFD simulations of vehicles in rainy conditions were performed using Ansys Fluent. Rain drop data was exported to Ansys SPEOS for camera and lidar simulations. SPEOS results were analyzed with an open-source perception algorithm software to determine bounding boxes and confidence levels in identifying various objects on the road.
Coupled CFD-Optical solution can be extended to other conditions including fog, snow, ice and dirt under day and night-time lighting. This coupling of solutions enables engineers to address the challenges posed by weather conditions by developing end-to-end weather-aware solutions, including designing of sensors, optimizing their performance, strategically placing sensors on a vehicle, designing a sensor cleaning system, and developing and testing perception algorithms.How do I store leftover turkey?

The England legend inexplicably picked out Ebere Eze with a 75th-minute crossfield ball. That sent the Hoops’ dangerman racing into the box to tee-up sub llias Chair to finish.
Rangers had taken the lead through Grant Hall on 34 minutes after Eze, Johan Barbet and Dominic Ball had all failed to test the keeper with shots.
Skipper Hall show them how it was done when he smacked the ball in off the bar from 16 yards after Matthew Clarke shinned Ryan Manning’s cross.
Derby’s Martyn Waghorn had volleyed over a cross that was begging to be finished. But he made no mistake with his head when he glanced in Max Bird’s 43rd-minute corner.
But the hosts were a threat on the break in the second half, with keeper Ben Hamer pushing out Marc Pugh’s 64th-minute volley at his near post. And Rooney was left red- faced when he set up Chair’s winner to cries of ‘Rooney, Rooney’ from the home fans.
Daily Mail
London has been a miserable place for Derby to visit this season and an error from captain Wayne Rooney compounded their travel sickness against Queens Park Rangers.
Derby had lost all three of their league games in the capital before Tuesday's match. When they fell behind to a sumptuous strike from Grant Hall in the 34th minute - the QPR captain crashing a shot in off the crossbar - it looked destined to become four.
Yet Rooney, never far from the action, created a Derby equaliser just nine minutes later when Martyn Waghorn headed in his corner. It is the sixth goal Rooney has been involved in - three strikes himself and now three assists - since his debut in January.
But in a cruel twist of fate, he then had a hand in QPR's winner.
The Rams captain misplaced a pass in his own half in the 75th minute and Ebere Eze pounced, collecting the ball and driving forward before picking out substitute Ilias Chair. Chair had only been on the pitch for two minutes but it didn't show. He ruthlessly buried his shot past Ben Hamer to snatch the three points for QPR.
After the initial jubilation, taunts of 'Rooney' echoed out around the stadium from the home supporters.
BBC Sport
Ilias Chair scored seconds after coming off the bench to earn Queens Park Rangers victory over Derby County at Loftus Road.
Both sides are anchored in mid-table but victory saw QPR leapfrog their opponents into the top half although both side's play-off hopes are slim.
Grant Hall gave the hosts a first-half lead with a splendid half-volley, only for Martyn Waghorn to head home the equaliser two minutes before the break.
But, less than two minutes after being sent on by Rangers boss Mark Warburton, Chair was found by Eberechi Eze and he lashed in the winner with his right boot.
Victory continued QPR's improved form having now earned eight points in their past four games, after losing their previous three, to steer them well clear of a relegation battle.
Derby's away form has been the reason they have not mounted a more serious play-off challenge, boasting the second-best home record in the Championship but the third-worst form on the road. This was their their 10th away defeat of the
Ilias Chair capitalised after a mistake by Wayne Rooney to score QPR's winner in a 2-1 victory over Derby.
Martyn Waghorn had hauled the Rams level after Grant Hall put Rangers ahead, but Chair's emphatic finish restored the home side's lead.
Chair, just on as a substitute, netted with 15 minutes remaining at the Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium.
Rooney's attempted cross-field ball was intercepted by Ebere Eze, who cut in from the left and fed Chair with a clever pass.
The young midfielder did the rest, controlling the ball with an excellent first touch and then firing past keeper Ben Hamer.
Hall opened the scoring with a cracking strike 11 minutes before half-time.
Matt Clarke failed to deal with Geoff Cameron's ball into the box and it ricocheted off him towards Rangers captain Hall, who blasted in off the underside of the bar from 20 yards.
Derby had created the better chances and Waghorn should have put them ahead but volleyed over from close range after being found by Max Lowe's left-wing cross.
Clarke also volleyed over, in his case after being found unmarked by Rooney's corner, and Ryan Manning almost scored an own goal when he cut out Rooney's pass to Lowe and inadvertently diverted the ball just over the bar.
Rangers did threaten at times before going ahead - Jordan Hugill had an effort saved by Hamer following great work by Bright Osayi-Samuel, before Yoann Barbet went close with a free-kick.
Hamer was well beaten by Hall's thunderbolt but Waghorn atoned for his earlier miss by equalising with a header from Max Bird's left wing corner a couple of minutes before half-time.
Hamer produced a fine save just after the hour mark when he kept out Marc Pugh's first-time shot following a deep cross from the right by Todd Kane.
The Derby stopper could not rescue his team after Rooney's costly error but did prevent a second Chair goal by keeping out his near-post header from Manning's cross, while R's keeper Liam Kelly did superbly to save Waghorn's late header.
QPR are now unbeaten in four matches and the win took them above Derby in the Sky Bet Championship table.
The defeat continued Derby's poor away form. They have won just twice on the road this season - only strugglers Luton and Barnsley have picked up fewer points away from home this season.

Goals from Grant Hall and Ilias Chair helped Rangers to a 2-1 Sky Bet Championship victory over Derby County at the Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium.
Hall got the ball rolling for the R’s – who extended their recent unbeaten run to four matches – with a 34th-minute blockbuster, before the Rams levelled matters heading into half-time through Martyn Waghorn (43).
It was QPR who would ultimately prevail, though, as sub Ilias Chair struck just two minutes after his arrival in the 75th minute to move the hosts up to 12th in the league table. for 3.13.6

Hey!
It was a short week for me since I had a three day weekend. 😀 I haven’t read as much as I would like this week, but I am kind of taking a little break from reading and the pressure of trying to read a ton of books. So I read when I want to and not force it and it’s a nice thing! The plus side, the books that I have been reading this month have all been so good so far and that’s a plus. Last month I read a ton of 3 stars or lower and that I didn’t quite enjoy much. So this is a nice change from that.
Aside from not reading a ton, I did add a ton of books to my Goodreads TBR shelves over the last couple of weeks. You can see more of my TBR list over on my Goodreads account over here and feel free to add me as a friend!
With Malice by Eileen Cook
The Twelve Days of Dash & Lily by Rachel Cohn, David Levithan
Kids of Appetite by David Arnold
Before We Go Extinct by Karen Rivers
Boy Robot by Simon Curtis
A NEW DASH & LILY BOOK! I am beyond stoked for this! All of these others sound so good and I can’t wait to get my hands on them.
Riverkeep by Martin Stewart

Awesome! I hope you find some that you’ll want to read! 🙂
so excited for Boy Robot & Kids of Appetite! Have you read Mosquitoland by David Arnold? 🙂
I did read Mosquitoland last year and I had a lot of mixed feelings about it. I didn’t hate it, but I didn’t love it.
I loved With Malice. I got to read an ARC and it was a very entertaining read in the Memory Loss fiction category.
I just read With Malice as well! Really enjoyed it.
I really liked the way she presented the two sides.
I’ve been seeing a lot of good things about With Malice! I hope I like it too.
It’s a really cool and really interestingly presented thriller.
I really enjoyed With Malice, I hope you also enjoy it. I haven’t heard of the others but they sure sound interesting. Happy Reading 🙂
Here is my FF
I’ve been seeing a lot of good things about With Malice. Crossing my fingers I like it too!
I want to get Riverkeep as well. I read a review of it in Shelf Awareness yesterday and it piqued my interest.
Riverkeep sounds like it’s going to be awesome!

But, as of this year, I’ve reached new sales records, selling about $7,000 worth of crickets per month, which has lined my pockets with roughly $1,200 per month in profit.
And although my friends don’t like to discuss it, I fully embrace it – knowing that every shipped cricket is pushing me closer to my dream of financial freedom.
Pursuing Something You’re Not Passionate About
2 years ago when I began selling crickets, I broke the cardinal rule of side hustling: I pursued something I wasn’t passionate about. Not only was I not passionate about crickets, but I didn’t have any interest in their benefactors either: reptiles and amphibians.
But one thing that does grab my attention is making money online. And that’s because it’s a relatively passive way to make extra income from anywhere that internet access is available. Best of all, nearly any topic, any sub category, and any product has the potential to generate income!
I’ve discovered 4 basic steps to earning money online:
- Pick a popular topic with little competition
- Get some graphics (logo, product images, etc)
- Build a website
- Engage in a life-long battle of internet marketing
There are a lot of details missing from this list, however this is the basic foundation.
[EDITOR’S NOTE: I’ll also add that it depends on what *type* of business you’re trying to grow online, as while the above may be true for selling physical products, it can differ wildly if, say, we’re talking about growing a blog or service-oriented businesses/etc. Being passionate at what you do would greatly improve your odds of success whether there’s a little or a lot of competition ;)]
But Why Crickets?
Because it’s a popular topic with little competition!
This isn’t my first online rodeo, and I can attest that making money online has 2 important requirements: a topic and an audience. And when hunting for that topic, it’s critical that there is very little competition. But it’s just as critical that the topic has an active audience as well.
Now the tricky thing is that everyone else knows this online too, so finding the perfect topic or product will require hours and hours and hours of research.
Before landing on crickets I started researching binoculars, and then moved to thermal scopes. I then dove right into the meat thermometer industry, and even considered women’s shoes! But after months of investigating, it became obvious that there was no better choice than live crickets.
Getting a Site Online
This requires 2 main things: Scoring some graphics and building a website.
#1 Scoring some graphics
Logos aren’t necessary, but they can be an inexpensive investment if trying to build a solid brand – particularly if there are competitors as it will help distinguish your product or service from the others.
I ended up using Upwork for this, and it only cost me $125.
Unlike logos, however, product images are necessary. When I started soliciting partnerships with cricket ranchers, I always requested that they send over pictures of their products (crickets) in order to score some great – free! – pictures for the site. And while most were pretty responsive to this, a few did think it was “odd behaviour.”
If you find a supplier being over-protective of their merchandise, however, there are plenty of free stock image sites that offer high resolution photos.
[EDITOR’S NOTE: A lot of us bloggers use Unsplash.com too – although it is hard to find specific pictures of stuff sometimes – say, like cricket farms ;)]
#2. Building a Website
Once the pictures were secured, it was time to slap them onto a website. Now I have zero programming or computer science skills, which is what makes living in 2018 so wonderful. Website platform companies have streamlined the site building process so well that any cricket-pursuing nitwit can put together a clean, professional looking website. And there’s YouTube for any tutorials as well.
But because I was attempting to launch an e-commerce store, I needed help building a merchant website. And Shopify has proven to be an excellent solution, with great customer support. I picked out a theme, selected some fonts and colors, then stitched them all together and in a matter of hours I had a respectable website – fully loaded with product images of live crickets, and even a company logo.
But Shopify’s service isn’t free. So if you’re looking to take baby steps into an e-commerce venture, expect to fork out a minimum of $30 per month. There’s also less expensive options, such as using WordPress – a popular blog platform – as well as Weebly and Wix if you’re willing to get your hands dirty. All great platforms that have streamlined the creation process for those just starting out.
Engaging in The Life-Long Battle of Internet Marketing
Once the website was built, it was time to push this puppy in front of the masses.
There are 2 basic internet marketing strategies: paid ads and search engine optimization (SEO). Paid ads will instantly position your website in front of interested buyers. But for a recurring fee.
Alternatively, SEO doesn’t have to cost anything (unless you hire someone to do it), but it’s a daily grind that requires non-stop focus. And it can take months, or even years, to start pulling in the free traffic.
As a boot strapped side hustler, I was committed to keeping my costs as low as possible, so I skipped the paid ads and went straight for the SEO side of things. Which meant hours of optimizing the website, coming up with excellent content, and then going out and finding ways to get that excellent content shared on social media platforms and other websites – such as this one!
I hit the books studying as much as I could about crickets. I needed to make informative articles on caring for crickets, feeding crickets, the nutritional benefits of crickets, how to store crickets, how often to feed crickets, what to feed crickets, how to water crickets, how not to drown crickets, how to gut-load crickets, how to breed crickets, and many other long-winded, yawn-inducing articles on the “fascinating” world of being a live feeder.
And it was a grind.
I watched YouTube videos, interviewed cricket ranchers, stalked pet stores, picked through reptile forums, all for the sake of becoming the most well-versed cricket supplier online. I was committed and obsessed, and would blurt out random facts to my wife:
- “Hey honey, did you know that female crickets deposit eggs through an ovipositor?”
- “Did you know that male crickets will become cannibals if their habitats become too populated?”
- “A bearded dragon will eat about 50 crickets every day. Wow!”
And during this time is when my wife began avoiding me. It has since become an unspoken rule to not discuss my pursuit of crickets in the house :-)
My First Year of Cricket Selling (2016)
My first year at it was pretty rough, accurately reflecting the slow grind that is search engine optimization.
So I started reaching out to other reptile bloggers and forums, looking to build mutually beneficial relationships with each other. I also solicited advice and information on pet reptile care so I could make my site much more informative and helpful to the interested buyer.
By the end of the year I managed to scrounge up a measly $2,000 in sales, netting me a profit of about $150.
Year Two of Cricket Selling (2017)
In my 2nd year, I pursued the same routine, but unfortunately with less focus. My spare time was limited outside of work and family, so I had to dial back my cricket pursuit which transformed everything into an awkward mess.
My social appearances became robotic with scripted interactions, because all I could think about were crickets. My daytime job also became harder, because all I wanted to do was push the website further into the world wild web!
But for the small amount of time I did put into it, I still made a few connections and relationships. I composed long-tailed articles with hopes of attracting bloggers to share my content, and even though I had a distracted back-burner approach, I was able to triple my sales for the year netting me about $600 in the end.
Year Three of Cricket Selling (2018)
Earlier this year my wife gave birth to our third child. Couple that with upgrading to a bigger house and mortgage, and I was ready to slap myself out of this passive mentality and really see how far I could push this thing.
I spent more time searching low competition keywords that yielded high search results. I spent more time and money on composing long-form articles, as well as hiring writers from Upwork to compose long-form articles for me (don’t worry, I wrote this one myself!). And I also spent more time on my social media pages, slowly building a budding community of passionate pet owners who like to discuss and share care-taking techniques for their beloved pets.
I also started subscribing to a service called HARO (Help a Reporter Out) where I receive inquiries from online journalists 3x a day who are looking for comments and insight from various experts. I made it a personal goal to reply to a minimum of at least 2 inquiries every day, even though I may not be the best out there. This has helped greatly to get my name and cricket-slinging story out into the wild.
I’m also proud to say that the SEO work has finally started paying off. Once Google started crawling all of those long form articles on my site as well as others’, I began seeing a major boost in search engine rankings, which has helped me earn more than $33,000 in sales so far this year.
So now, my after-work, after kids-go-to-bed, start-the-day-at-4AM hours include more than just soliciting partnerships and composing content. I now have to send out nearly 100 orders per week, and also have to provide customer service!
So I can confirm that side hustlers never sleep.
To Sum It Up…
Earning money online isn’t easy, but it’s not impossible. From my experience, finding a topic and sticking with that topic for a few years can really pay off down the road. So although SEO is a grind, fighting through it can reap many rewards as long as that foundation is properly built with a popular topic and low competition.
Now who needs some crickets??!

Very clever- but very gross!
Fascinating… so he does the growing as well as the shipping? That poor family… I had a leopard gecko for a few years in college. You’d randomly find crickets in the shower, on the ceiling, in the closets… those little buggers can jump! Good for him, but not worth the money to have all those gross critters in my house. Though if I ever get back into reptiles, now I know where to go for their food supply :) Thanks for sharing your story.
The kids love them and have unsuccessfully tried naming them all. Thankfully, they’re being procured in a detached garage, which is about 20 yards away. Not sure i’d be willing to grow them in the house, and i know for a FACT that my wife wouldn’t be willing to grow them in the house. Any cricket found in the house would be grounds for termination. So I’m treading lightly…
Haha.. my kids would try the same thing naming them all :)
Awesome story! I am grateful dogs have dried food!.
You mention you like to bootstrap as much as you can (which I can completely relate to). However, do you think outsourcing or paying for services would have gotten you to your current profit levels faster?
“do you think outsourcing or paying for services would have gotten you to your current profit levels faster?”
Hmm… I don’t think so. I’ve outsourced SEO work before, and have never received the results I was hoping for. That might be because I was typically hiring low bidders off Upwork. But I can get pretty aggressive, and have spent hours hunting content writers off LinkedIn. I would then email them (or call if they have a number), and discuss possible articles about my hustle. It’s pretty belligerent, but it’s netted pretty good results. And I don’t believe I’d ever be able to hire an SEO person that would be willing to go to that level.
Wow, great job growing your side hustle this year. That’s a huge jump from 2017 on a mature business.
Why do people think crickets are gross? They not like a cockroach or anything.
Nice job.
Thanks. I’ve created a monster, but I’m trying to push this thing even further. Right now, I’m reading “The Everything Store” to really see how a madman operates.
I’m not sure why they’re considered gross. They’re actually trending right now as a source for human food!
Are you going to start a spinoff site targeted at humans? :)
I wouldn’t consider them gross, though I wouldn’t eat them either. More like annoyingly noisy if they get into your home. Use to have that issue with an apartment and it would drive me nuts.
Interesting side hustle though.
Interesting!!!! i grow meal worms for my chickens just to save on money. Hey, i could possibly sell them also as a side hustle lol!!
Ps, ive read your blog for a while and love all the tips. I’ve been saving extra and contributing more to 401k since following!
Rock on!!! So glad to hear!
First off, congrats to Jeff on the new baby and new home!
I admire the persistence and entrepreneurial spirit here but I gotta say, it kinda made me a bit ill. Then, to scroll down and see him attempting to eat the cricket was enough for me. But I made the next mistake about reading the verbiage below his picture about super worms and larvae and that was all I could handle. I now need to try to erase my mind……
No guts, no glory!
That’s hilarious, never would have thought of raising crickets. I’ve heard crickets are super healthy too, wouldn’t mind trying them if there were a restaurant that served it.
I haven’t tried them either. And they do offer some intriguing health benefits. So I wouldn’t mind seeing if they can provide both health and wealth into my household.
Awesome story. Also, just looking on your website the professionalism shines through. Very good prices (man, if only you were around our ends 10+ years back :) – have never seen flat package prices) and guaranteed live delivery, I am amazed. Please don’t be offended, but I have to state that I kind of hate these sneaky little bastards. You have all my respect that you can handle them as you do. As a former tarantula breeder, bought huge amounts of them. They are noisy and their cooperation levels are very low when you want to feed them to spiders (however I cannot blame them, would do the same in their place). They are great from a nutrition perspective though. In the end, we replaced them with superworms for the smaller spiders and cockroaches for the medium-sized ones, those are much easier to handle. So kudos to you, this is a business I would not like to do because I know exactly how much time and effort does it require. It would drive me insane. :)
Thanks for the compliments. I’ve been reading up on Sam Walton and Jeff Bezos, and figured a $20 flat rate price was not only a great price, but simplified the decision process for the buyer.
I noticed that too right away – thought it was brilliant! And I bet people still pick the lower ones even if it’s not *as good* a bargain so they don’t waste crickets (am I right?).
Bingo. If the caretakers have a younger pet, then it makes more sense for them to select the 500 or 250 count of crickets, because a younger pet won’t intake as much as a mature pet. J.Money, sound like you have some experience in the art of product pricing?
Question for The Critter Depot. Your avg sale was about 26$ the first year and then 43$ the second year. It is now up to 73$ per sale. That is really impressive and amazing
As a fellow small ecommerce business owner Could you share insight how this is achievable with your products only being in the low 20$ range?

JACK
Jack goes to a small town in Arizona where a local militant group has taken over, harassing honest business owners in an attempt to run them out of town. Jack is pulled into a war between the right and the righteous, caught up in a world that is as foreign to him as a distant county. Among it all, he meets Ruth, an angel who makes him rethink the direction of his life. At the end, he's faced with a choice: the stubborn woman who dominated his past, or the pious woman who could fulfill his dreams of the future.
CRISPIN
I lost my wife five years ago. I left my job three months ago. My life has never been in such a state of flux. I'd always known what to do and how to do it. But now, it seemed like fate or the universe or whatever was determined to push me down a road I couldn't control. And her name was Alli. A wildcat like no one I'd ever known before, she was almost more than I could handle. Therefore, when I learned we'd be stuck in a car together for three days, I was not exactly thrilled. She had this way of plowing through life, knocking people out of her way whenever they got too close. But she found her match when she came up against me. I wasn't going anywhere, even if it meant risking everything, including my heart.
PATRICK
No one knew who he was and that was a source of pride to him for a long time. But those secrets were growing heavy, almost too heavy to carry on his own. Patrick Shaughnessy loved his work at Stone Security, but he was wondering if it wasn't time to move on, to find a way to unburden himself from his past. But then this woman bursts into his life, a victim of a vicious attack that is too reminiscent of a time of darkness in his past that he's been running from for more than a decade. He offers this woman sanctuary, doing for her what he might have wanted for his sister or for the woman he loved. But when he catches her in a lie, can he continue to protect her and face the possibility of his carefully hidden past unraveling around them, or will he run?
QUENTIN
They foreclosed on his family's ranch while he was away fighting a war on terror. He brought the fight home with him, turning the life of the man who served the papers, the man who broke promises and stole from his family, upside down. He promised he'd take everything away from this bank manager and he was very close to fulfilling that promise. But then she walked into his life and turned it upside down. Can Quentin Forrester save his family from the shame and poverty that losing their livelihood dropped on them with a distraction as complete as Malaika Gray? Can he be cynical and still feel hope? Can he save them both from a shared enemy?
MATTHEW
Matthew Pearce was a member of the Guardians, the militant religious group responsible for the death of Harry Cravits. He hadn't been able to save Harry, but he did what he could to help Jack Stone put his killer in jail. But that guilt never went away, wouldn't until he could stop the Guardians from the darkness they were spewing on his hometown. He has to go back, has to take up arms with the Guardians again in order to take them down from the inside. But why does she have to pick this moment to come home? Whit Ellington is the girl of Matthew's dream, but she is also a reporter threatening to spill everyone's secrets. Can he protect her and take down the Guardians?Ath.

Coherent Navigation apparently focuses on High Integrity GPS or iGPS, this technology is so accurate it can apparently provide a location within a few centimeters.
According to MacRumors the team from the company joined Apple back in January and the company’s CEO is now listed as working within the Apple Maps team at Apple.
Apple have been working to improve their Apple Maps software since they launched the software on the iPhone and iPad and replaced Google Maps as the standard mapping software on iOS.

Before you can move in, there are 3 payments that have to be received by UWE Houses; these are your holding deposit, tenancy deposit and your rent.
PAY YOUR HOLDING DEPOSIT
Once you have viewed a house and decided that you definitely want to live in it, you will need to let us know by completing an application form. For a group of six, we will need to receive 6 individual applications from each tenant.
We will then review all applications and if successful, you will be invited by UWE Houses to secure your application by paying a £100 holding deposit per person. Payment details will be given to you and you should only pay this once you’ve been invited by UWE Houses.
Once your application and the £100 holding deposit has been received, the room will be reserved for you and we will take it off the market and no further viewings will take place.
Refund Policy
The holding deposit of £100 is refundable upon completion of all paperwork within our specified time frame.
If tenants decide they no longer want the property, the holding deposit is returned to the landlord..
PAY YOUR TENANCY DEPOSIT
Tenancy deposit: This is £300 per Occupant to cover any damage to the room and communal areas and any additional cleaning at the end of the tenancy. We conduct an inventory when you first take the room (check-in) and also when you move out (check-out) so that the condition at both points in the tenancy is accurately recorded.
We will protect your deposit with ‘My Deposits’, which is a government Tenancy Deposit Scheme (TDS). Your holding deposit of £50 is returned upon successful completion of reference checks and supplying all the information listed above.
The holding deposit does not contribute to your tenancy deposit so a further £300 payment will have to be made to cover this. Payments for the tenancy deposit will be made to the same account as the holding deposit.
Refund Policy
Your Tenancy Deposit is fully refundable at the end of the contract, less any deductions as outlined in the contract.
In the case where the tenant requests that they are replaced by another tenant, either before the start of the contract, or during the contract, there will be deductions from the tenancy deposit to cover the administrative costs of arranging a replacement tenant and re-letting the room.
For more information on deposits, please click here.
PAY YOUR RENT
At the start of your tenancy, we ask our tenants to set up a Standing Order Mandate (SOM), which is an instruction from you to your bank to send us a regular rental payment on the 1st of each month. Please check that a SOM hasn’t already been set up before making a one-off payment, otherwise you may end up paying twice.
When setting up the SOM, make sure you have chosen the correct property reference code and room number i.e. 7 Vas 2 (7 Vassall Court, Room 2), otherwise you could end up paying somebody else's rent for them!
If you have to make a one-off rental payment, the easiest way is to use your internet banking service. You should already have our bank details (which is same account used for the holding deposit and tenancy deposit); however, if you can’t find the correct account details, please call the office on 0117 911 8282 or email us on so that we can provide them for you.
Refund Policy
If an over payment is made, this will be refunded as soon as administratively possible.
OTHER PAYMENTS - PAY FOR ANYTHING ELSE
Please contact the office on 0117 911 8282 or email us on if you have to make a one-off payment for anything other than your holding deposit, tenancy deposit or rent. We can then provide you with the correct account details.We are owned and operated by a team of passionate people located in the United States, we thoroughly love what we do and we aim to provide our customers with the highest quality at the best prices!

These adorable burlap-covered centerpieces are perfect for a cute little backyard farm-themed, ranch-themed, or western-themed party. I went a little nuts with making decorations for my daughter’s 2nd birthday party, and these centerpieces were part of that mania! At the time of her 2nd birthday, I had recently published my first children’s book, The Adventures of Pootsey the Wonderbug; I really wanted to do a Pootsey-themed party for her, so I made her party a western-themed Pootsey party based on one of the little stories in my book.
These centerpieces were so easy and inexpensive to make, and they added some fun festiveness to the tables. All I did was cover some large coffee cans with burlap and ribbon, and then I bought those cute farm animal wooden pieces and glued them to sticks to add a little more charm.
One bouquet of Baby’s Breath from HEB (my favorite grocery store) for $4 was enough to fill 3 of these large centerpieces.
Here’s the type of coffee can I used to make these:
And then because the coffee can wasn’t exactly waterproof, I used empty cottage cheese & Greek yogurt containers to hold the water and the baby’s breath, and then just set them right inside the coffee can.
Here’s what you need to make these cute centerpieces:
- A coffee can
- Burlap fabric (Hobby Lobby has all sorts of colors of burlap to choose from)
- Burlap ribbon
- An accent color ribbon (I used turquoise)
- Bandana-print ribbon
- Hot glue gun
- Scissors
- Some kind of plastic container to hold the flowers & water inside the coffee can (unless you use a tin coffee can, and then you don’t need to use an additional container to place inside)
Optional:
- Wooden farm animal pieces (I got all of these at Hobby Lobby – they were about .70 each. Can’t beat that!)
- Wooden skewers/sticks for gluing the animals
Side note: Before I show you how I made the centerpieces, I also wanted to show you that I did the exact same thing with smaller tin cans that held utensils, straws, etc. except I didn’t use the burlap fabric on these. They’re so cute!!
Ok, let’s get started with the large centerpieces! First, layout some burlap fabric and measure how much you need to go around the can.
Cut the fabric so that it’ll span the can up and down and all the way around.
I frayed the ends of the burlap (the ends that would show at the top and bottom of the can) by taking out 1-2 strands of burlap from each end. You can kind of tell in this photo:
After you’ve cut and lightly frayed your burlap, put a line of hot glue down the coffee can.
Press on one end of the burlap fabric.
Wrap the burlap fabric all the way around the can and secure it with another line of hot glue all the way down the can.
Just like you measured the burlap fabric, measure the ribbon to go all the way around the can.
You glue the ribbon the same way – just in the one spot. A line of glue on the can (just enough to cover the ribbon from top to bottom), wrap the ribbon around, and secure the end with another line of glue. Repeat until you’ve got all of your ribbon on there.
I folded the ribbon under and then glued it so you didn’t see the cut & frayed end of the ribbon. I think it looks a little neater to do it this way.
Then if you’re going to use those cute wooden pieces, hot glue them to wooden skewers and then set them in the centerpieces.
So adorable!
Here they are on the tables, just waiting for guests to fill them up with food and conversation!

If your insurance covers orthodontic treatment, you will receive the benefit of reduced personal costs.
Orthodontic benefits differ from regular dental coverage. Insurance policies vary and some may have life-time maximum orthodontic benefits and/or age limits. Once we determine your orthodontic coverage and treatment has started, we will file your claim.
Will my insurance company pay the complete benefit up front?
Normally, your insurance company will pay a portion of your down payment, and will pay the balance of your benefit over the course of treatment. Most insurance companies pay monthly, although, there are some that pay quarterly, semi-annually or annually.
If I obtain insurance after orthodontic treatment has begun, will the insurance company pay any benefits?
If you are already in treatment, most insurance companies will not cover your treatment since this is considered “treatment in progress”. Exceptions may be made, particularly for group coverage.
How does having two or three orthodontic insurances work?
Whenever more than one insurance company covers you, “coordination of benefits” will dictates how the insurance works between the insurance companies. Most primary insurance companies are determined using the insured’s birthday month, however, there are other determining factors.
What should I do if my benefits change?
If your benefits change during the course of treatment, please inform our staff as quickly as possible with your new insurance information. This is to help ensure you will not have a loss of benefit, or lack of payment.
Please remember that orthodontic insurance is a benefit. We can only estimate your coverage in good faith, but cannot guarantee coverage due to the complexities of insurance contracts. Any amount not covered by insurance is your financial responsibility.RIGA, Latvia, 29-Dec-2020 — /EPR HEALTHCARE NEWS/ — German Charite Medical Center once again is in the limelight of international attention:. In 2014 Kernes was attacked during an assassination attempt and since then had to be moving around in a wheelchair.
Founded in the early 18th century, the Charité Medical Center is considered one of the best in Germany. However, into political issues and related statements make the clinic’s reputation highly controversial.
As a result, a number of Russian and Ukrainian media outlets now say that Gennady Kernes, who maintained close contacts with Moscow, could have been intentionally mistreated, adding suspicion to his sudden death. The cases of Yushenko, Navalny, Timoshenko, Verzilov, Kernes and other ones that are actively used at the political and geopolitical arena, make more and more experts and civil activists demand transparency and information disclosure, including medical history, regarding the patients whose health and diagnosis can affect the lives of millions.

Sharing Summer Camp Resources for 2021
Well, summer is nearly upon us. With the close of the school year, refreshing swims and warm summer nights are all within reach. What better way for your child to create a memorable summer than attending a summer camp? They can be beneficial for any child and are great for social development, memory-making, and creating lifelong friends. Finding the perfect summer camp/program for your child can be a difficult task; and that’s true for any parent. Even though many options are inactive due to the pandemic, there are still some fantastic programs and camps that are in full swing. Make your child’s summer one to remember.
First and foremost, know that your child may attend ANY program or camp that is open to sighted children. However, you may have concerns about leaving your child who has a unique need like a visual impairment at camp. For example, you might wonder if the staff are qualified to work with children of varying abilities. If you’re concerned, it could be highly beneficial to reach out to the camp. You can ask if the camp is able to make any accommodations to ensure your child’s enjoyment of the program. An increasing number of programs are becoming accessible, so you might be surprised at the answer you get!
Disability-Specific Summer Programs
You do have the option of seeking out a more personalized experience that specifically meets the needs of a child with a visual impairment. Thankfully, we have some great recommendations that you might find helpful! These camps are fully accessible for children with visual disabilities.
First, a great option to consider might be National Camps For Blind Children. These camps take place in several locations. They strive to give campers the traditional summer camp “experience”. Activities like modified archery, trips to waterparks, and beeper kickball are just a few of the fun experiences your child can enjoy!
Additionally, The Lions Club has dedicated its program to assist people with visual impairments and there are many sponsored summer programs across the country. You can search for a club near you through their site and see what programs/events your child might enjoy.
For a more sport-oriented program, a great route is TOPSoccer. This national program is hosted by soccer clubs dedicated to working with children who have disabilities. The organization strives to give aspiring soccer players the essential skills they need while developing them in a fun and all-inclusive environment. They also utilize a buddy/partner system. Check out the US Youth Soccer website where you can search for soccer clubs by state to see if a club near you has a TOPSoccer program.
An Inclusive Summer Ahead
Attending a summer camp can be one of the most memorable childhood adventures of a person’s life. It might seem difficult to find the perfect camp for your child, but options are plentiful thanks to increasingly widespread inclusion. We hope you find the perfect fit for your child this summer so that they can take this experience with them through life. We’ve provided you today with just a few examples of the many inclusive summer camps. As you find more that you think children would benefit from, let us know and we will add them!
Braille Works wishes you all a blessed, safe, and fun summer!

Each year, the Grand View Auxiliary Golf Tournament, typically held in early August, brings together organizations, community leaders, businesses, physicians and the leadership of Grand View Health, to raise funds to supporting growth of new facilities and health initiatives. As many as 164 golfers compete in a four-person scramble at the 18-hole course at Indian Valley Country Club. Players also enjoy a sumptuous gourmet meal prepared by the club’s chef. New sponsors are always welcome and invitations to both sponsor a hole or participate in the event are sent by the Auxiliary each year in early spring.
In 2021, the champion of the event was former Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Tommy Greene, from the 1993 World Series team, along with Howard Eisenbrock, MD, William Evans and Dave Gorman. The event successfully raised more than $100,000 and broke all previous records for funds raised by the tournament.
The event also marked the kick-off of the Auxiliary’s Car Raffle fundraiser. The Grand View Auxiliary is selling $100 raffle tickets for a chance to win $30,000 towards any car or truck at any Bergey’s dealership. A winner can also elect to choose a cash option for the prize of $25,000. Only 650 tickets will be sold. For more information, visit.
Many thanks to our title sponsors Sodexo and Univest, along with 80 other loyal sponsors. The “Martha Otto Putting Contest” sponsored by MRA Group was dedicated this year in honor of Martha’s efforts over the years, functioning as the Chair of the Auxiliary Golf Tournament. Players had the opportunity to sink a hole-in-one putt for a chance to win autographed sports memorabilia.
Proceeds of the Grand View Auxiliary Golf Tournament in 2021 will become part of the Auxiliary’s annual gift to support the 190,000-square-foot addition to the main hospital building. The new building will feature all private patient rooms, new operating rooms and a trauma-ready emergency department.

I filed for unemployment insurance on Monday, April 6. On Thursday, April 9, I received a notice that I was scheduled for a telephone fact-finding interview to determine if I was, in fact, eligible for unemployment benefits and that interview would be on June 8.
Two months. No benefits. In the middle of a pandemic.
I’ve tried calling several times to see what’s going on, but I haven’t even been able to get into the phone queue to get put on hold. I just get a message saying that the lines are full and to call back later. And for the record, I am sure that everyone working at the Maine Department of Labor is doing their absolute best right now.
Now, I’m one of the very lucky ones. I can survive for a few months without the unemployment insurance benefits to which I am entitled. I have some savings in the bank and I don’t have three of the big expenses that many 20-somethings have: I don’t have children; since I live with my mom, I don’t pay rent, and since I drive a 14-year-old Subaru, I don’t have a car payment. (I used to think all these things made me a loser, but suddenly in this upside-down world, they are huge advantages.)
You know the statistic from the Federal Reserve survey that 40 percent of Americans can’t afford an unexpected $400 expense without borrowing or selling something? I’m guessing that percentage is higher right now. Also, I had an unexpected $400 expense last week. My dog attempted to seek a position in the pest control industry and she killed a porcupine. Thanks to the extremely wonderful staff at the Hollis Animal Clinic (I cannot recommend them enough), she is fine now, but that was an unexpected hit to my wallet that took a chunk out of my savings.
But what about the $1,200 stimulus check, you might ask? That was deposited in my bank account on May 6. (Several days AFTER the porcupine encounter.) The CARES Act was passed March 27. By government standards, that’s pretty speedy, but by regular people standards, it’s a day late and a dollar short (as my mother always says).
I think a common feeling among the millennial generation is the feeling that we played by the rules and did everything right and still got bilked. We were promised that if we went to college and got a degree in something we were good at and passionate about, that was the ticket to financial security. So I did that, and ended up back in Maine, with $68,000 in student loan debt, unable to find a job in my field. So I tried the backup American dream: I got an office job that, while it wasn’t my passion, was decent enough. Solid benefits. And I worked hard and was good at that job, too – I have the performance reviews to prove it – but then came coronavirus and suddenly I was a bunch of numbers that needed to be moved off the ledger. So I was laid off. Poof went the benefits. But I did what I was supposed to do, and I promptly filed for unemployment benefits.
And still nothing. You know, when she was my age, my mom had been married for two years, and was two years away from buying her first house.
There is a bright spot. When I was laid off, I realized I would lose my health insurance at the end of April (as a country, we really shouldn’t be linking our ability to pay for health care to our employment). I applied for MaineCare – the state name for Medicaid. The application was long and a little scary and despite asking me about every single monetary asset I could possibly own, there wasn’t an option on the form to indicate “I got laid off from my job and have no income and that is why I am applying.”
But fortunately, I was approved pretty quickly. Now I’m on Medicaid, so if I contract coronavirus, or get hit by a car while I’m out walking the dog, I can go to the hospital without worrying about medical bills eating away at me for the next 20 years.
Life’s a bit of a waiting game for me right now, mostly. I suspect it’s that way for a lot of people – for the frontline workers, for nurses and doctors and delivery drivers and grocery store employees, everything is happening way too fast and too hard, but for the rest of us, employed or otherwise, it’s quieted down. Waiting for checks to arrive. Waiting for coronavirus cases to wind down. Waiting.

While many professional plumbers are qualified to handle most plumbing jobs, you should make sure that you hire a commercial plumber who is fully certified in backflow service and prevention to install and inspect your device.
Backflow Service
Our commercial plumbers are highly trained and certified to install and maintain all types of backflow service and prevention devices in the New York City area. We are always glad to answer any questions about backflow prevention and certification, so feel free to call us any time.
What is a Backflow Device
A your potable water piping. Sources of back pressure may be pumps in the water distribution system, boilers or heat exchanging equipment and even power washing equipment. In these cases you may have an almost constant risk of overcoming the static water pressure in the piping and when chemicals are used, as they are for commercial/industrial descaling (boilers) or residentially as in deck/siding cleaning such as bleaches (power washing), you would benefit greatly from having a backflow preventer.
To prevent such an occurrence, many regulatory regimes require there to be an air gap or mechanical backflow prevention assembly between the delivery point of mains water and local storage or use [1].It’s finally November, which can only mean one thing: it’s officially Scorpio season! It’s also officially less than 50 days to Christmas, which means the year has flown by faster than I can say ‘Editor’s Letter’. It won’t be long before Mariah Carey begins defrosting for the winter and Michael Bublé emerges from his cave of croon, to serenade us into a holly, jolly festive season ahead.
But before we embrace Santa, we’re embracing a different kind of red this month – with all things feeling sexy. As we kick off a whole new theme today, it’s time to turn the heat up a notch. Raunchy, you say? Hardly. The word ‘sexy’ seems to get a bad rep, but like the best things in life, I think it’s just because it’s misunderstood. In my research for our content this month, as I searched our theme, I was inundated with an overflow of over-sexualized content, all focused on the flashing of skin or the insinuation of romping affairs. And whilst sex in itself does of course, play a role in all things feeling sexy, it hardly embodies the true breadth and essence of the word itself.
So, what does it mean to embody sexiness? For me, it’s all about self. Self-care, self-awareness, self-love, self-joy, self-acceptance, self-exploration and most of all, self-confidence. Where at one time I used to equate sexiness to body types and lip colours, I’ve discovered that knowing thyself is akin to loving thyself and there is nothing sexier than someone who can truly be comfortable in their own skin – even when it’s covered from head to toe.
Sexy is more than just showing off; it’s showing up. Showing up for you, showing up for the things you believe in and showing up for the causes and people you care about. Sexy is the intellectual banter between two people, the exchange of wit and laughter and minds growing in unison. Sexy is learning new things from those around us and embracing how they can shape and mould us into better versions of ourselves. Sexy is wearing the clothes that we’ve never felt the confidence to put on, because we thought there was an ‘ideal weight’ before we could glow up and glam out. Sexy is not waiting to date because you’re not ‘this enough’ or ‘that enough’, because you have always been and will always be, more than enough. Sexy is all about revealing – revealing all your inner vulnerabilities and being unafraid to be raw, open and honest with yourself and with those who matter.
Sexy is truly an attitude and a way of thinking – especially of yourself as the main character in your life.
Which is why this November, whether it’s women challenging the notion of ‘femininity’ by weightlifting, short men breaking stereotypes on why height doesn’t always equal appeal or sharing our favourite picks for the sexiest men’s fashion, we got your sexy content covered and all the inspiration you need.
Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to go sharpen my inner Scorpio for the season.

State v. Arlene’s Flowers, Inc., 91615-2 (Unanimous Opinion – McCloud author). This case involved the violation of the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD) and the Consumer Protection Act (CPA) by a florist seeking to deny services for a same-sex wedding. I hope to blog about this case in more detail soon, but in the meantime, here are the basics.
- The court upheld the WLAD and the CPA and rejected the attempt to create an exception based on religious belief. The court held that the refusal to provide flowers was discrimination based on sexual orientation, rejecting the argument that it was marital status discrimination (and therefor permissible).
- The florist attempted to argue (1) that it was marital status discrimination, not sexual orientation discrimination (and therefore okay for her to refuse services), (2) the WLAD already an express exemption to RCW 49.60.215 for “religious organization[s]” that object to providing public accommodations for same-sex weddings, thus the attempt to argue that WLAD didn’t cover marriages in secular public accommodations failed. The court also rejected the argument that the WLAD requires a balancing test between the rights of the protected class members (i.e., the public using the accommodation) and the business providing the service and the religious beliefs possibly held by the owner of the company.
- The court also rejected the claim that the WLAD violated her right to Free Speech or Religious Exercise. The court held that the “WLAD is a neutral, generally applicable law subject to rational basis review. And the WLAD clearly meets that standard: it is rationally related to the government’s legitimate interest in ensuring equal access to public accommodations.” (Citations omitted)
- The court also noted that the WLAD withstands strict scrutiny review – rejecting the florist’s argument that the couple suffered no real harm:
- We emphatically reject [the argument the couple suffered no real harm.] We agree with Ingersoll and Freed that “[t]his case is no more about access to flowers than civil rights cases in the 1960s were about access to sandwiches.” Br. of Resp’ts Ingersoll and Freed at 32..
- Finding that Supreme Court has never held that a commercial enterprise, open to the general public, is an ‘”expressive association’” for purposes of First Amendment protections, the court rejected the florist’s Free Association claim.
What this means for the LGBTQ Community in Washington
We know our experience and the experiences of our friends, people continue to discriminate based on sexual orientation and gender identity despite the laws. The best way to get compliance is to complain to the people who can command enforcement. If you experience discrimination in a public accommodation, file a complaint. The Washington State Human Rights Commission is the agency where a complaint should be filed. The Office of the Attorney General also has a complaint process.Nyc State prosecutors need indicted three professionals for allegedly much exceeding the state’s limitations on interest levels on brief financial loans, through alleged payday advance loan which can be typically badly managed, report the fresh new York instances.
The uncommon instance highlights the risk customers can deal with from payday advances that make them dire financial straits. In addition, it sheds light on a multibillion-dollar market that contains seldom already been the subject of violent measures, the days highlights.
Pay day loans are typically at under $500 and because of about debtor’s subsequent payday, in accordance with the customer Investment defense agency. The mortgage’s financing charge could start from $10 to $30 per $100 borrowed, with a regular two-week financing amounting to a yearly portion price (APR) of nearly 400per cent, when compared to 12per cent to 30% for credit cards.
Carey Vaughn Brown presumably possessed 12 agencies in the U.S. and offshore to try to dodge American regulators while managing all parts of an exploitative loan procedure, including increasing financial loans with expensive rates of interest between 350per cent and 650percent and collecting automated costs from consumers’ bank account.
Company Insider achieved off to Brown’s lawyer the circumstances, Paul Shechtman, for a comment and certainly will revise if we listen to back. He told The Times their clients ” acted in good faith and appears forward to revealing his innocence.a€?
Throughout, 18 says additionally the area of Columbia prohibit overly high-cost payday lending through different methods, based on the customer Federation of America.
Although New York has statutes capping rates of interest at 25percent, these expense tend to be uncommon because loan providers continue steadily to get away with dishonestly extending financing at much higher prices
The largest challenge for payday lending subscribers is what takes place when they miss money, making them vunerable to charge they might never be alert to and huge quantities of interest, as John Oliver keeps stated on a segment of their talk program “a week ago this evening.” Over 75per cent in the payday lending market’s mortgage quantity are generated by consumers that forced to use again before their after that wages period, Oliver reported.
It guide of just one payday home loan company features a group drawing clearly revealing a vicious circle consumers can deal with. a€?An actual Ace funds classes guide for staff members properties a diagram which starts with the customer obtaining an ACE loan, moves through them spending the amount of money thereon mortgage, getting not able to repay it, following being forced to submit an application for an ACE financing once again,a€? John Oliver mentioned on their program.
But 32 shows still allow payday loans at triple-digit interest levels, some without even setting any speed cap
We hit over to ACE loan to give it a way to touch upon the Oliver section, and we’ll modify this post when we listen straight back.
The trouble persists because payday lending providers discover methods to skirt rules a number of shows through lesser modifications. Like, enterprises in Ohio have licensed as mortgage brokers to leave legislation focusing on organizations approved as temporary lenders – while keeping the same practices. “For regulators it’s like playing legislative wack-a-mole,” Oliver said. “Just as soon as you envision you’ve squashed all of them lower, they appear somewhere else dressed in a completely various clothes.”
That vicious cycle impacted Columbus, Kansas poet and online installment loans New Jersey publisher Joylynn M. Jossel after she borrowed a few hundred cash but couldn’t repay it a couple of weeks later, reported DailyFinance. Since she cannot pay-off the girl loans at some point, she turned into suffering from too much interest rates.
Jossel after that lent from another payday lender to pay back once again the lady first mortgage, generating a slick mountain that kept their owing cash to four different loan providers. Whenever she did pay back her loans, she would right away have to take around another loan to pay their debts. Sooner or later, she ended up being paying $1,800 toward those debts every month.
That resulted in harassment from debt collectors. “They reveal whatever and every little thing to make you arrive and purchase the make sure that failed to clear,” Jossel informed routine financing. “They’ll show, ‘You’re a criminal, you had written a poor check. That’s unlawful, it really is a felony, you’re going to jail.’ They phone all your records along with your tasks. It is scary. We noticed very suffocated. It believed as if I became inside black-hole that I just cannot escape.”
Jossel escaped the pattern after she received money from a not related municipal lawsuit. “We have never, and I also imply never ever, think two times about checking out a quick payday loan heart ever again inside my lifetime,” she stated.Suck It And See has no songs that I can imagine being played down at your local indie night. A few come close though: Reckless Serenade, Black Treacle and the third single, the title track, Suck It And See. By far though, the song tht stands out in my mind is Piledriver Waltz, which also appears on the soundtrack to the 2011 film, Submarine.
Many people who know me know that it takes a pretty special movie for me to watch it the whole way through, let alone actually express any opinion on it. Submarine is one such movie that I've watched (the whole way through) recently and have loved. Directed by none other than Richard Ayoade, of The IT Crowd and The Mighty Boosh fame, it's a pretty simple little movie, with a beautiful soundtrack (composed by the Arctic Monkeys frontman, Alex Turner), about a young boy that I'm sure some of the more left-of-centre of us would identify with. I wont give the storyline away here.
So three morals to this story: firstly, grab a copy of Suck It And See so you too can suck it and see (but i'd advise you to not actually suck it, or you may damage it); secondly, find a way of seeing Submarine, it'll make you smile if nothing else; and finally, get your tickets for an Arctic Monkeys show somewhere near you, for example, the recently announced 2nd Arctic Monkeys show in Sydney, all ages at the Enmore theatre (tickets on sale on Monday 7th through ticketek).
Check out the video for Suck It and See.... but be careful, it may just corrupt you.

В творчестве группы Disturbed преобладает религиозная тематика.
This album is simply PERFECTION, no bad song, might find that doesn't kill you like the rest but in every disturbed album there's always that song I skip, here there's nothing that's skippable. Even though Indestructible and Asylum surely have the most powerful album atmospheres, and Believe has such beautiful songs, and The Sickness is their classic debut, despite all those things my vote goes for Ten Thousand Fists because this album has so many incredible songs, and has STRICKEN on it! Amazing album.Just as the pandemic was heating up several Las Vegas hotels raised their resort fees. Now as Las Vegas re-opens several properties are running ‘specials’ where they waive resort fees and parking. In other words, with a whole lot of rooms to fill, they’re lowering the price.
Resort fees have been shown to drive people away from Las Vegas, especially travelers from nearby Southern California who take on increased importance with more people willing to drive than fly.
Last fall we started hearing about “venue fees” in Las Vegas, you were already paying a resort fee for the resort facilities, but spend money in one of those facilities and they’d tack on a fee for the venue.
Now though as properties re-open in Las Vegas it looks like there’s a new opportunity for a surprise ‘gotcha,’ a COVID-19 surcharge. When destinations around the world that have re-opened, or that are looking to, are practically paying you (COVID-19 rebate) to come, the Mon Ami in the Paris hotel is raising prices 4% but not listing the increase on the menu.
Paris closed, but Mon Ami open. Indoor and outdoor seating via side entrance. Limited menu, and social distance seating. Entrance outside on the strip. Amazing lunch, as always. But now, there is a #CovidSurcharge #VegasAgain #Vegas #VegasIsBack pic.twitter.com/bVwRqKh44d
— ᴛʀᴀᴠᴇʟᴢᴏʀᴋ (@TravelZork) June 9, 2020
They clearly know it’s illegal to require you to pay a different price than what was listed on the menu, so they make it “optional” by telling you that you can have it removed. You shouldn’t have to ask.
Three weeks ago I wrote “Karl Marx said history repeats itself first as tragedy then as farce. Destination and venue fees were hotels repeating resort fees as tragedy, a COVID surcharge must be the farce?” Sadly that wasn’t wrong.
What a miserable idea. I get that costs of production have increased, but identifying maintenance of hygenic premises as a line item cannot be a good marketing decision over the long term.
This is ridiculous. Mon Ami Gabi is a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant. They are a huge company with restaurants all over the country. What a rip off.
Hahaha… Murican business with murican tipping mentality…I’ve always said keep it simple: show the final mandatory price in the pricelist and I’ll decide to buy based on that final price.
City & municipal local sales tax, GST, convenience fee, federal tax, extra surcharge, resort fee, highway access fee, COVID-fee, tipping fee, service fee, elevator fee, bellboy-is-sick fee, our-cleaning-lady-is-pregnant surcharges, and all these sh*th*l*s can be kept an internal accounting book.
Here’s something that might help from Gal 6:7-9: “Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows”.
Yes, pay a “surcharge” for cleaning when restaurants are already supposed to be clean. Typical Vegas, they can’t help but try to kill the golden goose.
Welcome to NEEEEvada where the slime lives on.
I just had an oil change in Reno and they tacked on an additional $7 (undisclosed) fee because of “government imposed additional costs”.
Trying to support local business by having our windows washed I gave the worker a $10 tip and he gives me the white nationalist salute.
Some businesses deserve to fail and the sooner the better. Vote with your feet. We do.
Absolutely right. All of this should be illegal. Don’t support it with your business.
They shouldn’t charge you for the virus unless they GIVE you the virus!
I don’t support the surcharge. But I don’t really think it is accurate to say this is a surprise “gotcha” or that they are raising prices 4% but not listing the increase on the menu since the menu in your link specifically says in bold at the bottom that they are adding the 4% surcharge and you can ask for it to be removed.
This reminds me of the mandatory 15% tip on everything at the Cadillac Hotel, Autograph Collection in Miami Beach. It is hidden in fine print on the bill. Most people tip 15% or 20% not realizing a 15% tip was already included.
Such a vulgar place; no discerning person will go there more than once…
1) The receipt says if you want it removed you can ask the manager (Karens of the world rejoice!)
2) At least it is specifically spelled out as a COVID charge, which makes it less defensible to keep it around after the pandemic has subsided, or normal business operations resume. I would share everyone’s fear that it somehow sticks and never goes away, but for a business, it is easier to program a surcharge rather than adjust every price, every menu, etc.
3) Are “employee health benefit” surcharges still around or have those been baked into total pricing yet?
Your story has nothing to do with Las Vegas. Mon Ami Gabi is a Lettuce Entertain You Restaurant and LEYE is adding 4% Covid fee in a lot of their restaurants (Chicago too).
Please please please give us your business, oh BTW here’s a surprise surcharge to express our gratitude.
As others have stated Mon Ami Gabi is an independent restaurant not directly affiliated with or controlled by Paris (or by Caesars Entertainment). They are basically renting the space. In fact to show you how removed this restaurant is from the rest of the Paris dining establishments it is the only dining outlet listed on their website at which you can’t either earn or redeem (or both) Caesars Reward Credits. If you don’t believe me bring up the website for Paris to review dining options then compare that to the Caesars Rewards site regarding earning and redeeming Reward Credits (you can sort by location, casino and type of establishment).
Basically this is a corporate move by the parent of this restaurant (as others have stated) and it is click bait and misleading to tie this into either Paris or Las Vegas in general.
BTW – I feel such add on fees are ridiculous. I have no problem with restaurants (and other businesses) raising prices due to the increased cost of goods, capacity restrictions and additional staffing required for cleaning or oversight but just raise your damn prices!
The pandemic was a global emergency!!! why should people have to pay for some thing they had no control over? We’re just starting to get back —-greed is disgusting I will not be visiting or staying at any hotel that charges a service fee or surcharge for a virus affecting everyone!!! people please speak up and stop this insanity!!! no surcharges at hotels, casinos or resorts reference to the virus – it may come up again in the fall – we don’t know but stop this craziness now!!!!!!!!!
For me, it is easier to boycott alas Vegas due to resort fees and boycott all Lettuce Entertain You for adding a cleaning fee.
It will serve Vegas right when the city gets the COVID-19 Disease back in full force since they are not practicing the rules of social distancing or mask wearing! The town has always been known for it’s greed!
Does the surcharge menu statement say if you are more or less likely to catch the virus if you pay the surcharge?
I remember the days when these kind of chicago surcharges were taken care of in the back room and not paraded around out in the front of the house. I guess times change.
In related news, a FT troll named “hotelboy” (who has claimed to own, varying, 25-50 Marriott properties), claimed that Marriott approved his $4.19 daily (up to 10 days) COVID surcharge. At least the Marriott Lurker called BS on it and it got shot down pretty quickly.
Just another company trying to pork the consumer over. Even my Barber shop added a $1.00 Covid 19 Cleaning charge.
Cancelling my reservation for next month. Not due to the heinous surcharge but rather it is clear from early reports and photos that social distancing is not enforced. I enjoy playing craps and hanging out at the pool but not willing to risk my life to do so.“Seldom do people discern

I received this fundraising request from the Tigard Good Neighbor Center the other day. It is a stark reminder that something simple like a day off of work isn’t so simple when you’re trying to lift yourself out of poverty. There is little margin for error.
I would encourage you to read it, and if you are so inclined help them out. Or, help an organization aiding people on the edge in your community.

After the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the lives of Japanese Americans would change forever. On February 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt would authorize the evacuation of over 110,000 people of Japanese descent along the Pacific Coast and incarcerate them into relocation camps. Over 60 percent of these people were U.S. citizens. It would take four years for the last of these camps to close. It would take another four-plus decades for the U.S. government to condemn its own actions as racist and xenophobic and offer reparations to those Japanese American families whose lives were upended by the incarceration.
In remembrance of this dark stain in U.S. history, we highlight some of the survivors' experiences in their own words.
“As far as I’m concerned, I was born here, and according to the Constitution that I studied in school, that I had the Bill of Rights that should have backed me up. And until the very minute I got onto the evacuation train, I says, ‘It can’t be’. I says, “How can they do that to an American citizen?” – Robert Kashiw." - George Takei

"Sometime the train stopped, you know, fifteen to twenty minutes to take fresh air — suppertime and in the desert, in middle of state. Already before we get out of train, army machine guns lined up towards us — not toward other side to protect us, but like enemy, pointed machine guns toward us." - Henry Sugimoto

In The Consulting Economy, Jonathan Dison, founder of Lightrock Consulting and BenchWatch.com, explores the realm of consulting, teaching both aspiring and experienced consultants, contractors, and freelancers how to find a niche within their industry, start a business, develop a clientele, maximize income, and create a career that is vibrant, challenging, and rewarding.

The biotech, listed on the Nasdaq and Australian Stock Exchange, said in a July 30 release that the review will cover targeted indications, patient administration, product formulations, manufacturing and regulatory requirement issues across technology platforms to Phase I clinical trials as soon as practicable with an eye on value.
"We remain committed to exploiting and creating value from all our technology platforms in order to build a sustainable, international, biotech company," Ross said in the release, adding, "whilst we do not rule out securing third party collaborations and partnerships to further validate and fund our programs, I can confirm there are no M&A plans."
However, Ross said the scope of the biotech's programs means that some hard choices need to be made.
"Notwithstanding, it is clear that we cannot realistically undertake and fully resource all our research and development programs in parallel all the way through to market approval and launch." Anisina set to enter the clinic in 2016.
Kelly's departure this week came as the company presented details in July for a promising in vivo proof-of-concept study for anti-tropomyosin drug candidate Anisina in the U.S.
On the company's website was an update on Anisina with a presentation by Timothy Cripe, a doctor with the Nationwide Children's Hospital Research Institute, at the 8th Annual Cancer Molecular Therapeutics Research Association meeting in Boston.
It showed improved efficacy of vincristine in animals and suggested the potential to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy for children with fewer side effects.
The animal study, CHLA-20, to evaluate Anisina either alone or in combination with vincristine in a mouse model of human neuroblastoma was part of Australia's Children's Oncology Drug Alliance.
Ross, in the release, also said the company was searching "for a world class CEO and authorized the immediate recruitment of additional staff including a full time CMO, project, and manufacturing management support."
The company did provide detailed general updates on its programs but strongly suggested the priority list would change.
"Whilst not wanting to pre-empt the outcome of the review I anticipate we may have to re-prioritize some of the programs," Ross said.

Marks & Brands is a site-specific sculptural installation that commemorates the rich traditions of the cattle industry that flourished in Southwest Florida during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was conceived, designed and fabricated by California sculptor and art instructor Peter Mitten, who was chosen from a field of three finalists and 112 applicants.
The installation consists of a large three-dimensional ferrous metal sculpture that is located in a water feature in the courtyard of the new Fort Myers Regional Library on First Street and Royal Palm Boulevard, and four bronze relief panels
containing the imprints of cattle hooves that have been inserted in the sidewalk running along First Street and McGregor Boulevard to identify the site of the historic cattle trail that once cut through the city.
It’s true. Between 1865 and roughly 1908, a crude dirt cattle trail sliced through Fort Myers. Connecting pasture lands in Fort Ogden and Fort Thompson to shipping pens and a deep water wharf built by Union soldiers in Punta Rassa in 1864, the road was dotted with scrub pens and stopovers like the cracker-style shack at the Edison & Ford Winter Estates that Jacob Summerlin put up for cattle drovers moving his herds down the old Wire Road
(now McGregor Boulevard). The weed-covered sand and dirt road was finally replaced with a paved thoroughfare in 1915 thanks to legendary civic leader Tootie McGregor Terry, who offered to cover the costs of paving the 20-mile stretch from Whiskey Creek to Punta Rassa if the city and county would pick up the cost of paving Riverside Avenue from Whiskey Creek to the train station at Monroe and Main Street in downtown Fort Myers.
For the 3D totemic piece, Mitten has stacked various cattle brand shapes in a calligraphic linear configuration that pays tribute to the “historic branding irons utilized by Lee County’s cattle ranchers to mark their cattle.” Known as Stacked Brands, the 400-500 pound rust-colored sculpture
stands eight feet in height, although it appears taller because it has been mounted on a 2 x 4 x 4 foot travertine clad pedestal which resides in the center of a shallow 12 foot wide by 77 foot long water feature that runs along the west side of the plaza opposite the library’s entrance. The sculpture is on loan to Lee County from the City of Fort Myers under a long-term lease in exchange for which Lee County agreed to install, light and maintain the piece, which has been sealed with three coats of clear Smart Coat sealer to protect it from corrosion and the sun’s UV rays.
The four 1 x 2 foot life-cast silicon bronze relief panels have been inserted in the sidewalk along First Street and McGregor Boulevard following an intensive
ADA and historic preservation review. Mitten fabricated each half-inch thick panel with rounded, ADA-compliant edges so that they could simply be bolted into the sidewalk with 3″ threaded rods and secured with epoxy.
“It was important for me to visually mark the historic cattle trail as it
made its way from the ranches in eastern Lee County through downtown Fort Myers west toward Punta Rassa where cattle were loaded onto ships destined for Cuba and other ports,” notes Mitten. “Marking this trail became, for me, a powerful metaphor for passages that mark time, a recurrent theme in my public artworks for more than twenty years.”
Marks & Brands is the 25th sculpture in the City of Fort Myers’ public art collection, which also maintains more than two dozen paintings, prints and photographs in its Portable Works Collection. When combined with works commissioned by the federal government, Lee County and other sources, there are more than 70 public artworks within the city limits, with most being concentrated in a four-square-block area in the downtown Fort Myers River District.
Fort Myers and the Cattle Industry
But for the cattle industry in Southwest Florida at the time of and in the years following the end of the Civil War, it is likely that there would be no Fort Myers today. Oh, there would probably be a town on the Caloosahatchee River, but it is doubtful it would be called Fort Myers and it would certainly not include the historic buildings that line First Street and dot the rest of the downtown Fort Myers River District. It is
also highly improbable that Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, or the McGregors would have ever found their way to this part of Florida.
By the time forces under the command of General P.G.T. Beauregard opened fire on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, Florida was one of the leading cattle-producing states in the South. And the Confederacy relied heavily on
Florida’s cattle ranchers for beef, hides and tallow. (Leather was vitally important not only for shoes, but cartridge boxes and harnesses for pulling artillery.) However, not all of Florida’s cattle went to feed and supply the Confederate Army. Because clothing, tobacco, salt and other provisions were in short supply due to the Union blockade, Florida ranchers diverted
thousands of head to blockade runners who sold their steers in Cuba, which was able and willing to pay more than three times what the Confederacy could pay – and in gold, clothing, home goods and food rather than Confederate dollars.
To interrupt the flow of cattle to both Confederate fighting forces
and the traders and fishermen who were thwarting the Union’s blockade, the Union re-garrisoned the abandoned redoubt on the Caloosahatchee known as Fort Myers with five companies from the 110th New York Infantry and the 2nd Florida Union Calvary. Between January 1, 1864 and the end of the Civil War, the soldiers
stationed there confiscated more than 4,500 head of cattle from ranches extending from Punta Gorda to as far north as Fort Meade. “Some of the cattle captured by raiders from the fort … were slaughtered at Fort Myers to supply meat for their garrison,” reports Karl H. Grismer in his book, The Story of Fort Myers. “Most of them, however, were driven overland to Punta Rassa, where they were loaded on transports and taken to Key West. The trail followed by these cattle
drives was the one which had been blazed in 1838 by Col. Persifer F. Smith during the war against the Indians …. [I]t became tramped down and so well defined that it was followed by cattlemen for many years after the Civil War ended.”
To facilitate the shipment of cattle from Punta Rassa, the Army built cow pens,
chutes, a long wharf into the deep waters not far from shore, and a 100 foot long by 50 foot wide barracks built atop 14 foot pilings. It was these facilities that lured Jacob Summerlin to the Fort Myers area in the months following Lee’s surrender to Grant at Appomattox.
Jacob Summerlin
got into the cattle business before the war when he traded 20 slaves he inherited for 6,000 head of cattle. Early on, he supplied the Confederacy with beef, but beginning in 1863, he teamed up with James McKay, Sr., a daring and highly successful blockade runner who operated from a base in Charlotte Harbor to the north. Whether he learned
about Punta Rassa from McKay or by other means, Summerlin made the abandoned pens, chutes, wharf and barracks his base of operations for the continued export of cattle to Cuba and Key West within weeks following the end of the Civil War.
But Summerlin’s appropriation of these facilities was interrupted in 1867 when the Ocean Telegraph Company (which was later acquired by Western Union) took over the barracks and wharf under the provisions of a Congressional act that permitted a telegraph company “to take and use public land necessary for the stringing of line or the establishment of stations.”
The IOTC did not prohibit Summerlin from using the pens, chutes and wharf. But it did assess a port charge of 15 cents per head for his continued use of the shipping facilities.
Summerlin’s export business accelerated in 1868 when Cuban insurrectionists began a ten-year war with their Spanish occupiers which increased their demand for beef. In no time at all, Summerlin’s agents began buying and driving ‘beeves” from ranches throughout central and northern Florida south toward Punta Rassa. Some herds crossed the Caloosahatchee at Fort Denaud; others at Fort Thompson. To facilitate these drives,
Summerlin constructed a crude road from Fort Ogden to Punta Rassa, building scrub pens and stopovers along the way including the cracker-style structure that Thomas Edison purchased in 1885 and converted into his Caretaker’s House. The town emerging from the remnants of the old fort was integrated into Summerlin’s cattle highway, which often saw herds exceeding a thousand head passing along present-day First Street.
It
wasn’t long before other cattlemen began arriving in Punta Rassa intent on striking deals directly with buyers from Key West and Havana. F.A. Hendry and his brother Marion were among that group. Since Jacob and his son Samuel had the exclusive right to the IOTC facilities, the Hendrys and other cattlemen had to pay the Summerlins an augmented port fee for use of the pens, chutes and wharf.
In October of 1873, the facilities were severely damaged by a hurricane. Ever the astute businessman, Jacob Summerlin decided he’d better construct his wharf and pens, and so he built a longer and even better pier farther up the point along with a hotel to compete with the hostel that the cable operator, George Shultz, was running out of
the old barracks that the Union soldiers had constructed in 1864. Jacob named his new hotel the Summerlin House. It not only provided room and board to drovers during their stays in Punta Rassa, but accommodations to cattle buyers visiting from Havana and Key West.
During the decade that followed the start of the Cuban insurrection, “165,669 head of cattle were shipped to Cuban ports and for them the cattlemen received $2,441,846 [which was] truly a princely sum during
those lean reconstruction years,” Grismer sums up. (Id. at 86.) But it wasn’t until the Hendrys moved into Fort Myers themselves that any of that money found its way to the small settlement on the banks of the Caloosahatchee.
The Hendrys decision to relocate to Fort Myers was actually prompted by the death of a six-year-old girl in May of 1873. Her name was Esther Ann Hendry, and she was the daughter of Charles and Jane Hendry. Charles and his family were living in an isolated two-room frontier shack in pasturelands near present-day Immokalee. In the aftermath of the girl’s death, Jane decided that she would no longer live far from civilization just to keep watch over the family’s cattle.
She and Charles arrived in Fort Myers four days later, and Captain Francis Asbury Hendry, Marion Hendry and three other closely-related families soon followed. All were familiar with the fort. F.A. Hendry had visited the fort or “Cattle Battalion” in an unsuccessful attack on the fort. Charles had also been to the fort during the Second Seminole War, when he brought Seminole prisoners there while a member of a Florida Volunteer boat company.
And all three had.” (Id. at 91.) Capt. Hendry, in particular, quickly eclipsed the Summerlins as the principle cattle rancher in the area. With a herd in excess of 50,000 head,
he became known as the Cattle King of South Florida and endeavor began coming to Fort Myers.
“They could make a living here while at the same time get all the benefits of a fine climate, and fish and hunt to their heart’s content.” (Id. at 97.)s,.” Included in this influx were Dr. Thomas Langford and William H. Towles, who became prominent cattlemen in due course. And thus Fort Myers evolved into a rough-and-tumble cow town. Not fast, but slowly and deliberately until finally visionaries like Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Ambrose and Tootie McGregor came to lead Fort Myers into the age of invention, shifting the overall tenor and focus from cattle to citrus and tourism.
About Peter Mitten
For 40 years Peter Mitten has been making and exhibiting sculptural ideas, drawings, and architectural design on a commissioned basis.
After receiving an MFA in sculpture in 1976 from Southern Illinois University School of Art and Design, Mitten moved to California for a college teaching position at Point Loma University. Launching his sculpting career at the same time, he quickly received favorable critical reviews and several awards, including “Best In Sculpture Division” at the 1982 Southern California Expo. In 1989, Peter moved to Boston, where he received a Pollock Krasner Foundation Grant to continue studio endeavors until his return to southern California in 1992. He now resides in Hemet, California.
Among
the public art pieces he has completed are installations at the San Diego County Library (Grove Canopy, fence and gate in cut and welded steel, 56′ x 10′ x 4″ – 2010), the Mt. San Jacinto College Library in Menifee, California (Polyhedron Stretch, right, painted wood – 2010), the UCSD Mathematics Department in La Jolla, California (Polyhedron Cloud, stainless steel – 2005), the Music Department at Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego
(Centenary Passage, cast bronze and granite, 120″ x 96″ x 96″ – 2002), the Escondido Transit Center (Hekkilk, cast, pigmented concrete, 96″ x 240″ x 168″ – 2000) and the Rapid Transit Center in Plano, Texas (Stele of Plano, right, cast bronze, twelve separate 48″ x 32″ sections 48″ x 32″ x 2″ – 1993), as well as in Belmont, Massachusetts and Prescott Valley, Arizona.
Mitten’s
work has been exhibited at the San Diego Botanical Gardens in Encinitas and by the Santa Ysabel Art Gallery in San Jacinto, California. His most recent one-person exhibition was in 2010 at Yuma Art Center in Yuma, Arizona.
“My work has been inspired by the hard surfaces, landscape and water drainage patterns in the southwest United States,” states Mitten. With a background in cast metals, he has interpreted canyons, valleys, rock outcroppings and distinctive areas along wilderness trails through small, medium and large-scale cast and fabricated metal, bronze, aluminum and iron, as well as granite and painted steel and wood in sizes ranging from desktop to 20 feet in
height.
Peter’s recent work explores modular sculptural interpretations of micro and macroscopic systems.
Peter teaches life sculpture and three dimensional design at Mt. San Jacinto College in Menifee, and he remains involved in curriculum and teaching for the Oak Lake Art Center in Julian, California.

In a Clean Install, set the boot pool as the system dataset, by default
Description
When I do a clean install there is no device/pool set as the system dataset until I create a pool
I am suggesting that we set the boot pool as the system default if there is no pool
I believ there is already a ticket to prevent a passphrase being added to an encrypted pool if it is also set as the system dataset. I will find that ticket as well

An AWS Glue job encapsulates a script that connects to your source data, processes it, and then writes it out to your data target. Typically, a job runs extract, transform, and load (ETL) scripts. Jobs can also run general-purpose Python scripts (Python shell jobs.) AWS Glue triggers can start jobs based on a schedule or event, or on demand. You can monitor job runs to understand runtime metrics such as completion status, duration, and start time.
You can use scripts that AWS Glue generates or you can provide your own. With a source schema and target location or schema, the AWS Glue code generator can automatically create an Apache Spark API (PySpark) script. three types of jobs in AWS Glue: Spark, Streaming ETL, and Python shell.
A Spark job is run in an Apache Spark environment managed by AWS Glue. It processes data in batches.
A streaming ETL job is similar to a Spark job, except that it performs ETL on data streams. It uses the Apache Spark Structured Streaming framework. Some Spark job features are not available to streaming ETL jobs.
A Python shell job runs Python scripts as a shell and supports a Python version that depends on the AWS Glue version you are using. You can use these jobs to schedule and run tasks that don't require an Apache Spark environment.
Defining Job Properties for Spark Jobs
When you define your job on the AWS Glue console, you provide values for properties to control the AWS Glue runtime environment.
The following list describes the properties of a Spark job. For the properties of a Python shell job, see Defining Job Properties for Python Shell Jobs. For properties of a streaming ETL job, see Defining Job Properties for a Streaming ETL Job.
The properties are listed in the order in which they appear on the Add job wizard on AWS Glue console.
-
glueetl.
Choose Spark Streaming to run a Apache Spark streaming ETL script with the job command
gluestreaming. For more information, see Adding Streaming ETL Jobs in AWS Glue.
Choose Python shell to run a Python script with the job command
pythonshell. For more information, see Adding Python Shell Jobs in AWS Glue.
- AWS Glue version
AWS Glue version determines the versions of Apache Spark and Python that are available to the job, as specified in the following table.
Jobs that were created without specifying a AWS Glue version default to AWS Glue 2.0.
- This job runs (generated or custom script)
The code in the ETL script defines your job's writing.
Note
AWS Glue creates a temporary bucket for jobs if a bucket doesn't already exist in a region. This bucket might permit public access. You can either modify the bucket in Amazon S3 to set the public access block, or delete the bucket later after all jobs in that region have completed.
Source and target are not listed under the console Details tab for a job. Review the script to see source and target details.
- Advanced Properties
- Job bookmark
Specify how AWS Glue processes state information when the job runs. You can have it remember previously processed data, update state information, or ignore state information. For more information, see Tracking Processed Data Using Job Bookmarks.
- Monitoring options
- Job metrics
Turn on or turn off the creation of Amazon CloudWatch metrics when this job runs. To see profiling data, you must enable this option. For more information about how to turn on and visualize metrics, see Job Monitoring and Debugging.
- Continuous logging
Turn on continuous logging to Amazon CloudWatch. If this option is not enabled, logs are available only after the job completes. For more information, see Continuous Logging for AWS Glue Jobs.
- Spark UI
Turn on the use of Spark UI for monitoring this job. For more information, see Enabling the Apache Spark Web UI for AWS Glue Jobs.
Tag your job with a Tag key and an optional Tag value. After tag keys are created, they are read-only. Use tags on some resources to help you organize and identify them. For more information, see AWS Tags in AWS Glue.
- Security configuration, script libraries, and job parameters
- Security configuration
Choose a security configuration from the list. A security configuration specifies how the data at the Amazon S3 target is encrypted: no encryption, server-side encryption with AWS KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS), or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3).
-. This option is passed as a job parameter. For more information, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Encryption Keys (SSE-S3) in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.
Important
This option is ignored if a security configuration is specified.
- Python library path, Dependent jars path, and Referenced files path
Specify these options if your script requires them. You can define the comma-separated Amazon S3 paths for these options when you define. This is the default Worker type for AWS Glue Version 2.0 or later machine learning transforms.
You are charged an hourly rate based on the number of DPUs used to run your ETL jobs. For more information, see the AWS Glue pricing page
.
For AWS Glue version 1.0 or earlier jobs, AWS Glue version 2.0 or later jobs, you cannot instead specify a Maximum capacity. Instead, you should specify a Worker type and the Number of workers. For more information, see Jobs.
- Number of workers
For G.1X and G.2X worker types, you must specify the number of workers that are allocated when the job runs.
The maximum number of workers you can define is 299 for
G.1X, and 149 for
G.2X.
- Maximum capacity
For AWS Glue version 1.0 or earlier jobs, using the standard worker type, you must specify the maximum number of AWS Glue data processing units (DPUs) that can be allocated when this job runs. You are charged an hourly rate based on the number of DPUs used to run your ETL jobs. For more information, see the AWS Glue pricing page
.
Choose an integer from 2 to 100. The default is 10. This job type cannot have a fractional DPU allocation.
For AWS Glue version 2.0 or later jobs, you cannot instead specify a Maximum capacity. Instead, you should specify a Worker type and the Number of workers. For more information, see Jobs.
- (48 hours) for batch jobs. When the job execution time exceeds this limit, the job run state changes to
TIMEOUT.
For streaming jobs that run indefinitely, leave the value blank, which is the default value for streaming jobs.
-. Jobs that reach the timeout limit are not restarted.
- Job parameters
A set of key-value pairs that are passed as named parameters to the script. These are default values that are used when the script is run, but you can override them in triggers or when you run the job. You must prefix the key name with
--; for example:
--myKey. You pass job parameters as a map when using the AWS Command Line Interface.
For examples, see Python parameters in Passing and Accessing Python Parameters in AWS Glue.
- Non-overrideable Job parameters
A set of special job parameters that cannot be overridden in triggers or when you run the job. These key-value pairs are passed as named parameters to the script. These values are used when the script is run, and you cannot override them in triggers or when you run the job. You must prefix the key name with
--; for example:
--myKey.
getResolvedOptions()returns both job parameters and non-overrideable job parameters in a single map. For more information, see Accessing Parameters Using getResolvedOptions.
- Catalog options
- Use AWS Glue data catalog as the Hive metastore
Select to use the AWS Glue Data Catalog as the Hive metastore. The IAM role used for the job must have the
glue:CreateDatabasepermission. A database called “default” is created in the Data Catalog if it does not exist.
- Data source
Choose a Data Catalog table.
- Transform type
Choose one of the following:
- Change schema
Adds the
ApplyMappingtransform to the generated script. Allows you to change the schema of the source data and create a new target dataset.
- Find matching records
Allows you to choose a machine learning transform to use to find matching records within your source data.

1).What is state management?
State management is the process that maintain state and page information over multiple requests for the same or different pages.
2).Http is stateless, What does this mean?
Stateless protocol is a communications protocol that treats each request as an independent transaction that is unrelated to any previous request
so that the communication consists of independent pairs of requests and responses.

4).What are the Advantage and disadvantage of Session?
Advantages:
Disadvantages:
5).What is Session ID in Asp.net?
Asp.Net use 120 bit identifier to track each session. This is secure enough and can't be reverse engineered. When client communicate with server, only session id is transmitted, between them. When client request for data, ASP.NET looks on to session ID and retrieves corresponding data.
6).By default where the sessions ID's are stored ?
By default, the unique identifier for a session is stored in a non-expiring session cookie in the browser. You can specify that session identifiers not be stored in a cookie by setting the cookieless attribute to true in the sessionState configuration element. We can also configure our application to store it in the url by specifying a "cookieless" session
7).Where does session stored if cookie is disabled on client’s machine?. The following code example shows a Web.config file that configures session state to use cookieless session identifiers.
<configuration>
<system.web>
<sessionState
cookieless="true"
regenerateExpiredSessionId="true"
timeout="50" />
</system.web>
</configuration>
8).Can you describe all the property set in web.config under session state?
<configuration>
<sessionstate
mode="inproc"
cookieless="false"
timeout="20"
sqlconnectionstring="data source=127.0.0.1;user id=<userid>;password=<password>"
server="127.0.0.1"
port="8080"/>
</configuration>.
9).What are Session Events?
There are two types of session events available in ASP.NET:
You can handle both these events in the global.asax file of your web application. When a new session initiates, the session_start event is raised, and the Session_End event raised when a session is abandoned or expires.
10).How you can disable session?
If we set session Mode="off" in web.config, session will be disabled in the application. For this, we need to configure web.config the following way:
<configuration>
<sessionstate Mode="off"/>

BrianOnline mall protects against fakesThe government has officially launched an online shopping mall where the intellectual property rights of non-exclusive imported products are authenticated to protect customers from counterfeiters.
The Ministry of Strategy and Finance and the Korea Customs Service on Friday said it has opened Alramm Mall (), though it has been in test operations since October.
The online shopping mall provides one-stop services that allow shoppers to purchase products, authenticate them and even request repairs.
“Alramm Mall is a shopping mall that only sells imported products by non-exclusive companies that have received customs approval, which allows consumers to purchase products without having to worry whether they are counterfeits or not at a bargain price,” a customs agency official said.
“The main purpose of the website is to step up the integrity of the parallel import market.”
Since 2012, the Korean customs agency has been operating a system that certifies imported goods that have undergone legal approval. Detailed information, including the time the product was approved by the customs agency as well as the importers’ identification, can be accessed via a smartphone using the QR code on the product.
According to the customs agency, 12 importers are participating in the online shopping mall. The Trade-related IPR Protection Association (TIPA) under the Korea Customs Service scans the importer, and a private company, Aram Korea, manages the website.
The agency said customers can also get repairs on the products through 18 companies that have a contract with TIPA and apply for it on the website.
Imported products from non-exclusive contractors have recently gained popularity, especially since they are cheaper, and in some cases, the ordering process is less complicated than purchasing goods directly from major overseas online shopping malls like Amazon.com.
The weakening Korean won against the U.S. dollar has added to the cost of imported goods.
The Korea Consumer Agency added that complaints concerning overseas purchases doubled from 2,781 in 2014 to 5,613)Average loan terms for new vehicles now exceed 71 months, up from just over 69 months a year ago.

He's obviously annoyed with the relentless flash of our camera, not to mention his encounter, just moments before we took this picture, with a raccoon hissing and rambling through the yard. A lot on his plate, and not all good kitty treats. Tomorrow's another day.
At the recommendation of our kind blog friends and relatives, we bit the bullet and took our scratched and bitten hand to the doc this afternoon. As usual, we had put off having a physical over the last period of time, and the good doctor took the opportunity of our visit to suggest we take care of business then and there, which we did. Now that it's over, what a relief. Everything seems to be up to snuff except the blood pressure, a longtime issue inherited from our mother and grandmother, which we agreed to monitor weekly and email him the results for evaluation. We had a slight temperature, which suggested infection from the bite wounds. Are now on the antibiotic Amoxicillan three times a day for the next period of time. You never know what tomorrow will bring.
Good. See the medicinal magic felines bring into our lives? I wouldn't doubt it if Babe didn't strike the blow just to get you to take care of yourself.
It didn't take long for Sabby's bite to get infected and took a while to heal. Antibiotics were definitely called for and I suspected they would be for you too.
Just be careful with Babe. Only two weeks later Sabby wandered outside and went missing for twenty four hours only to crawl up on the porch the next morning terribly injured. He nearly died.

Glad you saw the doctor and even more pleased that you are dealing with the b.p. issue Sissy. I've finally - after years of trying - gotten mine down to something reasonable and believe it or not, I actually do feel better. No point in leaving the exquisite Baby and the adorable Tiny motherless, now it there?
Posted by: GayleMiller | March 29, 2006 at 09:09 AM
I'm so glad you went to the doctor! Much much better to get cat scratches and bites treated quickly rather than risking a bad infection by waiting too long. A mostly clean bill of health on all the rest - excellent! I'm sure you'll be able to work on the BP now that it's been brought to your attention. *grin*

Glad you got checked out Sissy - cat bites are serious business.
As for Mr Cakes. Can't speak for that spirited individual but the cats in my life tend to digest new ideas over the course of several years, something I've had to take into account when learning how (and when) to discipline them, making it largely an exercise in faith.

WendyCross shows. WendyCross webcam.This is the name of a three-part series of short film screenings and workshops by mixed heritage filmmakers, celebrating films and generating conversation on identity, heritage labels, language, significance of names and the “good immigrant” trope.
The multicultural work is the creation of Tape Collective who, before a UK-wide screening tour,Â launched their series at the Barbican Cinema on 20 October.
“But where are you really from?” invites the audience to redefine, reject and re-establish notions of belonging. It can do so because its creators are filmmakers of Zimbabwean, British, Bolivian, Algerian, Venezuelan, Trinidad, Canadian heritage, to name a few of many multitudes.
Cross-arts events bolster these dynamic screenings with workshops and performances including live music, spoken word and panels. UK Cinemas across the regions have partnered with Tape Collective to offer engaging and memorable events to welcome audiences back over the autumn season.
The curated selection includes new work from international and regional, award-winning filmmakers and actors who delve into personal experiences and question perspectives with humour and sincerity.
“But where are you really from?” collates conversations about belonging and the intersections of identity, collaborating with local independent venues to bring about a national dialogue whilst spotlighting new talent.
The first programme The good immigrant explores the “good immigrant” trope experienced by refugees, and children of immigrants where acceptance is afforded those deemed best behaved. The films in the programme offers a look at shaping an identity beyond labels and an emergence from generational and ancestral trauma.
Whether it is learning or losing a language, the second programme Trippin’ over my tongue looks at the barriers raised when the mother tongue is not as fluent as we want, or the words simply slip away.
It is an experience not uncommon within a diaspora to have your name viewed as too foreign or exotic, and subject to either whitewashing or clumsy – and sustained – mispronunciation. Expanding on the theme the final programme Call me by my name looks at the wider ideas of labels and definitions of identity and heritage.
Following events at the Barbican Cinema on 20 Oct (The Good Immigrant), 8 Dec (Trippin’ over my tongue) and 26 Jan (Call Me By My Name), “But where are you really from?” goes on tour. The season will also include special events in Cardiff, Glasgow, and Birmingham whilst more venues across the UK begin to book the programmes as part of their cultural offering (TBA).
Highlights of the season include: What’s in a name directed by Runyararo Mapfumo who has recently directed multiple episodes of Netflix’s hit show Sex Education. The short was commissioned as part of An Uncertain Kingdom, aiming to provide a unique and contemporary portrait of the UK, following Mapfumo’s previous work, which has been featured at the BFI London Film Festival, on BBC and Google Arts.
As British as a watermelon is the latest project from Manchester based mandla rae, which enjoyed success in last year at Queer Contact in Manchester and Edinburgh’s Fringe of Colour, where it was recommended by the Guardian.

But, as a non diet dietitian, I feel like we need to be aware of just what is diet culture, and the ways it can be dangerous to both our physical and mental health. Stick around to learn more about how diet culture permeates our everyday life, how to identify it, and how to fight back.
Diet culture definition
On of the best ways to define diet culture is that by Christy Harrison, Registered Dietitian and tireless crusader against diet culture. She defines diet culture the following way:
”.
As an introduction to diet culture, let me tell you a little bit about my own experience with it. I hope this can illustrate some of the ways diet culture operates.
My own experience with diet culture
I developed an eating disorder early in my life. It started when I was 12, during a gym class in which were weighed, measured and had our skinfold measurements taken. I was told I was above the average for weight and body fat %. That’s when I started to feel like there was something wrong with me.
I’m a Latina, from Puerto Rico, and at the time I was living in the US. Most of the girls at school were slender and tall, and with “normal” fat %. I am petite, with a butt that was “too big” and legs that were “too thick” (“cankles” was a term that horrified and plagued me). At least, according to all the beauty magazines I was suddenly noticing around me.
Diet culture in the media
I would devour Seventeen magazine and Cosmopolitan, who would tell me I had to look like this or that actress in order for people to like me. So here’s one of the first examples of what diet culture is: it tells you that what you are and look like is not OK, and that you need to “do something” to change that in order to be happy and accepted (which I actually was, before these doubts started to eat at me).
Back then (this was the early to mid 90s), magazines would frequently include diet plans in their issues, and there were also these tiny diet books along with the magazines in the supermarket checkout aisles (anyone else remember those?). It was one of these little books that ultimately sucked me into diet culture.
That summer of ‘91, I started following that little diet book to a tee. I would eat exactly what it told me to: foods that would burn off my body fat, especially the lower body fat I was suddenly super self conscious of. But I still pretty much looked the same, even after weeks of eating celery sticks for snacks. So, another diet culture example: false promises. Diet culture tells you there are certain foods you can and can’t eat in order to achieve a physical ideal. It does not take into account that we’re all different and metabolize food differently as well.
Eating disorders can ensue
I won’t bog you down with details, but all of this eventually led to full blown anorexia nervosa, where for the next two years I would eat very small amounts of food, and some I even banned (I was horrified over the 2 Tic Tacs we had to eat during a Science class experiment about taste buds, or something).
When I look at my pictures from that time, I looked ill and unhappy, which I was. I lost my period for a whole year, my hair was starting to fall out, my skin had a yellowish tinge to it and I would frequently feel dizzy and weak.
Even though I was dangerously underweight, I still felt that my legs were “too thick” and my butt was “too big”. I still didn’t look like my American peers. I felt there must be something wrong with me because I was doing everything the diet books and articles told me to, right? And here’s another example of diet culture at work: making you feel like it’s your fault, that you need to try harder, instead of recognizing that these diets just don’t work.
The problem with diet culture
The problem with diet culture is that it’s actually many problems. As my above example, diet culture can have the following dangerous results:
- Believing that you’re not enough as you are, that there’s something wrong with you, and you need to fix it because it’s your fault (like, it’s my fault I have genes for my cultural body type?) ?♀️
- Thinking that you won’t be accepted if you don’t look or weigh a certain way
- Believing that you’ll be happy, healthy, successful, loved and accepted as soon as you have “x” body, which leads to frustration and self hatred when it’s not achieved
- Developing a problematic relationship with food, such as eating disorders and food preoccupation
- Weight cycling, which can have many negative health effects
- Internalizing weight stigma and weight bias
- Continually searching for outside approval instead of cultivating self love
- Self esteem and body image issues
- Normalizing and even encouraging self deprecating talk, especially when it comes to our bodies. Feeling and talking well about our bodies is seen as “conceited” and “stuck up”, as Regina George here demonstrates.
Another huge problem with diet culture is that it’s everywhere! It’s in magazines, commercials, at the gym, in daily conversations. And we’re sometimes not even consciously aware of it. Plus, you don’t even have to be on a diet to be caught up in diet culture and the diet mentality. Here are some examples of diet culture at work in our everyday lives.
Diet culture examples
As a dietitian, one of the most worrisome effects of diet culture is the conflicted relationship with food that it fosters. When we contemplate the fact that food is just food, that it’s necessary in order to live and that we also have a right to enjoy it (radical thinking, I know!?), then we can see just how screwed up these diet culture messages are. For example:
Have you ever felt “guilty” after eating a certain food? Do you berate yourself for “pigging out” during a girls night out? Do you find yourself saying things like “I really shouldn’t eat this” or “I’ll ‘be good’ and skip dinner since I had such a huge lunch”? That’s diet culture right there. As I mentioned above, diet culture moralizes foods into “good” and “bad”, which means you’re “good”, “bad” or “guilty” for eating certain foods or amounts of foods.
Diet culture also uses compensatory behavior around food. For example, “burning off” that cupcake with vigorous exercise, or “rewarding” yourself with a slice of cheesecake for eating only salad all week.
But let me clear something up first: This is NOT your fault. This is the effect of the toxic and sneaky diet culture we live in. It’s the effect, as this article discusses, of a “$66 billion” weight loss industry that profits from those who will do anything to pursue their “ideal body”. We’ve been programmed to relate to food and body image this way.
Diet culture normalizes disordered eating and diet behaviors
Therefore, diet culture normalizes disordered eating. It brings about food phobias, guilt and shame around eating and completely ignores the importance of satiety and eating for pleasure. And the problem is we internalize this thinking as if it’s just the way things are, as if it’s normal. Here are some more diet culture examples:
- Using moralizing food descriptors such as “sinful”, “guilty-pleasure”, “fattening”, “bad for you”, “cheat day foods”, “clean eating”, “clean foods”, etc.
- Promoting/selling products or programs that promise “spectacular”, “fast” and “easy” weight loss results.
- Encouraging the restriction of certain foods (for example, foods with gluten) or food groups, without any medical need to do so (such as an allergy or intolerance), in order to lose weight.
- Marketing over-the-counter dietary supplements and products with the promise of a “fat burning” effect, without sufficient clinical evidence, safety and/or proper regulation.
- Praising weight loss. This is problematic because (1) it perpetuates the wrong assumption that “thin=good”/”fat=bad” and (2) the reason for the weight loss may be due to a negative experience, such as stress, illness, depression, etc.
- Using “fat” in a negative sense. It’s just a descriptor, people, such as short, tall, blonde, brunette, green eyed, curly haired, etc!
- Promoting exercise as a tool to try achieve an often unattainable body type rather than something that can empower you or make you feel good.
The dangers of diet culture
So, as we’ve seen, diet culture permeates our way of thinking and relating to food and our bodies. It’s dangers range from impaired enjoyment of food to life threatening eating disorders. Plus all the emotional torment in between. And all of this just because of the normal, natural and necessary biological function of eating. Think about it. Is it worth going through all that because of some arbitrary and socially constructed ideals? Does a scoop of ice cream really get to determine whether you’re “good” or “bad”? I think it’s time to change this way of thinking, don’t you?
Another important point is this: diet culture doesn’t tell you to “eat healthy” and “do exercise” because of the benefits it can have on our health–it promotes these behaviors as a means to lose weight. And just like I’ve mentioned before, there can be health promoting and health hazardous behaviors throughout the entire weight spectrum. Thus, you can have a person in a larger body who nourishes themself well, honors their hunger and satiety cues and engages in enjoyable physical activity to feel strong. And you can have a person in a thin body who binges on alcohol and neglects their nutrient needs. Health promoting behaviors, not weight or body size, needs to be the priority.
Toxic relationship with food and our bodies
Other ways diet culture can be toxic and dangerous is because it:
- Perpetuates harmful, unproven diet and food practices, such as:
- “Detoxing” for weight loss and health
- Fad dieting, especially with respect to diets that have no evidence to back up their claims and/or have been developed by people with no health and medical training
- Self medicating with “natural” products/ supplements that promise weight loss results
- Fails to recognize that bodies come in all different shapes, sizes, colors, weights, and that there’s nothing wrong with that.
- Does not recognize that our bodies naturally and constantly change over time, and that it’s not a “failure” on our part
- Just like a typical rom-com, it fails to inform you what happens after the wedding. Most intentional weight loss is regained over time. In fact, chronic dieting is a surefire way to develop other negative effects such as disordered eating and a slower metabolism
- Equates our worth to how much we weigh and what we look like. It never takes into account who we are as a whole: our values, traits, characteristics, personalities, quirks, things that make us unique
- Fosters an unhealthy preoccupation with food. An example of this is the emergence of orthorexia
- Perpetuates disordered eating and all the negative health hazards related to this
Healing from diet culture
Healing from diet culture is possible. It’s not easy, but it’s worthwhile. And the more we heal from this toxic way of thinking and behaving, the more we pave the way for others to free themselves from it as well.
As for me, I eventually did beat my eating disorder. It started when I became scared of all the negative physical symptoms I was experiencing, and gradually allowed myself to start eating again. It was hard, because weight gain naturally occurred. I tried to battle it with “better” and “healthier” diets I would find in magazines, but these were too difficult to maintain and just made me feel repressed and unnatural (a feeling I absolutely loathe!). And anyways, a diet, is a diet, is a diet….
My experiments with food and diets led me to pursue a career in dietetics, and that’s when the real healing began. I started learning about the real role that food has in our lives (cough-keeping us alive-cough). I also learned about how food behaves in the body, how all foods can be good, and how many food and diet related beliefs are just myths.
I won’t get into details, but it took some time and effort on my part to stop diet related behaviors and thoughts. And while my weight didn’t go to where my 12 year old self would have wanted, I’ve been able to maintain a stable weight that’s right and comfortable for me during the time following. Just by eating intuitively (a concept I didn’t even know of yet). In fact, I just enjoyed two powdered mini doughnuts as I’m writing this. No guilt, no shame!
Do I sometimes struggle with body issues? Of course! But body acceptance is a journey that never really ends; it’s an ongoing call to continue to embrace and appreciate ourselves over and over again! So, if you’re interested, here are some ways to fight back against diet culture and start taking back your power.
Resources for breaking out of diet culture
Educate yourself: This was a real turning point for me. Don’t just take these diet centered messages at face value. Look into what the real evidence behind it is and what its real purposes are (usually to get you to fork over cash). Read books and blogs and listen to podcasts based on the anti diet culture message. Here are some great books, websites and podcasts you can check out:
- The Beauty Myth by Naomi Wolf
Body Respect by Lindo Bacon
- Health at Every Size by Lindo Bacon
- Anti Diet by Christy Harrison
- Intuitive Eating by Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch
- Food Psych Podcast
- Health at Every Size Community
- National Eating Disorders Association Community
Be wary of social media: Stop following people on social media who are promoting diet culture and the diet mentality. Especially if they don’t have any health education to back up their advice. Instead, search for and follow those people who promote body acceptance and self love. Here are some of my faves on Instagram:
- Christy Harrison
- Melissa Carmona (@the_spanglish_therapist)
- The Curvy Edit
- Robin Nohling (@thereallife_rd)
Seek professional help if this is a difficult issue for you: There are many health professionals nowadays who are understanding the importance of the anti-diet movement, and many offer services to give you the help you need. Eating disorders, body issues and self esteem are extremely complex issues to work through, and you don’t have to go at it alone. Please consult with a healthcare provider, especially those who practice weight neutrality and a non diet approach.

And now I would like to hear from you. What do you think about the diet culture we actually live in? Do you think it’s harmful or can there be some purpose to it?…Listen to the podcast

The primary attitude you want before you begin caring for another individual is affection for that person. It is unwise to attempt soul care if you do not feel love for the person you’re discipling. And the way you gain this kind of affection is by having a divine perspective about them.
A divine perspective happens when you see the individual the way God sees them. All good discipleship requires a “divine perspective” because in the “soul care business,” there is no place for thoughtless or unkind care.
If you view the person that you are counseling the way God sees them, your perspective will be correct, and you will be at the right starting point to begin the discipleship process.
Key Idea: Affection for others is rooted in your perspective of others.
In 1 Corinthians 1:4-9 you are able to see, read, and feel Paul’s attitude and affection for a group of unruly and proud people. The attitude and affection that Paul had for the Corinthians were rooted in his divine perspective of the Corinthians.
Here is how he said it at the beginning of his first letter to them.
Paul had gratitude for them (4), he acknowledged their identity in Christ (5, 6) and he had faith that God would complete what He started (7, 8, 9).
Paul’s affection for this challenging church body was a profound declaration of the grace of God in his life, and it’s an excellent template for you to think about as you approach the work of discipleship. Meaning, you must tether the motive of your heart to a divine perspective that will give you extraordinary affection for those you serve prior to serving them.
How is your heart toward unruly people?
Whether your friend needs correction, the way Paul eventually corrected the Corinthians, or your friend needs other forms of soul care, you should model Paul’s attitude and affection for the Corinthians before you begin the discipleship process.
Perhaps you’re caring for a family member, extended relative, or church member. As you think about them, assess yourself: do you have divine affection for them?Property Attributes

Diehard fans of independent hip-hop had much to be hyped about when Starch Records first announced the collaboration of label founders Ill Move Sporadic, and rising underground heavyweight soloist Tenchoo, back in 2015. Consisting of Ben 81 and One Boss, IMS have quickly gained a reputation as some of the most promising hip-hop producers the UK has to offer. A reputation earned from a slew of well received releases over recent years, which have undoubtedly helped expose some of the finest emerging MC's in the UK right now.Many bands have vied for the title of unofficial bar band of St. Patrick's Day. Nearly every major city with a significant Irish population claims allegiance to a local band, each insisting that its band's version of "Rocky Road to Dublin" is far superior to any other version. As these debates unfold, one band continues to play only a handful of shows each year. Twenty-five years into its career, The Pogues are, of course, the official band of St. Patrick's Day.
Over the last decade, several bands have revitalized the Irish sound. However, they are only rekindling the fire originally lit by The Pogues, who first brought the Irish sound and instrument set to popular music. These styles are on display in the unheralded box set quietly released last June, "Just Look Them Straight in the Eye And Say Pogue Mahone!"
The Dropkick Murphys and Flogging Molly claim The Pogues as a primary influence for their Irish-punk sound. But in truth, The Pogues have transcended that genre for years. Yes, the breakneck tempos on some of their more famous songs encourage this labelingas does Shane MacGowan, their self-destructive lead singerhowever their sound has always reached beyond any one genre. "Just Look Them in the Eye" goes to great lengths to demonstrate their vital role in redefining and expanding both punk and traditional Irish sounds by this genre-elusiveness.
In the 110 songs on "Just Look Them in the Eye Ŕ several different styles appear: Middle Eastern, Spanish, Afro-Cuban, country, opera and '80s synth. Although The Pogues rarely stray beyond the traditional Irish instrument setbanjo, Irish flute and accordionthey always bend the sound of their tools to suit their sound. They may dip into the Spanish sound, but make no mistake: it's Irish-Spanish, not vice-versa.
"Just Look Them in the Eye " should please both hardcore Pogues fan and the Johnny-come-latelys. They have alternate takes of all their famous songs, including three different takes of "Fairytale of New York" which show how the song developed from a minimal piano duet to the sprawling orchestral single release. The set collects their work from B-Sides, soundtracks and radio performances. Also included are concert recordings spanning from early in their career, when MacGowan still had his bearings, to the end when his situation became so untenable that Joe Strummer of The Clash had to replace him. The Irish spin they put on "I Fought the Law" is something that every Clash and Pogue fan alike needs to hear.
Although The Pogues no longer record new songs, St. Patrick's Day will ensure that their classic recordings will not be forgotten. Look in any pub serving green beer on March 17, and "The Sickbed of Cuchulainn" will be playing in the background. "Just Look Them Straight in the Eye and Say Pogue Mahone!" will not only provide you with six hours of great music, it will ensure that no one ever questions your Irish sympathies on St. Paddy's everIf you're just not feeling white on your wedding day, the very best of local couture has a ton of solutions for you.

Predictive policing systems digitally redline certain neighborhoods as “hotspots” for crime, with some systems generating lists of people they think are likely to become perpetrators. These designations subject impacted communities to increased police presence and surveillance that follows people from their homes to schools to work. The typical targets are Black and brown youth, who may also be secretly added to gang databases or asked by school officials to sign “contracts” that prohibit them from engaging in behavior that “could be interpreted as gang-affiliated.” For communities whose lived experience includes being treated as inherently suspicious by police and teachers, increased surveillance can feel like a tool for social control rather than a means of public safety.
The foundation of these practices are what police departments and technology companies call data-driven policing, intelligence-led policing, data-informed community-focused policing or precision policing. While data has always been used to solve crime, these tools go a step further, relying on a fraught premise: that mining information from the past can assist in predicting and preventing future crimes. As the scholar Andrew Guthrie Ferguson has said, “Big-data technology lets police become aggressively more proactive.” But this data can be biased, unreliable, or simply false. Unquestioned reliance on data can hypercharge discriminatory harms from over-policing and the school-to-prison pipeline. Our elected leaders must uncover and dismantle these practices and recognize them for what they are: an attack on our constitutional rights to due process and equal protection under the law.
Biased data
One foundational problem with data-driven policing is that it treats information as neutral, ignoring how it can reflect over-policing and historical redlining. For example, predictive policing systems typically rely on historical crime data in order to make predictions about where crime is likely to occur or the persons likely to be involved. But as a 2019 study by the AI Now Institute illustrates, this data can be “derived from or influenced by corrupt, biased, and unlawful practices,” including racially discriminatory policing practices like stop-and-frisk and the manipulation of crime statistics. Similarly, reliance on data from calls to police provides a limited view of where crime occurs, as it can reflect biased fears around who is dangerous or even intentional animus (such as when a white woman called the police on a Black bird watcher in New York City). Incorporating historical crime data without explicitly addressing the inequalities and selective enforcement that is engrained in this information overlooks the influence of discrimination.
Even information that is not based on police data can reflect social and economic inequalities. In the course of a public records request for information about the New York City Police Department’s predictive policing system, the Brennan Center for Justice obtained communications with technology vendors that proposed relying on data such as educational attainment, the availability of public transportation, and the number of health facilities and liquor licenses in a given neighborhood to predict areas of the city where crime was likely to occur. The NYPD ultimately chose to build its own predictive policing system, but these companies (like PredPol, Keystats, and HunchLab) are common vendors to several police departments. While some of this data might be relevant to the incidence of crime, such information also reflects structural issues like school segregation, neighborhood redlining, and urban blight. Instead of enabling a multifaceted approach to correcting these longstanding problems, predictive policing systems accept the world as it is and generates a one-note solution: more policing.
Unreliable and false data
Data-driven policing can also incorporate unreliable or false information, including into secretive gang databases. In city after city, audits and investigations of gang databases reveal that they are overwhelmingly populated with Black and brown people, that the criteria for inclusion are overbroad, that police invent gangs that do not exist, and that officers falsely claim that individuals admitted they were gang members despite evidence to the contrary.
The manipulation of data has been well-documented in police departments across the United States:
- In Los Angeles, an, investigation revealed that LAPD officers used field interview cards to regularly claim that individuals self-identified as gang members, despite body camera footage and car recordings that contradicted these assertions. This led the California attorney general to suspend the LAPD’s ability to add names to the statewide gang database, in turn prompting the Los Angeles district attorney to revisit hundreds of cases involving officers that were charged with falsifying evidence.
- In Chicago, an audit of the police department’s gang database by the city’s inspector general found racial bias and widespread inaccuracies. Nevertheless, information from the database was widely shared with educational agencies, housing agencies, and immigration authorities, posing the risk that it could facilitate individuals’ suspension from school, eviction from their homes, and deportation.
- During last year’s racial justice protests, the Phoenix Police Department went so far as to try to add protesters to the state’s gang database as supposed members of a nonexistent street gang based on an activist rallying cry: ACAB (All Cops Are Bastards). This brazen action prompted an independent investigation by the City Manager’s Office, which found the action was based on “dubious Grand Jury Testimony and deeply flawed (according to the Superior Court of Maricopa County, unconstitutional) legal conclusions.” The Department of Justice is also investigating the Phoenix Police Department for a number of related issues, including discriminatory policing and retaliation for engaging in First Amendment-protected activity.
- In June, leaked documents revealed that the Washington, D.C., gang database is also riddled with inaccurate data, including on children younger than six years old, and gangs made up by the police based on intersections or geographical landmarks.
Far from providing useful insights, gang databases provide a ready-made way to justify ongoing surveillance, harassment, and police killings that are unlikely to elicit widespread public pushback because the people involved were “known gang members.” The extent to which information from gang databases is fed into predictive policing systems is unknown, but the flawed data is used by other police systems such as data analytics or link analysis tools that attempt to trace connections between people. It is unacceptable for law enforcement to using inaccurate and fabricated data to power investigations and resource deployment.
Data-driven harassment
Data-driven policing’s vast web of surveillance facilitates harassment that can affect entire families. In Pasco County, Florida, an “intelligence-led policing” program trained officers to look for factors that could indicate a minor is “destined to a life of crime.” Among the risk factors were “poor rearing as a child,” “poor school record,” “hanging around in public,” being “socioeconomically deprived,” “antisocial behavior,” and “being a victim of a crime.” These criteria, often linked to poverty, could tag minors as fated to become criminals. Pasco County runs a separate program that creates a list of people they believe are likely to break the law, based on the county’s interpretation of various data inputs such as their connections to particular people and criminal records, as well as other secret inputs. In one family’s case, being a target of this program resulted in police showing up at their home multiple times a day, banging on windows, and regularly ransacking their property. When the family resisted, the police retaliated by issuing citations for minor infractions like overly long grass and missing numbers on a mailbox. Eventually, the family left their home and sued the police. In the words of one officer, that was the program’s objective: “make their lives miserable until they move or sue.”
Over the summer, the Pasco County Sheriff began sending letters to people that are flagged as potentially involved in future crime under the department’s “Prolific Offender Program,” informing them that their names and criminal records are being shared with agencies ranging from the FBI to the Department of Homeland Security to the United States Attorney’s Office. The sheriff’s letters do not offer any information about why the recipient was included, how they can petition for removal, or the specific consequences of being on this list, other than a vague warning of the “highest level of accountability for all current and future criminal acts you commit.” Instead, these letters function as a cold and intimidating warning that recipients are being watched and have already been predetermined to pose a threat.
Not only does data-driven policing continue over-policing of marginalized communities, it may also be a catalyst for reinforcing cycles of violence. In Chicago, a predictive policing program intended to identify people who are likely to be involved in a shooting—and prevent violence from taking place—appears to have had the opposite outcome, playing a role in causing shooting to take a place. There, a man was identified “at risk” of being “party to violence” based on where he lived and his relationships with people involved in crime. The system did not specify whether he would be a perpetrator or a victim, but as a result of his being flagged, police officers were regularly dispatched to keep tabs on him at home and at work. He believed that ongoing interactions with police made his neighbors suspicious that he was acting as an informant, ultimately leading other members of his community to shoot at him on two separate occasions. Thus, far from acting as mechanisms to interrupt or prevent violence, these tools can push people further into the margins.
At other times, surveillance can be a precursor to deadly encounters with police. In one instance, a ShotSpotter alert prompted the dispatch of Chicago police to a scene involving a 21-year-old man and a 13-year-old boy, Adam Toledo; one of the officers ultimately shot Adam, who was unarmed at the time of the shooting. A Vice investigation into ShotSpotter technology revealed that in a separate murder investigation, company analysts took sounds initially marked as fireworks in one location and reclassified them as gunshots detected at a murder scene that occurred nearly a mile away from the initial detection. It appears that these changes may have been at the request of Chicago Police. A subsequent investigation by the Associated Press found that “ShotSpotter employees can, and often do” change sounds picked up by the sensors. In August, the Chicago Inspector General issued a damning report evaluating the CPD’s use of ShotSpotter, finding that the technology “rarely leads to evidence of gun-related crimes,” and that the technology has altered the way Chicago Police “perceive and interact with individuals present in areas where ShotSpotter alerts are frequent.” The report also confirmed community concerns about the discriminatory impact of this technology, finding several instances of police officers pointing to the frequency of ShotSpotter alerts in a given area as a reason for stops and “protective pat downs.”
Under the guise of “unbiased” data, modern policing undermines fundamental constitutional rights. Contrary to the guarantees that people are innocent until proven guilty, that police questioning is limited by reasonable suspicion and probable cause, and that the government provides people the opportunity to challenge evidence used against them, data-driven policing leverages secret watchlists and proprietary algorithms to label people as inherently suspicious and worthy of ongoing monitoring. Impacted people may never know they are on government watchlists and may have no ability to challenge the determinations made by police. Preserving a society governed by due process and the rule of law requires addressing and remedying practices that subject marginalized communities to policing that smacks of authoritarianism.
Moving forward
Over the past year, historic protests across the country called for systemic changes in law enforcement’s relationship with communities of color. Pushed by local organizing efforts, the police department in Los Angeles scrapped its predictive policing system. Santa Cruz, California, became the first city to ban predictive policing, and jurisdictions from Portland, Oregon, to Cook County, Illinois, began taking steps to erase their gang databases. These initial victories are just the start: More jurisdictions must take steps to uncover and undo the ongoing harms facilitated by the tools and tactics of data-driven policing. At a minimum, it is time to scrap reliance on predictive policing technologies and gang databases.
As part of this process, legislators should also reject ongoing attempts by technology vendors to rebrand their systems as something that is more palatable or that misappropriate demands from advocates. As part of PredPol remodeling itself as Geolitica, the company is reframing its forecasting software as a tool for greater police transparency and community accountability. Similarly, HunchLab (now owned by ShotSpotter) is attempting to revamp its image by expanding its predictive algorithms to spot areas where social workers and mental health providers are needed.
These efforts should be seen for what they are: corporate makeovers and attempts to tinker at the margins. There is no evidence that predictive policing or gang databases have been or can be cleaned of bias. While there are important efforts to uncover and mitigate the ways that racial bias can infect machine learning, there is no excuse for continued funding and deployment of policing tools whose only consistent track record is a string of scandals. Adopting a wait-and-see approach treats the disparate impacts endured by communities of color as an acceptable tradeoff for technological process. In fact, there is no indication that communities are asking for “solutions” that supplement biased police with biased machines. Only decisive steps to dismantle the predictive systems themselves and remedy the harms wrought by data-driven policing will steer us toward building a more equitable society. Legislators should consider whether money allocated to discriminatory police technology would be better spent investing in social services to facilitate equal access to education, housing, transportation, and other life essentials.

While dressing out the carcass, I found these tiny egg clusters that were attached to the inside of her lower backbone. Apparently, these are the beginning of egg formation.
Wild Turkey eggs recovered from a hen shot on December 23, 2017
Until I found these tiny egg packets the question of when eggs begin to develop in a wild turkey had never occurred to me. And since I usually try not to shoot adult hens during the fall hunt, this is the first December hen I have dressed out in preparation for the table.
Also, see When do Turkeys nest in Wisconsin?
It is legal to shoot any turkey during Wisconsin’s fall season so why do I try not to take a hen?
An adult hen (brood hen) is a proven breeder, so I choose to focus on the jakes and jennies, thinking turkey biology, they are the most likely members of a turkey flock not survive the long cold winters. In other words, they are more likely to perish so why not put those excellent eating turkeys on the table?
In December most turkeys are approaching the same size, except for some late in the season hatched chicks. Documented turkey nests with incubating eggs have been located as late as mid-August. Over the years, on three occasions, I have discovered broods of flightless poults at the end of August.
These eggs located in Wisconsin mid-March
Other interesting observations from the hen.
Pictured are the contents of a Dec 23rd hen’s crop. Temperatures were in the low teens and single digits.
This insect was found alive in the hen’s crop.
I do not know what kind of insect it is. Even when temps are subzero, these bugs can be found moving around at the base of trees and in the bark when the sun warms the south side.
N.C.L.W. says
If it were not for this article’s title I may well have been likely to believe that those developing Turkey eggs were in fact fish roe from somewhere early on in that bird’s digestive tract.
I suppose the eggs begin to form inside the bird where you discovered these, then change location inside the Hen to become fertilized and subsequently grow into full eggs which are then laid?
No help with entomology as per ID’ing the bug found there. They seem familiar yet I do not recall personally seeing that one before. Certainly would be good to know who that is! Many insects overwinter among trees like that, it seems to act like a Box Elder Bug yet lacks the markings and is shaped differently.
Charlie says
When time allows I intend to do more research on both the timing of the eggs and these insects that stay active in the snow and cold.Top 100 Polluter Indexes

they usually are panic-inducing. One previously don’t do well with fulfilling new people, but satisfying someone you know is “sizing your up” is obviously shallow breath moment. Very, as you look at the future show, you set about re-living each of the earlier catastrophic primary goes you may have had—your short, curt replies to query requested, the incapacity to help keep a flow of chat went, those embarrassing “good nights.” In addition to the superficial breaths have become followed closely by that mincing within the gap of the stomach.
While no miraculous rod might take their introversion out, there are certain things you could do in order to master the art of the main go steady.
The Cooking
1. No Major Updates
Should you determine that you are looking for newer and more effective shoe as well as a brand new clothes for your date, do it. But don’t produce large adjustment. do not invest in few boots or an outfit definitelyn’t “you.” And don’t get an exciting new haircut.
Heading anywhere brand new can add on your discomfort—you won’t discover the right path around and you’ll generally be sidetracked attempting to familiarize yourself with spot. If this is the shorter 1st go steady, decide on a restaurant, simple bistro, or a compact club you know. You might be informed about the counter arrangements, the position and car, the diet plan, and so the individuals that shall be looking on you. These situations enables you to concentrate on the individual you will be with.
If parked across from a complete stranger and producing dialogue are uncomfortable for your needs, why-not decide on a romantic date that you is going to be earnestly doing it? Weather enabling, you could potentially proceed to the zoo or organic backyard; you could potentially check-out a wine or food flavored party or a street fest; why not consider a bar that has environment baseball if you’re effective in it? Are taking part in an activity offers you even more to share, plus it helps you “be a person.”
Whenever career candidates select interviews, they generally practise responding to the most likely questions with somebody. A first meeting is a bit like a job interview, let’s think about it. Collect somebody to sit down with you and enquire of an individual some most likely query. Practice both the mental and non-verbal answers, such as facial expression because motions until they seem organic. Consequently, shut the game tables. One formulate questions you should ask your very own big date, then training becoming a proactive close attender as well.
The Big Date
For those who have applied by doing so friend, you have got problems that uncover a bit longer feedback than only “yes” or “no.” Ask them, and exercise those listening skills with eye-to-eye contact, mind nods, and little smiles (and laughs if they’re genuinely funny). You will want that individual discover you have got a true desire for other folks plus him or her especially. Plus, exactly how more does someone know a person if you should don’t seek advice that allow those to open up and show one who they really are?
As opposed to wondering these people the things they’re doing for a job, question them exactly what they love ideal and minimal regarding their job. Simply don’t keep heating those issues from stress. Your won’t the go steady feeling prefer it try an interrogation. Whenever that you have practiced the likely query you may be expected, you will understand what we should communicate or not. Oversharing on a first time is sometimes embarrassing for its opponent. Providing the whole set of specifics of your very own finally separation is actually oversharing—save they.
You might be able to “fake” an outgoingness for a while of time—especially when you have applied this before—but you happen to be just undertaking that in making what you believe are good earliest effect. If the very first big date can become a second one, however, and s/he desires take you to a substantial friendly celebration, your own solution will likely be up. A person don’t have got to blurt up that you’re an introvert, but whilst you discuss the needs and interests, it’s likely that that aspect of the individuality will arrive down.
>
If you’re witnessing all type of red flags, pay attention. Listed here are just a couple:
- The date’s consult is perhaps all adverse about more people—last partnership, manager, co-workers, etc. This is not good mark.
- The day addresses a waiter or waitress seriously and/or miss his/her temperament once some thing isn’t made just right—this is not a sort guy.
- Their go out happens to be a narcissist and will just talk about him/herself, never asking you a question.
An extrovert in cases like this might well feel slightly confrontational and announce which go out has finished. Introverts may nip his or her tongues and sustain the pain sensation your duration. You don’t have to do this. Setup your very own explanations in advance. Get partner words your approximately one hour in and now have an indication to content back. Then your call come that displays an issue that will require the instant awareness. Or start feeling inadequately and go directly to the restroom. In case you go back, clarify that you are bad and also have to go.
a fake reason, mind you, need used as a last resort; if and as much as possible, it’s best to be honest about situations. You can actually bow right out the go steady with a straightforward “I’m sorry to achieve this, I’m just experience a tiny bit bogged down with abstraction and would prefer to commit residence.” When preparing because of this moment, it’s best if you push individually for your meeting, too. No need for an awkward cars experience residence.
And Afterward
Introverts posses remarkable memories—detailed memories—because these people bring all things in. This really is both a blessing and a curse. At your workplace, many experts have a blessing because introverts witness and heed earlier pulling results and often come up with great inventive options.
After a romantic date, it is often a curse. Introverts usually tend to re-live each minute, throwing on their own since they believed one thing dumb or as their awkwardness/anxiety is expressing. Give yourself a rest. You happen to be exaggerating and targeting your very own seen “bad” not to the numerous great things that probably happened. Concentrate on the advantages of the meeting and exactly what walked very well instead. This offers one confidence for a 2nd time or even relocate onto somebody else./cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/58351195/Lucky_Dragon_Hotel___Casino_11-19.0.0.jpg)
In the market for a Chinese-themed resort? Lucky Dragon, which closed its restaurants and casino earlier this month, heads into foreclosure after just over a year in business. The resort received a default notice in September for a $90 million loan and goes on the auction block on Feb. 6, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
The first resort built from the ground up since Cosmopolitan in 2010 allegedly owes millions to its lead building contractor, while staff was laid off.
The resort’s developer, Andrew Fonfa, borrowed $90 million to complete construction on the 2.5-acre resort that features a nine-story hotel and a 27,500-square-foot casino as well as Dragon’s Alley, the night market at the resort, Pearl Ocean with its dim sum menu for lunch and dinner, Phoenix with a focus on modern Chinese fare, and Bao Now with its casual dishes. Fonfa, who also owns neighboring Allure residential building, also used the EB-5 foreign investor program that promises green cards for investors to finance the project.

Work, moments of work, and heat flux are studied for the generic case of a strongly driven two-level system immersed in a bosonic heat bath in domains of parameter space where perturbative treatments fail. This includes in particular the interplay between non-Markovian dynamics and moderate to strong external driving. Exact data are compared with predictions from weak-coupling approaches. Further, the role of system-bath correlations in the initial thermal state and their impact on the heat flux are addressed. The relevance of these results for current experimental activities on solid-state devices is discussed.How to change the "reply to" email address on an email alert

Campaign launched to raise $1 million for renovation to Hawthorne Seniors Care Community
When you wake up after a deep sleep, you don’t expect to see a stranger in the next bed but that can happen at Hawthorne Seniors Care Community, where many of the frail elderly share semi-private rooms.”It was heartbreaking and it was a challenge,” says CEO Lenore Pickering of the experience of new residents at the 44-year-old Port Coquitlam facility.
Although Hawthorne has been providing elder care in Tri-Cities, and a leader in providing state-of-the-art services, with its innovative dementia cottages in 2005 and community style amenities, the inability to provide private rooms because of the building’s original “medical model” design has been a sore spot.That is about to change, said Pickering, who said construction has already begun on a $4.2-million renovation that will convert 19 semi-private rooms to private rooms while also adding more lounges and upgrading the decor to create distinct “neighbourhoods” and a more home-like atmosphere for residents.
Last Thursday, a public campaign was launched to come up with $1 million toward the project and the good news is more than half has already been been raised by supporters — and even Hawthorne staff. PoCo Mayor Greg Moore, whose mother lives at Hawthorne, revealed that the first and largest donation of the $568,264 collected so far for the renovation came from the Hawthorne team at $110,000.”We want to start at home,” said Moore, who is the campaign chair.
The PoCo Senior Citizen Housing Society, the organization behind Hawthorne, believed the renovation to be so important that it loaned $1 million from its emergency reserve to get it started. But that loan must be paid back, which is the reason for the public campaign. Also helping with the project is Fraser Health, which will help offset the interest on the $3.2-million mortgage cost, and BC Housing, which will provide interim construction financing and assist in getting a competitive mortgage rate.
According to project documents, the construction will add nearly 11,000 sq. ft. of space, convert 19 semi-private rooms into 38 private rooms, include three new bathing rooms, lounges, courtyards and medicine cabinets in residents’ rooms. As well, additions will include two nursing stations, a music therapy studio, a resident kitchen/activity room, offices and a storage room. The current dining area will also be redesigned and enlarged.
Article was originally posted here on April 3, 2017.Earlier today, I headed off to a two hour meeting with no idea what the training was all about. All I knew was that I didn’t want to go. Titled Governance Training, they tried to make the meeting more enticing by adding a Happy Hour afterwards. Getting out on time was all the happy that I needed.
Admittedly, I didn’t go into the meeting with the most open of minds. Still, there seemed to be a disconnect between the audience and the presenters. With senior management at the front of the room, I believe to make us feel their buy-in on the change in process, the presenters spent the majority of time looking directly at them. At times, one of the senior staff would stimulate a discussion which, in my opinion, would have been more appropriately discussed before such a meeting. The effect was that of a game show, with us as the audience.
All of the key words and phrases were brought out. We don’t want to be “like big pharma” was stated repeatedly. However, the model that was put on the table was so similar to BIG Pharma that many jaws in the room had to be propped up. With insistence that “Sharing is key” the slides went up. The content was overwhelming, the font was so small that it is doubtful that those in the middle of the room could make it out. And yes, I realize that I am being overly critical.
It is hard not to be critical when the presenter starts off saying “I did not make these slides so I don’t know what they say.” Another jaw dropping moment indeed. Perhaps there was a little too much streamlining in this process. Wouldn’t you think that some previewing and preparing before such an event would be in order? That’s just me.
After two full hours of training, I walked away with no new information. Even if they had held our attention, I am not sure what value it had to spew off acronyms, list out the stage gate processes, and display the org chart to reinforce just how lean the company is running.
As for Happy Hour, if there was any happiness in the hour that followed, I didn’t see it. Perhaps the guy, who sat in the back of the room, would find happiness in seeing his newly created paper airplane fly. Who knows?

This indigenous antibody is created by Bharat Biotech as a team with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Virology (NIV).
“The approval has been given to Bharat Biotech after their application dated September 23 for Phase III efficiency and safety clinical trials. It will be carried out under stringent rules, regulations and SOPs,” said a senior health department official, adding that all stakeholders will be provided the findings of the trials periodically.
The five schools/clinics that will participate in the preliminary incorporate BJ Medical College, GMERS Medical College at Sola, MK Shah Medical College and SGVP Hospital in Ahmedabad, and GMERS Medical College in Gandhinagar.
Sources conscious of the improvement said the clinical preliminaries are optimized, and some different states have likewise been decided to make a Covid-19 antibody accessible in India, which is one of the most exceedingly awful hit nations in this pandemic. “We will expand all conceivable help, while the SOP and choice of people for the preliminary is anticipated,” said a senior city-based wellbeing office official.

More than a few musicians of note have called up Dino to see if he might be interested in collaborating, which he is floored by. This talented young singer has an appreciation and deep respect for the musical heroes who preceded and profoundly influenced him. So, when George Lynch opened the doors to the idea of writing and producing a record together, Dino was more than intrigued. Frontiers, known for releasing interesting collaborations of this nature, was more than happy to be the label home for this project.
The resulting album and band, Dirty Shirley - named after one of the first songs they wrote together - covers a wide spectrum of styles. Classic metal to more “traditional” Lynch Mob oriented sounds and even some hints of the first Badlands album are in the mix. Showcasing a stunning performance from George Lynch - a seemingly bottomless pit of inspired and creative guitar playing - and an absolutely over the top lead vocal performance from Dino, Dirty Shirley is going to be an easy 'must listen' for the hard rock and metal crowd. Evanescence drummer, Will Hunt rounds out the line-up.
Dino says, "This record was done differently from everything else I did so far. George jammed and sent me rough versions and I tried a thousand melodies and lyrics on it. It turned out fantastic and very versatile. From r&b and rock ballads to some very heavy tunes, bluesy stuff, hard rock, rock 'n' roll, grungy vibes... everything. Will was the perfect drummer for this, loud and groovy. I recorded vocals while being on tour with TSO in the bus, every evening when we had a day off. And finished it in Croatia. You gotta listen to the whole album to get the impression of it, not only singles. But the first single will surely kick your ass, so better be prepared!”
George adds, "At its core, this record is built on classic guitar riffage and grooves, but is also infused with eclectic tendencies scattered about that are unexpected and challenging. 80% of the guitar work on this record is rhythms, so I wanted to create a three-dimensional sonic tapestry that complimented the more basic riffs and chords. I tried to add a little twist to everything." He continues, "It was funny because when the label approached me about pairing up with Dino, for some reason I got the impression he was an Italian pop singer. LOL. So I wrote some songs in that vein, haha. ; ) Then when I heard what he was actually all about, I had to duck back into the laboratory and reinvent the wheel. If Ronnie James Dio and young Coverdale had a baby boy, his name would be Dino."
The band is currently exploring live show opportunities for 2020, so stay tuned for more news on Dirty Shirley!BRAND NEW GUCCI YA101339 G-CHRONO STEEL CHRONOGRAPH IN ORIGINAL BOXSET.

Tags: Iran Iran Nuclear Deal Russia Arutz Sheva Staff , Nov 07 , 2021 4:23 AM Nuclear talks in ViennaReuters Iran told Russia on Saturday that Western governments should be "realistic" when nuclear talks resume later this month and not to exceed the bounds of the 2015 deal they are seeking to revive, AFP reported. A telephone call between Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, which Moscow said was requested by Tehran, came just weeks before the talks reopen in Vienna on November 29 after a five-month gap. "The rapid approach of the talks requires the European and American sides to adopt a constructive and realistic approach, avoiding excessive demands that go beyond the terms of the nuclear agreement" struck in 2015, the Iranian minister said, according to a ministry transcript. The Russian foreign ministry said the two "sides spoke in favor of restoring the nuclear deal in its original, balanced configuration, approved by the UN Security Council". "They confirmed that this is the only correct way to ensure the rights and interests of all participants of the comprehensive agreements.". On Wednesday, an Iranian diplomat said that the negotiations will restart November 29 in Vienna. Iran wants a lifting of all US sanctions which were imposed after Trump's withdrawal, but the Biden administration says it will only negotiate measures taken by its predecessor over the nuclear program, not steps imposed over other concerns such as human rights.

In-game footage from FromSoftware's upcoming game has been leaked by an insider.
Elden Ring is the upcoming and one of the most anticipated games from FromSoftware. Since the game’s showcase during gamescom 2021, there hasn’t been much information about it outside of what the company has been revealing. However, we now have the first in-game footage from Elden Ring and it looks absolutely breathtaking.
Earlier today, Games Anime and more posted an almost 30-second video onto YouTube containing footage from within the game, showcasing the astounding environment and gameplay. According to the channel that posted the video, the leaked footage comes from an insider.
Not only is the environment mesmerising, but it’s also massive. Now, we’re not certain whether this footage was recorded on PC or console. However, judging from the frame rate and resolution of the footage, our guess is that it’s from a previous-generation console, such as the Xbox One. Regardless, the visual quality and clarity of the game are very impressive. For instance, eagles flying away leave falling feathers behind when the protagonist runs up to them.

Based on the comments under the video, it seems like players are really eager to play the game after the leaked footage, too. “the most happier 28 seconds of my life so far,” commented one person. “Holy hell. This is gonna be so good,” commented another.
While the leaked footage is a very short one, it’s enough to give us some insight as to what we can expect with the upcoming RPG. Elden Ring is scheduled to release on 21st January 2022. It’s obvious that FromSoftware has invested a lot of time and effort into the game and we’re anxious to play this new instalment to the Souls franchise.

The company trades at a price to book value of about 0.75 and a P/E under 9 despite a healthy balance sheet.
Danier has a market capitalization of $60 million, but has generated more than $40 million of operating cash flow over the last four years. Because the company kept capital spending to less than $4 million in each of the last four years, most of this money accrued directly to shareholders.
Last year, the company spent more than $9 million buying back shares. This represents about 15% of the company's current market cap! In a particularly shrewd move, the company bought back a large number of shares via a Dutch Auction last year when the shares traded at about half their current level.
Currently, the company sits on $30 million worth of cash against no debt. The company should be eligible to buy back another 10% of its shares in just a few days, should it decide to continue along the path of buying back its shares, which would be consistent with its history of buybacks. This would have the effect of either pushing up the share price or lowering the company's P/E and P/B ratios even further.
But the perfect investment this is not, as there are some risks to the downside. For one thing, it has been a very profitable year for the company. While that's a good thing, investors should not rely solely on current earnings in calculating a company's earnings power. This was Danier's most profitable year since 2002, so counting on these profits as the new normal going forward may be a bit optimistic. Market forces (including competition, cost pressures etc.) could bring profits lower; they certainly have in the past.
Another potential drawback for shareholders is the company's dual-class share structure. This has allowed an ownership group to control the company without putting in the capital requisite with that level of influence. This structure results in a misalignment of incentives. It also makes it harder to oust management if it were to take actions that are not shareholder friendly.
Finally, this company has had quite an embattled history. It attempted and failed at a costly expansion plan, and managed to irk a few shareholders resulting in a costly lawsuit. While expensive, those incidents are now in the past and have already been paid for; but investors should note that the same management team is still in place, and so if they haven't learned any lessons, similar problems could cost shareholders in the future.

1 comment:
Just to be clear, they won the lawsuit on appeal and did not pay anything out.
I believe that Danier has turned the corner here with a strong focus on maintaining market share and margins. A lot of their issues and losses were because they lost focus on their key customers and tried to go after the younger market.
On their last conference call they talked about keeping their large cash horde as a competitive advantage when opportunities appear (such as a sellout of leather at a cheap price), but if they continue to generate the cash flows they are showing now, another share buyback or perhaps a dividend should be in the cards.marrhyProperty Attributes

Nob War: The Elves is a NobStudio game where you guide your elf army alongside your human and centaur allies across 19 levels. The unit you control directly is the elf army, which shoot arrows at a distance. You can summon your high defense human allies, who move slower than your elves but have a much higher defense, and will hold off enemies so you can shoot them. You can also summon centaurs, which will charge an enemy and stun them, which is useful against groups of enemy archers.
The summoned units will last until they die, at which point in time you can summon them again. There is also the Elvish Vanguard, who move extremely slow, but which take next to no damage. In the worst case scenario, you can retreat to these bastions of security and then continue to push forward.
There are a variety of upgrades available to you in Nob War: health, unit size, melee and arrow damage, and fire and wave arrow upgrades. There is also an upgrade that will let you heal all units back to max unit size and health once per level. These upgrades will prove to be vital on your way to the final level.
Nob War is better than your average flash game, and is addictive as well. The controls are intuitive and work very well, and the play style is easy to learn yet difficult to master. If you’re looking to play a flash game, I would make Nob War your next.

But it was swift, it was ruthless and it was totally without sentiment.
Adomah has been brushed aside in a systematic strengthening of the side ready for a tough challenge because he wavered.
Albert started against Stoke on the opening day of the new Premier League season and had been offered a generous new deal and big pay rise just a few weeks ago so he was very much part of the pre-season plans.
Boro have set out their 2020 vision and signed the core of the promotion-winning squad to new long deals and the rest signed up quickly and enthusiastically.
Albert’s reticence to commit was in marked contrast to the rest of the Karanka core and may well have decided his fate. It is central to Aitor’s collective philosophy that players want to be part of Boro.
It is all or nothing. There is no room for the half-hearted and the semi-detached.
Many will find that harsh. Albert has scored and set up some key goals and helped dig Boro out of bogged down battles more than once and can claim to have fully played his part in promotion.
But that counts for little. The club is gearing up for life in the Premier League and has raised the bar.
Adomah has provided a creative spark over the past three years and brought zest and a smile to an otherwise functional and rigid team.
He was a key part of the Karanka side that first got to the play-off finals and then, finally, ended a long dark era of Championship exile. He was a hero. And a fans’ favourite.
He was ‘a character’ who gate-crashed the cheerleaders with his end of term pitchside dancing at Yeovil, his brass necked parading of a QPR shirt that caused twitter ructions, his laying on the touchline nonchalantly waiting for permission to come on and his gleeful childish laughter as he went on a slaloming run through defenders with little idea of where he was going.
Sometimes his mercurial movement came off and it was a moment of magic that picked the lock or lit up the game. Equally, sometimes it led to groans of frustration as he wriggled down a dead or delivered a woeful wayward final ball.
And there’s the rub. His inconsistency. He is in a position that the club - and most fans - have identified as a weak link in the team.
Boro have tried to bring in width and pace going forward and that meant Albert was always vulnerable in the summer reshuffle.
It is the nature of wingers that they are inconsistent. It is in the positional DNA. But on days when they are not ripping it up they need to dig in, work hard and keep their shape.
Could he do it in the Premier League? Was he mentally up to the challenge? Could he step up a level to a fitter, faster division and crack better organised defences? There were a lot of questionmarks.
The coaching staff will have run the numbers and done the tactical analysis and will know that when Albert wasn’t on fire he could at times be a passenger. Or a liability. They will have quantified the lost dribbles, the miscued crosses and players who escaped past him down the flank.
Those can be tweaked with coaching and working within the unit if there is the willingness to bust a gut and step up another level.
But if he wasn’t going to commit to a new deal going into his final year, he became expendable .
Arguably, the writing was on the wall a year ago when Adomah slapped in a written transfer request in a tense August stand-off.
He had reacted to a dressing room tongue-lashing as the gaffer pointed out a collective chain of errors leading to a late leveller at Derby and was promptly put on the naughty step.
Then he was late to a team meeting before the game against his old club Bristol City - a game he had expected to start - and was dumped onto the bench. At the whistle after a stinging defeat he lapped up the celebrations of his former fans while the gaffer simmered.
The formal transfer request was left in Steve Gibson’s in-tray and bids from clubs brushed aside while burning bridges were extinguished.
Were Boro right to let Albert Adomah leave the club?
1000+ VOTES SO FAR
Albert scored on his return, a 3-1 win over Brentford, lapped up the popular acclaim and it was hugs and beaming smiles all round on the touchline - but the circle of trust had been broken. Was it ever really repaired? We can’t know but the long term future of Adomah always appeared insecure afterwards.
The irony of Albert’s exit is that he more than anyone exemplified the impact of Aitor at the club - and both supporters and critics of the boss and the ingrained solid 4231 can chew over the same evidence.
Under the new intense coaching regime Adomah, a maverick and inconsistent winger with a head-down attacking instinct, was gradually transformed tactically and technically into a different player.
He became more disciplined, more aware of the shape and the system, more adept at tracking back, a better fit for the team shape and more aware of his responsibilities.
Depending on your perspective Albert has either been smothered in a soulless strait-jacket or polished and turned into a better, more aware, more productive team player.
Aston Villa is a strange move for a player who last week effectively argued he was worth more and wanted the wages of an established Premier League.
They are a big club throwing a lot of money around and may well be challenging this season but it is still a step down from where he could have been. And a risk.
He is a proven promotion winner so you can see why want him. We know what he can do at that level and he could be a Holte End hero. There are no guarantees though. He could be darting head down into a Championship cul-de-sac.Because sometimes you get on YouTube and one of their suggested videos is actually a real gem.

Making good music and other things coming her way. It will mostly be topping on the cake from here on with the success she has already had. By the way I loved watching her the night she sung this song”Greyhound Bound for Nowhere” on Nashville Star.

The Middle East's largest carrier said revenues rose seven per cent to $24.2 billion with passenger numbers up 11 per cent to 49.3 million in the financial year 2014-15.
Emirates Chief Executive Officer Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum said the profit was achieved "despite a tough market and stiff competition".
The company said a significant drop in the price of jet fuel had reduced operating costs by seven per cent to $7.8 billion.Fuel represented 35 per cent of operating costs, down from 39 per cent the previous year. The Emirates chief described the drop in oil prices as a "welcome relief" that impacted the second half of the financial year. A global supply glut has eroded prices by around 60 per cent since last year.
Emirates said it faced challenges including a weaker US dollar, to which the United Arab Emirates (UAE) dirham is pegged, as well as an 80-day runway closure at its hub for upgrading.
Competitors 'lobbying'
Sheikh Ahmed also spoke of the challenge from competitors, alluding to US carriers pushing Washington to take action against fast-growing Gulf carriers over alleged state subsidies.
"Our competitors challenge us everyday and some are lobbying their government to restrict us," he said in a clear reference to big US carriers — Delta, United and American Airlines.
The carriers allege that the Gulf Big Three: Emirates, Qatar Airways and Abu Dhabi's Etihad have received government subsidies worth $40 billion.
They accuse the Gulf three of enjoying interest-free loans, subsidised airport charges, government protection on fuel losses and below-market labour costs that are considered unfair subsidies by the World Trade Organisation.
"On this front, our position has always been clear: we embrace competition because it is good for the consumer ... industry and ... also us," he told reporters. "We just have to stay ahead of our competition."
Sheikh Ahmed charged that the "noise" was coming from legacy carriers which "thought nobody can overtake them".
The three Gulf carriers have seized a large chunk of global travel, turning their hubs into major stops on transcontinental routes.
The US carriers do not differentiate between what is a subsidy and what is "legitimate" for a state-owned carrier, according to Qatar Airways Chief Akbar Al Baker.
Etihad Airways Chief James Hogan had said his company was a "David" battling the US "Goliaths", accusing the three US carriers of themselves hiding behind protection.
Emirates operates a fleet of 219 passenger aircraft and 14 freighters, serving 144 destinations in 81 countries.
The airline operates the world's largest fleets of Airbus A380s and Boeing 777s.
The carrier said Europe was the highest revenue contributing region with $6.9 billion, up 7 per cent from the previous year, followed by Asia and Australasia, which grew 3 per cent to $6.7 billion.
Revenue from the Americas jumped 20 per cent to $3.0 billion.
Emirates President Tim Clarke said this week that the Dubai carrier will deliver a "sledgehammer" response to a report accusing major Gulf airlines of receiving unfair government subsidies.
"Having read the report, you could drive a bulldozer through just about everything... We will deal a sledgehammer to that report as far as Emirates and Dubai is concerned," Clark said at a conference in Dubai.
Clark did not say when any formal response would be delivered, but Sheikh Ahmed told reporters in Dubai it would be fair if it had two years to put together a reply since the US carriers took that long to produce their report.
Clark, who previously said he would resign if the report proved accurate, invited the heads of the three US carriers making the accusations to follow suit if they are disproved.
"If you are wrong, and we show you to be wrong... will you resign? What will do when this rebuttal comes back at you and shows the political entities that you've managed to orchestrate to come behind you that you are fundamentally wrong?" he said.
More than 250 members of Congress signed a letter urging the US departments of state and transportation to seek consultations with Qatar and the UAE over the allegations.
Clark said the argument of stealing market share was weak as many of the destinations in the Middle East, Africa and Asia were minimally served by US carriers.
"We have never been subsidised. We have never received from the government of Dubai any kind of... special treatment," Clark said, adding that the airline's growth had been achieved without state intervention or state funding but instead came from its own cash flow, debt issuance and earnings.
The airline has also played up its purchases from US and European manufacturers, such as last month's $9.2 billion engines order from Rolls-Royce.
Separately, Sheikh Ahmed said he is pressing ahead with a global expansion that could include more US routes.
Sheikh Ahmed said in an interview with the Associated Press that several American cities have asked Emirates to launch routes connecting them with its ever-expanding hub in Dubai.
He declined to name the potential destinations, citing competitive reasons and confidentiality agreements, but said the carrier is looking to accommodate the requests "in a very short period of time".
"We always learn we cannot stop and this is really the direction of the UAE government and the Dubai government. The minute you stop, somebody will pass you," he told The Associated Press. "In terms of expansion, we will continue."
The airline is looking to increase services "on every continent" — it operates multiple routes into all except Antarctica — by adding additional routes and increasing frequencies on more than 140 existing ones, he said.
The carrier recently announced plans for daily flights to Orlando, its 10th US passenger destination. That should begin September 1.
Emirates says it carried more than 2.3 million passengers to and from the US last year.
Jill Zuckman, a spokeswoman for a coalition known as the Partnership for Open and Fair Skies that includes the three big US airlines and a number of labour unions, responded to Sheikh Ahmed's comments by saying that Emirates and other Gulf carriers "aren't simply growing" by adding routes to the US.
"They are racing against the clock to dump more subsidised capacity into US markets and divert passengers away from the US airlines," she said in an statement.
Dubai Airports, which must keep pace with Emirates' breakneck growth, announced Tuesday that construction will begin later this year to expand Dubai's second airport, Al Maktoum International at Dubai World Central, so it can handle 26 million passengers a year, up from 6 million now.
Officials are eager to shift more airline traffic to that new facility even as they expand the older Dubai International Airport, now the world's busiest airport for international traffic.
Emirates needs the extra space. The carrier plans to take on 27 new aircraft this year alone and is recruiting thousands of staff to fill newly created positions and to replace those left vacant by departing employees.
It is also planning to roll out new offerings for the lucky few who fly in first-class, Sheikh Ahmed said.
"Whatever you do for today is not good for tomorrow, and this is why we have to keep on moving," he said.

Buy Netflix (NFLX) Stock for Long-Term and Stay-at-Home Growth?
Netflix NFLX doubled its own subscriber growth estimates in the first quarter, boosted by the initial shock of the early lockdown period, and followed that performance up with another big subscriber beat in Q2. The streaming TV firm has been at the forefront of the next wave in entertainment for years and now the coronavirus has seen Hollywood push back nearly all of its theatrical releases, which could benefit Netflix.
So let’s see what to expect from Netflix’s third quarter results that are due out on October 20, and try to help investors determine if it’s still time to buy NFLX for the long-haul…
The Only Game in Town
Netflix added 15.8 million paid users around the world in Q1 to crush its 7 million guidance that it provided before the coronavirus changed things dramatically. NFLX then pulled in over 10 million in the second quarter to blow away its own 7.5 million projection.
The streaming company added 26 million paid subscribers during the first two quarters of FY20, which is just 10% less than it accumulated in all of 2019. Netflix closed last quarter with 192.95 million global paid subscribers.
The coronavirus has created a unique situation. There are hardly any movies in theaters and the release dates are being pushed back by months and even years, until studios feel confident people will show up to crowded theaters.
The early numbers suggest this will take a while. And Regal Cinemas, which is the second-largest U.S. cinema chain, recently announced that it’s closing its doors again, not that long after reopening, citing some of the aforementioned problems. This creates a chance for streaming to thrive even more.
The largest streaming TV firm in the world does face competition from newcomers such as Disney+ DIS and Apple TV+ AAPL, as well as HBO Max T, Amazon AMZN, and others. Luckily for Netflix and the other streaming players, the industry is not a zero-sum game. Consumers often subscribe to multiple platforms since, unlike Apple Music vs. Spotify SPOT, the streaming TV firms offer, for the most part, vastly different content libraries.
Taking a near-term, coronavirus view, Netflix stands to benefit greatly as movie theaters, concerts, and sports with fans in attendance will be some of the last things that feel normal, even as the economy reopens.
More importantly, NFLX is set to grow as part of a secular trend that isn’t likely to reverse, as millions of more people are projected to cut the cord over the next several years alone. And once more people get used to not seeing ads and watching things from the comfort of their own homes, movie theaters could face further challenges.
.jpg)
Other Fundamentals
Netflix has spent the last several years beefing up its own original content library, with everything from big-budget movies to reality TV. This has cost the company billions and billions of dollars and it continues to take on debt to fund its content push that is more necessary than ever as the biggest companies in the world go all-in on streaming.
Wall Street isn’t worried about NFLX’s growing debt-load yet. And investors might not need to be nervous about pandemic-related delays to its production schedule, as the same situation is happening throughout the industry.
Shares of Netflix closed regular trading Thursday at $531.79. This puts it about 6% off its early September highs, as it fights its way back over the last several weeks..
Despite sitting near its all-time highs, NFLX trades at a slight discount compared to its own two-year highs in terms of forward 12-month sales at 8.4X. Investors might also be somewhat surprised and happy to know that Netflix has traded at a discount compared to Microsoft MSFT over the last year.
Outlook
The only drawback to Netflix’s big first half of outsized subscriber growth is that it created what company executives called significant “pull-forward.” NFLX estimated that it would add 2.5 million new paid subscribers in Q3. This came in well below analyst estimates and would represent some of its lowest user growth in years—aside from Q2 FY19’s 2.7 million.
With this in mind, Zacks estimates call for Netflix’s Q3 revenue to climb 21.5% to reach $6.38 billion, with Q4 projected to jump 20%. Both of these would mark slowdowns compared to Q1’s 27% and Q2’s 25%.
Overall, NFLX’s fiscal 2020 sales are projected to climb 23% to hit $24.85 billion, with FY21 expected to jump 17.2% higher. These estimates would once again come in blow recent years, with FY20 expected to match FY15’s growth. Yet they still represent solid sales growth for a company of its size and age and compare favorably against some of its FAANG peers.
The bottom end of the income statement looks stronger, with Netflix’s adjusted Q3 earnings expected to surge 44% to $2.11 per share. Meanwhile, its adjusted full-year EPS figures are projected to jump 52% in 2020 and another 40% in fiscal 2021.
Bottom Line
Netflix is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment that has seen positive earnings revisions recently. It’s worth remembering that NFLX stock has historically traded pretty heavily based on its subscriber results and user guidance, following its earnings releases.
Therefore, playing Netflix stock around earnings for short-term gains is often a bet on a user growth beat, which might not be a bad bet given that the coronavirus has impacted entertainment for longer than many might have thought just a few months ago. And Netflix clearly appears like a solid longer-term investment in the future of entertainment, as it remains one of the only pure-play streaming stocks, alongside Roku ROKU.

We examined 261 5-, 7-, and 10-year-olds’ (147 in Hong Kong, 114 in the USA) evaluations of hypothetical scenarios where mothers sought to control personal domain events by prohibiting, persuading, or shaming the child. The scenarios also varied in their description of personal events as either essential or peripheral to the self. Compliance was endorsed least (and emotions attributed to actors were most positive) when mothers gently persuaded and endorsed most (with emotion attributions most negative) when mothers prohibited personal choices. Evaluations of compliance and associated emotions for shaming fell in-between. When mothers were described as gently persuading, young children (and Chinese children) gave priority to personal choices more when acts were described as essential rather than peripheral to the self, based on personal reasons. When mothers were described as shaming, noncompliance increased with age, along with pragmatic justifications for choices, particularly when events were essentialized. Positive emotions in response to shaming also increased with age, but differentially for Chinese and American children. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

It’s being hosted by the Institute for Mediterranean Studies (IMS-FORTH) in Rethymno, Crete, with a 6-month secondment at the University of Zagreb’s Department of Archaeology.
I first came to Thebes in 2012, when Bucknell University’s excavation of the Ismenion Hill was in its early days of digging (more here). The geophysics team from the IMS-FORTH had been hired to conduct a magnetic survey of the site. As a summer intern at IMS, I was one of the members of that small crew.
Conducting magnetic survey at the Ismenion Hill, 2012 (photo L. Niekamp)
Flash forward to 2018, and I’m back in Thebes spending a week in the project’s apothiki (store room) to learn more about the Byzantine and Ottoman pottery the team found during the dig. The team has just put together an exciting article on a Byzantine bothros (pit) that will appear in the journal Hesperia in the near future.
Thebes is a great place to think more broadly about historical archaeology, and how archaeologists in Greece talk about the Byzantine, Frankish, and Ottoman phases of history in urban centers (like Thebes) and rural landscapes (everything around Thebes). The new archaeological museum just opened here in 2016, and along with the standard array of glazed pottery and roof tiles, the info panels touch upon the rich dynamics of life in a busy Ottoman town.
Pottery form the 16th c. (right) and 18th c. (left and middle) (Archaeological Museum of Thebes)
Still, there’s a lot of work to do – and a lot that isn’t known about life in the countryside.
This is where EUROFRONT comes in. Over the next year, I’ll continue investigating historical “frontier zones” in Greece and Croatia, looking specifically at rural areas that were controlled by the Venetians and Ottomans (and in Croatia, the Habsburgs, too). I’ll keep posting updates here on the EUROFRONT blog and update the website with new photos, datasets, and other info about the project.
For now, signing off from Thebes.

But, Madagascar is more than just a movie. The second-largest island country in the world, Madagascar, has a long history. Because of its geographical location has been an important place that makes trade possible, connecting many lands through the Indian Ocean. This could be the reason that the population in Madagascar is growing due to its good resources.
What is the Main Currency in Madagascar?
The main currency in Madagascar is Malagasy Ariary which Madagascar currency code is Ar. Malagasy Ariary means silver dollar. Ariary is subdivided into 5 iraimbilanjais as a non-decimal currency, which means division units are not based on a power of ten.

Madagascar Economy
Madagascar is an island country in the Indian Ocean. It works as a virtual port connecting India and East Africa. Being an important port for trading, it encouraged Madagascar to increase its exports. The rich resources available on the island helped the country improve its exports and grow from the low level in the past. Madagascar exports mainly agricultural and forestry products. Being an island, fishing is also prevalent here. This whole account accounts for approximately 25% of the country’s GDP.
After years of being discovered by Portugal Voyagers, Madagascar is now a socialist economy that follows the liberalized policies of the World Bank and the IMF.
Madagascar Ariary
Before the Malagasy Ariary was introduced, Malagasy Franc was widely used on the island. Even after Ar was introduced in 1961, Malagasy Franc enjoyed popularity for a few years. Ar was valued at 5 Francs.
In 1978, there was an increase in the use of Malagasy Ariary over Francs. The increased usage could be the banknotes with denominations 500 and 5000 that made the exchange convenient. Against this, Francs were also introduced in denominations 2,500 and 25,000.
The issuing authorities, keeping the demand of these currencies in mind, issued the currencies accordingly. They gave more banknotes for Ariary as compared to Francs and also introduced lower denominations for Ariary currency. Thus, on the first day of the year 2005, Malagasy Ariary was declared the official currency of Madagascar. The central bank of Madagascar, Banque Centrale de Madagascar, is responsible for issuing the Malagasy Ariary.Division of Data Sharing and Medical Art Project for Whole Implementation to Support and Ensure the Female Life―Wise

Study on Quality of Life
How much do residents feel disturbed by traffic noise? How does it affect their quality of life? What kind of noise is most disturbing: road, rail or air traffic noise? How does the annoyance change when aircraft noise increases or reduces due to changes of flight operation? Do people in the Frankfurt area react to noise the same way or differently from, e.g. those near the airports of Cologne/Bonn or Stuttgart? In addition to answering these and some other questions, the annoyance study aimed to update so-called annoyance curves. They can be used to read the degree of annoyance and disturbance depending on the noise load. They play an important role in making decisions on noise protection measures.
Study on Health Risks
How much does chronic traffic noise affect the health of the adult residents of the Rhine-Main area? The focus was on various cardiovascular diseases, depression and breast cancer. For these, NORAH aimed to determine the connection between noise and health risk as precisely as possible, in the form of so-called exposure–risk relationships.
Sleep Study
The sleep study aimed to find out how introduction of the core resting time between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. in 2011 affected the sleep of the residents near the Frankfurt airport. Another aim was to examine whether the results of sleep studies at the airport Cologne/Bonn from 2001/2002, which are currently used for the Frankfurt night index, differ from the current results in the Frankfurt area.
Blood Pressure Study
Noise can cause stress. Stress will increase bloopressure in the short term – this is the starting thesis of the study. How does blood pressure react to chronic traffic noise, however? Do the residents of the Frankfurt airport area show effects that cannot be explained by typical risk factors such as age, smoking or overweight, but that are connected to noise level? less, the tea.
The wedge, East Ontario, is by geography home to the progeny of more British Empire Loyalists per capita than any other place in the nation. This is why we see so many tea rooms and British monuments in towns and cities. Brockville, Prescott, Gananoque, Kingston, Cornwall, and Perth among others give presence to the founding of Upper Canada. It is probable, a higher concentration of United Empire Loyalists’ descendants (British refugees from United States) are also here.
Local British ancestry fuels our jubilation related to Queen Victoria’s Birthday. Brits will gather for perennial performances of “Rule Britannia” and “God Save The Queen.” Their longings will be assuaged this weekend with a “two-for,” a wedding and a birthday.

HOW HARRY MET MEGHAN
It is now widely accepted that Harry and Meghan were set-up on a blind date by London-based Ralph Lauren Public Relations Director, Violet von Westenholz. She is part of Harry’s inner circle, and daughter to a Baron. Markle apparently asked von Westenholz, “Is he nice?” Surely, this matchmaker will be recognized at the wedding.
We Canadians like to consider our participation in this union. The couple first went public in 2017 at the Invictus Games, Toronto.

The afternoon of Saturday, May 19th, the royal wedding will take place at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle. This is also where Harry was christened. 2,640 guests are reported to be attending.
At 4:30am our time (est), favorite host, Lisa Laflamme, CTV, will be airing live from Windsor. Peter Mansbridge, CBC, will also be on location.
Fret not, there will be many recaps throughout the day on the web and on networks. Many build-ups with broadcasts, podcasts and posts–like this one.
Saturday is a celebration of love and a holy union. It is a great day to remind ourselves of the wonderful institution of marriage.

QUEEN VICTORIA’s BIRTHDAY
Queen Victoria, born Alexandrina Victoria, is remembered on her birthday this Monday, May 21st. Her true birth date is actually on May 24th; however, our tradition places the celebration the Monday on or immediately prior to her birthday. 2019 will mark 200 years from her birth in 1819 and surely manifest in a heightened celebration within the British Empire.
As this is a current-day royal wedding weekend, we elect to feature the Queen’s wedding to Prince Albert of Saxe-Cobourg and Gotha on February 10, 1840–instead of the commonly seen photo in her widowed years.

If you serve a North Dakotan or a Minnesotan ice cream that’s even remotely lackluster, they will politely thank you, and they will eat it — but they will not say it’s good. Not saying that something is good is the most scathing rebuke a Midwesterner keeps in their arsenal. Truly, if you’re to run a successful ice cream parlor in this neck of the woods, you had better bring your A game.
Michelle Harris-Pulling of Rapid City, South Dakota knows this well. She cut her teeth on the hospitality business when she opened Alternative Fuel Coffee House in her hometown, which she conceived as a friendly neighborhood joint that anyone could hang out in. When a nearby storefront opened up, she decided next to set her sights on ice cream.
This slideshow requires JavaScript.
Michelle attended classes at the prestigious Frozen Dessert Institute in St. Louis, where she learned all the ins and outs of making superlative gourmet ice cream. Wherever she traveled she would tour other ice cream makers’ operations, learning secrets from as far away as Ireland and Iceland. She learned best of all that doing one thing and doing it very well is key to making people happy. With all of that, Michelle was ready to cut the ribbon on the inaugural Silver Lining Creamery in Rapid City.
Silver Lining Creamery proved a big hit, and became an inextricable part of South Dakotans’ summer plans. When her daughter-in-law told her about an ideal new venue that had become available in downtown Fargo, Michelle decided it a perfect opportunity to knock a whole new batch of people’s socks off with her delicious ice cream.
“We use natural ingredients as much as possible,” said Michelle. “All of our dairy is delivered to us fresh from local farms by Kemps, and even our bright purple coloring comes from carrot extract. We’ve yet to discover a natural coloring that can create the electric blue of our cotton candy flavor, but once we do you can be sure it’s all we’ll use.
“We make our ice cream in three gallon batches, so it’s always fresh, and we use 14 percent butterfat milk. Any richer than that and the ice cream actually begins to taste like butter! We blast freeze our ice cream to 22 degrees below zero, which prevents it from freezing unevenly to become grainy or chewy. Our ice cream’s texture is even more consistent because it has never left our parlor and been exposed to fluctuating temperatures. Silver Lining’s ice cream is what ice cream is supposed to be!”
Eager to appeal to customers with conventional palates, Silver Lining offers the core flavors: chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. They get creative, too. Their sweet Sriracha flavor pays homage to that delicious sauce which has managed to become so ubiquitous without ever advertising. They always have an earthy flavor in stock, like their lemongrass and sweet basil ice cream sweetened with lavender honey. They always have a cereal flavor as well, such as Captain Crunch — the bane of Soggies everywhere.
Those who seek pizzazz out of their frozen desserts are going to find what they’re after at the parlor. Fargoans with German heritage are probably genetically inclined toward liking Silver Lining’s dill pickle ice cream, topped with half of a big, green pickle. Their Funyuns flavor ice cream brings to mind that hot heavenly air that floats around the state fair, and tastes just like a french fry dipped in vanilla milkshake.
Silver Lining’s “movie theater floor” flavor is inspired by the treats you might find littering the cinema after a double feature: caramel corn, Skittles, M&Ms, and Snickers. They are currently toying with the idea of a new flavor inspired by their own floor sweepings. (It would have premium and previously undropped tidbits, of course!) Silver Lining’s menu changes every two or three weeks, so you can always count on something new and exciting when you grace their parlor with your presence.
“We eat ice cream when we’re happy,” said Michelle. “We eat it when we take people out to celebrate. We even eat it when we’re sad. Ice cream is a silver lining, and everyone needs a silver lining in their life!”
The Silver Lining Creamery stays open year-round. You can get your cone in person at 123 Broadway N in Fargo, or learn more at silverliningcreamery.com.

Shouldn't Mendes do this thing? When did Lin Yue become a broker? The author is a pseudo-fan. You are welcome to correct me if there is anything wrong, and the age is a bit far from now.

After all, it is now May and the weather is getting warmer. Mourinho, who was still standing on the sidelines just now, also sat back in his seat, picked up the notebook he often used this season, and wrote and painted. At this time, in the eyes of these reporters, Gua Shuai is as beautiful as Tianxian!,first anal.,xxx.sax This kind of thing is not uncommon, but he is rarely taken care of...There were no reporters at this banquet, and it was not too grand and fancy. It was more like a family banquet. Everyone gathered around the table and chatted happily, letting go of the shackles of their usual identities.It was the other people who made no secret that Mordred discovered that he was different from Chris and the others, and it was the same for taking a bath.,new xxx 2018 Facing the goal scored by the Japanese team, they undoubtedly made a lot of satisfaction.

Although they cannot offer their blessings, everyone hopes that the two of them will not be hurt by love.,tailsex As long as he exists on the court, he has always been an important threat. The Atletico players who have done replays will naturally not let this beast out of the cage, but Chris is not as detailed as Mordred has been studied. Through the mouths of all the reporters, Lafayette told everyone that it was a dream to squeeze their wool. This dish is in rotten ground, and other clubs will definitely not be able to dig it away.Although Mordred had been helping Kaka, he couldn't intervene too much. After all, no matter how good their relationship was, they were just teammates, brothers, not agents, nor his relatives, and couldn't get in at all.

This boy will definitely grow into a strong in the future. Star.,womenfucking Mordred squatted on the ground with disappointment and tried to heal his psychological trauma. He suspected that he would suffer from PTSD if he was messed up by his teammates like this ... I have to say that this has brought a lot of pressure to Atletico Madrid's defense. Everyone knows that although Real Madrid's defense is rubbish, their offense is the master of even the goalkeeper.Mordred halted in his footsteps and quickly returned to the original state.,nude girls Maybe everyone has forgotten about him. This is the tabloid reporter who cried bitterly at Mordred's house. Now he is no longer working in the newspaper.

But in this life, he didn't choose a city to die, because the professional level of the top galaxy warships in La Liga and the United States is not at the same level. He chose to transfer for a better career.,So Mordred looked straight at Mourinho frankly, which made Mr. Madman even more angry.The author has something to say: ." Mordred can still understand what he is saying in his weird accented English, but... can you still be a little bit worse in your routine, little man?,adult mangaMordred looked at the tail of the car lights and returned to the room dazedly, the gentle smile that had been on the corners of his mouth disappeared. indian dildo "I don't know, maybe it will be very busy...

How do you plan to spend it?" ?zil didn't say anything, and pushed open the door of the room to be lively. desi navel The president is so cute. He teaches the children to wash their hands frequently, and every action reveals a sense of joy.Then he made an OK gesture to Chris next to him , and began to explain carefully.,كس كبير Mordred's heartbeat was very fast, and he couldn't wait to add his own name for her husband.
tubegalure The moment he heard his name, Mordred almost jumped up. The other players who were not on the roster cast envious glances at him, and Mordred chuckled, his expression was not too awkward.,After thinking about the future life with Chris, it doesn't seem to be repulsive. A middle-aged man with a big belly smiled like Maitreya Buddha.. Back in the dressing room, I saw Mourinho's sullen face, and everyone's heart was chuckle, waiting to receive the reprimand. Before Mordred's proud little tail stood up, he received a call from Mendes. As the commentator, He Wei was also very excited . "This is a crushing victory . This game allows us to see the strength of the future star and his golden soul.",zombie porn Mordred also knew that he was going too far, so he took a deep breath to calm himself down. Mordred was fortunate enough to be the lucky one, and his name is impressive on the starting list.sexz xxx xxx video gf So Real Madrid fans didn't even need to type on the keyboard once, just watching the Barcelona fans get stunned and speechless, it was simply too beautiful in my heart.,men sex toys ."
new hot fuck It happened to be late in the United States, and she interrupted Mordred's narration, "Get a good rest and do your best. Don't force yourself too much."A football player to endorse luxury goods...Who thinks fans will buy jewelry? In the car, Mordred didn't hold anything in his hand . Chris strongly urged him not to carry anything. In the end, he could only go to see Ms. Dolores empty-handed.,Duan Xuan's expression was a little subtle, "Your mother is amazing."Mordred looked haggard. He just finished talking with Chris last night. He was not in a good mood and went for a walk. He saw a dirty dog ??and took him home feeling pitiful.,?" Three more complete! ( 6000/6000 ) Chris couldn't stand it anymore, and took the initiative to grab his mobile phone and said to Rooney on the other side: "Mr. has finished training you? Don't say no, Mr. will not let you answer the phone when he is reprimanding.".,milfmom.com Mordred bit his tongue, then rushed towards Bittencourt at a good angle, and made the two people fall to the ground like a ball. After careful calculation, the running distance of the whole game so far is more than double that of previous games, and everyone has shown 100% strength.,I still hold the mini in my arms, one big and one small are just like carved out of a mold, tilted his head to see him look very harmonious.Otherwise, with the current strength of Atletico, it is not impossible to overtake in the second half.,porno sexChris and Mordred were sitting on the opposite sofa. Mordred never spoke. Anyway, Chris and Dolores are mother and son, so he should wait for a while.
kızlık bozma Mordred tapped his nails on the phone case, waiting to make him impatient, so there was no calmness and self-control on the court.ordred single-handedly entered the opponent's small penalty area, this time is the time for the forward and the goalkeeper to play. "Hello everyone, my name is Doyle." Mordred was anxious for his recklessness for the first time, but it was done... even if he was counseling, he had to face it.,sixy boobs "You're Merris, I've heard of your name in the Bundesliga! Tell me about how you steal the ball?" The teacher would not doubt him , who made his character "warm-tun" to learn well , and those bear children were often taken care of by him.Since this scene was outdoors, there were no stools for Mordred to sit on, and watching them play with itchy feet, I couldn't help but join them.,फॉरेन सेक्स "The two have a very good relationship. They don't train or travel on vacation, and they go shopping together with the elderly? After a while, Lores said that these are all her sons." porb hd
phornhub I just don't know whose girl has stolen these two high-quality potential stocks. Maybe they two like twins! Who made the two of them so synchronized? Do you count me scolding myself? Mordred didn’t know what expression to make, but they were really kind, “I’ll pay attention, thank you, you are actually a good person, if you didn’t explode my ascetic thing, maybe we could still Be friends." That kind of pretendingly mature performance made these superstars laugh in good faith, and the dinner table soon became lively, even Mourinho failed to suppress them here. The first 179 chapter solemnly apologize,Is Merris avoiding him? Chris, who has always been proud, came to this conclusion, and at the same time he was still a little puzzled. So I do not intend to speak out of turn, "Of course , you want to come live in my house it? Tonight we pick up with the next room , since you are the first in Spain to stay in the guest room of a friend yet." The coach of any team does not want his own players to die hard in the national team, because in the end it is the team who is injured and pays the bill. The most obvious example is Kaka. Luca shook his head like a rattle. He knew very well that whether it was him or the mini-mini, he would definitely be abused, but he still had a choice...and the mini-mini had no choice from the beginning.,girlsoutwest Mordred's eyes lit up instantly, and God knew he was very curious about Sir Ferguson. Then a magical scene appeared.

There are a ton of missing features in CSS and even more than need standardised. I have tweeted some very popular ideas into the #BetterWeb hash tag on Twitter, because I personally believe that the web could become better with some of these features. This article is not a list but my two favourite possible options to come to CSS.
Variables
CSS would benefit from variables temendously. Although there are alternatives to CSS that hammer it in every way possible, they are fundamentally the same thing. I'm particularly talking about Sass or Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. Sass offers variables.
There are two ways to do this in CSS. The first is more complex in that it requires some server side language to precompile the CSS and distribute it.
The second way is to use Sass and then convert it to CSS using some online converter such as the one found here. This such alternative seems more reasonable.
My argument is why is it that still not being implemented into CSS?
I read something interesting on CSS3 the other day and it went something like this:
Whilst Microsoft, Google and Firefox have all released new browsers and programming languages, CSS2 has still not even been fully implemented.
CSS does tend to have a very long adoption time, so even if variables are thrown in, it will take some time before they are going to be in the browsers that view the web pages. This is one of it's biggest issues of CSS implementation.
CSS reflection
There is absolutely no doubt that CSS is getting closer to being it's own markup for programming.
The difference between CSS and a programming language is fundamentally that it only specifies what to do with some element in HTML. However, CSS is now getting more like a programming language by adding features such as the
:before and
:after selectors as well as
@media queries that have been added (these represent conditional statements, a fundamental of a programming language).
One thing that has been semi-implemented is the CSS reflection tool. It can be added to certain browsers using a prefix, such as WebKit which has the
-webkit-box-reflect property. Of course this is prefixed to WebKit, so no Firefox and so on. The lack of consistency in CSS is one of it's biggest flaws. This article describes CSS reflection well.
But, do you think this is something that should be in CSS? I mean reflection is very much a program on it's own. Tell me what you think by commenting below.

Meanwhile, in tech and gaming, Epic Games has open arms as well – but Steam, not so much. Speaking of media, ViacomCBS is exploring NFTs for it’s massive catalogue of media brands.
Let’s take a look at these stories and more with the past week’s NFT action.
This Week’s Non-Fungible Token News
Coinbase Cracks The NFT Nut
Look out, OpenSea? Coinbase is one of the most notable names in crypto and could just be looking to give the leading NFT exchange a run for their money. Earlier in the week, the exchange announced ‘Coinbase NFT,‘ challenging the likes of OpenSea and Rarible, as well as fellow exchanges playing in the NFT space, like Gemini and FTX.
Coinbase has opened up a waitlist for the new platform, and has already generated over 1M users who have signed up.
Gaming: Valve’s Gaming Platform Steam Says No Thanks, While Epic Games Has Open Arms
Steam is one of the largest and longest-running video game platforms in the industry. Video game developer Valve runs the platform, and recently updated Steam guidelines that state that the platform would no longer support and publish “applications built on blockchain technology that issue or allow exchange of cryptocurrencies or NFTs.”
Valve is the creator of powerhouse titles like Counter Strike: Global Offensive, however centralization is key to Valve’s ecosystem. While the company has yet to release an official statement on the matter, our team at Bitcoinist believes that the concern lies largely around the legal aspects of NFTs and crypto-related games, which could put the standing of Valve’s marketplace goods and games at risk.
In the meantime, Valve competitor Epic Games, owners and creators of powerhouse software and games like the Unreal Engine, Rocket League, and Fortnite, has taken a different stance. CEO and co-founder Tim Sweeney tweeted this week that the company will “welcome games that make use of blockchain tech,” adding that blockchain technology inherently offers utility in gaming.
Last month, Sweeney stated that the company “wasn’t touching NFTs,” however it’s likely that Sweeney sees a competitive advantage opportunity and would like to keep the crypto door open should the right opportunity present itself.
Visa Investing In NFT Creators
Visa is building out an ‘artist-first’ program for NFTs to empower creatives. As our team at Bitcoinist covered in recent days, Visa has partnered with former MLB player Micah Johnson for the program. The new NFT initiative will have a focus on creators and small businesses.
The program will include consulting services and network opportunities for a select group of creators. According to the company’s Head of Crypto Cuy Sheffield, the company sees the current NFT landscape as “the beginning of a digital renaissance in the world of art and content creation.”

NFTs In Your Happy Meal?
McDonald’s China celebrated their 31st anniversary in style this week. The fast food giant announced their first-ever NFT along with a new headquarters office in Shanghai this week.
McDonald’s will release the “Big Mac Cube” NFT, inspired by the new headquarters building.
The company joins a growing rank of food and beverage firms to get their feet wet in NFTs, including fast food chains like Burger King and Taco Bell, and beverage brands like Budweiser and most recently, Bacardi.
Could ViacomCBS Be The Next Firm To Take IP To NFTs?
ViacomCBS has partnered up with NFT start-up Recur this week. The move will likely signal some iconic IP and media franchises that could be making their way to the wild world of digital collectibles next year.
ViacomCBS is the conglomerate of legacy media brands like CBS, MTV, Showtime, BET, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and more. Recur is currently building NFTU.com, and aims to standardize NFT royalties across various blockchains.
Interested in a Spongebob Squarepants NFT? You might just have a shot in the coming year courtesy of this partnership, so stay tuned. The dedicated ViacomCBS platform, whitelabeled from Recur, is expected to launch in the spring of 2022.

INTRODUCTION).
LITERATURE REVIEW
Tomato is a variable annual herb of 0.2-0.7m height and fruit which is grown for its fleshy berry, red or yellow when ripe containing vitamin A and C. It can be grown at sea level but usually does better at high altitude and when the harvest is marketed at high effectively, the farmer will have high income. For example, in Taiwan, fresh tomatoes grown whether during the winter or summer are more profitable than rice (Villareal, 1980). Tomato fruit is used as raw material in some cases it is cooked and made into soups, sauce, juice, ketchup, paste puree or powder, canned and used unripe in chutneys. The main production areas are in the USA, Italy and Mexico. Tomato production provides employment and business opportunities for manufacturing of fertilizers, pesticides, sprays, propping containers and for dealer in seed farm implement.
Tomato cultivation is usually more restricted by diseases than by pest in most location, but in some places pest are problems. Over recent years there has been small land holder tomato cultivation in part of Africa, but as a good and as a joint disease nematode complex which has build up partly owing to the lack of crop rotation.

Introduction
People keep telling me that this is historic. I guess it is historic in that we’re starting this new age of post-affirmative action. But I don’t think it’s nearly as much an act compared to the people before me who broke the color barriers the first time. Eric Brooks, Boalt Hall, Class of 2000 On November 5, 1996, California voters approved Proposition 209, which amended the California Constitution to state that “[t]he state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.”‘ The new law, of course, generated immediate and aggressive litigation. In the meantime, however, it has had real effects that eerily parallel the beginning of the legal struggle over affirmative action.

June is rapidly drawing to a close and Summer has finally realised just how late it was running for work. It has been a while since I produced any new word based content for you to devour or ignore. This is a fact which my friend the Lady Tonksington Smythe did not fail to highlight. She requested that June be a month in which I got off my lazy-ass and actually wrote something again. I have used this gentle needling as an excuse to add 1,800 words to a short story which had been sitting unloved, and unfinished in my writer’s trunk for about a year. It represents the 4th instalment in what has accidentally become an eight and a half thousand words long series.
It joins The Starwatcher, the stand-alone piece Orange, and follows directly on from the end of The Watcher of Stars. It sees the (almost inevitable) return of the mysterious Gayane Al-Taftazânî, her hapless friend Almund Skeete, and the strange, wondrous science-fiction world they inhabit. The series was initially based on the famous “Starwatcher” image by the late Jean “Moebius” Giraud, but has since rapidly taken on a life of its own. This is the piece I cryptically hinted at two weeks ago, and it was a true joy to write and I adore every last bit of it. I hope you do too.Artist:Compatible Figures:Genesis 8 Female, Genesis 8.1 FemaleCompatible Software: Daz to Blender Bridge, Daz to C4D Bridge, Daz to Maya Bridge, Daz to Unity Bridge, dForce Cloth, Daz Studio 4.16, Daz to 3ds Max BridgeInstall Types:

Get perfect posture easily
Good posture helps keep your body functioning at a high level. Whether it’s in your day to day life, whilst playing sport or exercising, having good posture can help prevent injuries and other pain and symptoms.
Good posture is different for everybody as everybody is built slightly differently. Generally good posture involves standing or sitting up straight. You need a good base of support, and you need to keep your back straight, shoulders back and chin tucked.
Here are my three tips for helping to keep good posture:
1. Core stability
2. Rolled towel stretch
3. Chin tuck
1. Core stability
Having good core stability is the best way for your spine to have a good base. With a strong core, you can build good posture on top of that. An easy exercise you can do to help strengthen your core is the plank. This exercise is done by holding yourself up on your forearms and toes with your stomach towards the floor. Keeping your back straight, try to hold for up to 30 seconds. You should feel tension building in your abdominals.
2. Rolled towel stretch
As most people work on computers or on handheld devices, a lot of people are tight through their chest which pulls the shoulders forward. The rolled towel stretch is a great way to loosen the muscles in your chest and shoulders..
3. Chin tuck
Again, with the use of mobile phones and handheld devices, most people tend to spend a lot of time with their neck and head tilted forward and down. This can lead to pain and symptoms in the neck and upper back. Doing the chin tuck exercise can help to reverse this and strengthen the muscles in the neck to hold your head up straight. Sitting up straight in a chair, tuck your chin and hold for 3 seconds. Repeat this 10 times and do that a couple of times a day.
If you suffer from pain relating to poor posture, an Osteopath can help you improve your posture to decrease pain and symptoms.Men are going to have to “get over it” and accept the fact that a woman will be leading the nation if Hillary Clinton wins the election next week, filmmaker Michael Moore said on Tuesday.
“It’s the muscle memory of 10,000 years that’s in our DNA where we’ve run the show forever,” Moore told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes. “Next Tuesday possibly ― hopefully ― a woman is going to lead the most powerful country on Earth. In other words, the 10,000-year reign is over.”
Moore was responding to a clip of President Barack Obama asking men who weren’t planning to vote for Clinton to consider why they might oppose her, and if there might be some sexism behind it.
“Guys have got about a week to wrap their heads around the fact that Hillary Clinton is going to be president of the United States,” Obama said.
Moore compared the change to the end of segregation.
“I grew up in a time when the ‘N’ word was used as often as you would say the word Kleenex,” Moore said, adding:
“Those people had to change. The future came in, everything moved forward. These men are not going to be able to stay this way. They’ll get on board the train and they’ll realize that actually having women having a say in what’s going on makes the planet ― makes your life, actually ― better.”
Moore also joked that having a woman in charge might be good for men’s health.
“Let women run the show,” he said. “It’s going to be a lot less stress on us. They live three years longer than us. We’re going to get to live those extra three years now.”
See the full discussion above.
We each have our own unique habits as individuals.
Some habits may benefit us, while others may cause more problems than we realise.
If you want to achieve happiness and success in life, it’s important that you remove your negative habits and replace them with ones that serve you.
This is exactly what we help with at James Hopkins Coaching.
By turning your negative habits into positive ones, you can quickly begin making real changes throughout your life.
Such habits will impact you in your personal life, work life and throughout your day to day activities.
So how can you begin turning your negative habits into positive ones?
You must first begin by acknowledging you want to change.
Many of us live in denial that our bad habits are impacting us.
Rather than addressing them, we will sweep them under the rug.
Over time, this causes us to dismiss bad habits altogether. In order to make real changes, we have to acknowledge the impact they’re having and become mentally prepared to change.
At James Hopkins Coaching, we can help you prepare for this process.
Once you have established the habit you want to change, you must start noticing the triggers.
No matter the type of habit, there is usually a trigger that causes us to act a certain way.
For example, if you’re bored or stressed, you may choose to eat food.
Begin noting down how you feel when giving into the habit, what is going on and the time of day.
This will help you to determine the trigger of the bad habit which will allow you to begin making changes.
Our team at James Hopkins Coaching can help you to understand these triggers and begin creating strategies to avoid them.
After understanding your triggers, you can begin the process of turning bad habits into good ones.
For example, if you know you watch TV for 2 hours every evening, you can consider doing some exercise or stretching with the TV on in the background.
You can also turn your triggers into positive behaviours.
Every time the trigger occurs, begin a positive action instead of a negative one.
For example, if you’re stressed and want to eat, go for a 2 to 5 minute walk outside (if possible).
This will help to clear your mind and will at the same time help you replace your bad habit.
Eventually, you will begin completing the positive action naturally and will forget the negative one altogether!
To make sure you stick to your new habit, the James Hopkins Coaching team recommends working with an accountability partner.
This is someone who will push you to maintain your good habits.
They won’t let you slide at the first sign of stress and will remind you of the reasons why you have chosen to change your habits.
Through touch love, this individual will make sure you follow through with your new plan, making sure you begin transforming your life for the better.

Unlike THC, that will be another cannabis ingredient, CBD is certainly not high-inducing. It’s the key reason why CBD is quickly becoming a choice that is preferred regards to dealing with different health problems.
Georgia is not just what you would phone a state that is cannabis-friendly. The final years that are few been better, but it’s still pretty strict in most things linked to cannabis.
Having said that, Georgia comes with organized legislation regarding CBD oil. Under specific conditions, it may be legal provided that a resident is qualified.
Is CBD Oil Legal in Georgia?
CBD oil is appropriate in Georgia, but under really circumstances that are specific.
In 2015, home Bill 1 had been introduced by Gov. Nathan contract, that will be known to Georgians as Haleigh’s Hope Act. The Bill stipulates that anybody through the state could have usage of cannabis oil she is suffering from severe or chronic health issues such as epilepsy or cancer if he or.
The Bill also allows universities to conduct research on CBD so that you can show up with techniques to relieve the outward indications of seizure problems in kiddies, given that the CBD that is particular product perhaps not have THC content higher than 5%.
It is also worth noting that the legislation does not exactly utilize the term “CBD oil.” The Bill mentions the utilization of “low-THC” oil rather.

Why was a news story that was given such fanfare suddenly thrown down the memory hole? Because it implicated the wrong people.
The next time Occasional Cortex bleats about Concentration Camps and Child separation, ask her about this story.
If we were dealing with honest journalists, this story shouldn’t be deleted, it should be set against current information. The fact that they’re pulling the story is an implicit admission that the damning effect of the story is not relevant to their objectives, and the actual numbers under the current administration compare favorably against the Obama era.
Bernie immediately jumped on it. Because he loves to tout news critical of America… whether it’s true or not. No wonder we call them the ‘Blame America First’ Democrats.
Who was president in 2015?

But if you click on Bernie’s tweets, the source story he links to has been withdrawn. It has been withdrawn across various news sites.
Reuters withdrew theirs.
So did other news sources foreign and domestic.

Should it really surprise us? It was an Obama Admin staffer tweeting out an Obama-era photo of ‘children of cages’ that launched this bogus children-in-cages narrative in the first place.
Several things going on here:
– Media largely ignored the immigration crisis under Obama
– Things that happened under Obama admin have been used to attack Trump (kids in cages, family separation)
– UN's blind acceptance of detention #'s from China & Russia is concerning

Selection commissions of SIDER and "Empreende Jovem" propose projects over 5 million Euros and 71 new jobs
The Vice-President of the Government of the Azores considered that the growing number of applications submitted by regional entrepreneurs for the various investment support programmes, particularly by young entrepreneurs, is an "encouraging result."
"As the Regional Government is undertaking a great effort to promote a series of measures to combat unemployment, including a strong support to investment, we are very pleased with this response, being a sign that the measures adopted are appropriate," stressed Sérgio Ávila.
"These figures give us the certainty that the path we have chosen is being followed by the Azoreans, particularly by young people, who, with their proactive attitude, seek support in our measures for the creation of their own employment. In addition, they also demonstrate the fighting spirit of the Azorean people as well as their confidence in the future of the Azores and their trust in private investment as a solution for the development of our Region," said the government official.
The Vice-President commented on the proposal for the approval of 23 new investment projects by the selection commission of the Local Development and Tourism Development subsystems of SIDER and "Empreende Jovem" (Youth Entrepreneurship). These projects amount to an overall investment over five million Euros and represent the creation of 71 new jobs.
Under SIDER, the ten approved projects in the Subsystem for Support to Local Development are primarily addressed at the areas of trade and industry, corresponding to an estimated investment of 2.4 million Euros and the creation of 28 new jobs. The financial incentive is set at 0.8 million Euros in the form of non-repayable subsidy and 0.1 million Euros in the form of a reimbursable subsidy.
With regard to the Subsystem for Support to Tourism Development, a total of three projects have been approved in the areas of accommodation and tourist animation, corresponding to a planned investment of one million Euros and the creation of five new jobs. Under this subsystem, 0.3 million Euros will be granted in the form of non-repayable subsidy and 0.2 million Euros in the form of reimbursable subsidy.

The history of the region, with the regional dress collection as one of the highlights will be showcased in a special and interactive manner. The museum shows both young and old past times. Do you dare to play the game barcode?The collection is composed of various regional costumes, agricultural implements, farm wagons, archeology and utensils with an emphasis on the 19th century.
The special architecture, historic buildings and restored unique wall and ceiling paintings add an extra dimension to the museum and its collection.
A unique combination of historic values and modern architecture Museum Het Warenhuis consists of two monumental buildings combined with a new part consisting of a modern designed exhibition space.
The national monuments are the former shop in the market no. 2 and ditto house annex were house on the market to no. 2a. Both properties were founded by entrepreneurs couple Antheunisstraat-van den Ierssel.
The property market 2a is a simple house with retail space in format. The original plan is still intact. What makes the property very rare, are the floor, wall and ceiling paintings and decorations from the hand of owner Clement Benedict Antheunisstraat. Who received his training as a master painter and master decorator in Zelzate and Ghent. His work, in a style at the intersection of eclecticism and Art Nouveau, is of very high quality. The paintings and decorations at this property are made between 1909 and about 1920. The late discovered particularity of this house is the reason it is placed on the monument list.
The property market is second in 1920 for the Antheunisstraat family built as a shop / store. It is performed in late transition architecture. The shop has premises in both the ground and first floor. Here was once sold a variety of items. This shop was an important meeting in the core Axel. Also, this particular building has a richly decorated interior, including a shop on cardboard painted ceiling in geometric Art Nouveau, a granite floor and original wall cupboards.
Both the house and in the shop the ceilings are decorated with marouflages. These are, in this case, a total of 21 oil paintings on canvas, which are pasted in recessed areas against the cartons and thus are contained in the whole of the decoration.
The paintings give a remarkable picture of the work of a well-trained, highly talented decorator in the first decades of the twentieth century. Unique!

From tourism to international competitiveness - 10 years BSwiss Summer School
Since 2011, the two-week Swiss International Business Summer School has been held in Basel at the beginning of August. As in 2020, BSwiss had to be cancelled in 2021 due to Corona. The 10th anniversary will therefore not be celebrated until next August, and registration will open in January 2022.
Jürg Schneider initiated BSwiss, Swiss International Business Summer School, in 2011 and ran it until his retirement three years later. Erich Bürkler, lecturer in economics, then took over the leadership and stuck to the basic idea of offering content that was complementary to the curriculum of the existing degree programmes. However, he also took the opportunity to set new thematic priorities.
The focus had previously been on tourism, and I changed it to migration, innovation and international competitiveness.
These topics were not only of importance to him personally but are still of the greatest importance for the Swiss economy today. Erich Bürkler explains: "Since the immigration of the persecuted Huguenots, Switzerland's competitiveness has benefited from clever immigrants who launched their innovations here and then exported them all over the world.
Two weeks of block teaching in Basel
In 2020 and 2021, Corona made it impossible to hold BSwiss, which normally takes place every year at the beginning of August during the semester break. Two blocks of five teaching days are dedicated to the topics of migration, innovation and international competitiveness, supplemented by an exclusive accompanying programme. For example, there are guided tours of Basel and one of Bern, half-day seminars at the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs SECO and at the Patent Office in Bern, two visits to innovative companies in Northwestern Switzerland and a Discover Switzerland programme over the weekend in Central Switzerland.
In class, students work on international competitiveness, countries' comparative advantages and their companies' competitiveness, migration and competitiveness. Switzerland's macroeconomic policy and competitiveness is explained from different perspectives and discussed in mixed groups. The lecturers discuss issues that are currently particularly relevant, including the US elections and "Brexit".
Students from (almost) the entire world
Every year, between 25 and 45 students take part in BSwiss, which is conducted in English, half of the students are Swiss and half are international. Incoming students from partner universities only have to pay their expenses, which is why BSwiss is affordable in such a high-cost country as Switzerland. The FHNW School of Business project leader provides group accommodation in a student hotel close to the school, which has been successful so far and also has had a positive effect on the group dynamics.
Incoming students come from (almost) all over the world: from Canada, Australia, England, Spain, South America, China and the Arab countries. No one has taken part so far from Africa. The BSwiss examination system considers differences in level due to origin in that an initial part of the examination is taken before classes begin, with questions on challenging papers. This counts for 60%, ensures a levelling of performance and creates a common basis in terms of content. Finally, all students write a final essay on one of the core topics, which counts for 40%.
Intercultural exchange and buddy system
The cultural topics are not only discussed and applied in the classroom during an intercultural workshop, but also making the incoming students more familiar with Switzerland during leisure time at the Summer School. This is ensured by the buddy system: each international student is assigned a Swiss "partner", i. e. a buddy who has the task that they gain an insider view of Switzerland. This is a win-win situation for both sides because part-time students from Switzerland who do not have the opportunity to undertake a semester abroad for several months benefit from an additional offer and an international perspective.
Next BSwiss in August 2022
Switzerland is the ideal place to host a BSwiss Summer School, not only because of its cultural diversity, but also because of its high international competitiveness with its high number of internationally successful companies. When it became clear this year that international students would have a hard time travelling to Switzerland because of Corona, Erich Bürkler and the project manager Alexandra Yankam tried in vain to realise a hybrid implementation: with Swiss students on site and students from other countries connected online. However, since the travel restrictions contradicted the basic idea of BSwiss, namely to get together, go on various excursions and exchange ideas intensively, the cancellation in May also made sense in terms of content. Those who had already registered showed understanding for this.
Preparations are now being made for BSwiss 2022. At the beginning of the year, the directors of the FHNW School of Business and the International Offices of the partner universities will be contacted, and students from all over the world can apply by the end of April. For this next ‘edition’, a current topic will remind us of last year: a case study on the growing national debt in Switzerland due to the Corona virus.

Natural autoantibody (NAA), generated by B-lymphocyte cells, is a vital component of human body fluid that exists naturally. Recent Research found that NAA can be used as a kind of characterization for a variety of diseases. They are valuable diagnostic biomarkers not just for autoimmune illnesses, but also for diseases that show no obvious clinical symptoms in the early stages.
As one of the leading service providers in the field of antibody discovery and manufacturing, Creative Biolabs has gathered a team of scientists focusing on natural autoantibody, and established cutting-edge drug discovery and analysis platforms enabling NAA development as research tools, therapeutic candidates, or diagnostic reagents. Now, it offers advanced NAA detection services and products to accelerate disease diagnosis study.
— NAA Detection Services
NAAs are a part of the immune system and show great potential in disease diagnosis studies. Creative Biolabs launches NAA detection services to promote immune disease-related diagnostic marker study, covering Alzheimer’s disease, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), ischemia, and so on. The portfolio of detection services includes western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescent staining, immunosensors, and antigen arrays.
“We provide a wide range of NAA detection methods to meet all the specific needs of our global customers. For example, immunofluorescence is a common technique used for light microscopy with a fluorescence microscope, and we use the specificity of antibodies to target fluorescent dyes combined with specific biomolecule targets within a cell, and therefore get the visualization of the distribution of the target molecule through the sample,” as introduced by a senior scientist in NAA development team.
Assay kits are powerful tools in drug discovery and development research, and Creative Biolabs is capable of delivering an array of assay kits, which will highly facilitate the study of disease pathways, the screening for potential drug candidates, and the evaluation of biopharmaceutical production processes.
The featured products include:
* Mouse GAD Autoantibody (IgG) ELISA Kit
* Rat Liver kidney microsome Autoantibody ELISA kit
* Human Oxidized LDL Autoantibody (IgG) ELISA kit
* Human Calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) Autoantibody (IgG) ELISA kit
With competitive prices, these kits are of high specificity and sensitivity and can deliver quick and accurate results by sample steps. (The products are for research use only.)
The latest information about NAA application, NAA-related diseases and biomarkers, as well as the all-inclusive services and products at Creative Biolabs can be found on. Name

The simplest way to tell if a person has opted out of receiving either email or text messages is to access the Opt-Out reports. There is an exception to this, explained below.
Go to ParishCast → Admin Reports → Email Opt Outs - or - SMS Opt Outs
When a person opts out from receiving email
- The email is flagged and put on the Email Opt-Out Report.
- The email address will be removed from the person's record
- The person's record will not be removed.
- The person that opted out will no longer receive emails through ParishCast.
- The email address of a person who has opted out will not be re-added through an import. The import verifies the record has been flagged for opt-out and does not re-add the email address.
What happens when the person wants to opt back in:
- Even when the person wants to opt back in, the email address of a person who has opted out will not be re-added through an import.
- The email address can be manually re-entered and will then receive the email.
- They will stay on the Opt-Out Report even when they have been re-added and are receiving emails.
- If they opt-out again, they will show on the Opt Out Report twice or as many times as they do so.

Quitting marijuana requires a comprehensive detox treatment provided by all drug rehab and detox centers. To ensure that patients do not suffer until they snore, rehab facilities escort their assailants through a step-by-step journey while holding them steady.
Otherwise, they would suffer unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. These signs face various physical and psychological challenges and change from moderate stress to acute depression.
Mild symptoms like anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia appear the moment you stop. You would end up agitated and maintain the attention span of a five year old just because you would yearn for a quick fix. At this point, continue with your willpower and don't indulge your cravings.
Another common side effect of quitting marijuana could be loss of desire. Your thoughts would be mechanically focused on smoking a joint, so you would lose the will to want anything else besides marijuana. Furthermore, users may also have strange nightmares related to insomnia and sleep apnea.ALL >> Humor >> View Article
Why Huawei Smartphone Series Best
Huawei is one of the most top-grossing companies that is building some of the amazing smartphones having the best features and specs. We have seen the numbers of smartphones launched by the Huawei Smartphone company. And some of the series of Huawei is the most famous and top-selling series. Huawei P and Huawei Mate Series are one of them. Both of the series has its worth and specifications let’s discuss some of the best smartphones of each series.
Huawei P20 and P20 Pro Smartphone
Huawei uses its EMUI overlay to complement Android and make the interface much better. This is the EMUI 8.1 version, the smartphone running Android 8.1. The design of the Huawei P20 is not so different from the P20 Pro as if we forget the fact that it is smaller than its illustrious brother, this smartphone also adopts a very similar appearance of the iPhone X. The notch is obviously present at the top of the screen and the reader of imprints is on the bottom of the front, but we also note the beautiful finishes, the comfort of the grip and well-rounded edges. The 5.8-inch TFT LCD screen has a ratio ...
... of 18.7: 9 for a definition of 2244 x 1080 pixels very accurately. Besides that, it comes with the good features whether it is in terms of photography or terms of internal features. Huawei P20 in Australia is available and for the price of this smartphone, Huawei P20 price Australia is almost 600 AUD.
The Huawei P20 Pro is the top model of the Chinese manufacturer Huawei for 2018 it is the pro version of simple P20 smartphone. The smartphone has a large, borderless OLED screen with a rear camera with no less than three lenses. As we are used to from Huawei flagships, the hardware under the hood is perfectly fine and is assisted by smart artificial intelligence. The P20 Pro is also watertight thanks to the IP67 certification. Huawei has worked out a lot for the P20 Pro, especially about the camera of the device. There are three sensors on the back of the device: a black-and-white sensor for detail, a color camera for color and a telephoto lens for zooming. These are simultaneously used to take razor-sharp photos, even in low-light conditions. Under the hood, Huawei is investing heavily in artificial intelligence. You will also find this in various places in the software. For example, the AI automatically adjusts the camera settings based on what is shown, and you can zoom in up to 5x without loss of quality. Huawei P20 Pro in Australia is available and for the price of this smartphone, Huawei P20 Pro price Australia is almost 800 AUD.
Huawei P30 and P30 Pro Smartphone
The Huawei P30 is also one of the finest Android smartphones available in Australia thanks to its rich equipment and advanced multimedia features. P30 comes with a large 6.1-inch display with a resolution of 2340x1080 pixel. The features offered by the Huawei P30 are many and innovative. Starting with LTE 4G which enables data transfer and excellent internet browsing. It comes with the 128 Gb of storage and also has the SD card slot. The Huawei P30 is a product with few multimedia competitors thanks to the 40-megapixel camera that allows the Huawei P30 to take great pictures with a resolution of7303x5477 pixels and record videos in 4K at the amazing resolution of 3840x2160 pixels. The 7.6mm thickness makes the Huawei P30 one of the slimmest and most complete phones. Huawei P30 in Australia is available and for the price of this smartphone, Huawei P30 price Australia is almost 1100 AUD.
The Huawei P30 Pro is the pro version of the Huawei P30 simple it comes with the advanced features from the previous one. It has a large 6.47-inch display with a resolution of 2340x1080 pixel the features offered by the Huawei P30 Pro are many and innovative. Starting with LTE 4G which enables data transfer and excellent internet browsing. It is also available in the same storage of 128 Gb with an SD card slot to increase your smartphone’s internal memory. However, in terms of photography, this will be one of the best photographic smartphones. This smartphone features a four-rear camera that makes it the most powerful photography mobile. Not only does this mobile also include the new IMX607 38 MP sensor. In addition to this, it also has a 3D TOF sensor for 3D facial recognition and three-dimensional modeling would be added. Huawei P30 Pro in Australia is available and for the price of this smartphone, Huawei P30 Pro price Australia is almost 1600 AUD.
Huawei Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro
Huawei has used two technologies for the screens display of its new Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro. The first model uses a 6.53-inch LCD (FHD + 3120 x 1440 pixels) while the second model uses an AMOLED screen of 6.39 inches (QHD + 3120 x 1440 pixels). At the rendering level, the screen of the Mate 20 and the Mate 20 Pro are of excellent quality. That of the Pro version is slightly brighter, because of the slightly better resolution. In terms of weight and size of the case of both smartphones, we find on the side of the Huawei Mate 20 a case of 72.3 mm x 157.8 mm x 8.3 mm, and on the side of the Mate 20 Pro, a box of 77.2mm x 158.2mm x 8.6mm In other words, the case of the Mate 20 Pro is slightly larger, although the size of its screen is slightly smaller. The Mate 20 is slightly larger than the Mate 20 Pro, but it is not heavier. Indeed, it is necessary to count a weight of 188 grams for the Mate 20, against a weight of 189 grams for the Mate 20 Pro.
The Huawei P20 was the first smartphone of the brand to have 3 sensors in the back. This is again the case for the Mate 20 and the Mate 20 Pro the 3 sensors designed with Leica are grouped in a square located in the middle on the back of the phones and the fourth space of the square is occupied by the flash. On the Mate 20 Pro side, there is a telephoto sensor of 8 megapixels (f / 2.4), a sensor of 40 megapixels (f / 1.8) and an ultra-wide-angle sensor (f / 2.2). For the Mate 20, we will be satisfied with a telephoto of 8 Megapixels (f / 2.4), a sensor of 12 megapixels (f / 1.8) and a wide-angle lens of 16 Megapixels (f / 2.2). As far as the price of both the models is concerned Huawei Mate 20 price Australia is almost 900 AUD and Huawei Mate 20 Pro Price Australia is almost 1200 AUD.
Huawei Mate 20 X
Huawei has announced a variant of the Mate 20 X which is equipped with the new generation of 5G connectivity, named Huawei Mate 20X. As for 5G enthusiasts who like to use 5G technology, Huawei has announced another amazing smartphone for those who like to enjoy 5G technology with the best smartphone. Huawei Mate 20 X in Australia has been announced. 5G technology is the first difference it has. The second and only existing difference is the battery, which has been reduced to 4200mAh (identical to the Mate 20 Pro) of the original 5000mAh. To compensate for this loss of battery life, the company replaced the 22.5W to 40W fast charging technology so that it could be charged from 0 to 100% in about 40 minutes. The Huawei mate 20 X price Australia is almost 3500 AUD which is considered to be an expensive smartphone.
Conclusion
Huawei Mate series in one of the most expensive series of Huawei as compared it with the Huawei P Series. As we have mentioned some of the best smartphones along with their prices and specs so it will make it easy for you to compare the specs and price and purchase the best one for yourself..

Collagen has many important functions, including providing your skin with structure and strengthening your bones.
- HERBAL SKIN SOLUTIONS: Collagen is a major component of your skin. It plays a role in strengthening skin, plus may benefit elasticity and hydration. As you age, your body produces less collagen, leading to dry skin and the formation of wrinkles. However, several studies have shown that collegen peptides or supplements containing collagen may help slow the aging of your skin by reducing wrinkles and dryness.
- SUPPORT BONE HEALTH: Your bones are made mostly of collagen, which gives them structure and helps keep them strong. As collagen in your body deteriorates as you age, bone mass does too.

There are no reviews yet.A question that is often asked is “where do you find inspiration?”. Where do you find the ideas that go into blogs and blogs and social media posts and ideas for courses and ideas of things that we teach, and we use as keynote themes.
Be observant
To answer that. I need to look at my own creative process. I tend to be relatively observant although I’m often accused by my wife that I don’t notice things a lot. But I am relatively observant of things around me and little things that happen will always spark an interest for me, will always spark an idea. It could be as simple as when I was at the gym the other day. I was in this gym class, and there was a girl a young girl in the in the row next to me, and she walked in five minutes late was busy on a mobile messaging from glancing over it looked like it was WhatsApp. Then in between every exercise I saw her grab her phone and continue to message people, so much so that she would miss the first minute of each exercise.
That inspired me that inspired me to write a blog because I realized how a certain generation are deeply connected to technology. This girl was deeply connected to technology, to the point where she could not decompress. We were talking about an 8.40am class. The day had not started, but she couldn’t take out the decompression time, the time to be mindful and the time to actually spend on herself.
Hollywood moments
And so that inspired me. And so that is what inspiration is about. It’s not about what a friend of mine calls the Hollywood Moments, those big explosions that you see in front of you and you go, I must change my life – I must do something. No, it’s not.
Inspiration is far more subtle. Inspiration comes in far more subtle ways inspiration comes from the little things. If we look around at the person on the public transport across the way from us, the person at the office, the person ordering the coffee and sitting there at the coffee shop or the person in the gym class. Every one of those provides inspiration.
When we used to fly
The same thing that happens when I am flying on planes or at least used to in the days when pre COVID when we used to fly on planes. I would be watching a story or series on the entertainment system. I wasn’t focused, as I was probably on my laptop doing other work. This would just be background noise and noise cancelling headphones on to stop distractions. I would stop the show, rewind a little bit, listen to the line, open up a Word document type out the line as best as I could transcribe it. And that would become the theme of a blog, of a video of an inspiration.
The truth and the reality of inspiration is that it comes from the simple things around us. It comes from being aware of our circumstances. It comes from being aware of what is going on around us and focusing on those things.
It does not need to come from the Hollywood moments. Those are great, but what happens after the Hollywood moment. If we spend our life looking for those Hollywood moments for those big pieces of inspiration. We will never be inspired.
Its a small world
We need to be inspired by the small things by the small actions by the observations. By seeing the sunrise by seeing the sunset by seeing two birds frolicking in the tree or talking to each other.
Those are the things that give us inspiration.
#WeeklyPrompt #inspiration #leadership #professionalspeakingAnnounced at E3, the Wii Motion Plus makes your Wii even more accurately aware of what you're doing with your arms, and we've had one in for testing
Announced at E3 so recently the booth babes' fake tan hasn't yet worn off, today we got our uncoordinated hands on Nintendo's Wii MotionPlus. It's a small adaptor that clips on to the bottom end of the Wii's Wiimote, and increases the controller's sense of spatial awareness. Theoretically at least, it should allow players to feel more immersed in the game they're playing by allowing your character to mirror your arm's position more accurately.
Some people, by which we mean CNET UK's chief sub-editor Nick Hide, believe the extra accuracy the clip-on adaptor provides should've been built-in from the start. But it wasn't, so now you'll need about 20 British pounds to buy the adaptor on its own, or else buy one of the new games that include it for free.
It pairs a type of gyroscope with the Wiimote's accelerometer, and one such game that takes advantage of the two silicon siblings is EA's forthcoming Grand Slam Tennis.
In the game, the MotionPlus allowed our little tennis guy to mirror whether we were holding our racket up in the air, or any position between the sky and the ground. Without the adaptor, the racket just stayed at waist height. We truly suck at most forms of sport, so we didn't find it made much difference to how well we played. But the technology certainly worked, and it did add a definite -- if thin, for us -- coating of realism to the game.
Grand Slam Tennis can be played with or without the MotionPlus, and we expect later titles will take even better advantage of the additional spacial-awareness jiggery-pokery it can conjure -- Red Steel 2, for example, actually requires you use it.
So don't rush out and buy just yet. Instead, hold off until you want one of the games that it comes free with -- Grand Slam Tennis, Wii Sports Resort and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10 being just some examples.

If even everyday infections suddenly become life-threatening, the number of annual deaths from resistant infections could rise dramatically. Whether and when this horror scenario occurs, however, depends on many factors: How prudently will people use antibiotics in the future? How quickly do resistant germs spread? How quickly will new active substances be developed? Every November, the World Antimicrobial Awareness Week (WAAW) and the European Antibiotic Awareness Day (EAAD) raise awareness of this issue and call for the prudent use of antimicrobial agents - join in!

This year on 20 Oct., CLEAN HOSPITALS DAY will focus on one aspect that has often been neglected...
World Patient Safety Day takes place annually on 17 September and raises awareness of patient safety through numerous activities and events - this year hybrid. This year's theme is "Safe from the first breath" and focuses on expectant mothers and newborns. Find out how patient empowerment and infection prevention contribute to patient safety and how we at HARTMANN are committed to this as part of our MISSION:INFECTION PREVENTION.
Sepsis remains one of the leading causes of death from infection, affecting up to 50 million people worldwide each year, with an estimated 11 million of those dying. But most importantly, sepsis could often be prevented - namely through appropriate infection prevention measures. In view of this, World Sepsis Day (WSD) was launched 10 years ago on 13 September. Today, as then, the day of action fights against the life-threatening complication and for infection prevention under the motto "Prevent Infections - Prevent Sepsis - Save Lives" - and we are fighting along!

Many of the community unpleased with the lack of public consultation on a development of such scale, tempers flared at one point when a community member was stating a valid concern about the entry of the property and a worker from said farm hurled expletive abuse at the man, as many in our community have come to expect from the current management.
One of my favourite questions from the audience was how does your company propose to contain 1000 cows when you can’t keep 400 cows off the road – also a common sight on our roads.
At no point did the company deny bringing in workers from China to run the operation.
Mr McNaught did his best to deal with a hostile audience and his younger counterpart was selling his mantra: happy cows = more milk.
He also shared his opinion on world’s best practice CAFO style, as many in our community know the grass revolution is here and we in South Gippsland are front and centre on the world stage for demand of grass-fed beef and pastured poultry, pigs and eggs.
This is the reason Australian milk commands such a price in China due to a predominantly grass diet and that equates to high levels of omega3 as opposed to omega6 in grain fed animals.
Many other valid concerns were raised on the night but a question I didn’t get to ask to all of our councillors was: Considering most, if not all of the milk will be exported to China; the large scale building will most likely be performed by a company outside our community; and the workers bought in to run the plant, and considering a significant investment in Loch Kernot Road upgrade, what does the Mayor and councillors believe to be the financial benefit to our community?
And if it’s putting Kernot on the international map, I think Australian milk products already are – that’s why internationals are buying up our farmland.
Iain McLaren, Kernot.

Review your DoctorStart Your IoT Development on the Right Path
DornerWorks guides you through avoiding the seven common pitfalls business experience when choosing an IoT provider. Direct download the PDF below.
Developers that understand how to improve their products with Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity know how to stay ahead of the competition. They don’t have to lose sleep—or market share—to the new best thing.
Even with a great product and a strong market, product developers often worry that the competition is getting an edge by adding connectivity first. The top success factor is delivering a differentiated product with unique customer benefits and superior value. In today’s interconnected world, linking products to a customer’s digital world is one of the best ways to differentiate.
Product developers may know their product well, but those who are nervous about successfully adding IoT capabilities often seek engineering services so they can build the products their customers truly want. Exploring many of the pitfalls companies must avoid when selecting an IoT partner can help prospective product developers avoid losing time and money as well as brand-damaging false starts.
Risks When Choosing an IoT Solutions Provider
This whitepaper illustrates seven possible developer/provider—client relationships that should be avoided when deciding on an IoT provider:
1. IoT Providers that Forget the Customer
should first and foremost be about your customer, not about you. What value does IoT add for your customer? What benefit do they get compared to your unconnected products? How do you improve the user experience for your customers by adding IoT?
2. Choosing a Web Developer Instead of an IoT Provider
Everyone is getting on the IoT bandwagon, including web developers. But web development is not the same as IoT development.
3. Choosing a Narrow Expert
IoT is a new and burgeoning field with many candidate technologies to consider. You need a partner that has sufficiently broad experience to tap into the best of class approaches for your product.
4. Choosing an Artist, Not an Engineer
Good product design marries form and function. You need a partner that can not only provide a beautiful, clean user experience but also can provide the functionality that brings your art to life.
5. Choosing Lowest Rate rather than Lowest Cost
It’s important to choose a provider that can work within a budget—even if they charge on a T&M basis.
6. Giving your IoT Provider a Blank Check
If you choose an undisciplined IoT provider, you’ll get an endless parade development, but never actually finish the project.
7. Choosing a Partner Who Can’t Scale Up
Don’t be fooled by a prototype mobile app or simple cloud-based demo.
IoT has opened up a whole new level of product design and interaction. Anything that can be connected to the cloud inevitably will be. But that doesn’t always mean it should be.
Delightful products aren’t going to create more problems than they solve. Along with solutions, they offer a meaningful experience that a user can appreciate as valuable. For someone to take interest in manufacturing those products, they also need to fit into a sustainable plan. The right IoT provider can help product developers build that plan.United Talent is immediately hiring for a Picker in Suwanee, GA!

EEORafa Benitez says his players need to be more aware and not let complacency creep in but would rather take the positives from the 4-3 win over Shakhtar Donesk on Wednesday.
The headlines today will focus on how Los Blancos almost let a 4-goal lead slip against the Ukrainian side. Ronaldo netted twice while Luka Modric and Dani Carvajal grabbed a goal apiece to give the 10-time Champions League winners a comfortable lead after 70 minutes. But the hosts fought back with three goals in the final 12 minutes to give Madrid a scare.
However, at his press conference after the game, Benitez said he wanted to focus on the positives. Real ensured they finished the group in top spot while they won away at an intimidating ground, scoring four goals in the process.
“You have to weigh up a lot of things and I think that what weighs heaviest is that we’ve won the group and played a great game for 78 minutes.,” he commented.
Asked once again about his style of management and tactics amid accusations he is too defensive, Benitez added: “As coach of Real Madrid I’ve reiterated a number of times, and today we saw it, that this is a team who attack and score goals. Today, unfortunately we conceded goals that we shouldn’t have at the end. But scoring four and creating the chances that we created, that’s Real Madrid’s style.”.
Maintain a Healthy BMI
As your weight increases so does your blood pressure so maintaining a healthy body weight is key to lowering HBP. In a recent study 50% of overweight adults were able to reduce their high blood pressure purely by going on a reduced calorie diet.
Exercise Regularly
A little exercise can make a big difference in your blood pressure. Regular cardio exercise makes your heart stronger allowing it to pump blood more efficiently. When the heart doesn’t have to work as hard it reduces pressure on the arteries, lowering your blood pressure. Try to get at least 30 minutes of brisk activity 5-6 days a week and you might be able to complete avoid the need for blood pressure medications.
Reduce Your Sodium Intake
While not every case of high blood pressure is linked to sodium intake it is recommended that everyone monitor how much they are consuming. The worst offender is processed foods so read labels carefully when grocery shopping and try to use salt substitutes when seasoning foods at home.
Get More Potassium
Adding more potassium to your diet has been proven to lower blood pressure. While there are many supplements on the market it is just as easy to add potassium rich foods to your diet. Load up on bananas, fish, sweet potatoes, leafy green vegetables, citrus fruits, poultry and whole-grain cereals.
Watch Your Caffeine Consumption
Beware of drinking too much coffee, not only can it increase stress levels but caffeine tightens blood vessels and this can raise your blood pressure as well. There’s no harm in having a cup or two a day but if you tend to drink a lot of caffeine throughout the day try mixing in a little decaf.
Lay off the overtime
While it may be hard for most of us to call it a week at 40hrs those who don’t are 15% more likely to suffer HBP. The more you work the harder it is to fit in trips to the gym or healthy home cooked meals so make sure that you squeeze in time to take care of yourself during your hectic week.
Relax
Research has shown that taking a half hour to sit quietly and practice deep breathing can make a big difference in your blood pressure. Whether your prefer listening to music, meditating or doing yoga taking the time to relax can lower your blood pressure by over 4 points.
Cut Back on Alcohol
While in small amounts alcohol can actually reduce blood pressure it is very important not to overindulge. 1 drink a day for women and 2 for men is considered healthy but heavy drinking can cause sudden increases in blood pressure along with other major health concerns.
By reducing stress, getting regular exercise and eating a healthy diet most people can easily keep their high blood pressure under control. While it is a good idea to consult with your doctor and get regular checkups these simple changes should allow you to skip the pharmacy on the way home.Sofia Music - Part 3

Saturn’s field aligned currents and their modulation by the Planetary Period Oscillations Greg Hunt 1*, S. W. H. Cowley 1, G. Provan 1, E. J. Bunce 1, I. I. Alexeev 2, E. S. Belenkaya 2, V. V. Kalegaev 2, M. K. Dougherty 3 and A. J. Coates 4 1 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester, 2 Skobeltsyn Institute of Nuclear Physics, Moscow State University, 3 Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College London, 4 Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London *gjh [email protected] acuk
Aims and motivation • Determine the dependence of the field-aligned currents on the phase of the planetary period oscillations (PPOs) • Separate out the PPO-independent currents from the PPO-related currents • Determine each of the current systems’ structure, position and strength • By better understanding these current systems we can improve upon theoretical discussions on the source the Saturn’s periodic behaviour • Understanding these current systems will also play a key part in Cassini’s Grand Finale The results presented here are from two papers, both of between can be found online in JGR: Space physics, Hunt et al [2014, 2015] and the current work is in progress
Current systems [Hill [1979], Cowley and Bunce [2003], Southwood and Kivelson [2007], Andrews et al [2010], Jia et al [2012], Jia and Kivelson [2012], Southwood and Cowley [2014], Hunt et al [2015]]
Data set To study the field-aligned current signatures we used Cassini magnetometer data from when Cassini was highly inclined from the equatorial plane Such a set of Revs were performed in 2008 at ~fixed local time on the nightside Previously studied by Talboys et al [2009, 2011] The bottom two panels show Cassini magnetic footprint in both northern and southern hemispheres Auroral boundaries from Carbary [2012]
Analysis Procedure •
Phase coordinate
Southern hemisphere data
Southern hemisphere currents We combine 31 Revs’ Im profiles into eight 45° (non-overlapping) sectors of southern PPO phase and calculate the weighted mean profiles By exploiting the symmetry of the subcorotation and expected antisymmetry of the PPO current, it is possible to separate them, by summing and differencing opposite phases We only found organisation by the southern PPO
Southern hemisphere currents •
Southern hemisphere boundary motion • Shown here are the positions and current magnitudes at the five boundaries to the four sheets of current • We have determined the colatitude of the current layers and found how they vary as a function of southern PPO phase • The current layers are displaced maximally towards the pole at 90° and a maximally towards the equator at 270°, with a point to point amplitude of ~2° • The fitted sin functions for the positions in the top figure are shown below on a polar plot • By considering the plasma and atmospheric flows physical implication the boundary motions with southern PPO phase can be determined
Southern hemisphere boundary motion
Southern hemisphere boundary motion
Southern hemisphere boundary motion
Northern hemisphere Now moving on to the northern hemisphere sections of the 2008 Revs Here are six NH ionospheric colatitude profiles chosen to exemplify differing conditions of PPOrelated phases • The top row the main PPO currents are expected to have the same sense • The middle row are where the PPO currents are opposite in sense • The bottom row where the PPO currents are minimal and an unusual profile
Northern hemisphere
Northern hemisphere profiles
Northern hemisphere profiles The remaining four sectors are when the PPO systems are in phase and in antiphase, these are generated from the profile on the last slide and then compared with the data Below is the comparison between the profiles derived the northern hemisphere data and the mapped southern hemisphere profile similarly derived
Northern hemisphere
These results are from Hunt et al. , 2015, JGR, submitted Equatorial oscillations NH Equator SH
These results are from Hunt et al. , 2015, JGR, submitted Oscillations in polar regions Northern polar region Southern polar region Applying the same fitting method, but now to colatitude bins in the polar regions, we see as with previous studies in the polar regions the oscillations are hemispherically pure to within ~10%
Work in progress Currently, we are now comparing the field-aligned currents from different local times to the results To do this we are looking at a set of Revs from 2006/2007 which have a different local time to the 2008 Revs • • 2008 Revs mostly ~midnight 2006/07 Revs span pre-dawn to post noon We can then compare these two datasets to see if there any similarities or differences which could correspond to the differences in the SKR powers So far we have done this for the southern hemisphere SKR power with LT [Lamy et al 2009, Andrews et al 2011]
Work in progress Here we compare the 2006/2007 coloured symbols with the 2008 boundary data (grey) The colatutide position has been transformed to account for the offset of the centre of the auroral oval compared to the spin/magnetic axis [Nichols et al 2008] The Im values we split into 180° sectors centred on 90° and 270° and take the mean Here we attempt to remove the sinusoidal motion of boundaries from the 2008 data and then take the mean position
Work in progress Comparison between the 2008 (dashed lines) and 2006/2007 (solid lines) calculated from the mean boundary positions and mean Im values of each boundary split into 180° of phase Then we perform the sum and differencing to get the next two plots for the PPO-independent current and PPO-related currents The key point is that the profiles are remarkably similar in strength and form, in particular the main upward current of the PPO-independent, this raises interesting questions for the current paradigm for the powerful dawn SKR and requires further work
Conclusions • Saturn’s field-aligned currents are modulated in form, amplitude and position by the planetary period oscillations • For the first time the subcorotation current system and PPO current systems have been separated and their individual signatures identified and shown to be co-located • The PPO related currents are shown to be fully on closed lines • In the southern hemisphere the boundary motion is shown to be evidence for the driving of the PPO field -aligned currents to be driven from the planetary atmosphere/ionosphere • The first direct evidence of the inter-hemispheric currents associated with the southern PPO current system in the northern hemisphere’s ionosphere • Both northern and southern oscillations are present on closed field lines interior to the field-aligned current region • In common with previous studies in the polar regions the oscillations are hemispherically pure to within ~10% Hunt, G.

These results are from Hunt et al. , 2015, JGR, submitted Effective Conductivities • From the PPO-Independent current profile and angular velocity profile for the magnetospheric plasma. The effective Pedersen conductivity can be estimated [Cowley et al. , 2008] • This shows that the latitudinal variations in the effective Pedersen conductivity of the ionosphere at least as important as the variations in plasma angular velocity in determining the structure of the field-aligned current system
Latitudinal variations of oscillations Phase offsets Northern amplitude Constant term Southern amplitude • Select the mapped data in the grey shaded region in overlapping latitude intervals of 15° • For a pair of phase offsets search for values of the three parameters in a 3 D parameter cube that gives the minimum RMS deviation • Vary phase offsets to find the smallest total RMS and repeat with those phase offsets fixed, to get “best” 3 parametersProject management

Others got less, having to make do with 13%. At the same time workers were getting 2.5% under the terms of the PNR. In addition many of these executives were able to make use of various tax fiddles through being paid into overseas bank accounts or receiving company shares rather then cash. In addition 93% of executives have a company car.
The biggest winners were probably banking executives who received pay increases of 65% from 1985 to 1989. The workers in the banks, needless to say, got a hell of a lot less. In addition in 1988 the major banks introduced "yellow-pack" staff so that school leavers had their starting wages dropped to £6,750.
The IBOA, a non-ICTU union, which represents banking workers is now looking for a 6% rise this year. The same executives fresh from their 65% increases are raging about this threat to the PESP and claiming the banks cannot afford such an increase. Similarly the directors of Waterford-Wedgewood who tried to savagely cut pay and conditions at Waterford glass last year were paid £1.49 million between six of them in 1989.
These figures expose the "we're all in this together, tightening our belts" crap that the bosses come out with. Workers and bosses have no common interests and it's up to workers to fight for every penny they can get. The bosses inability to pay clearly never extends to their own salaries. The way forward is clearly to break the PESP and for workers to demand the pay increases they need not what the bosses claim they can afford.

Keynes said, "Right now we have to increase prosperity. That is why at the moment we have no time to think about non-violence, moral values, etc." He said, “Economics is a science". As a science, it was not concerned with morality or immorality. To reckon with them is the concern of ethics, the science of morality. The subject of the science of morality cannot be made the subject of economics. As a result, he never agreed to give importance to morality, non-violence, and purity of means or any such aspect.An apparently pro-masculinity tech entrepreneur has ignited a social media controversy by describing men in leadership positions as “losers” if they take extensive paternity leave.
In a long Twitter thread, Joe Lonsdale, a co-founder of software company Palantir Technologies and other ventures, was apparently reacting to a Joe Rogan episode in which the podcaster raised questions about U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg’s paternity leave in the midst of the supply chain crisis.
“Isn’t that supposed to be for the person who gave birth?,” Rogan reportedly wondered.
When an Axios editor tweeted that Spotify, the streaming service that distributes Rogan’s show, provides six months of paid parental leave without regard to gender as an employee benefit, Lonsdale provocatively responded as follows:
“Wow. Great for fathers to spend time [with] their kids and support moms, but any man in an important position who takes 6 months of leave for a newborn is a loser. In the old days men had babies and worked harder to provide for their future – that’s the correct masculine response.”
Wow. Great for fathers to spend time w their kids and support moms, but any man in an important position who takes 6 months of leave for a newborn is a loser.
In the old days men had babies and worked harder to provide for their future – that’s the correct masculine response.
— Joe Lonsdale (@JTLonsdale) October 27, 2021
As the responses rolled in, and they were seldom supportive of his position, Lonsdale replied with variations on the same seemingly unpopular theme.
“I’m slightly confused why those who didn’t take six months off themselves as fathers are so offended by this – it’s clearly nonsensical for a leader, & even the most woke responders here take less. You can love your kids and spend lots of time [with] them without irresponsible leave.”
He also acknowledged that, as one Twitter pointed out, a policy that differentiates based on gender could lead to discrimination against women. “I respect that this is one theory behind this. Men who are leaders in key positions shouldn’t take the full six months cold turkey is my view on this and others agree but are afraid to say so.”
I respect that this is one theory behind this.
Men who are leaders in key positions shouldn’t take the full six months cold turkey is my view on this and others agree but are afraid to say so.
— Joe Lonsdale (@JTLonsdale) October 27, 2021
Lonsdale also claimed that he has started “six different billion-dollar companies,” and that a six-month absence for senior executives just isn’t viable in that kind of scenario, although some paternity-related time off “is great.”
According to Bloomberg Technology, Lonsdale later conceded that “using the word loser was ‘uncalled for,’ but he doubled down on the importance of maintaining traditional gender roles.”
Lonsdale also admitted that “This probably would have been better as a private comment, in retrospect, to be debated and moderated amongst friends. Although it proved amusing.”
“A father of three, Lonsdale is a regular critic of ‘woke’ politics. He is a longtime associate of Peter Thiel, the powerful conservative billionaire,” Bloomberg added.
One size never fits all, of course, in terms of child-rearing responsibilities in a family. Given where we are in contemporary culture, however, at least as it manifests itself online, the Twitter reaction was probably to be expected. Here is a sampling:
You didn’t take six months off. So … sounds like we agree that would have been too much.
— Joe Lonsdale (@JTLonsdale) October 27, 2021
Imagine thinking as a father that you have to take six full months off from your work to prove you love your newborn.
— Joe Lonsdale (@JTLonsdale) October 27, 2021
Wow. In the “old days” people were often forced to work 18 hour days, 7 days a week, including children, to provide for their families. That was so masculine! But then we evolved as a society and introduced labor laws and social welfare policies. Nostalgia🙇
— Elad Gilo (@elad_gilo) October 27, 2021
Dude, if you died today, your company would go on fine without you, in fact it would likely improve once freed of your bullshit issues. Sadly, your family would likely as well. You are under the impression that you are important because of your work. You are not.
— Melanie T (@MelanieRetweets) October 28, 2021
If you’re pining for the ol’ glory days of masculinity, the correct masculine response is to go fight a lion in the cage for a loaf of bread for your family.
Fought any lions 🦁 or hippos with a spear? If not, you’re not masculine enough!
— Akhilesh Mritunjai (@TheMritunjai) October 28, 2021
To be fair, if I were your kid I’d also be opposed to paternity leave
— At Wholesome Prison (@WholesomePrison) October 27, 2021
Your companies are a net negative for society, even if (especially if) you made a lot of money from them. And “senior leadership” does basically nothing of value, congrats you oversaw and siphoned profits from other people’s actual work.

In its web GUI there are options for auto-mounting USB drives. I also discovered that if I formatted my external drive with the label "jffs", it would mount at /jffs on the router. (Yes, I know that's "wrong", but it works and is also in the default search path for shared libraries so I didn't have to fiddle with LD_LIBRARY_PATH.) I don't know if there's much more advice I can give right off hand, but let me know if you have other questions.

The most revolutionary Greg Graffin quotes that may be undiscovered and unusual
PUNK IS: the personal expression of uniqueness that comes from the experiences of growing up in touch with our human ability to reason and ask questions.
Whether you reach a lot of people or have a profound impact on a few people, their memories of you are your afterlife..
I don't bill myself as an atheist but as a naturalist.
Naturalism is a belief system. A lot of scientists bristle at that. We all have to believe we can find the truth. Evidence is my guide. I rely on observation, experimentation and verification..
I'm trying to champion the naturalist's worldview and show it's not as heathen as most religious people would make it out to be.
Science is very vibrant. There are always new observations to be found. And it's all in the interest in challenging the authority that came before you. That's consistent with the punk rock ethos that suggests that you should not take what people say at face value.
Naturalism teaches one of the most important things in this world.
There is only this life, so live wonderfully and meaningfully.
The thread of culture that runs through the entire history of punk is also a dedication to challenging the authoritarian.
I would say there's a lot of similarity between folk and punk. It's written for the common man.
If you can believe in God, then you can believe in anything. It's a gang mentality..
So much of the habitat destruction and pollution is based on the simple principle that we somehow have been given free license over other species to degrade the planet.
Whether or not punk is the flavor of the month is not important for us.
Bad Religion has been popular through many different climates. When heavy metal was popular, when new wave was popular, Bad Religion was still there underneath the mainstream selling more and more records.
You can't take up all the music bins at a CD retail outlet with Spice Girls CDs and leave nothing for the Joan Jett catalogue.
A fossil is so powerful. It's moving. This is my ancestor. The naturalist is moved by the fossil... not the cross.
I don't think anyone is going to Hell, because it only exists in the minds of people who wish ill will on others.
Bad Religion has never been about criticizing people who are Christian.
But we've always been about pointing out the irony and contradictions in Christian theology and the more extreme versions of Christians that seek to challenge modern secularism..
One of our great thematic traditions in Bad Religion has been to question human nature.
I definitely was attracted to similar things in punk and science.
They both depend on a healthy dose of skepticism.
It's not a random chance that we have Alanis Morissette.
She didn't evolve out of a null and void. She came from a former template. She borrowed styles and sounds from a very limited set of other artists.
Dont take Portlandia too personally - Its just a stupid TV show
Knowledge is organized data. For it to be shelved as human knowledge it's got to be predictable, repeatable, all the basics of scientific validation have to be there.
For me, the existence of nonexistence of God is a nonissue.
Creativity is a challenge. It requires us to be fully human -- autonomous yet engaged, independent yet interdependent. Creativity bridges the conflict between our individualistic and our sociality. It celebrates the commonality of our species while simultaneously setting us apart as unique individuals.
The problem is, as a company, if you attempt to streamline knowledge or try to limit information you get accused of censorship. So they have to open the gates to any a**hole's opinion. It's like 'oh that opinion is valid'. No, it's not. Not all opinions are valid, you know? It's this idea that every kid gets a trophy. Yeah, but someone won the game!
I'm saying that there were many great naturalists before Darwin's time who were very pious people and who knew more about nature than most of us. These were great naturalists; people I would admire for their knowledge of natural science given the time.
I'm a biologist, so... Which I think should be mandatory. Biology should be mandatory. Mathematics? They say we don't know enough about math and science. Well we don't know enough about science and particularly biology, which is such a huge field.
there is no such thing as hell but you can make it if you try.
This era in human existence where so much information is out there, it's easy for someone like Donald Trump to use that to make his claim that information is fake news. And there are people who think 'I guess we should believe the President when he says it's fake news.'
We delude ourselves into believing that morality comes from somewhere else, whereas in reality we behave as we've been told to behave.
It's been an objective of mine since I started writing songs to include both intellect and energy.
I usually am thinking about my next book the second I put the last dot on the previous one that I turn in.
I believe in strong legislation for the environment.
So the only question is being smart enough and educated enough to scrutinize the people who are writing the legislation, because there are plenty of ulterior motives out there.
....the songs are universal enough that in ten years time they should still hold up quite well.
Unfortunately, the average guy on the street believes that studying evolution leads to atheism.
People need to understand the basics of evolution if they are going to reject it—otherwise, they are not contributing anything productive to modern society.
You can't let your personal disposition be dictated by the world around you.
When we look back on this time and we are going to see what the Internet brought us, and social media brought us, I think people are going to say 'how did people know anything in those years, during that particular time in history?' Because there is so much disorganization in the information.
If there is no destiny, there is no design.
There's only life and death. My goal is to learn about life by living it, not by trying to figure out a cryptic plan that the Creator had in store for me..
Almost everyone shuts down when science becomes too technical;
you've got to infuse it with entertainment and storytelling to make it effective. From high school on, science is taught in a very dry manner, which isn't as potent.
Folk.
There are certain ways you have to delude yourself.
Self-delusion is important, for instance in family life. You know what I mean? If you're in love with your wife you have to go in there with blind faith. You have to support everything. And with your kids, you have to believe that you're doing something that has higher purpose; even though you don't have any evidence that that's the way it's going to turn out.Three Multi-size SIM Card (Nano/Micro/Standard)

In fact we have moved 15 times to date..Citizens of the United States watched in shock on Jan. 6 as pro-Trump supporters, who continue to maintain that the presidential election has been rigged, stormed the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., in an effort to disrupt the counting of electoral votes–a process mandated by the U.S. Constitution.
Many in the U.S. cite the tradition of a peaceful transition of power, despite the outcome of any election, as a guarantee in the nation–and many were stunned by the mob’s attack on a federal building and its attempt to halt democratic processes and prevent Joe Biden from becoming the nation’s next president in just a few short weeks.
January 6, 2021 calls for more than surface-level lessons on what our nation’s democracy is, what it stands for, and where our country is headed. Discussing events like this aren’t always easy, and teaching strategies will certainly vary with students’ ages.
Here are some resources educators can use to help their students process and understand what happened in the U.S. Capitol Building this week.
1. The New York Times offers a lesson plan on the topic. Teaching Resources for the Storming of the U.S. Capitol by Pro-Trump Extremists includes dozens of lesson plan ideas, activities and Times materials for exploring the causes and consequences of this assault on democracy in the United States.
2. PBS offers three ways to teach insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, intended for grades 6-12.
3. We Are Teachers recognizes that while we’re all still trying to process the events of Jan. 6, teachers also must be prepared to help their students learn about what happened. The site offers resources and tips to do just that.
4. Newsela offers a number of articles and insight on the events.
5. Teaching Tolerance shares resources to help educators guide students as they consider that events of Jan. 6 and discuss what led up to them and where the nation goes from here.
6. Facing History‘s resources can help educators teach their students about the insurrection in D.C., and the site will be continually updated with new ideas and resources.
7. This is an excellent time to teach the importance of critical evaluation when it comes to news and media resources. Common Sense Media offers a number of activities to do just that.

Kyle,
The neighbor statement in your configuration must be in two separate sections: Under the main configuration, and under the address family (as we now support IPv4 and IPv6 and can run them concurrently or separated to different peers. So your configuration should work if you add neighbor 55.55.55.1 under your address-family ipv4 command.

Next week, Big Bang arrives. On Sunday evening at my house, things start rolling with a gathering of the planning team for the Leadership Conference to be held in January in San Diego. It will certainly be great to see everyone and it is probably the most BPL people that have gathered in one place since we met right at the beginning of COVID in West Hollywood, FL - February 2020.
As usual there is a ton going on for Big Bang. This year’s theme Expectations Revolution strikes a chord that resonates with Leaving to Learn (LtL). In LtL, Expectations loom large. From the beginning of BPL, we always talked about how schools have always had expectations of students but that also students have expectations of schools. These expectations go mostly unrecognized and is the cause of loads of student disengagement. It is no mere coincidence that without any prompts Sophia and Naseem discussed their high expectations. Student’s expectations are something we have paid attention to and honored since our beginnings. Watch -.
A few things I’ll be doing at BB:
My San Diego Leaving to Learn is taking us to “Say Their Names” a travelling exhibition driven by community volunteers from every city that the exhibition goes to. “Say Their Names” honors dozens of Black Americans who lost their lives interacting with police or who were victims of hate crimes. I’ve already been to the exhibit. While there, I stopped at each of the 300+ photos and said their name. ‘Nuff said.
At Big Bang, Harbor Freight Fellows, Project InSight and BPLiving will all be facilitated and led by students. All of this initiatives have a big year coming up around spreading and scaling beyond our schools into communities and districts. Maddie, Tirza, Alisha, David, Roccio and Maria and others will be with us at these sessions. Also, B-Unbound will have a session and be announced to our larger community. B-U is an opportunity to do BPL out of the confines of a school. Later today Me, Pam, Anthonette and Viv and David G. will be meeting around forms B-U can take.
My calls with Stephen Small , Director of the Institute for the Study of Societal Issues (ISSI) and Professor of African American Studies at Berkeley are getting to a place where ISSI is getting involved with BPLiving both in the Bay Area and around the country more specifically, in New Orleans at the post-secondary level. Also, an article in SUNY Downstate Medical School is coming out about BPliving. With Eric Adams being the front runner for mayor in NYC, there is lots of potential for NYC schools to take a national lead on well-being and heathy lifestyles..

Love this certificate from BPL Italia and a photo Beth sent on the way Italians practicing social distancing in a field of lavender.
Not much time to do a slew of ‘Ellisms’ for this year’s Big Bang but here are a few that have come out recently.
We are always at a crossroads in our work. Do we go as we know or do we know as we go? We make the road by walking.
Student-centered: Are you WITH a student or is a student WITH you? Both are student-centered. Are they both student-driven?
Agency - alone together; individual autonomy is entirely dependent on the community
Check-out Sherry Turkle on Alone Together - MIT professor Sherry Turkle argues that as technology ramps up, our emotional lives ramp down. Based on hundreds of interviews and with a new introduction taking us to the present day, Alone Together describes changing, unsettling relationships between friends, lovers, and families.
See you at Big Bang where we get online to get offline.
Be Well!

From Purpose and Summary: "The Protecting Children from Identity Theft Act (H.R. 5192), as reported by the Committee on Ways and Means, requires the Social Security Administration (SSA) to match the name, Social Security number (SSN), and date of birth submitted by permitted entities against the SSA's records. The bill seeks to protect individuals, firms and the economy by allowing financial institutions to verify the accuracy of their customers' personal identity information, in order to guard against the establishment of synthetic identities based on a valid SSN and a false name. The bill would require the SSA to develop or improve an existing system which verifies name-SSN matches and require SSA to accept an electronic signature as authorization of the consent required to conduct this verification. Currently, the SSA requires a wet signature on a paper form as proof of consent. However, many credit applications occur online where a wet signature cannot be obtained. The bill protects the confidentiality of consumers' information and guards against fraudulent misuse of the system by requiring valid consent; limiting the system to certified users; requiring users to comply with requirements for data security and privacy in federal law and as required by the Commissioner; requiring compliance audits of users; and authorizing the Commissioner to terminate or suspend verification services for users that do not comply with these requirements. The bill also ensures the verification system does not detract from the SSA's ability to conduct its mission-critical work, by requiring users of the system to pay for all start-up and ongoing costs, both direct and indirect, of the verification system."Help with citationsMoon Pot III

Sophie Milner is a London based artist and writer. Her practice explores interrelations between poetic symbolism, gesture and narrative within painting, drawing upon both historic and personal symbolism to explore moments of biomorphic or psychological change. Her work functions to both encourage and disrupt the narratives she engages with, as a means of encouraging the viewer into a liminal engagement with the webs of associated imagery she interweaves. The resulting scenes are often filled with a sense of biological restlessness, that toy with the languages associated with violence and stillness, the figurative and abstract, and the self as perceived and felt.

You can snap the city skyline from the London Eye, or capture the sunset from picturesque Waterloo Bridge, but London is home to many more great photo-worthy places.
Whether you’re an avid photographer, or just a picture-happy tourist, there are plenty of local spots that can fill your digital albums with breathtaking shots.
Here’s an insider list of photo-worthy spots in London!
Modern Hall Park
An old waterwheel spins from the current of a stream in Modern Hall Park. The wheel was used to grind tobacco decades ago when the land was a working farm. You’ll find white steel bridges, lush trees and old farm buildings throughout the park. It’s also the perfect spot to enjoy a picnic with the family, so take a blanket and a traditional packed lunch to make the most of your day out.
Hampstead Hill Garden and Pergola
Head over to the Hampstead Hill Garden around sunset to capture breathtaking landscape photos. Check out the West Heath, where ivy-wrapped stone columns surround an elevated brick walkway. Take the whole family there to walk around and go home with some great family photos for the mantel.
God’s Own Junkyard
Vegas might be synonymous with glittering lights, but London’s own Chris Bracey has a “junkyard” full of neon signs he created for fashion’s hottest shows, landmark movies and celebrities. This “wonderland of creativity” is a fun and funky picture-taking place. You can also stop by for a bite at The Rolling Scones cafe which is open all weekend. God’s Own Junkyard is open Friday-Sunday.
Carnaby Street
The historic arch that spans the entrance to 13 streets of Carnaby are picture gold. It’s a bustling area, where you can snap candid photos of everyday life. With unique buildings housing independent shops, you can capture images of structures and people wandering about. Carnaby is also home to some of the tastiest restaurants in the capital, so be sure to take snaps of the delicious culinary offerings.
Notting Hill
Travel to Notting Hill, a quaint neighborhood made famous by the Julia Roberts movie of the same name. Hit Portobello Road for some great architecture shots. You’ll find trendy home design shops like Loaf, cafes and bars sandwiched together along a narrow, colorful road. Take a stroll over to the South Kensington neighborhood to see more affluent, tightly packed brick homes.
We also happen to have some of the most beautiful apartments in the South Kensington neighborhood!
Canary Wharf
Tube stations aren’t just transportation hubs, some are also impressive works of art. Canary Wharf, for example, offers a massive escalator that looks like it juts up into a glass ceiling above. The natural light is amazing, which makes it a great spot for photos.
If you like Canary Wharf, Southwark station has a giant wall of reflective blue triangles that could make for some unique shots, also.
Hungerford Bridge
Photo courtesy of Johannes Reusc
Waterloo Bridge is a hot spot for photographers, however, pictures from Hungerford Bridge won’t disappoint either! The bridge affords many picture compositions with cables shooting up along the pedestrian portion of the bridge and the River Thames flowing below. You can take some stunning images in the day, but night photography offers many great photo opportunities, too.
By stopping by these seven places, you’ll have an original album full of unique photos from London that can’t be topped. If you’ve been to London, feel free to share your favorite picture-taking spot with others in the comment section below.

This trunk was found in a barn in Kalamazoo, Michigan. History unknown, manufacturer unknown. It's not like other wardrobe trunks I've seen - it's small and light, it doesn't hinge open, there's no shoebox and no drawers, and that funky accessory bag in pic #3 seems unique as well.
I think its outer case is aluminum - badly gouged in some places - and it looks like all the edges were covered in a very fine leather that was painted silver. I thought it was all rust at first until I took a closer look.
I'm surprised there's NO manufacturer info anywhere on this trunk. Does it look familiar at all to anyone? I'm guessing maybe 1930s, based on similar suitcases I've seen..Dorset Polo Club, based in Lytchett Matravers near Poole, has confirmed the return the Dorset Polo Festival for 2020. The family-friendly event will take place on the Lytchett Heath Estate on Sunday 21 June.
The Dorset Polo Festival, which has been running since 2017, is a one-day event offering attendees from Dorset and beyond the opportunity to watch exhilarating polo matches, take part in a variety of enjoyable family-friendly activities and enjoy a range of local trade stands with plenty of artisan food and drink.
Rob Brockett of Dorset Polo Club said, “We’re delighted to bring the Dorset Polo Festival back for 2020. Based on the success of last year’s event, we’re planning even bigger and better events and activities to delight visitors of all ages. To accompany the excitement and thrills of the polo matches, there’ll be a range of fun activities for all the family and tempting food and drink offerings, to showcase the best of Dorset.
“The hugely popular fun dog show will also be returning for 2020, offering a range of classes for all shapes and sizes. Even if your family pet doesn’t have an impressive pedigree, there’ll be plenty of opportunities for them to shine!”
Founded in 2011, the Dorset Polo Club provides sociable and competitive polo for all abilities. It holds over 600 polo lessons per year and offers members the opportunity to play regular chukkas in a beautiful setting overlooking Poole Harbour. A new arena extends the polo season across the entire calendar year. Run by Jemima and Rob Brockett, whose combined experience playing and working in polo amounts to 42 years, the club also offers corporate and team building days as well as bespoke packages for unique celebrations.
Rob added, “The Dorset Polo Festival was established to bring the excitement of polo to the attention of a wider audience. It’s a superb, fast-paced sport which is great fun to play and just as much fun to watch. The beauty of polo is that is allows players to compete on a level playing field, regardless of age or gender, which is something which rarely happens in other sports. The festival aims to illustrate that polo can be accessible to everyone. If you ride, you’ll love to play; if you don’t, we can teach you, and in any event it’s a thrilling spectator sport which appeals to all ages and backgrounds. We welcome anyone who is keen to come along and have a go.”China boosts FX swaps partnership with South Korea

The existing won-yuan swap arrangement reached in April 2009 was worth the equivalent of $33.5 billion at the current won-dollar exchange rate.
The central Bank of Korea (BoK) said its new deal with the People’s Bank of China would last until October 25, 2014.
The agreement came a week after South Korea and Japan signed a deal to increase their currency swap agreement to the equivalent of $70 billion from $13 billion.

A currency swap allows central banks to exchange their currencies with each other in case of a liquidity crunch.
The new swap deals will help South Korea secure extra liquidity in a worst-case scenario, even though its own foreign exchange reserves stood at $303.38 billion at end-September.
“This measure will help reduce a negative impact, caused by growing uncertainty in global financial markets, on the economies of the two countries,” the BoK said in a statement.
Exchanges have also been opening doors to the export currency, CME group launched a Yuan denominated futures contract and SGX has started offering NDF’s.

Get viewers to take action when viewing your videos. This is a “call-to-action” tactic. For instance, if you’d like your audience to subscribe to a newsletter, give them the option of clicking a link within your video description. To make this work efficiently, it has to be easy to do for the viewers.
Your content submissions should be engaging as well as fresh. This will ensure viewer returns. Boring content does nothing except repel viewers, and that is not good for business. Be original, create some fun videos and work on your endings so viewers want to see the next video. Great content will boost sales..
The first thing to figure out is the success of your video. You can always use your own judgment about a video’s likely appeal. If you have actual numbers available it will be much more helpful. Look at how many views you have and how much of your videos they’ve watched, and more.
Video marketing is simple to implement, as you can now see. The only thing that you have to do is learn all you can about it. After doing that, then your marketing strategy will be successful. Now the only thing left to do is to start working on it!Description

ROCHESTER, NY — A group protesting the death of Daniel Prude suspended its demonstrations Monday night, but said it was planning "new actions in the coming weeks."
In a statement posted on Facebook and Instagram, Free The People Roc said:
As a result of the thousands of you who have marched, rallied, and occupied City Hall, we’re winning justice for Daniel Prude and his family. On Sunday, Attorney General Tish James announced a new policy to release body cam footage in police brutality cases directly to the public, and today Mayor [Lovely] Warren and RPD [acting] Chief Mark Simmons were subpoenaed as part of an investigation into Daniel’s murder.
Our organizers have decided to end Occupy City Hall and plan new actions in the coming weeks. We recognize that taking care of our collective health and wellbeing is a revolutionary act. Systems of oppression want to see us tired and beaten down. But we won’t give them that satisfaction. We urge those of you who have been out with us every night to rest, reflect, and recharge for the next set of actions. Our movement is just beginning..

A foreign ministry letter seen by The Associated Press says the WHO representative to Burundi, Walter Kazadi Mulombo, has been declared persona non grata and must leave the East African nation by Friday. The letter says three WHO experts also must go.
The letter gives no explanation for the expulsions. Reached by phone and asked for details, Foreign Minister Ezechiel Nibigira hung up Thursday morning.
The WHO representative, Mulombo, did not immediately respond to phone calls. .
Burundi has 27 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but some citizens and others have raised concerns that more exist.
Authorities have been accused of downplaying the virus and relying on divine protection, while rights groups have alleged squalid conditions and lack of access to quarantine facilities.
Burundi is using virus restrictions to limit election observers, however, telling the East African regional bloc that any arriving foreigners would face a 14-day quarantine. The election is May 20.
Holding a vote that allows the virus to spread could make it extremely difficult for a country to contain it later, the Africa CDC chief said.
If an election is conducted that limits space for people to come together, it’s OK. But if you cannot ensure that … then it’s gonna put you in danger.”
Burundi’s previous election in 2015 sparked deadly political turmoil.
This is not the first time Burundi’s government has expelled a United Nations official. It kicked out the UN human rights office a year ago after the UN repeatedly raised concerns about killings and other alleged abuses following the 2015 vote.
Burundi also became the first country to leave the International Criminal Court after ICC judges authorized an investigation into allegations of state-sponsored crimes including murder, rape and torture.Martinborough Vineyards

Emily Maxwell, introduced in O’Nan’s Wish You Were Here (2003), is a compellingly old-fashioned character—wry, unsentimental, resourceful, self-critical and stalwart, even as her life fills with loss. Her beloved husband and best friend are dead, her family is far-flung, and her once-tight circle of country-club friends diminishes by the week. The brutalities of old age are upon her: she’s socially invisible, her body is weakening, she’s nervous in her once-genteel Pittsburgh neighbourhood.
It’s territory most of us don’t want to visit. So it’s testament to O’Nan’s talent that Emily, Alone is a page-turner suffused with vibrancy, humour, even hope. Emily finds purpose and comfort through order and ritual: writing to-do lists, attending church, keeping house, planning elaborate family holidays, and making weekly pilgrimages to Eat ‘n Park’s two-for-one buffet with her sister-in-law Arlene. During one of those jaunts, Arlene, the terrifying designated driver, suffers a minor stroke that prompts the frugal Emily to buy a new car, which brings fresh freedoms.
Emily’s universe may be small, but its depths are complex—revealing prickly tensions between elderly parents and middle-aged children, rueful observations on funeral etiquette, the complicated bundling of final regrets and reckonings. Emily’s unflinching insights are often disquieting. Happy memories, she finds, are actually the most painful: “They plagued her like migraines, left her helpless and dissatisfied, as if her life and the lives of all those she’d loved had come to nothing, merely because that time was gone, receding even in her own memory, to be replaced by this diminished present.” Yet even a diminished present can offer joy and discovery, as a temporarily depressed Emily realizes as she muses on the duplicitous nature of time: “Time, which had her on the rack, would just as effortlessly rescue her. This funk was temporary. Tomorrow she would be fine.”Sammohanam
After a laugh riot like 'Ami Thumi', Mohankrishna Indraganti is expected to present a clean rom-com. That's 'Sammohanam', slated to be released on June 15.
Sudheer Babu plays a children's book illustrator in this seemingly thought-provoking movie. Aditi Rao Hydari, who was recently seen in Mani Ratnam's 'Cheliyaa' and Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Padmaavat', seems to be in the showbiz, entertaining the audience as a heroine.
Romance and comedy are said to be the film's hallmarks. Naresh, Tanikella Bharani, Nandu, Rahul Ramakrishna, Pavithra Lokesh, Kadambari Kiran, Hari Teja, Kedar Shankar, Abhay and Harshini are part of the cast.
Music is by Vivek Sagar. The cinematography is by PG Vinda. Editing is by Marthand K Venkatesh. Lyrics are by Sirivennela Seetaramasastry and Ramajogayya SastryGalaxyZoo, like Transcribe Bentham. What can small institutions and small projects do, and do the rules that seem to apply to large projects also apply to them?
Balboa Park Online Collaborative. It's a Klauber Field Notes Transcription Project--the field notes of Laurence M. Klauber, who was the nation's foremost authority on rattlesnakes. These are field notes that he kept from 1923 through 1967. This is done by the San Diego Natural History Museum and is run by our own Perian Sully who is out there in the room somewhere.
Julia Brumfield Diaries. If the name looks familiar, it's because she's my great-great grandmother. This project was the impetus for me to develop this tool for crowdsourced transcription.
So all of these projects, what they have in common is that we're talking about page counts that are in the thousands and volunteer counts that are numbered in the dozens at best. So these are not FamilySearch Indexing, where you can rely on hundreds of thousands of volunteers and large networks.
this is the North American Bird Phenology Program out of Patuxent
summed up by Rachel Stone, and what she essentially said is that crowdsourcing isn't getting the sort of random distribution from the crowd. Crowdsourcing is getting a number of "well-informed enthusiasts."
SETILive. Now what this does is it pulls in live data from the SETI satellites[sic: actually telescope], and in those 24 hours--I took this screenshot; I actually skipped lunch to get this one screenshot because I knew that it would pass 10,000 people participating with 80,000 of these classifications. And it would have been higher, except last night the telescope got covered by cloud cover. So they dropped from getting 30 to 40 contributions per second to having to show sort of archival data and getting only 10 contributions per second. Well, they can do this because they have an existing base of active volunteers that numbers around 600,000.
Kathryn Stallard and Anne Veerkamp-Andersen at Southwestern University Special Collections and I discussed a lot when we were trying to launch the Zenas Matthews Diary. We said, "Well, we don't have any budget at all." Kathryn said, "Well, let's talk about local archival newsletters. Let's post to H-Net lists." I was in favor of looking at online communities of people who might be doing Matthews genealogy or the military history war-gamers who have discussion forums on the Mexican War.
Well that wasn't actually what he was talking about, but he responds and says, "Yeah, okay, I'll check that out, but can you please give me the document I want." They get it back to him and we returned to our discussion of "Okay, what do we need to do to roll this out? We're going to start working on the information architecture. We're going to work on the UI. We're going to work on help screens." And while we're having this conversation, Mr. Patrick checks it out.
So wow! All right! We got our well-informed enthusiast! In 14 days, he transcribed the diary, and he didn't do just one pass. I mean as he got familiar with the hand, he goes back and revises the earlier transcriptions. He kind of figures out who's involved. He asks other members of his heritage organization what this is. He adds two dozen footnotes.
What just happened? What was that about? Who is this guy? Well, Scott Patrick is a retired petroleum worker who got interested in his family history, and then got interested in local history, and then got interested in heritage organizations. And he is our ideal "well-informed enthusiast".
What you have when someone is coming in and asking about material is, if you think about this in terms of target marketing--this is a target-rich environment. Here is someone who is interested. He's online. He's researching this particular subject. He is not an existing patron. he has no prior relationship with Southwestern University Libraries, but "Hey, while we answer your request, you might check this thing out that's in this related field." That seems to have worked in this one case. Hopefully, we'll get some more experience with future projects.
OldWeather, which is run by GalaxyZoo, will plot your ship on a Google map as you transcribe the latitude and longitude elements from the log books.
crowdsourcing game of Whac-A-Mole. So this is crowdsourcing taken to the extreme.
And hey, while we're at it, let's mine our data. We can come up with a couple of top-10 lists. So we come up with the top-ten list of transcribers and a top-ten list of editors, because that's the data I have.
Well remember, the whole point of this exercise is to index these diaries so that we can find the mentions of these individual species in the original manuscripts. Do you see indexing on here anywhere? Neither did our volunteers, and the minute this went up, the volunteers who previously had been transcribing and indexing every single page stopped indexing completely. They weren't being measured on it. We weren't saying that we rewarded them for it, so they stopped.
Alexandra Eveleigh. Her point is that if you're going to design any kind of extrinsic motivation, you have to make sure that it promotes the actual contributory behavior, and this is something that applies, I believe, to small projects as well as large projects.Can we integrate our postings with your system?

She’s sweet and lovely – He’s charming and kind. Can you get a better match than that? When Casey and I first spoke with Michelle & Adam for our initial Skype meeting, they told us about the epic party they wanted, she wanted to be able to eat everything at their wedding (girl after my own heart – or stomach) and they really just wanted to enjoy every moment of the day… cue the sparkle alarm! They are a #KOWEcouple.
Senior Coordinator, Casey says: Michelle and Adam are like two puzzle pieces that fit perfectly together. When I finally got to meet them in person the week of the their wedding (after months of only talking on the phone), it was like seeing old friends. They were warm, genuine and loved each other so deeply you could feel it. I was honored to share in the celebration of their wedding day and can only wish that my future husband looks at me the way Adam looks at you! 😉
Michelle says: The KOWE team made the day run smoothly and both Adam and I felt that we could relax as we knew KOWE was on top of every detail. Every time I went to Casey with a question or concern, she had already planned for and taken care of it. She was literally three steps ahead of everyone and it was so reassuring to know she was there. My only regret is that we did not choose a more extensive package that offered more planning help. The team is dedicated to making your day perfect and they are complete professionals.
We spent the day our new friendors, The Spragues & Birdhouse Films who captured all the feels of their wedding day. Check em’ out. Now onto the gorgeous moments they captured:
We started the morning with Michelle and morning preparations
We love when our couples share love notes before they walk down the aisle. It’s so sweet and the most perfect memento.
The walk “down the aisle” at Gedney Farm’s ceremony location, the knoll is epic.
That backdrop… seriously?
I do!
Pure joy for the newlyweds. This may be my favorite image out of them all (I know it was hard to choose).
The oh-so-handsome bridal party! Gedney Farm was glowing for Michelle & Adam.
That light though!
Linda and her team did a beautiful job. Keeping it simple and matching the amazing landscape of the venue.
#teamKOWE always there to pick out sticks from your train and a quick bustle before cocktail hour!
We love the way the main floor of the barn sparkles with bistro lights!
A quick dress change for Michelle and some fantastic sunset pictures!
Michelle and Adam, we wish a life as SWEET(man) as you both are. I couldn’t imagine a better fit than you two. Sending you so much love and sparkle!

Apparently many makers already have. Tesla in at number 6 and 10 in this evaluation. Top 12 Best Electric Cars (2019 Update): UK Market Guide • Motorway Top 12 Best Electric Cars in 2019 When talking about the best electric cars, you’ll rarely finish the discussion without the word ‘Tesla’ popping up mid conversation. Yes we all love Tesla and there’s no doubting the quality of their cars, but many people don’t realise there are now plenty of incredible (and often more affordable) Tesla alternatives on the market. We’ve created this guide to cover all the best electric cars to buy in 2019, including a couple of the best new Tesla models for good measure. The best electric cars are reviewed below: Jaguar I-Pace Hyundai Kona Electric Kia e-Niro Mercedes EQC BMW i3 Tesla Model 3 Volkswagen e-Golf Audi E-Tron Quattro Renault Zoe Tesla Model X Nissan Leaf Hyundai Ionic63,000. But how does it actually stand up to the Tesla? Jaguar’s new I-PACE electric is taking on the Tesla Model X58,500 (with Government grant) or £63,000 (without)30,000 – at just half the price of the Jaguar iPace, you can see why they’re calling it a game changer! The 2018 Hyundai Kona Electric in all its efficient, long range glory Range aside, at a weight of 1.7 tonnes, it’s a bit heavy and not the most practical car – and it doesn’t feel quite as fast as many other slicker EVs. But it’s got all the features you’d want in 2019 – including a charging pad with higher-end models. The handling isn’t the best but it’s comfortable, and with 300 miles of range for £30,000 it’s generally hard to quibble! This one should definitely be on your short list. Price range: from £25,000 Distance on a full charge: 200-300 miles Advantages: Futuristic looks Excellent value Incredibly high mileage for the price Disadvantages: Poor ride, mediocre handling and it’s heavy Less spacious and more impractical that the iPace and Tesla Model X Expensive to service and insure 3. Kia e-Niro The new fully-electric Kia e-Niro has the potential to completely change the electric car market in the same way as the Hyundai Kona Electric32.9 electric motor) but this electric Kia handles more than well enough around corners and in town. The Kia e-Niro could be a game changer in the industry due to its high mileage range and low cost. Winner! So what is the difference between this and the Hyundai Kona? Well for a start the handling is slightly better (even though Kia is slightly heavier). The interior of the Kia is slightly higher quality than the Kona too and you’ll get a better driving position. There’s also more space in the back seats. For the price it’s very hard to argue that the Kia E-Niro shouldn’t be on your wishlist. The downside is that at the time of writing (March 2019), the Kia E-Niro isn’t actually available on the market to buy. Though we can expect to see it on roads towards the end of the year. A winner. Price range: starts at £32.995 (depending on spec/ finance choice) Distance on a full charge: claimed 282 miles, real world 253 miles! Advantages: Bargain price! 7 year Kia warranty Quiet Incredible range! Disadvantages: Average performance, average handling Heavy car 4. Mercedes EQC The Mercedes EQC is the first in an all-electric range coming from Mercedes in 2019 .. It’s likely to cost you from around £55,000 to £75,000 with added specs, trims and other options. The Mercedes EQC at the Paris Motor Show 2018. Hello future!55,000 Distance on a full charge: 250-300 miles Advantages: Luxury exterior and interior Spacious (thanks to being an SUV-style vehicle) 2 x electric engines for speed and performance Disadvantages: Expensive There may be limited stock in early 2019 forward thinking. You’ll get to 0-62mph in 7.3 seconds and reach a top speed just shy of 100mph (93mph to be precise). BMW’s flagship BMW i3, one of the very best electric cars to buy in 2019 There are various models available, some with more oomph under the hood and others with more range. With the new and improved i3S (Sport Edition) due out soon, the i3 has to be top of the pile of the best electric cars. Price range: £30,925 – £46,595 Distance on a full charge: 80 – 125 miles Advantages: Speed Build quality Futuristic looks Disadvantages: Expensive to service and insure Poor low speed ride 6. Tesla Model 3 The Tesla model 3 is the electric car everyone is talking about. Stunning, futuristic and reasonably priced, this electric is a smaller, cheaper (half the price) version of the Model X (which we’ve also reviewed here). It is a vital part of the Tesla’s master plan to provide and sell an ecosystem of sustainable products – but there’s a small spanner in the works. They won’t be widely available in the UK and Europe until at least mid-2019. That’s a lot of waiting around… Tesla’s latest – the ‘Model 3’ That being said, there are still a fair few to buy on the market (whether new or used) and Tesla recently announced a successful ramp up in production. Not only that, but in October 2018, Elon Musk also suggested a newer, cheaper Model 3 may be just round the corner . All in all, there may be more available to purchase in 2019 than some auto pessimists suggested earlier in the year, so those waiting lists could be shorter than at first thought. But whatever the supply situation, the auto press has been singing the Model 3’s praises since it was first announced. This thing is quick, it’ll do 0-62mph in just 4.4 seconds while the more expensive P100D version does it in an amazing 2.7 seconds and it drives’ for a start!30,000 – £38,000 [TBC] Distance on a full charge: 300-350 miles Advantages: You’ll impress your friends! Full of tech (it’s a Tesla after all) Very quick Disadvantages: There could be a lengthy waiting list May draw unwanted attention Elon Musk may not be to everyone’s taste 24.2kW lithium ion battery between the axles. Going electric gives you speedier acceleration, but generally a lower top speed (87mph for this Golf). VW’s eGolf. An updated electric design for an ever-popular model All the internal goodies are top notch, as we’ve come to expect from the Volkswagen Golf range . A sturdy mid-range electric winner! Price range: £17,570 – £34,095 Distance on a full charge: 100 – 118 miles Advantages: Comfortable ride and handling Practical Cheaper to run than the BMW i3 Disadvantages: High monthly PCP payments Slightly dreary interior 8. Audi E-Tron Quattro The Audi E-Tron Quatro (not officially on the market until early ‘ish’ 2019) is without doubt an electric car you should have on your radar. It’s Audi’s flagship electric Audi E-Tron Quattro (Coming in 2019) The E-Tron will manage 0-62mph in under). Advantages: Be an owner of the first ever Audi electric Audi build quality Full of tech Good range Disadvantages: Not released until Jan 2019 Not fully tested and reviewed yet 9. Renault Zoe We’ve chosen to look at the Renault Zoe electric car as they start at just £14,245 (with a Government grant) making it the cheapest EV on the market in the UK. The only downside to that low initial cost is the slightly odd fact that you have to lease the battery at an additional cost. Renault’s Zoe, the budget-friendly electric car for 2019 You can buy the car outright (Zoe i model) but it’ll set you back more upfront. The benefit to a lease however is that Renault will replace the battery free of charge if the range drops below 75% of what it was when bought new. Quite an attractive offer with anyone familiar with owning an old mobile phone. The Zoe has the biggest driving range of any sub 30K EV so if range is a worry, the Zoe could be for you. Price range: £14,245 – £31,215 (depending on spec/ finance choice) Distance on a full charge: 96 (basic) – 178 miles (top of the range) Advantages: Very low running costs Battery replacement guarantee Quiet Great range Disadvantages: Average performance, poor brake feel Battery lease agreement may put off some Dull interior 10. Tesla Model X The Tesla Model X is one of Elon Musk’s most successfully adopted electric cars yet. It was designed to crush the opposition in the SUV/ MPV markets and during its three-or-so-year-reign it did a pretty good job. It’s been around since December 2015. Back then there were basically no rivals in the market, but now we have direct competitors like the Jaguar i-Pace, Audi E-Tron Quattro and even Tesla’s own Model 3. So how does the Model X stand up now? Well, the new 100D version sill packs a punch! For a start, the falcon wing doors will always give it a wow factor and for that alone, it feels like something out of Back to the Future (available to buy in the present)… Tesla’s popular ‘Model X’ It’s super-quiet to drive, like most electrics and has HUGE punch on the acceleration front – reaching 0-60mph in a blistering 5.2 seconds. For a car that weighs 200kg, it: from £79,000 Distance on a full charge: 250 – 350 miles Advantages: Impressive falcon doors Smooth drive Great range Disadvantages: High cost Doors can be awkward 11. 2018. Top of the tree of electric cars in 2019? The Nissan Leaf There have been many improvements made since the first generation edition. The new massive battery range sits at a proven 168 miles and the engine produces much more power at 150bhp. Price: £21,990 (Including Government grant) Distance on a full charge: between 168 – 235 miles (top of the range) Advantages: Cheap to own Very quiet and smooth drive Spacious Disadvantages: Boxy design is a bit over-used and boring Not many options beyond the standard spec Awkward driving position 12. 2018. Hyundai? Not a brand normally associated with electric cars, but the Ioniq is a great fresh pick for 2019 This car has a modest maximum range of 174 miles and a super-smooth feel and ride, but it can be a bumpy drive when dealing with rough roads. Price: £28,995 (Including Government grant) Distance on a full charge: between 168 – 235 miles (top of the range) Advantages: Plush exterior and interior Spacious Low running costs Disadvantages: Options on specs are limiting A bumpy ride on less-smooth roads No ultra fast charging You may disagree with their evaluation but the sheer number of electric vehicles on sale and in the pipeline is quite amazing. Also in my case I have a VW and Skoda agent 10 minutes walk away, my nearest Tesla centre is 145 miles away.
Future Cars Worth Waiting For 2021-2025 Our sneak peeks. This video will give us information about future cars. 2021 Alfa Romeo GTV Quadrifoglio's 505-hp twin-turbo V-6. Expect up to 600 horsepower. 2021 Alfa Romeo Tonale. 2024 Aston Martin Vanquish. 2021 Audi e-Tron GT Audi's electric e-Tron lineup grows for 2021, with the shapely e-Tr. 021 Audi Q4 e-Tron The Audi Q4 e-Tron is smaller and cheaper than. It, too, will offer a slightly sleeker Sportback version. 2024 BMW i8 M! 2022 Chevrolet Corvette Z06. 2022 Ferrari Purosangue SUV. 2022 Ford Fusion Active Selling a station wagon in an American car market infatuated with SUVs is a risky play for a manufacturer. But once Ford kills off the Fusion sedan later this year or early next year,. 2022 Ford Maverick. 2022 GMC Hummer EV. It's set to go on sale at the end of 2021 in loaded First Edition form, with an SUV version to follow. 2022 Honda Civic Type R Honda confirmed that a new Civic Type R is on the way, and it should have a more mature look as previewed by a prototype of the 11th-generation Civic sedan. toward the end of 2021. 2023 Hyundai RM20 N. 2021 Hyundai Santa Cruz. We expect to see Santa Fe's 2.4-liter and turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four paired with an eight-speed automatic and all-wheel drive. 2022. 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee Early in 2021, Jeep will launch an entirely new Grand Cherokee. It likely won't make it into buyers' hands until later in the year, as production has been delayed. What those new owners will get is a Jeep based on a version of the Alfa Romeo Giorgio platform found under the Giulia sedan and Stelvio SUV. The Grand Cherokee will be significantly longer than the trim little Stelvio, though. Not only will the Jeep's wheelbase surpass the Alfa's 110.9 inches, we expect it to be longer than the current Grand Cherokee's 114.7 inches. Not only will be roomier than the outgoing model, but it will also offer a three-row version with up to seven seats, as pictured here in spy photos. 2022 Jeep Grand Wagoneer Jeep is bringing back the iconic Wagoneer nameplate for a new full-size SUV offering. Shown so far in concept form,.

An F performance model might even pack a twin-turbo V-8 good for 600-plus horsepower. Maserati MC20 The upcoming MC20 is a mid-engine reminder that Maserati exists. Rather than a successor to the ultrarare, hyper-expensive MC12, the MC20 is a run-of-the-mill six-figure Italian sports car offered in both coupe and convertible forms. Maserati promises that the MC20 marks the start of a new phase in the brand's history, which it desperately needs if its vehicles are going to be relevant again. Maserati recently released technical details about the MC20's twin-turbo V-6 engine, which will produce 621 horsepower.
Short answer: yes, of course the Model 3 will succeede, this doesn't change anything in Model 3 future. Let's face it: the main problem of Tesla Model 3 was not the 500,000 reservations long waiting list or the production speed - it was the anticipated waiting time. Some people jumped off the train and bought - the Model S. But in my opinion quite many are waiting for the base $35k model, maybe with some options, but whatever. Since Tesla pushes the advanced model 3 that costs around 48-60k, their deliveries will have to wait few additional weeks, for the last ones who made their reservations could be even a bit more. Yes, Tesla managed to ramp up the weekly production to 5000 cars per week and will probably hover around that number for some time; could be 6000, but let's be conservative for a moment. That's 5,000 x 52 = 260,000 per year. Probably 300,000 in the next year. But there are still 400,000 reservations. You do the calculation. Tesla is sold out almost up to the beginning of 2020. And then when the cars start arriving also to the international market (India, for example, isn't covered at all, yet) and are actually seen on the streets, I am sure that Tesla's Model 3 sales are secured for 4-5 years in the future - at least. I'd say more, but I won't over-speculate. And the Model 3 standard is head on head with its competition (Chevrolet Bolt, Hyundai Kona, Nissan Leaf 2019 E-plus), but excels on many points and it will be cheaper. And if some performances wouldn't match, Tesla could easily release an upgraded battery version when they are no match anymore. Tesla is starting to build a factory in Shanghai, China, to cover the East Asia market which is huge (China, Japan, S. Korea, Taiwan, probably also India in the future), but this plant won't be able to produce serious numbers of cars before 2021 and the production will be most probably split between the Model 3 and Model Y. I am sure that Tesla Model 3 sales have a bright future, especially because other cars: a) may be fancy, but are not in the same class (Jaguar iPace, Porsche Taycan, Audi E-Tron), b) have some serious design flaws (VW e-Golf, Nissan Leaf 40 kWh, Renault Zoe), c) are not produced in numbers that would be a serious competition to Tesla (like Hyundai-s, BMW i3 or Chevrolet Bolt) And I haven't seen any new car that would be announced for 2019 or 2020 that could out-compete the Model 3. Most that are announced are more a competition to the Model S or Model X. The only car that could be comparable in battery, price and availability will be the new Nissan Leaf 64 kWh E-plus, but by then Tesla will be ready. But when you make a close comparison of those two, the Leaf is no match. Yes, it's OK, it's good, but seriously, if you have to put the money on the table? No. Sorry, Nissan. Edit: Actually Tesla wants to get these numbers down! Who wants to have a waiting list of over one year or even much more! And beside Nissan there are few others that would want Tesla to go down too, of course the big three in Detroit and a few others (VW and other car makers) wouldn’t share a tear either. But Chevrolet & co., Tesla won’t go down. I actually expect it will make profits by the end of this year.
OK, we talk about the future. Mercedes will come out with the EQ C in 2020. Having a 80 kWh battery, it will be the a direct competitor to the Tesla Model X 75. Advantage? Luxury. Disadvantages? Less range, slower charging speed, most likely a higher consumption, comparable in charging only when the Ionity network is built and if it will offer CCS 2.0 ultra-rapid charge capability. Sorry, CCS 1.0 200A is significantly slower that Teslas Supercharger. The Model X is a 7-seater and additionally Tesla is continuously developing autonomous driving. Price? We don't know yet, but I bet a Mercedes won't be cheap. If Mercedes (as rumoured) will also make a 110 kWh version, the competitor is the Tesla Model X 100 and we have the same story again. Tesla Model X 100 is already built and the Mercedes in the far future of 2021 or 2022. Jaguar iPace? Good styling, better on unpaved roads than the (similarly priced) Model S 75. But the same story goes again: Tesla charges (a lot) faster, consumes (a lot) less, has more internal space. And it has the Autopilot and the Supercharger network. Audi is yet to be seen. I expect to see something between the iPace and the EQC. Edit: Audi e-Tron slightly outperforms the EQC and iPace, so it places itself between the Tesla Model X 75D and 100D. We have to wait for the prices and delivery / production numbers. Porsche Taycan? When it reaches the market, the competitor will be the Tesla Roadster 2 with it's big battery, range – and power. If Tesla (as promised) upgrades at least some Superchargers too, the Taycan will offer faster charging only on paper. But in performance? The Roadster will beat any roadworthy car on the planet - with maybe an exception of a handful of super-cars which cost ten times more, like some Bugatti or Koenigsegg, for example, in a single category - top speed. But you should know, at top speed they run out of fuel in less than 20 minutes too. Porsche Taycan will be left in the dust, even on a race track. But on the other side, yes, there can be better EVs made than Tesla is currently is making. Having some styling, features or convenience details. But when they will evenly match Tesla's cars in many categories, won't be worse in no one and be better in some others, you can be sure they will be a lot more expensive than Teslas. So better, regardless of price? Yes, some German manufacturers could produce better EVs by 2025, but since they are several years behind Tesla in development, they either won't offer all the features or they will be a lot more expensive. Probably both. But I am pretty sure no manufacturer will offer a better price/performance EV before 2030 - and match Teslas production numbers, which are currently about 40.000 of Model S and Model X (sold globally) and the Model 3 being well beyond 200.000 cars - per year.

Two years later, he was named the head coach of the Raiders, and eventually led the team to seven AFC West titles as well as a victory over the Vikings in Super Bowl XI. His overall coaching record of 103-32-7 is still a record for any coach in NFL history with a win percentage of .750.
After his retirement in 1979, he joined CBS as a broadcaster, where he worked until 1994. When CBS lost broadcast rights to NFL games, he switched to Fox and worked there until 2002, when he became the lead analyst for ABC's Monday Night Football. When NBC took over the primetime Sunday night game in 2006, he switched networks for the final time. His last broadcast game was Super Bowl XLIII between Arizona and Pittsburgh. Over his entire career as an analyst, Madden also managed to win sixteen Emmys for Outstanding Sports Analyst/Personality, and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2006. Replacing John Madden in the booth at NBC with Al Michaels will be Cris Collinsworth, who has filled in for Madden this past year.
Madden has also had a significant impact on the gaming world. The Madden NFL Football franchise is widely known to be the top selling sports series of all time, and recently celebrated its twentieth installment. But what does Madden's retirement mean to the acclaimed franchise from EA Sports? Will it continue in the same format, or will it change to reflect the exit of the legendary analyst? The speculation is obviously going to swirl around what steps will be taken in the wake of Madden's departure from the booth. While it may not wind up affecting Madden NFL 10, which has been in production for quite a while, this could significantly affect development of Madden NFL 11. John Madden's visible role with the title has been diminishing over the recent years, with Madden no longer contributing in-game commentary. In fact, with the exception of "Cyber Madden" to test a player's skills in Madden NFL 09, the game is virtually Madden in name only.
The retirement raises two separate and obvious paths that Madden NFL 11 could go. Madden has admitted that he "still loves all aspects of the game," which is the reason that it took months to come to the decision to retire. Without having to worry about driving the Madden Cruiser around the country on a weekly basis during the football season, it's possible that he could assume a larger consultant role on his game, adding additional coaching features and even revamping other EA Sports franchises like Head Coach. The other direction revolves more around Cris Collinsworth. Since Collinsworth seems to have been groomed as the heir apparent of John Madden at NBC, will this extend to EA Sports as well? Collinsworth's additions to last year's game was rather notable, as he did commentary with Tom Hammond, and was instrumental in breaking down plays with the EA Sports Backtrack feature to help players learn from their mistakes. But to be blunt, Collinsworth NFL 11 doesn't have the same ring to it that Madden NFL 11 does. Clearly, these are all speculative ideas regarding the future of the franchise, but they do raise significant questions that all football fans would want to know.
When we contacted EA Sports President Peter Moore, he issued."

Rolling rotas are inefficient because they have redundancy built in to allow people to book annual leave. You need more redundancy depending on your leave rules. If you want to allow people to have time off any possible shift permutation apart from nights, then essentially you need TWICE as many people to staff a rota than you actually need. You do not need this with self rostering.
Rolling rotas are designed to provide a baseline level of cover and the underlying assumption when they are written is that they are always full (they are never full). They also assume that doctors work full time (this is becoming less common). If a rolling rota isn’t full it means that the redundancy built in to allow leave falls apart, and that redundancy (which was never designed for departmental resilience) is used to plug gaps, which leads inevitably to people not being able to get leave, or attend educational opportunities. This damages morale, training, and leads to burnout.
The rolling rota is often thought of as the baseline or required level of staffing for a department, but actually this isn’t the case. The department needs staff to be allocated at a different time and frequency than the rolling rota does. Once you separate people’s work schedules from the departments schedules you can more efficiently allocate your staff, and at your level (ie middle grade), that will have a real impact on department function.
The other thing that people find hard to believe with self rostering systems is that they are better at allocating night shifts and weekends. Nearly everyone can remember stories of people being rostered for nights or a particular weekend, and them having very legitimate reasons for not being able to work (ie getting married, exams etc etc), now often these shifts if there was no swap available would either be left blank, or get swapped with an empty slot, and remain vacant. This doesn’t tend to happen with SR systems because everyone fits their OOH allocation to where they can actually provide it.
Isn’t it impossible to self roster junior doctors in training jobs?
There is nothing in the JD2016 T+C document that precludes self rostering providing that the safe rostering rules are met. There is also nothing in the T+C document to suggest that doctors on the same rota need to be paid the same. Medical staffing generally want everyone to work the same because it makes their payroll calculations easier, and they are even more woefully understaffed than we are.
Junior Doctor Contract 2016 gives quite specific rules about rotas and leave, but the key to allowing a SR system is in the paragraph that explains what a Generic Work Schedule is.
“…A standard full-time generic work schedule shall be for a minimum of 40 hours and a maximum of 48 hours per week, averaged over a reference period defined as being the length of the rota cycle, the length of the placement or 26 weeks, whichever is the shorter. A less than full time generic work schedule shall not exceed 40 hours, averaged over this same reference period…”
You can use a generic work schedule as a template for self rostering. As long as the doctor does the number of shifts in the work schedule, it doesn’t matter what order, or what combination they are done in.
If you pull the generic work schedule that HR have, and count the variety and type of shifts that can form your allocation. As long as every doctor works all of their allocation their pay will remain the same.
Now if you add up each type of shift available, and multiply it by the number of full time equivalents you have you will notice that you probably have far more day shifts than your department actually needs. This is because your work schedule is based on a rolling rota and it is assumed that some of those day shifts are going to be used for SL or AL.
How did you get people to get on side?
The rota administrator who works in HR, or for your department will handle the day to day bits of the rota. They need to be brought on board, I did it by incrementalism. People are a lot more willing to try things if they think it’s a pilot or trial.
ED consultants generally are skeptical at first, and there is always some push back about excusing everyone from shop floor duties for a few hours to arrange a rota, however the gains become apparent very quickly. That sacrifice allows for more consistent staffing, and fewer episodes where there are feasts or famines of trainees.
People on the rota might be skeptical at first, however I found that once people grasped what the system would allow them to do everyone came on board.
How does Annual Leave work?
Annual leave works differently in this system. If a doctor doesn’t want to work, they just don’t book a shift. If they want to take annual leave, they can use annual leave to reduce the number of day shifts they have to allocate, they do this prior to picking their shifts. So if you want two weeks AL away on holiday, you spend enough annual leave days to reduce the daytime allowance you have to allow you to schedule your shifts how you want. It works the same for study leave. Doctors just don’t book themselves down to work on the shop floor, and submit forms in the usual way.
One of the biggest issues I found with this system was that it allows so much flexibility that people don’t need to use much annual leave to take time off. This means you generally have a glut at the end that you cannot accommodate (a bit like an normal rolling rota). I generally tried to strongly encourage people to take a few days each cycle, but suggest that they are mindful of when they want their ‘big’ holiday.
What about maternity, paternity or adoption leave
Generally speaking this is even simpler than annual leave. If you have a hard stop date (like a due date) you can do a number of things
- Reduce that doctors allowance for the rota period that they are in (say if the baby is due half way through)
- Take them off the rota for when they are off
- You can also change people’s allocations if for example they are pregnant, don’t want to do nights past a certain point but still want to do other OOH work. Though my general feeling was that if people wanted to be off nights from 26 weeks they could be, and they shouldn’t have to make up the time.
Paternity leave is slightly trickier because its start time is less clear cut, what I generally did was ask people to put their OOH shifts far enough away from the due date that we wouldn’t be short on nights or weekends but would be able to manage any short term absence caused by an early arrival.
Problems with complexity
Some people’s rotas are very complex, and it can be difficult to fit the required number of shifts and type in any way other than done by the work schedule. I’d argue that a rota like that probably isn’t fit for purpose anyway, as swaps will be almost impossible, and if the work schedule is that close to breaking the actual JD2016 contract rules in reality, then it is certainly breaking them in spirit.
The system I have described works if you have a small number of different types of shifts. It makes the administration easier, and the allocation faster.
Can you Annualise?
So Annualisation would basically mean adding up everyone’s allocation for the period of placement, or a year, and allowing them to pick shifts over a greater period of time. Now I am not sure if you could annualize on a training contract, it depends on what people interpret the reference period to be. If your rota cycle is 8 weeks, it’s 8 weeks, if your rota is more complex (and I’d argue they shouldn’t be) then it might be longer. Longer periods for allocation throw up practical problems. People are less likely to know what they do and don’t want to work 4 months in advance. This means that you might have to arrange swaps, and fiddle things further down the line. Which brings me to the bad thing about self rostering:
How do swaps work?
Swaps are hard to arrange and fit in safely.
This is because often people have created bespoke working patterns for their own reasons, and they don’t like it when they are tampered with. There is less flex in a finalized self-rostering rota to account for last minute swaps. However the same rules as for a rolling rota apply so if you can find someone to do a like for like shift swap it generally doesn’t matter. It just might difficult to find people who can.
What do you do if people are difficult?
Now these could be people who are a little difficult to work with, or people who don’t grasp the need for compromise when it comes to shift patterns. This system can work (and I have direct experience of this) with people who are inflexible or difficult, but it does take more of the rota coordinators time. I made sure that all communications about the rota went through email, so there was a record of what had been said, however the system is usually flexible enough to accommodate them.
Having people’s shifts decided at a meeting is a good way of moderating unreasonable behavior, because people find it a lot harder to be difficult when surrounded by their peers.
Sometimes people seem difficult because they don’t know how the system works. This is particularly true of more senior doctors who are more used to working on rolling rotas. People found it hard to grasp how annual leave worked, and how other commitments can be scheduled around their shop floor work. Once they get it, it’s a beautiful thing, but especially around changeover periods things can be confusing for people.
What about changeover?
Changeover time is tricky, it’s difficult to get an accurate list of all of the doctors who are coming, and get them in a room in time for the rota meeting. I also had a hard time finding out from medical staffing, and the deanery who was coming. Here social media is your friend, and you can often find out through gossip about who is coming and reach out to them over twitter, whatsapp, or facebook to welcome them and give them a run down of their shifts.
How do you run a rota meeting?
You need a big screen, someone to chair and someone to run the spreadsheet. I provided print outs for everyone with a list of their allocation, for them to fill in, so they could keep up with what shifts they said they’d do. I also had a flip chart on the side with the safe rostering rules so people could remind themselves of shift patterns that they couldn’t work.
The rota meeting starts at the end of morning handover, night SPRs are expected to attend. When I was in charge I ran the meeting after I had done a night shift a few times, and this worked well. Doctors who can’t attend need to specify what they want, and I nominate a deputy to book shifts for them. Generally the nominated deputy does a good job.
We start by allocating the night shifts, then the mids, and then populate the days and lates. We start at the top of the rota and just run down, with people shouting up if they want to do a particular shift. If more than one person wants to do a shift, I ask them to come to an agreement amongst themselves and this has never failed to produce a solution. Over Christmas periods I allocate the 2 weeks over Christmas first. The meetings generally last for about 2 hours.Awesome Pete’s

COVID-19 has impacted our nursing population in two significant ways. First, it has exposed an increased demand for more highly-trained professionals to handle the needs of struggling medical facilities, which puts added pressure on those already working in the field. It has also added extra challenges to the next generation of practicing nurses as they graduate and seek out the experience and proper licensing necessary to enter the job market and give care to the growing number of those afflicted with the virus. Of course, our global focus on the virus compounds the ongoing attention required by other serious illnesses.
Now more than ever, we are asking a lot of nurses, given their responsibility not only to help keep patients alive but also to care for themselves by attending to their own physical and mental health along the way.
While restrictions have limited all nursing programs, students attending school in Texas are fully participating in their hands-on, clinical schooling. They are capable of getting the full benefit of lab work and practical applications found in first-hand experiences.
Danielle Walker is an assistant professor specializing in nursing education at the TCU Harris College of Nursing and Health Sciences. Walker has observed how the coronavirus pandemic has shifted the program’s focus. “Our students are still able to have their typical clinical experiences, but we’re all dealing with differences in the way hospitals function. One of our program’s big things has been wellness for our students, especially our graduate students, because they are going out into a changing environment. A nurse’s wellbeing impacts the quality of care they are able to deliver.”
As students seek clinical placements to gain essential experience, they are encouraged to develop self-care patterns like yoga and meditation. Walker said, “We’ve had to create creative opportunities for connection because our younger students are spending so much more time online.”
One of those creative measures was the delicious exercise of baking bread, a practice many have engaged in during the homebound period of lockdown. “It is a task that uses mental capacity and allows them to use their minds differently. One of the things that’s hard for our students to understand is that they often don’t see what happens with a patient after a 10- or 12-hour shift has concluded.” The students were able to share the final products throughout the School of Nursing, “I think it tasted like home.”
Walker says that they have been lucky to send students to hospitals for clinical practice. “It is an extra step for those hospital nurses to teach our students and explain what they are doing in an already–stressful climate.”
One of those nurses working in the field and shepherding a student is Nicole Frederick. Graduating with her Doctor of Nursing Practice, or DNP, from TCU in 2019, Frederick has been a Clinical Nurse Specialist focused on trauma care with Texas Health Resources for just over a year. The DNP degree allowed her to impact her hospital positively for the nurses who rely on her guidance. “I wanted to take my knowledge and effect change over a broader scope, rather than just my two patients,” Frederick explains.
The online format of the DNP program allowed her to continue working. The small classes gave her the tools she needed to succeed. No longer at the bedside, Frederick deals with trauma administration where 15 and 25 patients are seen every day. Nurses are responsible for completing an assessment and following patients through their course of treatment to oversee the quality of their care and improvement.
Frederick also acts as a mentor to a current student in the program, a Family Nurse Practitioner with whom she speaks frequently. “Every DNP student has a mentor, usually at the same facility, to see you on the fly.” Her instruction includes sharing information about facility norms and her insight into the process’s good and bad elements.
In much the same way those students mentioned above transformed dough into bread, one generation of nurses looks out for the next to develop skills through the TCU Nursing program.
Frederick notes that since the onset of the pandemic, she has frequently received supportive messages from the educators she worked with during her four years in the program. “My old professors from TCU have been asking if I have all I need to be safe.”
Nurses handle highly intense situations and must remain flexible to adjust things as needed while lives hang in the balance. Frederick said, “We know COVID surges are coming now. There will always be challenges, but procedures and workflow are all now in place.”.When does the season start and end?
The 2021 season start date is currently TBD and will depend on the date of the first football game. The season concludes at the end of October or early November depending on the game schedule determined by FLYFCL.
When are practices?
In August, B and C teams practice Monday through Thursday evenings. Flag teams practice Tuesday through Thursday evenings. Once school starts in September, B and C teams practice Tuesday through Thursday and Flag teams practice Tuesday and Thursday evenings. Note that practice times also shorten once school begins, and football practice shortens as it begins to get darker in the evenings.
Where are practices?
Football and Cheer teams practice at the Pal-Mac Intermediate School during the month of August. In September and October, Cheer team practice location is at the Palmyra Community Center.
Can I stay with my child at practice?
In August 2019, PMYFCL adopted the policy that parents/caregivers should not stay at practice with their child. Please drop your child off and return 5-10 minutes before the end of practice to pick them up. If you feel you need to stay, we ask that you sit 15 yards away from the practice field or in the bleachers. When the cheerleaders move to the PCC for practice, no parents are allowed in the gym during practice time.
It is extremely important for the kids to be paying full attention to their coaches. The coaches are volunteering their time and would like to ensure that the practice time is benefting the team as a whole. There needs to be no interuptions from parents during practice or water breaks. We ask that you allow the kids to stay focused on what the coaches are asking of them and not coaching your own child from the sidelines.
All coaches have each parent's contact information in case of emergency/injury or if they need to reach you during practice. If your child has any medical concerns, please let the head coach know ASAP.
When and where are games played?
Games are most often on Sundays. Our home field is Pal-Mac High School. Away games are to be determined by the schedule set forth by FLYFCL and will be announced at the beginning of the season. You can see the teams in the FLYFCL league on their website at.
Do cheerleaders participate in competitions?
Yes! Our cheerleaders typically participate in 3-4 competitions per season, including the FLYFCL Competition. These events are most often held on Saturdays in the month of October.
What requirements exist for me if my child partipates in football or cheerleading?
There are required fundraising and volunteer activities you agree to fulfill by registering your child in our league. In August, you are required to participate in a mandatory raffle ticket fundraiser. You must sell or purchase all tickets and provide the full amount of money at the time the tickets are due. In lieu of this raffle ticket fundraiser, you may "BUY-OUT" of this mandatory fundraiser by paying the buy-out option amount during registration.The number of tickets needing to be sold depend on which team your child is on.
You also must particpate by volunteering for Workers Board shifts during our football games. Workers Board signups will be in August and the number of required shifts also depends on which team your child is on.
Additionally, there are optional fundraising opportunities to participate in. Examples include StevCo food items and our annual Bottle and Can Drive. While these are not mandatory to take part in, they are offered with prizes for the participants who raise the most money. Fundraising is a crucial piece to the sustainability of our league and we appreciate the efforts of all our families.
In addition to registration costs, what else will I need to pay for?
FOOTBALL
- PMYFCL provides helmets, mouth guards, shoulder pads, practice pants, game pants, practice jerseys, and game jerseys.
- Parents will need to purchase cleats, girdles, water bottles, and protective athletic cups.
CHEERLEADING
- PMYFCL provides uniforms (shell and skirt), hair accessories, and registration fees to competitions.
- Parents will need to purchase water bottles, bodysuit midriff liners, lollies, and league specific game day/competition sneakers. Optional items may include warm ups.by Gordon Nary
Gordon: You recently moved to the the St. John the Baptist parish in Front Royal, How is it different from your last parish, and how has your new parish contributed to you spiritually?
Matthew: My previous parish (also a St. John the Baptist, ironically; this one in Silver Spring, MD) was an unusual sort of parish in modern America: very modernist in many ways, yet still very Catholic. It helped when we were assigned a new parish priest some years ago, who was quite firm about Catholic teachings but in a way that was kind to those who had simply received bad information, something all too common in the modern Church in America. That priest transformed it from being simply the closest church to my home (and the most handicap-accessible of anything nearby) to being a place I could feel was a home for faithful Catholics. After he arrived, for example, I never again saw anyone with a pro-abortion bumper sticker in the parking lot.
My new parish is one I’ve been familiar with for some time, as it is the only parish within half an hour of my alma mater, Christendom College. This parish is one of the reasons I moved here, rather than a place closer to my job in DC, because I already knew it was one of the most tightly-knit parishes I’d ever experienced. For example, at the previous St. John’s, people tended to clear out quickly, with few staying after to chat with friends; there was always a traffic jam in the parking lot immediately after Mass. At this St. John’s, there’s never a jam of any kind – except at the door, where only bad weather will keep people from having conversations with each other long enough to bump up to the next Mass on the schedule.
St. John’s in Front Royal is also an extremely charitable parish. Every year, for the Bishop’s Appeal, this parish is one of the very first to reach its donation goal; and many years, it’s been one of the top donators, even over areas with much more wealth. The giving doesn’t stop there, and one can always count on other parishioners to step in when they know someone needs help. It’s an old-fashioned parish, but one that’s not dominated by the elderly. To say it’s full of children and young couples would be an understatement. Several years ago, St. John’s converted the foyer into a large cry room, specifically to handle the amount of young ones at every Sunday Mass.
Gordon: When and why did you did convert to Catholicism?
Matthew: Well, that’s a bit of a long story! One thing I like to joke about, which usually gets people very interested to hear more, is that I’m Catholic because of the Redskins.
It began with my mother, who was raised in Alabama in a respectable Protestant family. After she married my father, a strong atheist, and had my older brother Michael, she began to feel her faith mattered more. What would she raise her son as? What would she teach him? Did she even know enough to try?
So she began investigating further, though keeping it from my father at first. She joined Bible groups and different churches, but it didn’t seem to fit for her. She even tried a Catholic church, which was a big step for her because of both her upbringing and my father’s specific bias against Catholics. Nothing fit. Yet certain things kept drawing her back to Catholicism, such as how her Protestant Bible groups could never explain to her why, if they focused on the literal truth of the Bible, they insisted that Jesus was speaking metaphorically about His Body and Blood.
Well, my father was no great fan of the Church, but he was a football fan. He grew up in rural Idaho, a completely different world from my mother’s upbringing, and never had a home football team to follow. When he joined the Navy and was eventually assigned to DC, he became a devote of the Washington Redskins. This was in the early 80s, when I was born. After almost eight years of that, moving to his next assignment (in Hawaii) was a big adjustment for him, because he couldn’t follow his favorite team live. A year later, he was assigned to teach at the Naval War College in Rhode Island, where he still couldn’t get Redskins games on broadcast TV. As a result, he decided to spring for cable.
And that’s where the Redskins lead me to Catholicism, because with cable comes EWTN. My mother started watching Mother Angelica, and she began to understand why Catholicism drew her, yet none of the parishes she had visited had felt welcoming. Every single one of them she had seen had been infected by the American attitude, post-Vatican II, that worship should be simple and modernist. Watching EWTN convinced her that these parishes had gone astray, and that Vatican II hadn’t been the huge change that some claimed supported their own ends.
But there was still a problem. Her own upbringing, and her husband’s bias, kept her from taking that final step. Catholicism drew her like a magnet draws a needle, but there was still a part of her that was afraid to make that commitment. The biggest step she had managed was enrolling my older brother Michael in a Catholic school.
Eventually, three years passed, and my father was informed he would be reassigned again. The problem was, the Navy didn’t know exactly where. It came down to two choices; and of course, in the military, you have no input on where you’re assigned. He was simply told the two choices so that he could start looking for homes and schools in both locations, as it was coming down to the wire.
Well, we might not have any pull with the military, but my mother decided to try prayer. So one day, when my father was out of the house, she gathered us children together; my older brother Michael, my younger sister Christina, and me. Our prayer was simple and to the point. Lord Jesus, send us where You want us to go.
Almost immediately, the decision came back from the Navy. They had completely changed their minds. Gone were the two previous options; instead, they had settled on a third choice, seemingly out of the blue. My father was being assigned to the American embassy in Rome, Italy.
It’s hard to get a clearer sign than that without burning bushes or lights from the sky. My brother finished his final year of high school in our first year there, and decided to attend Franciscan University in Steubenville, OH. I still remember my parents arguing about that, with my father unhappy about the choice. But while there, my brother officially converted, and he was our mother’s sponsor into the Church. Sadly, our father remains an atheist to this day.
My sister Christina and I were young enough to simply be taken along for the ride. We had been raised with such a generic understanding of Christianity that even I, at thirteen, didn’t really grasp the change that had happened. And my mother and I have very different approaches to our faith; as I said previously, I struggle with being spiritual, but that’s my mother’s strength. Mine is in understanding the interconnected thought of thousands of years of history and philosophy and theology that goes into explaining the nuances of doctrine (not that I am or have any calling to be a canon lawyer, mind you!). Because my mother was unable to provide this, and neither of us knew it was necessary for me, I’m sorry to say that this resulted in me being a cafeteria Catholic, even though I didn’t even hear that phrase until my twenties.
But there was one more important event that happened before we left Rome, and that was the rededication of the Church of Santa Susanna, on Sunday, June 27th, 1993. I was never interested in attending church, and usually put up such a fight that my mother would leave me behind half the time. This time, however, she insisted, and no amount of protest would sway her. She made me dress up, and so I was overheating in the Roman summer while we were waiting outside through a strangely long line. Once inside, the thick stone walls acted as natural air conditioning, and I quickly switched to shivering. I was miserable, crammed in by a huge crowd, unable to see anything, and to top it all off, my mother wouldn’t let me read a novel.
Finally, there was a huge commotion at the back of the church. I couldn’t see what was going on, but suddenly my mother was pushing me toward the center aisle. The other people in our pew resisted at first, but then they saw it was an eleven-year-old boy and their annoyance turned to smiles and they helped me along. I didn’t know why I was moving in that direction, but it was apparently important to everyone else.
Well, as you’ve probably guessed by now, the rededication of a church is a matter for a bishop, and this particular church was very politically important to boot, being the only parish in Rome with regular English-language Masses. So of course, the Bishop of Rome was there. I don’t remember John Paul II’s face, but I remember his white robe as he hugged me for a long time. And I remember something I had never felt before in my life: comfort at being in a church. All the misery of being there, crammed in with the press of humanity, completely drained away.
I firmly believe that without that moment, my life would have taken a very different turn. As I said, I was a cafeteria Catholic as a teen and young adult, led astray by bad teachings and my own desires. If I had never felt comfortable in a church, I’d have moved on to seemingly greener pastures, seduced away by promises of the pleasures brought by drugs and sex.
It very nearly happened anyway, but I had a minor obsession with Ireland at the time (okay, and now), and my mother and I convinced my father to agree to send me to a three-week study abroad program hosted by Christendom College, called Christendom in Ireland. That was a culture shock, and like nothing I had ever experienced. To put it in full perspective, my original plan had been to go to Franciscan University like my brother, until my mother got sick. I stayed to live at home to take care of her, while attending a local college and studying physics. She had never liked how she was keeping me from attending a good Catholic college, though, and jumped at the chance to send me to Christendom even for a short program.
The real culture shock came when I started the new semester, though, and realized just how much Christendom had clicked with me, despite being so utterly alien. Christendom provided the perspective I had been lacking, the perspective my mother was incapable of giving me (not for lack of trying). Its focus on rationality and the interconnectivity of Christian history spoke to me like no homily ever had before, precisely because I lacked the context to understand them properly. All it took was for me to admit one day to my mother that I wished I had gone to Christendom instead, and I was swept away by her preparations. By the end of that semester, I was enrolled at Christendom for Spring 2005, giving up my studies in astrophysics for history and literature.
That April, of course, was the death of Pope St. John Paul, and the election of Benedict XVI. Some joker that I will be forever grateful to hung a banner in the cafeteria shortly after that read “The Cafeteria is Now Closed! ~ B16.” Confused, I asked a friend what it meant, and for the first time learned the phrase “cafeteria Catholic.” A year later, I had cause to remember that moment, and realized with shock that at the time, I had been a cafeteria Catholic, someone who picked and chose the parts of the faith that I liked, conforming a church to myself, rather than myself to God.
As I said, my conversion story was a long one, full of twists and turns. If things hadn’t gone just right, my life would be very different, and far, far unhappier.
Gordon: What have been some of the most interesting courses that you have taken at Christendom College?
Matthew:: The most interesting by far was “The Inklings,” a cross-discipline history/literature course on the writings of Tolkien, Lewis, and Williams, and their influence on culture and fiction, as well as a look at Chesterton as an influence on them. I can safely say that no single course at Christendom prepared me for my career as an adult like that one did – though I didn’t know it at the time, of course.
Beyond that, I would have to say that the best and most interesting thing about Christendom is their core curriculum. Every student has to take, or at least qualify out of if they are transfer students, two years each of history and literature, three years each of theology and philosophy, one year of political science, and of course math and science requirements. Being a former physics major, I obvious was overqualified for the latter, but despite my efforts I couldn’t get my previous credits in any of the other subjects to count as more than simply electives.
When I went through the program, however, I discovered why. Multiple professors were teaching the same subjects, with their own unique spin on the topics, but with about three-fourths of the program set by the department rather than the individual professors. Rather than stifle things, as one might expect without experiencing it, it instead expanded the amount that could be covered. Since each professor knew what would be covered in another department, they could spend less time on redundant information and more on the details. That 75% mandated by the department was more detailed than anything I had received at any secular school, and there was still room left over for the professor’s own particular focus. It was a lot of work, and my professors will be the first to tell you that I wasn’t an exceptional student; but I learned more there than I could have anywhere else. Even if it had never been useful for me in a career – which it has – I would still consider it worth it. And in fact, during a long stretch of time where I was unemployed because of my physical handicap, I never once regretted that education. Sometimes there are more important things in life.
Gordon: Please provide an overview of your responsibilities as Director of Communications at Daniel Morgan Graduate School for National Security.
Matthew:: DMGS is a unique graduate school; we’re the only one in the nation that focuses on training national security and intelligence professionals for real-world knowledge and application, taught by professors with real-world experience. In fact, it was a bit of a challenge to get the school approved (it’s only a few years old, and I’ve been with the school since the beginning), as we have a far higher than normal number of adjunct professors. This is because we focus on people who are active in their fields, rather than full-time academics.
My job at the school is to process information for the public, and to help others do the same. I frequently downplay it as being a glorified editor, but since I enjoy being an editor, that’s not really as bad as it might sound. I work with everyone, from students to staff to faculty, and help them present things to intended audiences. Sometimes this means helping a professor rewrite a paper he’s writing on the Communist Party of Vietnam, making certain that the information he gives in the paper is understandable to those outside of his field. Other times it’s helping a student understand effective communication in the field of national security. One of my first jobs at the school was drawing up a sample curriculum. Another was to do research on the American Revolution, specifically on the life of Major General Daniel Morgan, the namesake for our school. (Incidentally, that particular job made me gain a professional loathing for the very historically-inaccurate movie The Patriot.)
In summary, I’d have to say the best short description of my job is “troubleshooter.” I edit, rewrite, research, and advise. Much like with the fiction editing I started with, and still do on the side, my job is to help others do their jobs more effectively.
Gordon: What are your responsibilities with Novel Ninja Freelance Editing?
Matthew:: Novel Ninja started out after I lost my first post-college job. I was mired in depression and unable to find work. While at that previous job, however, I was living with Regina Doman’s family. Regina Doman is a fairly famous Catholic novelist and editor, and at the time she was in charge of the (now-defunct) Catholic fiction wing at Sophia Institute Press. I overheard her talking about the backlog of submissions she had, and offered to help out. This was my first professional editing job, and it turned out I had a knack for it.
So, when I was back with my parents, unemployed and feeling low, I decided to hang out a shingle as an editor. It was just something I’d do until a real job came along. Instead, it turned into a career. As far as I know, I’m the only Catholic freelance editor specializing in science fiction and fantasy, and one of the few SF&F editors who doesn’t put politics over stories. I have worked with Catholics, atheists, Protestants, and pagans; Republicans, Democrats, Communists, and Libertarians; and while I specialize in SF&F, I’ve also edited romance, mystery, historical fiction, and dystopia; my only content rules are that I will not touch erotica or anything that insults the Catholic Church.
The name “Novel Ninja” came about because of my particular belief in how an editor is supposed to function. My job, first and foremost, is to make the author look good. I should be completely invisible; in fact, while it’s probably to my detriment, I rarely even mention which books I’ve edited precisely because it’s not about me. I’ve had friends who haven’t realized I edited something until they saw my name in the acknowledgements. On the other hand, the most powerful form of advertising is word of mouth, and the majority of my clients come to me because a friend recommended me.
Of course, my position at DMGS has resulted in me having to cut back on the time I’ve spent with Novel Ninja, but I’ve refused to give it up even when working overtime for the day job. This might not be what I can spend most of my time on, but it’s definitely my calling. Not only are there people out there who feel they can trust me over other editors they could choose – because I’m Catholic, or because I don’t share a particular political philosophy, or because they know that I will go deep into the details of a story and they need someone they can learn from – but I also find it’s the best way I can bring my faith to the world. The truth of God shines through even when a story isn’t overtly Catholic, and even if I can’t combat an entire culture that seems bent against me for my beliefs, I can do what I can for what I can.
Gordon: Based on your experience, why have so many younger Catholics left the church and what can we do to help reduce this challenge and to interest more young people in becoming Catholic?
Matthew:: It’s interesting that you ask this question at this particular time, because I have a young friend who left the Church last year to become pagan. We recently reconnected, and she admitted the reasons why she left, and also something more telling: that she stopped talking to me not because she didn’t like Catholicism, but because she felt that I wouldn’t want to have her around.
That, right there, sums up the reasons why people leave the Church, at any age. Human nature is the same no matter whether you’re twenty or seventy. If you don’t feel connected, you will try to find that connection elsewhere. If no one is reaching out to make you feel welcome, you will necessarily feel rejected. And if anyone is berating you for feeling different, for feeling like the expression of Catholicism they adhere to is not enough, well . . . how can you not feel drawn to someone else who might be offering what you lack? My friend, despite knowing me for several years, thought that I would reject her like so many others had.
I’m not going to go into the details of my friend’s problems; that’s her story to tell, not mine. Suffice to say that her experience with Catholicism in her formative years was similar to mine, only more so. We both felt disconnected from what was around us, from the single expression of Catholicism that stood before us, and we were being driven away by those too inflexible to realize that the Church is called “catholic” because it is universal. The major difference was that she actually had more integrity than I had. I coped by picking and choosing and calling myself Catholic when I didn’t actually follow the Church. She responded by stepping away entirely, because she had too much respect for the Church to indulge in half-measures..”
As I said, it’s not about just the youth; when my mother, born in the 40s, was searching for the true core of Christianity, she was initially turned away by how bland Catholicism was. It took watching Mother Angelica to realize there was more out there. A fallen-away Catholic author I know – a bestseller and a household name in science fiction – once told me in private that he dropped away from the Church he was raised in because of that same blandness. Until he met me, he had no idea that the Church was still more than (as he put it) “Peter, Paul, and Mary worship bands.” A mutual friend of ours, someone he introduced me to that fronts a goth band called The Cruxshadows and wears his Catholicism on his sleeve (even though said sleeve is made of leather and ripped cloth), got married in the Tridentine rite, and it was the first time that author had been to a Trid mass since the 60s. He hadn’t even known it was still possible to find those. In fact, he hadn’t known, until I told him, that there was a regular Trid a half an hour from his own house.
Real Catholicism is not mere appearance – how you dress, how you speak – but rather substance, an ancient practice that is renewed every day so long as it isn’t stifled. The Church doesn’t dictate to us how our customs should be, only what our intent is; and even there, it’s far less restrictive than Hollywood or Internet memes might lead one to believe. The Church has room for those who dress like 50s housewives, 60s hippies, 70s yuppies, 80s punks, 90s goths, and 2000s hipsters, precisely because it is not tied to any one decade or even any one century. The Church is in this world, but not of it, and so limiting things based on mere appearance is to limit the Church herself.
Sometimes people react to that by pushing back against anything modern, which itself is wrong; the Church never dictates culture, only doctrine, because the first changes and the latter never does. It’s entirely possible to be too focused on traditionalism and completely miss why tradition is not doctrine, confusing substance for appearance all over again.
One thing I frequently repeat to Catholic students looking to write Catholic fiction is that the best way to promote Catholicism is to promote Catholicism, not attack whatever might be different. If we want to promote an alternative to a culture that considers casual sex the norm, that doesn’t mean to avoid sex or sexuality. God created the human body; it is therefore good, and it is only human choice that might misuse it. The opposite of casual sex is not celibacy, but rather marriage; and so to promote an alternative to the modern expression of sexual pleasure above all, we must instead promote marriage.
And just as my friend’s story sums up why people leave the church, that right there sums up how they come back. They come back when they feel welcome, when they feel like they are part of something greater, and when they realize that the expression of Catholicism they had been exposed to before is too narrow to be the real Church.
We are Catholic, and we are many. We will endure, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against us. And think about that for a moment: gates are a defensive structure. Christ told us not merely that the Church will never fall, but that we will be victorious – even if we march on Hell itself.
Gordon: How popular are the Marvel superhero films with your friends?
Matthew:: Very popular. It’s interesting, since Marvel Comics and Marvel Studios are effectively two separate divisions that have little to do with each other. The Comics side has been attempting to promote odd modernist and political ideas at the expense of stories; meanwhile, the movies have been huge hits, precisely because they are entertainment first. Many people have attacked the films for being too lighthearted, too full of jokes; or for promoting something other than a modernist, political message like one might find in today’s comics. In truth, if they were not entertaining, then they would not be selling.
This is something that needs to be looked at by anyone wondering how to promote their idea of stories. Look at what sells. Figure out what audiences want. The Marvel movies sell not because of jokes, but because of an expression of heroism that has been lacking in our culture at large. All too often, we get told that our heroes are flawed, and therefore cannot be looked up to. The first is true, but the second is not. We are all of us flawed, and a true hero is one who moves beyond that to sacrifice for others. All good hero stories follow an example written on our hearts; our idea of the hero was written into us when God created us, and that is why the Gospel story plays out the way it does – because Christ is the ultimate hero. All others, whether they intend to or not, whether they lived before Him or after, follow His example.
Superhero movies, especially of the sort that Marvel has been releasing, have been powerful examples of this drive for heroism. My friends are not the only ones who respond to that. Audiences will sit in theaters for the action sequences; they will return again and again for the good storytelling and the heroic decisions. Once again, children are able to look up to these fictional characters and desire to be like them – the monstrous Hulk who has to control his anger, the self-denying Captain America, the quick-witted Black Widow trying to atone for her sins, or the prideful Doctor Strange who only gains true power by learning humility first. Icons like these have been rare, even missing from the lives of both children and adults, and now that they’re back they’re stronger than ever.
Gordon: Who is your favorite Catholic superhero and why?
Matthew:: Absolutely Nightcrawler, one of the X-Men characters. Like with many superheroes in recent decades, sometimes he’s been taken in odd directions and frequently his Catholic faith has been all but erased, but he was once the most prominent Catholic character in comics.
For those who don’t know the character, he’s a mutant; mutants don’t just have special powers, but frequently look very different from the human norm. Nightcrawler – real name Kurt Wagner – has it worse than most. He has blue skin, pointed ears, fangs, backwards-bent ankles, three fingers on each hand and two toes on each foot, and a tail with a spade-like point. He has the power of teleportation, but every time he appears and disappears, he does so in a puff of sulphuric smoke. In other words, except for the color blue, he looks like a classic Devil image.
He was introduced in the 70s when Marvel decided the X-Men series needed more non-Americans, and he was recruited in Germany where Professor Xavier (the founder of the X-Men) had rescued him and the priest who had taken him in from an angry mob. The priest was named Fr. Wagner, which is where Kurt got his name.
There have been many different origins in different X-Men series; the above was the comics line, but my favorite was in a cartoon series that aired in the 90s, where Kurt had been living in a monastery rather than in a priest’s house. There, the nearby villagers had become convinced that the monks had fallen away and were harboring a demon, but the monks protected him nonetheless. Again, Professor Xavier arrived to quell the mob, but I’ve always enjoyed the idea of this character growing up in a monastery rather than a circus freak taken in by a priest only shortly before becoming a superhero.
Regardless of his origin, he remains my image of a Catholic superhero because there was a storyline where he left that life to enter a seminary. He was in training to be a priest, and it was handled very well. He eventually left and returned to lay life, but it was an important part of his character history and one that the current Marvel Comics would never allow.
Before I move on to the next question, though, two other Catholic superheroes deserve mention. One has a similar origin to Nightcrawler, except that the reason he looks like a demon is because he was created in a demonic ritual. He’s known as Hellboy, from the Hellboy series. However, he was rescued by a human and raised Catholic. Some years ago, a movie was made based on the comics, and it didn’t skimp on this element, producing a joke among Catholic fans: Literal spawn of Satan, still prays the rosary. What’s your excuse?
The other one is in the graphic novel Confessor, part of the Astro City series. It’s the second in the series, and can be read as a stand-alone story. I highly recommend it, and if I were to tell you why, I’d ruin the story for you. Just go read it, and enjoy the idea of a Catholic Batman-like character with a priest motif.
Gordon: You mentioned you specialize in science fiction and fantasy. What about SF&F do you find most interesting, and what is your favorite SF&F film?
Matthew:: Films . . . oh, I can’t really tell you. There are too many to narrow down as any one favorite. It depends on my mood, honestly. Sometimes I might want the quirky humor of the B-grade Hallmark film The Magical Legend of the Leprechauns, and other times I’ll want something serious like Blood and Chocolate, a movie about werewolves in Bucharest that didn’t get nearly the reception it deserved. Sometimes it’s something popular, sometimes it’s something I liked but was panned by critics. I suppose the best such film in recent years might be Rogue One, the Star Wars anthology film that came out last December. That still doesn’t mean it’s my all-time favorite, however. I really can’t say what that might be.
As to what I find interesting about it, that’s a much easier question to answer. Fantasy and science fiction let us explore things beyond our current lives. Both G. K. Chesterton and J. R. R. Tolkien wrote about the need for that sort of escapism. Chesterton wrote that such fairy tales (this being long before the surge in popularity of the genre, so they were typically called fairy tales if anything, rather than fantasy) are more than just nursery tales, but rather refreshed one to look at the world around us with wonder. He wrote in Orthodoxy that fairy tales “make rivers run with wine only to make us remember, for one wild moment, that they run with water.”
Similarly, Tolkien wrote in his famous essay “On Fairy Stories” that the escapism provided by these tales is necessary; it is not the Flight of the Deserter, he says, where the reader abandons his responsibilities in the real world, but rather the Escape of the Prisoner, hemmed in by a fallen world’s day-to-day drudgery and needing a renewal of mind and spirit.
God gave us imaginations that can contemplate not only His Creation, but the what-ifs of how He might have done it differently. Whenever someone tells me that it’s better to focus on the realities in front of me, I think of natural philosophers in Paris in the 13th century, who insisted on putting limits on God based on their own narrow understanding of reality. Among other things, this included the idea of distant worlds where life might be flourishing. These were condemned by a 1277 bull issued by the Bishop of Paris, Etienne Tempier, opening up permission for philosophers at the University of Paris to explore other ways God might have done things. A very important (though not widely-known) French physicist in the 19th century, Pierre Duhem, considered that the true start of modern scientific inquiry – coming about from a bishop admonishing early scientists for thinking the world is simple enough for one person to comprehend.
Science fiction and fantasy let us explore that concept of a wider world in a way that only stories can. Fantasy can let us look at man’s relationship to the natural world alongside the spiritual, exploring ideas such as “What if there were forms of magic God let us use?” or “What if elves live beside us?” Science fiction lets us explore worlds where technology shapes our lives rather than living things, and how that changes our relationship with each other. Both let us do things in different ways, with the ultimate effect of producing a sense of wonder for how things really are today – and perhaps how things might be in the future. After all, much is made of how Captain Kirk’s personal communicator paved the way for the modern cell phone!
Gordon: What are some of your favorite books?
Matthew: Once again, so many to choose from. It’s easier than films, though.
My most enduring influence on how I think of fantasy is David Eddings’ Garion series, a collection of twelve books (a five-part series, with a five-part sequel, and two prequels) that shaped what I expect from the epic fantasy sub-genre. Similar to that in science fiction, and especially the sub-genre military SF, is David Weber’s Honor Harrington series, which can be thought of as “what if C. S. Forester, author of Horatio Hornblower, wrote Star Wars?”
Another series is The Dresden Files, a series that, while it has a few adult elements, stands out for many things; but to Catholic fantasy fans, particularly because of the high treatment Catholics get in the series despite the author not being Catholic himself.
Another good Catholic fantasy series is The Wizard in Rhyme, by Christopher Stasheff; who also wrote a science fiction series with heavy Catholic elements as well, which in turn produced a comedic book about a fictional saint (introduced in the sci-fi series), St. Vidicon to the Rescue.
An alternate history fantasy/mystery series of short stories can also be found, reprinted last decade in one volume for the first time: Lord Darcy, by Randall Garrett. These are the most overtly Catholic fantasy stories I’ve ever read, describing a world where the laws of magic were discovered instead of the laws of physics, and where magic works according to Catholic morality. Both Lord Darcy and The Wizard in Rhyme are books that prove Catholic stories can have wide market appeal.
I really could go on about great fiction, and I know that there are authors who will probably read this interview who will be disappointed I didn’t mention their books. Unfortunately, after a certain point, it will just be quicker to give an abridged list of my personal library. I try to review a lot of them on my sites, novelninja.net and the catholicgeeks.com, so I’d encourage your readers to go there and take a look.

Published:
Also posted on: Fran Howarth
Today’s threat landscape is complex and increasingly sophisticated. Opportunistic attacks still occur and are a menace, but targeted attacks are a rapidly growing threat. They are often launched by sophisticated and professional criminal organisations, with motivations ranging from profit to ideological hacktivism. According to Arbor Networks in its recent annual worldwide infrastructure security report, published January 2014, there was a 36% increase in targeted attacks seen by its survey respondents in 2013.
One type of targeted attack that has seen a particular resurgence recently is the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. In a recent report, Cisco states that “DDoS attacks should be a top security concern for organisations in the public and private sector in 2014.” According to Ashley Stephenson of Corero Network Security, DDoS attacks can be considered to be the cost of doing business online.
A surge in DDoS attacks has been seen over the past couple of years. In one concerted campaign, the FBI reported that 46 US financial institutions were hit with more than 200 coordinated and timed DDoS attacks from September 2012 to April 2013 alone, causing consumers to lose trust in US banks. But that is just one example and Cisco warns that future campaigns will be even more extensive and will last for extended periods. According to the Arbor Networks report, there has been a dramatic increase in the size of DDoS attacks, with many attacks over 100 Gbps routinely seen—big enough to disrupt any organisation.
But, in many cases, mere business disruption is not the endgame of the attackers. Whilst that is bad enough for any organisation, especially those that use online channels extensively, DDoS attacks are increasingly being used as a distraction, diverting attention and resources away from other exploits occurring simultaneously. Often the real motivations are financial manipulation or a competitive takeout.
A number of vendors, including Arbor and Corero, offer products and services to help organisations to recover from DDoS attacks and these can be extremely useful in limiting the damage that they cause. But organisations also need to do more to shield their networks from harm. Targeted attacks are increasingly getting through network defences, with security controls such as firewalls being increasingly used as a conduit for attack. Arbor states that its customers are increasingly asking how to get visibility across their entire networks to reduce the vulnerabilities that they face.
And it is important that that visibility cuts across all parts of the network, from the data centre to the endpoints that connect to the network. Data centres are being increasingly victimised, with Arbor reporting that many of its survey respondents are seeing more than 100 attacks against their data centres per month, with one-third stating that the attacks are so overwhelming that they exceed the total available internet bandwidth. In terms of endpoints, DDoS attacks against mobile networks have almost doubled over the past year. This is a trend that is likely to continue as mobile devices proliferate and the so-called BYOD phenomenon continues to gain ground. Arbor’s research found that three-quarters of respondents allow the use of personal devices in the workplace, but half of those organisations have no way of identifying, let alone monitoring, what devices are being used on their networks.
An example of where attackers are taking advantage of lax security measures can be seen in the increase of DDoS attacks targeting DNS servers. Neustar states that attacks are being seen that first hit the web resources of organisations with large volumes of web traffic, before moving on to DNS servers, which tend to be more vulnerable. Arbor’s research found that 36% of respondents experienced customer-impacting DDoS attacks against DNS servers in 2013, up 10% from the previous year. It also found that, whilst 85% of respondents operate DNS servers, 26% have no security resources with dedicated responsibility for DNS security.
As we continue into 2014, the predictions from many quarters are that targeted attacks will continue to be a real and ever-growing threat. DDoS attacks, in particular, will continue to be a weapon of choice. Organisations should look not only to appraise themselves of the products and services that are available for helping to recover from such attacks, but should also evaluate their network and endpoint security controls and look to close as many gaps as possible.Product lifecycle management john stark

9633With just a little over a month until the premiere of The Wheel of Time, Amazon Prime Video is amping up the marketing. We got an incredible new trailer last week at NYCC 2021. Then, yesterday
Today, a new teaser was revealed that introduces Shadowspawn. What are Shadowspawn? They are the baddies who follow, and will do anything for, The Dark One. There are many kinds of Shadowspawn such as Trollocs, Grey Men, Draghkar and the most frightening, Myrddraal. The latter comes with many names like Fade, Eyeless or Half Men.
In the teaser, we get a very good look at the Trollocs and a Fade. Trollocs are the bloodthirsty, not too bright soldiers for The Dark One. They have the faces of animals and bodies of men, sometimes hooves for feet and they are always ready for a kill. Myrddraal/Fades can lead Trollocs into battle or work on their own. Whatever they are doing, you don’t want to be there and, as Moiraine says in this teaser, “You can’t outrun a Fade.”
Take a look at the teaser below along with the descriptive text that accompanied the new The Wheel of Time teaser.

DESCRIPTIVE TEXT: Out of a crowd of animal-like trolloc faces and hands, many of them holding torches, a myrddraal appears on horseback, riding slowly as the trollocs part. The horse he rides upon has a skull-like covering on his head. The myrddraal is wearing a black robe with a hood that nearly covers its face, but you can catch glimpses that reveal it has no eyes and pale white skin. Text on the screen says “Shadowspawn: Servants of the Dark” and below it are white weaves running horizontally. A closeup on the horse’s hooves cuts to both Lan’s and then Moiraine’s faces looking concerned. Cut to a metallic snake, coiling in a circle and swallowing its own tail as the words “The Wheel of Time” unfurl underneath it.

Huwaei was able to listen in to conversations made by government ministers and also had access to a database of phones
Chinese telecom equipment supplier Huawei was able to monitor all the phone conversations made through the Netherlands’s largest mobile network, reported Dutch News citing Dutch newspaper Volkskrant.
Huwaei was able to listen in to conversations made by license and the confidence of both the Dutch state and industry.
The researchers could not, however, establish if and how often Huawei listened in to conversations.
Its findings put “the continued existence of KPN Mobile in serious danger” since users “may lose confidence … if it becomes known the Chinese government can monitor KPN mobile numbers,” the report concluded.
KPN continued to award several contracts for parts of its core 3G and 4G networks to Huawei after receiving the Capgemini report, which is never made public..2nd Saturdayz

FHNW School of Business students who wish to study abroad are supported by the Swiss European Mobility Programme.
International experience is of great importance for later professional activities. Students who want to gain this experience during their studies have many options open to them. This is because the FHNW School of Business has a strong international network and promotes partnerships around the globe: There are exchange programmes with over 190 universities around the world, plus projects and partnerships with over a dozen other countries.
Swiss European Mobility Programme (SEMP)...
The Swiss programme for Erasmus+ at tertiary level is known as the Swiss-European Mobility Programme (SEMP). SEMP offers Swiss universities and colleges of higher education the opportunity to sponsor students, lecturers and staff as they study, teach and participate in continuing education abroad. Financial support is provided for both outgoing and incoming students who stay abroad for a limited period of time with a partner of their home institution. The partner institution may be in Europe or worldwide.
...for studies
The mobility type "Student Mobility for Studies" permits students in bachelor programmes to complete a study period of at least two months and up to a maximum of twelve months at a partner university abroad. Credits earned abroad are credited toward the student’s course at their own university. Grants are awarded as a lump sum depending on the length of the course.
General requirements...
Certain requirements must be met:
- An application at the home institution and nomination by the partner university are both mandatory before the start of the stay abroad.
- Placement of participants at the respective partner institutions is made by the home institution.
- Students remain enrolled at their home institution during their stay abroad.
- The extension of a stay is possible in consultation with the participating universities.
- For sustainable travel with SEMP, students receive a "Greener Travel Top-Up" of CHF 100 if they can prove that they use a means of transport that is low in CO2 emissions.

- 2016-08-26 CN CN201620941301.9U patent/CN206014969U/en not_active Expired - Fee RelatedIt’s always an exciting time when we get to welcome a new member to the Festicket & Event Genius family, especially when they share the passion for live events and the ambitions for the future of the industry which are at the heart of everything we do.
So we wanted to take the chance to shine the spotlight on the people helping make the magic happen and find out their story, their ambitions, the live entertainment experiences that shaped them, and more.
First up is Robert Fosterman, Event Genius & Festicket’s brand new Client Relationship Director who brings with him a wealth of experience from roles at the likes of Ticketmaster and Dewynters.
Why did you choose to join Festicket & Event Genius?
To be part of such a well known company within the ticketing industry and assist in the changes that are set to take place over the coming months was an amazing opportunity and one I wanted very much to be a part of.
What attracted you to the live events and festival industry? Or what do you enjoy most about the industry if you've previously been working in it?
Everyone loves the buzz of a live event and being able to work in such a fun and exciting industry was something I was keen to do. I spent the early part of my career qualifying as a Chartered Surveyor but knew that Real Estate wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of my life so I made the change about ten years ago and have never looked back.
What do you hope to achieve at Festicket & Event Genius?
I very much look forward to helping the company on the next stages of its growth and contributing to its continued success.
What are you most excited about with regards to your new role here?
I am excited about working with such a great team and also helping them develop their careers as we all take on new challenges.
As a fan, what is your favourite festival or gig memory?
I am lucky to have experienced some amazing things in my career, but two really stand out. Seeing Jay Z perform at the Royal Albert Hall with an orchestra was incredible. Also seeing Guns and Roses, who I had always wanted to see, at the Olympic Stadium a couple of years ago. They didn't disappoint.
What is your favourite onsite working memory?
Without doubt being pitch side for the first pitch when the MLB brought the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox to play at the Olympic Stadium. It was a massive project which we worked on for well over a year and being there seeing a sold out stadium and all the pomp which comes with an American sport, I will never forget.
Robert will join us in our London HQ but we also have offices across the world, including across Europe, Australia and North America..Machine Price · clay mining clay processing machine clay mining plant cgm clay ... for vertical grinding head · Cement Machine From Germany...

11). [...]Ashmere Lake in Hinsdale, MA
We were recently on vacation in western Massachusetts, and I took the kayak along. The cottage we rented was only one street away from Ashmere Lake, so I was able to go out and explore the lake a few times. Lake Ashmere is mostly lined with houses, two summer camps, and a few motorboats. It’s not an ideal paddling destination, but it was worth checking out.
The northern half of Ashmere Lake (where our cottage was) has much more shore to explore, though it is packed with houses. Camp Taconic had lots of kids on the water in a variety of boats, obviously having fun. It took me about two hours to leisurely paddle this portion of the lake.
The southern portion of Ashmere Lake has a few less houses, especially at the southernmost side. This portion of the lake is labeled as a state park, and there is a boat launch available. There’s also a tunnel connecting the north and south halves of the lake, and it was fun to paddle through that.
Ashmere Lake is a fine place to paddle if you live on the shore or are away on vacation, but I wouldn’t make it a priority to visit there. I suppose it may be worth noting that these photos are from a Pentax Optio W90 waterproof digital camera
; this is the first time I took it kayaking with me.

“Psychedelic Trance” (formerly called “Goa Trance”) is a style of electronic music belonging to the Trance music movement. It appeared in the early 1990s in Goa,
India, hence the name “Goa” or “Goa Trance” originally given to this musical trend.
Nowadays, the term is only used to designate a particular trend of Psychedelic Trance.
It is music that appeal to the emotions, imagination and dreams, that does not hesitate to create unexpected, and even startling, impossible and immaterial sounds, seeking to plunge into a trance and to alter the emotional state of the listener.
This type of Trance music is a global phenomenon although it is especially popular in Europe, Israel, Japan and, of course, in Goa.
It is typically characterized by a tempo in the range of 125-160 beats per minute (bpm), although some pieces can have as little as 110, or amount to 190, and even more than 200 ; making it faster than “classic” Trance.
Its basslines are strong, uninterrupted except for breaks, and covered by many other rhythms, often produced using the famous Roland TB-303 synthesizer known for its peculiar “acid” sounds.
The artist can use sounds recorded with a microphone, which he then reworks to create “kicks” (rhythmic beats), often mistakenly called “bass”. These sounds are often passed by an echo chamber to give rise to lingering synthetic shade and highlight the rhythm. Thus, the Psychedelic Trance will highlight not the melody but the synthetic rhythm pushed to the extreme of systemic repetition.
The Psychedelic music is essentially a type of dance music (it was designated as “trance dance” in its formative years). It has an energetic rhythm, almost always in the 4/4 meter and often going into the 16th or 32nd notes, especially for pumping basslines. One can also note a change in the beat to 12/8 with the same tempo during some parts of certain compositions. Most of the time, a typical piece will often build up to a stronger movement in the second half, and then decrease quite rapidly in the end. Generally having a length of 8 to 12 minutes, the Psychedelic Trance tracks usually have significantly more prominent basslines and kick compared to other types of Trance (except for Hard Trance).
However, as you could have guessed, it is composed of several styles.
“Proto-Goa”, born in the late 80s/early 90s, is the style that was at the origin of Psychedelic Trance.
The fact that rules and standards were not yet established, it is characterized by a certain experimental attitude, not hesitating to borrow from various genres and styles of electronic music, such as Acid Trance, Techno, House, New Beat, EBM and many others.
It is recognizable by its sonorities trying to get closer to the “organic” aspect that we know Goa Trance for and its psychedelic research across genres other than Trance.
“Goa Trance” is the original style of Psychedelic Trance. This one was soon followed by the appearance of Psytrance, proper in the second half of the 1990s, but the difference between the two styles is largely a
matter of sonorities.ist mythology and mysticism.
It is also characterized by a melody often much more present, by a kick less marked than in Psytrance, and by the use of filters rather than effects. Occasionally, it also happens that some artists blend it with “classic” Trance or Industrial Music. Generally, Goa consequently has a very melodic and complex nature, making it one of the most melodic Psychedelic Trance sub-styles together with Nitzhonot, Suomi and Psybient.
Most of the time, Goa and its derivatives are characterized by the use of thematic elements related to fantastic, fantasy, occultism and some science fiction styles (mysticism, divine transcendence, shamanism, extraterrestrial life, supernatural,...etc), whereas Psytrance and its derivatives will instead include other science fiction and alternative science styles (such as cyberpunk, transhumanism, space opera, hard science fiction or post-apocalyptic fiction).
The presence of two Goa trends can also be noted :
I. “Old School”, namely the original Goa, born in the mid 90’s.
II. “New School”, emerging style since 2003 and greatly inspired by the original Goa while modernizing it.
“New School” (also called “Neo Goa”) is recognizable by a higher complexity than the “Old School”, and by its more detailed kicks and synthesizer layers. Sometimes, “New School” tracks incorporates some Full-On elements such as the rolling bassline.
Moreover, unlike Psytrance and its derivatives, Goa Trance is a sub-style that is not encumbered by the throes of creating more derivatives to present different ambiences. Thus, we can find within it several atmospheres and structures: joyful, dark, exalting, progressive,...etc.
Representative labels:
“Nitzhonot” (meaning “victories” in Hebrew) is a style derived from Goa Trance born in the late 90s in Israel and Greece.
This one is characterized by a mixture of hard and pulsating kicks (sometimes called “Laserkicks”) and typical mid-oriental melodies of Goa of the years 96/97. Its rhythm is usually between 145 and 155 BPM.
It is recognizable by its long melodic breaks pushing ever further in the middle-eastern side and a more uplifting nature than Goa, thus seeking to push up at the highest the emotional and sentimental state of the listener, leaving a part of its psychedelism by this way.
“Uplifting Trance” is a term used to describe a form of Nitzhonot from Greece which continues to pursue the middle-eastern side of the melodies and the use of “Laserkicks”. Should not be confused with mainstream Uplifting Trance, which is very different from this latter.
There is also another form of Nitzhonot called “Nitzhogoa”. While Nitzhonot tends to move away from Goa, Nitzhogoa is characterized by its return to its Goa influences. Thus, one may note its more psychedelic side and legacy Goa sounds while keeping the high BPM and the “Laserkicks”, peculiar to Nitzhonot.
Representative labels:
Originating in the late 90s, “Psytrance” has a darker , minimalist sound, with “metallic” sonorities and less melodic that works more by layers of effects than by filters and mainly focusing on rhythm or
groove.
In addition, it has often faster and more pronounced rhythms than Goa Trance whose kicks are more powerful but more withdrawn bass.
“Full-On” is a more dynamic and engaging Psytrance style appeared in early 2000. This one is sometimes influenced by
Uplifting Trance (as Trance style) and
Electro-House and greater emphasis on the melody as it was
the case with the Goa Trance advent before.
Technically speaking, Full-On is characterized by a bassline so-called “rolling” (that is to say which crams two or three short basses notes in between each hit of the 4/4), by fast changes in music sequences (max 32 beats per sequence), and a more energetic melodic/uplifiting nature.
It is undoubtedly one of the most popular styles of Psychedelic Trance alongside Progressive Psytrance.

“Dark Psytrance” is a style of Psytrance born shortly thereafter, but bringing a darker side, heavier and faster. This style was developed in the 2000s,
mainly in Denmark, Russia and Germany. The speed may vary from 145 to 180 BPM.
Chants are very rare. They are usually replaced by science fiction samples or much more rarely by horror movies samples. Sometimes we find references to songs of different genres, but most often in order to discredit them.
This one is strongly influenced by genres and styles such as Dark Ambient, Darkcore, Industrial Music, Aggrotech and Black Metal. We find a willingness to create an heavy and disturbing/unhealthy atmosphere, based on the use of heavy rhythms, jerky and saturated melodies composed of futuristic sounds and these famous samples.
Beyond 180 BPM, it is more appropriate to talk about “Psycore” by its influences closer to Speedcore, even if it can be recovered in a slower tempo. Like Hi-Tech, it is recognizable by a certain saturation of the number of effects, but differs from this latter by its raw and/or somber aesthetic peculiar to Darkpsy. Note also that the horrific and unhealthy themes are often more common in Psycore than in Darkpsy.
Sometimes it also happens that Darkpsy and Psycore free themselves of any dark ambience or present an aesthetic leaving a form of black humor rather than really dark ambiences, but this remains relatively rare.
Representative labels:
“Forest” is a Psychedelic Trance style mainly born from Dark Psytrance, however this one can sometimes get rid of high BPMs and black ambiances from Darkpsy.
The Schlabbaduerst Rekkords label is considered as the pioneer of this style.
Technically, the Forest is characterized by a more pronounced resonance as well as more organic sonorities than in Darkpsy (in order to accentuate the “deep forest” effect) and “swarming/teeming” effects reminding ambient noises of fauna and flora. Just as Darkpsy, chants are very rare, they are more willingly replaced by ambient noises.
There is two distinguishable trends of Forest: the first one, born in the late 90’s and then linked to Schlabbaduerst Rekkords in the early 2000s, mainly consists in a blend of Goa and Psytrance or Darkpsy with often heavy Industrial Music influences and a more chaotic or experimental aesthetic while the second one stemmed in 2003 almost exclusively from Darkpsy. Note that the first one is uncommon contrary to the second one.
This style has mainly emerged in Denmark and in a minority in other nordic countries such as Finland, Norway or Sweden.
Its ambiance can greatly vary from artist to another one, some turning toward dark ambiences (majority), others will prefer exalting and joyful ambiences (minority).
Another form of Forest named “Swamp” also exists, born from the merger of this latter and Downtempo. It is characterized by a more experimental side than “traditional” Forest and a slower tempo, similar to Downtempo. Like Natural Trance, this form of Forest remains rarely produced.
Representative labels: Parvati / Forestdelic / Sanaton / Chronicle Of Mystery
“Twilight” (also called “Night Full-On”) is a Psytrance style born in South Africa in the mid 2000s from the fusion of
Dark Psytrance and Full-On. Like Forest, it deploys a certain complexity in the produced sonorities and has often a synthetic/metallic aesthetic pushed much further in the aim of creating an atmosphere
at the cross of black science fiction (or even Cyberpunk) and cosmic extended.
Technically, Twilight is a kind of “Dark Full-On”: it is characterized by a more aggressive bassline, a certain abundance of sound effects inspired by Darkpsy, as well as a melodious nature inherited from Full-On with a dark atmosphere.
There is also another form of Twilight called “South Af” (meaning “South Africa”, in reference to its origins) more approaching to Full-On. This variant, which is actually the founder style of Twilight, stands out by an aesthetic usually more harmonious but more bellicose, and a closer kick to Techno one, harder than “classic” Twilight one, and often by a less dark and atmospheric ambience, but more frenetic.
Representative labels: Nexus Media / Timecode / MMD
“Hi-Tech” (also written “High-Tech” or “Hitek”) is a Psytrance style strongly influenced by Dark Psytrance,
Psycore, Hardtek
and Full-On. It is characterized by a synthetic aesthetic pushed to the extreme,
a clear/uncluttered bassline and a fast rhythm (Darkpsy influences), or even very fast (Psycore and
Hardtek influences),
and often, by a very jerky/chopped melody (Full-On, Darkpsy and
Hardtek influences).
In terms of tempo, Hi-Tech vary from 150 BPM to over 200 BPM, making it and Psycore the fastest Psychedelic Trance styles.
Unlike Psycore, Hi-Tech can present an absence of atmosphere in favor of a non-regular melodic structure and Brostep inspired transitions. It can therefore greatly vary from an artist to an another one. In addition, Hi-Tech is generally the least predictable and constant of all Psychedelic Trance styles.
Representative labels: Noise Poison / Osom Music / Kamino / Dark Prisma
“Progressive Psytrance” (also called “Minimal Psytrance”, “Psyprog” or “Psygressive”) is a style of Psytrance born from the fusion of this latter with
Progressive Trance in the early 2000s.
This form of minimalist Trance, can be considered as progressive but is usually more involved and contains more complex sounds (from Psychedelic Trance) than Progressive Trance.
It is characterized by a House influence, usually an heavier and slower rythm, between 130 and 140 BPM, and a more progressive and atmospheric aesthetic than in new generation of 2000s Psychedelic Trance whose BPM starts from 140. Due to its lightness, Psyprog is often described as cheerful and appropriate to the beginnings or ends of evenings.
In many ways, Psyprog is an accumulation of various musical styles, however there are two major trends: one approaching Full-On (majority), the other adopting a more minimal style (hence the name “Minimal Psytrance”). For some, this style would be a Techno legacy. As said earlier, there also found a significant part from House.
It is undoubtedly one of the most popular styles of Psychedelic Trance alongside Full-On.
Representative labels: Iono Music / Ovnimoon / Iboga
“Psy Tech” (also written “Psytech” or “Psytek”), born in Germany in the early 2000s, is a form of
Tech Trance belonging to Psychedelic Trance
for which would have replaced the “classic” Trance
elements by more complex elements stemming from Psychedelic Trance.
The progressive nature as well as the kick and the bassline usually encountered in Psychedelic Trance have been replaced by a more repetitive nature accompanied by heavier kicks from Techno at a rhythm generally between 135 and 150 BPM.
This one is especially often characterized by a somber and very mechanical aesthetic as well as by inherited percussions from Hard House, claps and distorted and filtered hi-hats. Synthesizers are short and repetitive and blended with those from Psychedelic Trance.
The rest of the body of music, that is to say the effects, melody and atmosphere, come from the Psychedelic Trance style used by the artist.
“Zenonesque”, originating in Australia, is a minimal style of Psyprog presenting an experimental tendency aesthetics, occasionally “funky” or “jazzy”,
and related to Zenon Records.
It is characterized by both dark and light elements, a playful ambience as well as a hybrid sound design between organic
and synthetic and a willingness to create deep psychedelic atmospheres.
However, unlike Psyprog which presents a clearer/cleaner aesthetic, Zenonesque has harder and more mechanical sonorities, making it closer to Psy Tech. That can go so far as to integrate a Psy Tech kick and bassline for the productions most infused by this latter.
There is also an alternating current, preceding Zenonesque, named “Dark Progressive Psytrance” (abbreviated “Dark Psyprog”). Unlike Zenonesque, it overcomes most of the characteristics of this latter (contrasting elements, playful ambiance and tendency to organic design) in favor of a more regular structure, an aesthetic rather dark or subdued and science fiction atmospheres hovering between darkness, melancholy and fascination.
Representative labels: Zenon / Cosmic Conspiracy
“Natural Trance” (also called “Tribal Trance” or “Ethno Trance”) is a Psychedelic Trance style whose sounds are entirely or partly derived from conventional instruments and not of electronic sounds.
This variant puts forward the musical capacities of the interpreters, and gives rise to most impressive scenic performances by the presence of musicians in addition of DJs.
The instruments generally used are djembe,
didgeridoo or
electric guitar.
It has no particular characteristics except the presence of non-electronic instruments. This form of Psychedelic Trance is rarely produced compared to other styles.
“Suomisaundi” (abbreviated “Suomi”, also known as “Suomisoundi”, “Suomistyge” or “Spugedelic Trance”) is a freestyle
Psychedelic Trance style that originated in Finland around the mid-1990s.
“Suomisaundi” literally means “Finnish sound” in Finnish.
It is characterized by an absence of rules established outside the basic elements of Trance such as 4/4 kicks that defined most genres and styles of Electronic Dance Music to date. Suomisaundi tracks are usually very melodic, including heavy influences from early Goa, tribal beats and Acid Trance tracks, as well as funky guitar/keyboard loops and sounds from or reminiscent of 80’s.
Suomi songs frequently include distorted sampling, layers and combinations of effects, tricky drum fills and breaks, as well as speech samples in Finnish or in English.
Moreover, on many occasions, there are forms of strange and whacky humor and/or self-irony in the music or in the track titles. Some even describe the Suomi style as anarchistic and almost punk, because the songs are usually very different and progressive compared to mainstream European Psychedelic Trance tracks.
Representative labels: 6-Dimension Sound / Antiscarp / Faerie Dragon / Exogenic
“Psybreaks” is a Psychedelic Trance style born during the second half of 1990 from the fusion of different Psychedelic Trance styles
(as Psytrance, Full-On, Darkpsy, Twilight,...etc)
or Downtempo with psychedelic orientation,
and one of the four styles/genres from the family of breaks and drums, namely Breakbeat,
Drum & Bass,
Neurofunk and
Breakcore.
It is characterized by an absence of kicks and simple 4/4 rhythms in favor of polyrhythms and irregular breaks with a 4/4 structure of drums “patterns” (Breakbeat characteristics) which may add more industrial sonorities (Breakcore characteristics) or regular polyrhythms with a structure in 2-step of drums “patterns” accompanied by heavy bass lines (Drum & Bass characteristics) or even multi-layered drums and audio re-sampling (Neurofunk characteristics). The rest of the body of music, that is to say the effects, melody and atmosphere are from the Psychedelic Trance style used by the artist.
Sometimes, it also happens that some artists add Glitch elements in their music.
One can also find under the name of “Psystep” any blend comprising Dubstep instead.
Representative label: Broken Robot
“Psybient” is an Ambient
style that can be attached to Psychedelic Trance and which contains various elements from
Ambient, Downtempo,
Dub,
Ethnic Music,
New Age and Psychedelic Trance sub-styles.
Where other Psychedelic Trance sub-styles are rather boosting (with the exception of some Proto-Goa, Psyprog, Zenonesque and Experimental productions), it often seeks to reach a state of deep relaxation, close to meditation and lucid dreaming.
Psybient is 2-3 times slower than global Psychedelic Trance styles, it rarely exceeds 110 BPM (or be totally beatless) and generally has a less defined rhythm. Often, we find it as a rhythmic base that can be covered by Ambient elements, filtered and reworked with many effects, with the aim to obtain a particular psychedelic sound.
It can also include electronic tracks (Glitch, Acid,...etc), traditional instruments, archaic vocal techniques and meditative chants elements. The electronic elements are often combined with ethnic and modern instruments, cosmic sounds of keyboards and harmonic music.
One can also find other terms:
Representative labels: Ultimae / Altar / Aleph Zero / Celestial Dragon / Interchill / Liquid Sound Design
“Experimental” is a freestyle Psychedelic Trance style whose origins and birth remain undetermined.
Like Suomi, it is characterized by an absence of established rules except the presence of a certain research of psychedelism in the music to be considered as part of this style. However, unlike this latter, the Experimental may be entirely free of Trance elements or, on the contrary, simply consist in a mixture of various Psychedelic Trance styles.
Its influences, musical blends and ambiences are highly variable and often unique to each artist, or even each music on each album of one and single artist.
Although IDM, Abstract Music, Downtempo and Glitch are often used with this one, because very appreciated for their experimental and sought side, Experimental can be merged with genres fairly, or totally, opposed to this latter by their musical structure and/or ambience, such as Jazz, Industrial Music, Trip-Hop, Folk Music or Classical Music.

Young traveler or seasoned adventurer,
You are now arrived at the end of this mystical grimoire of energies forming part of Psychedelic Trance. They made you browse thousand and one places. Thousand and one atmospheres and philosophies. From the darkest forests and oceans to the most distant and luminous space confines, from the most profound and intimate psyche to the coldest and chaotic world, from the most ancient times to the most futuristic dimensions, from the most harmonious paradise to the most tortured underworlds.
Know that Psychedelic Trance is a gathering of a huge amount of influences of genres and styles, mentalities, universes and all different people that are water and fire. And it is from this diversity that draws its wealth because it is his philosophy.
Whatever the style or genre that suits you best, close yourself to a musical environment (or other medium) will only bring you the narrowness of mind and snap judgment. An artist can be bad but never a genre. So do not hesitate to open yourself up to other musical genres. Forge your own musical identity and do not let others dictate it to you, because that's what makes the diversity of a culture.
I have given you enough momentum and enough have guided you so that you can now fly on your own. Now it's up to you to explore the world through music.
So remember one thing: keep an open mind, and good trip in Wonderland ;)

Author Laurie Parker, 51, of Starkville, mostly is known for her work as a children’s author, having penned such books as “Everywhere in Mississippi” and “Mississippi Alphabet.”
“I wanted to start writing children’s books because I knew it would combine two skill sets I have, writing in rhyme and making collages,” Parker said. “I’ve been writing poetry since I could read and write, and I did it almost religiously until my 20s.”
She also worked as a self-employed artist before she began her writing career.
Parker decided she wanted a change from writing children’s books for multiple reasons. One was because the children who always used to read her books are now growing up, so she decided to offer her audience something a bit more mature. Another was because of a fear she has that this generation is not reading enough.
“I’ve literally had people pick up my (children’s) books and put it down as soon as they realized it had words in it,” Parker said. “Oh, you think this has words. I’ll show you words.”
Parker talked about her latest book and first attempt at a novel Thursday at the Hattiesburg library’s Lunch with Books.
This was not Parker’s first time to attend a Lunch with Books event.
“Laurie had spoken here before about some of her children’s books, so she contacted us when she was working on her first novel to see if we were interested in having her,” said librarian Donna Davis, who organizes the Lunch with Books.
The library tries to host a Lunch with Books event whenever it knows of a Mississippi author who is willing to spare their lunch hour. Cost to attend is free. Lunches are available for $10.
At this event, Parker spoke about her progress as an author and what writing her first novel means to her.
“The Matchstick Cross” is about a New York City-based Mississippi native returning home to clean out the attic of her recently-deceased mother. She has brought along one of her friends to give him his first experience of the Deep South. The book is filled with childhood flashbacks and instances of the cultural barrier between natives of the North and South.
This was a long work in progress, Parker said. The novel has more than 500 pages, and the manuscript was exactly that, a draft hand-written in pencil.
“To me, it’s about crafting with words. I need to be able to write in the margins, scratch out words and draw arrows to where things need to go,” Parker said.
With Parker being a self-published author, she is able to determine where her books are distributed. She feels because of things like e-readers, independent bookstores are closing down because everyone can get their books cheaper online. Even though publishing a hard copy costs Parker more money, she does it to support her fellow Mississippians.
Parker will be releasing her second novel this fall, titled “Yonder Breaks the Morning,” about a World War II veteran from Oxford.
Parker’s books are available for purchase at Main Street Books at 210 North Main St.Headquarters: Login to unlock

The Germanwings co-pilot intentionally crashed the plane, according to a French prosecutor. The co-pilot intended to “destroy the plane,” manually setting it into the descent that killed 150 people when the flight crashed in the French Alps. The pilot locked another pilot out of the cockpit, he said. Airbus, like other plane manufacturers, made cockpits harder to enter after Sept. 11, 2001.
Brazil’s economic outlook only got worse.

This is the investor's obligation. It can also work the other way. "Some metal dealers may suggest an Individual retirement account custodian," says Johnson.
These include:: Understanding all your expenses upfront can avoid any nasty surprises, such as hidden costs after you invest.: Look for a business with an impressive reputation from objective 3rd parties, such as the Bbb or the Organization Customer Alliance. Moy says it might likewise be valuable to dig into what consumers say about the business, specifically the number of problems submitted.
: You should only deal with a business that has all the proper and necessary licenses, registrations, insurance coverage, and bonds to protect your financial investment. Special Costs Owning gold in a gold Individual retirement account does come with some unique expenses.
"Similarly, each type of gold provides its own set of requirements when a financier needs to sell," he adds.: This one-time cost is credited develop your new IRA account. This also differs by institution, however it may be more than the typical setup charge, as not all monetary services firms handle gold IRAs.
: The gold needs to be held by a qualified storage facility for which storage fees are charged.: If you wish to close out a gold IRA by selling your gold to a third-party dealer, said dealership will wish to pay less than what it goes for on the free market.
Some IRA companies will ensure to purchase the gold back from you at current wholesale rates, however you could still lose cash by closing the account, something that normally does not take place with opening and closing regular Individual retirement accounts. Needed Minimum Distribution IRAs. Checkbook IRAs There is one possible method to avoid having a custodian and the expenses connected with one: You can open what's understood as a "checkbook IRA," a self-directed IRA, described in Internal Profits Code 408(m). The IRS is stated to be presently scrutinizing this type of IRA, so proceed very carefully with this choice.
The rollover process is the same when it comes to any other retirement fund. You normally fill out an account application (whether online or on paper), and the account is usually developed within 24 to 2 days of completion and invoice of the application. "As soon as the signed transfer request is received by all celebrations, the 2 custodians will communicate with each other to move the funds to the brand-new custodian and fund a new gold IRA," states Gottlieb.
Gold's Unique Threats All financial investments come with threats and rewards, gold included. "In many ways, gold Individual retirement accounts have the exact same threats that any investment has," says Moy.
," states Moy.
If your portfolio is stabilized with both gold and paper-based financial investments, a loss on the gold side will be balanced by the gain experienced by other assets. "A number of these dangers exist for conventional IRAs too. And conventional IRAs have risks that gold IRAs do not have," he includes.
Any physical commodity undergoes theft. Someone might get into the depository where your gold is being saved. However, to get approved for gold Individual retirement accounts, depositories are needed to be insured, which would safeguard your financial investment as long as your account doesn't go beyond the custodian's specified value on accounts, "There are also untrustworthy custodians who might take from their clients' accounts or devote fraud by selling your rare-earth elements that they do not in fact have nor are planning to purchase," says Moy.
While gold has the potential of a high return, it's easy to be blinded by its glitter. Gold costs can plunge unexpectedly. When gold is increasing, you also need to choose whether you 'd be purchasing ator close tothe top of the market if you invest at that point. Waiting could make more sense.
In basic, it's never a great idea to put all of your eggs in one possession basket. If gold appears like a strong choice for you, Sentell suggests putting no greater than one-third of your retirement funds into a gold IRA. Gottlieb advises you run out than "10% to 15% of an individual total portfolio purchased gold, whether in the paper kind [which is not allowed in a gold IRA] or the physical holdings.".

By performing a stress test you get insight into the performance limits of your application or platform. What is a stress test? A stress test will show you how your application reacts under an increasing load and what the maximum capacity of your application is. A stress test is often deployed to test a newly developed application, but also when there has been a change in the data centre, hardware or operating system. It is important then to check whether your system is still able to withstand the expected peak load. After all, most changes will have an impact on performances. What do we do during a stress test? When carrying out a stress test we simulate a real-world situation in a safe environment. In that we simulate the users’ behaviour at maximum (peak) load. We do that, for example, on your most popular pages, in frequently used transactions or heavy functionalities. By steadily increasing the pressure, we are able to pinpoint the limits of your system and we identify exactly where in the chain the bottlenecks can be found.During the stress stress test? The report following the stress test provides a clear indication of how many users or transactions your system can process simultaneously without faults or excessive response times. If you deploy a stress test in order to test the capacity of your system after that has been scaled up, or to optimise the performance, then we can tell you which infrastructure components or configurations will also require changing. In this way you are able to expand your system capacity with a minimum investment and at the same time ensure that the performance is safeguarded under all circumstances.

At Lee Family Dentistry, we are always excited when we get to treat the whole family! We love seeing infants, children, and adolescents in our office, and know how important it is that every visit is a positive experience for these patients.
Baby teeth, also known as primary teeth, play a big role in development. Children use them for 5-7 years, and they are important for chewing, appearance, and speech development. They also serve as place holders that direct the adult teeth into the correct spots.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that a child first see the dentist either at age one or six months after their first baby tooth appears, whichever comes first. That visit generally consists of a quick exam to make sure everything is developing correctly, and allows us to answer any questions you have about your child’s oral health. It also helps familiarize your child with our office, so they look forward to future dental visits.
When your child comes to see us for checkups, we carefully examine all baby teeth and any incoming adult teeth. We check for decay, make sure that everything is developing correctly, and review with you how to care properly for your child’s teeth. We also thoroughly clean the teeth and apply fluoride varnish to help prevent future decay. If needed, we may also:
- Apply sealants to help keep decay from getting into the deep grooves of molars.
- Fabricate mouthguards to keep smiles safe during sports.
- Refer to an orthodontist if teeth are not erupting (coming in) properly.Doctor’s Profile

In the final lesson of this series, we will take a look at the nonprofit accounting standards your accounting system needs to adhere to. If you run a nonprofit and have gone through our previous lessons on how to build an accounting system, this lesson is for you.
Nonprofit Accounting Standards
Accounting really only has one rule, which is everything must balance. Specifically, the debits and credits of your accounting system should always balance. If you need a refresher on debits and credits, check out Lesson 4, where we covered how these work as the nuts and bolts of your accounting system.
All of your accounts work together using debits and credits, and every transaction you enter needs to be in balance. This is why a double-entry accounting system is critical to your nonprofit’s financial success. If you record an expense of $50, but only record $45 being paid out of your asset account, that will cause problems with your reports. They won’t make sense. Every accounting software you find should be a double-entry system, so no need to worry. You’ll just need to make sure you find one that allows for true fund accounting in order to stay completely accurate.
Who Established These Standards?
Like any business or organization, there are always expectations created by governing authorities that dictate how your operations are run and what forms you need to file. Accounting decisions for nonprofits in the U.S. are made by the PCAOB, AICPA, IRS, GASB, and FASB. The main point of these organizations is to determine rules that accounting must follow. We call these GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) standards. All entities in the U.S. must adhere to these nonprofit accounting standards.
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) – Established by Congress to oversee the audits of public companies in order to protect the interests of investors and further the public interest in the preparation of informative, accurate, and independent audit reports.
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) – The national, professional organization of CPAs, which sets ethical standards for the profession and U.S. auditing standards for audits of private companies, nonprofit organizations, federal, state and local governments.
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) – The revenue service for the United States federal government, which is responsible for collecting taxes, and the interpretation and enforcement of the Internal Revenue Code.
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) – The source of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) used by state and local governments in the U.S.
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) – A private organization whose primary purpose is to develop generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) within the U.S.
Depending on your operations, you will need to research the individual requirements of your nonprofit, but generally it all boils down to your reports and tax returns.
More Required Nonprofit Accounting Standards
Reports, as mentioned in Lesson 5, are a collection of data from your accounting system that provide financial information about your nonprofit. As long as you have correctly set up your chart of accounts and entered accurate transactions within a double-entry, fund accounting system, you should be able to generate the reports required of your organization. Let’s recap what the three nonprofit financial reports are:
Statement Of Financial Position
Otherwise known as your balance sheet, this report illustrates the accounting equation and shows a snapshot of your organization’s financial health.
Statement Of Financial Activities
Otherwise known as your income statement, this report shows the money you’ve received, minus the money you’ve spent, which results in your net income or loss for a period of time.
Statement Of Functional Expenses
This report shows not only how much money you’ve spent, but it also breaks each expense down by fund and category.
Once you have created these reports, you can present the information to your board or any interested party. You can also prepare your annual tax return. Software designed for businesses may make it difficult to create reports that meet the requirements for nonprofits.
Form 990
Even though you are a nonprofit organization, the IRS still wants to know your financial information. Churches are exempt from this process, but nonprofits need to file a Form 990 return every year to the IRS.
Options include:
- Form 990-n (e-Postcard)
Required of any nonprofit organization with less than $50,000 in gross receipts (income) during the year
- Form 990EZ
Required of any nonprofit organization with $50,000-$200,000 in gross receipts (income), and less than $500,000 in assets
- (Full) Form 990
Required of any nonprofit organization with over $200,000 in gross receipts (income) or $500,000 in assets
Your tax return is due on the fifteenth day of the fifth month of your fiscal year. Meaning, if you have a fiscal year beginning on January 1, your return is due on May 15.
What Next?
This lesson completes the “Intro to Nonprofit Accounting” course. If you have not watched or read the previous lessons in this course, we highly recommend it. Once you have completed each lesson, you will:

HI Alex,
I am working in a church as an Administrator. Currently the Finance guy is showing a line item for depreciation and another for Amortization. Is this necessary for our book keeping?
Thanks for your reply,
Michael McDaniel
Depreciation and Amortization are two separate line items needed for different situations. I would consult an accounting professional to see if you need both, but they aren’t redundant of each other. Hope this helps!A

Only traces of the Bush administration’s No Child Left Behind legislation, the Obama administration’s signature education program Race to the Top and the waivers from No Child Left Behind that came with it are left. In their place is the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), a new bipartisan agreement to roll back what everyone, in time, came to perceive as an overbearing and counterproductive role for the federal government in education.
In this blog I will share my interpretation of the events that led to the passage of No Child Left Behind and its progeny, the great shrinking of the federal role we have just seen and the nature of the challenge ahead. In several blogs that follow, I will put forward the outlines of a plan for states that wish to take advantage of their new freedom to build a state education system that is competitive with the best education systems in the world.
The new federal education law largely restores the status quo ante, the world before No Child Left Behind. The nation has spent 15 years going down a blind alley, while more and more countries’ education systems have been successfully redesigned to outperform ours, some by very wide margins.
At the time No Child Left Behind was passed, the federal role in education had been largely focused for 35 years on improving the education of the nation’s disadvantaged children. As the years went by, there was strong bipartisan support for this program. Early on in that history, the public and policy makers expressed a lot of confidence in the nation’s educators, and saw the problem largely in terms of lack of resources for disadvantaged students. They were inclined to trust professional educators’ judgment as to how best to use the increased funds.
But, over the years, that confidence eroded. It started with A Nation at Risk, the Reagan administration report that portrayed the nation’s schools as having fallen a long way from some standard they had formerly met. That charge was false. But, by 2000, the year No Child Left Behind was passed, the cost of educating an average student in the nation’s schools had more than doubled in the preceding 20 years after accounting for inflation, an enormous increase. But the performance of the nation’s high school students had not changed at all. Where had all the money gone? The new President, George W. Bush, charged educators with embracing the “soft bigotry of low expectations,” saying, in effect, that they had accepted the money but had never actually expected low-income, minority and handicapped students to perform much better. The Democrats agreed. Both parties were angry. The nation had lost confidence in its educators. Their solution was to hold them strictly accountable for the results of their work. The age of tough-minded accountability had begun with a vengeance.
The Bush administration tried to hold the schools accountable by imposing tough consequences for whole faculties if the schools did not meet expectations. The Bush administration’s goal of having every student proficient by 2014 was a fantasy and everyone knew it. As the deadline approached, entire states were populated with schools deemed failing. No Child Left Behind had become politically untenable.
Enter the Obama administration, which used the impending implosion to replace the discredited Bush plan for accountability with its own catastrophe. The Obama administration, with Race to the Top and the waiver process, decided instead to put their full weight behind the new Common Core State Standards, fund the development of new tests set to those standards, hold teachers individually accountable for the performance of their own students against the Common Core State Standards, implement the new tests and urge states to use teacher evaluations based on test results to fire teachers whose students did not perform satisfactorily.
The new administration pushed the states very hard to implement the new Common Core State Standards as fast as possible. So we soon learned that teachers were given instructional materials that were not aligned to the new standards. They were not given training that would have enabled them to teach the new standards well. They were not given time to work with their colleagues to develop the kinds of instructional practices the students would need to master the new standards. New tests were hastily developed that were poorly constructed and in many cases simply laughable. School administrators, scared that their students would not meet standards, instituted frequent testing regimes to check student progress toward proficiency. Schooling for many children became nothing but testing, with low-level, dumbed-down tests. Parents revolted. Teachers of many subjects were evaluated using data on the performance of other teachers of different subjects than the subjects they taught. Award-winning teachers were fired. Teachers widely regarded as highly competent by their colleagues retired early in protest against the new accountability system. Superior teachers of inner-city minority children quit because anyone who chose to teach in those schools was more likely than other teachers to be fired under the new system. Young people in high school took one look at all this and decided not to become teachers. Applications to teachers colleges plummeted.
Is it any wonder that this Congress, which can agree on very little, agreed to get rid of this fiasco? Now everyone is declaring victory. But the problems that led an infuriated Congress to insist that the country get good value for the money spent on vulnerable children are still with us. The Every Student Succeeds Act requires the states to have standards and it requires them to administer tests set to those standards at times stipulated by the legislation. And it requires them to hold their schools accountable for their performance. But the states are free to set their own standards, create their own tests, set the pass points for them in the basement if they wish, and do little or nothing to hold their schools accountable. Some of these state efforts require federal approval, but the political circumstances in which the bill was written make the approval function virtually toothless. The Congress acted as if the problem were an overreaching federal government, and solved it by curbing its powers.
The victory we have achieved is hollow. No Child Left Behind created the political context in which it became possible for the states to develop national standards and for the federal government to provide funds to the states to create national tests to measure student progress against those standards. These are vital ingredients of high-performing education systems. The irony is that implementation of the high standards so ardently desired by the last two administrations has been so flawed and so injured by the insistence of these same administrations on tough-minded teacher accountability—something no top-performing nation has done and a policy that the Obama administration was repeatedly warned against—that the standards and testing system they birthed has itself been gravely wounded.
While the United States has been fiddling with the implementation of poorly designed accountability systems constructed in anger at our teachers, a large and swiftly growing number of other countries have succeeded in redesigning their education systems to greatly improve student achievement, provide much more equity for vulnerable students and do all this at much lower cost. Whereas the United States once had the best-educated workforce in the industrialized world, its workforce is now among the world’s least well educated. This is the true American catastrophe, the one we should all have our eyes fixed on now. It will sink us if we do not fix it.
The successful attacks on the Common Core and on common tests tied to the Common Core and the greatly weakened legitimacy for a strong—but sensible—federal role in education are not the only casualties of the last 15 years of policy. The worst is the effect on teachers and the teaching profession: the erosion of public support for them and their work, the image of teachers as under attack from every quarter, the plummeting applications to teachers colleges, the flight of teachers from schools serving disadvantaged students and from the profession generally, the fall in teachers’ salaries relative to those of others and the attacks on their benefits. No nation has ever improved student achievement by subjecting its teachers to continuous, unrelenting attack. We have not actually returned to the status quo ante. The costs of tough-minded teacher accountability policies have been incalculable and will be with us for a long time.
It is now up to the states. Many, free to revert to the status quo ante, will do so. Most will pursue the same silver bullet solutions that have gotten us nowhere for decades.
Much depends on the few states that will be able to reach beyond the immediate challenges they face, forge a new consensus on broadly shared prosperity as their state goal, and redesign their whole education system so the vast majority of their students can reach the standards they will need to reach to achieve that goal. In my next few blogs, I will lay out an agenda for those states, the states on which all of us now depend.

Engaging in crop and animal production, seems like a dead-end in order to diversify the country’s economy. But what are the challenges that farmers are facing during the process of a more sustainable and food secure future?
According to Food and Agriculture Organization, around 60 to 70% more food will have to be produced in the next 35 years, as a result both of population growth and rising incomes. The demand for cereals (both for food and animal feed) is projected to reach some 3 billion tons by 2050, while the annual cereal production will have to grow by almost a billion tons (2.1 billion tons today). Meat production on the other hand will have to rise up to over 200 million tons and reach a total of 470 million tons in 2050. 72% of this amount will be consumed in developing countries – in comparison to the 58% which is consumed today.
Without a doubt, livestock and livestock products can make a crucial contribution to household economic and food security -as well as nutrition- in the developing world. Even small amounts of animal source foods can improve the nutritional status of low-income households. Okorie Oscar Angus, is a pig breeder in Nigeria. He is fully aware that a livestock-dependent pastoral society is essential in order to achieve food and nutritional security.
“Unfortunately, Nigeria, known as the Giant of Africa with a growing population of 200 million people, operates on a unilateral economy, focusing on oil as the only source of revenue. Oil accounts for 80% of government’s revenue and 90% of foreign exchange earnings. Engaging in crop and animal production, seems like a dead-end to me in order to diversify the country’s economy, but also as one of the most viable ways to achieve food security…” says Okorie as we discuss about the reasons that made him turn out to pig husbandry.
“The value of trade in pig products around the world runs into billions of dollars every year and Africa enjoys less than 5% of this action. In addition, 80% of the pork consumed in Nigeria and Ghana is imported from other pig production countries at an estimated annual cost of approximately $3bn. We recognize that in order to be able to meet up with the rising demands for crop and livestock production we must focus on increase and consolidate our efforts on a local production which could contribute towards a more food secure future while supporting our community’s economy…” explains Okorie and at the same time he doesn’t forget to mention the non-availability of lands and the growing concern for climate change – two factors that should be taken into consideration since they can refrain productivity and lead towards food insecurity.
For these exact reasons, Okorie envisioned something more than just a livestock farm.“We have established Bigma Global Concept Limited farm (BGCL) as a subsidiary of Community Outreach Development and Empowerment Centre (CODEC) in 2018. BGCL piggery farm is situated across one hectare of land in Eziama Village Ohuba, Imo State in Nigeria. We opt to contribute immensely to the availability of food and livestock for consumption from local to international level.”
But that’s not the only goal Okorie has for his farm. He has already turned towards a more sustainable livestock and agriculture farming. One of his main concerns is ensuring that his animals are properly fed and that they are also healthy. “To mitigate this challenge, we have started producing our own locally made feed. Therefore, in our farm, we also produce enriched and healthy food to raise our livestock and we mitigate occasional disease outbreaks which ultimately increases and sustains food production. We carry out a vaccination program for our livestock and we are always in search for optimal combination of proteins, energy, and other nutrients, depending on growth stage of our animals. Their feed majorly consists of maize, soybeans, PKC and cassava peels.”
That is actually the first and main aspect a livestock farm can have: Producing high quality products and nutritious food. Okorie and his people are conscientiously working on improving their livestock and crop production, but that is not their one and only concern. “We are working on establishing our integrated farms as pilot farms where agricultural students and researchers can carry out studies and research in Nigeria. We opt for something more than just a farm. The idea of creating an Education Center can give us one more mission – the mission of educating kids and adults, but also farmers and livestock owners on how they can work towards a more sustainable future. That is something on which we are working with Food Security Center. It will certainly take time but we all know that it is an invest worth making for future generations.”
Being a livestock farmer in Nigeria is not easy. There are certain things that are adding to the non-available lands and the climate change that we have mentioned above which are making livestock and agriculture farming pretty challenging. “One of the challenges we face has to do with the lack of medical supplies, as well as cleaning products, that eventually leads in disease outbreaks amongst the livestock. About two weeks ago, a poultry farmer living in the South Western part of Nigeria lost over 600 birds at his poultry farm, as he could not have access in medicine and food for them. Moreover, there is insufficient or no market data that can help link local farmers to suppliers or even service providers. In addition, the Nigerian Government has been quite negligent in making proactive attempt to provide agricultural loans and incentives for framers who have been grossly affected by Covid-19. If we also add product diversion, pilfering -and recently- storage problems we realize that food security can easily get compromised.
But there is one more thing -beyond all these- that still remains my biggest concern and it has to do with our feed shortage. We procure the food with which we feed our livestock from local feed producers who are also procuring it from other farmers living in neighboring communities. Due to Covid-19 lockdown, it was impossible for livestock farmers to purchase sufficient food. Many panic-stricken farmers have bought food in bulk only to experience storage issues and damages owing the quick decomposition. To mitigate this challenge, so as to save our livestock, we have started producing our own locally made feed. For instance, some derivatives from our maize, yam peels and cassava peels are now being used to produce feed for the pigs. This is what we did in order to ensure the well-being of our animals and the production of nutritious meat for our clients. And we were lucky because we actually had the means to find a solution internally in our business. But not everyone can. The reasons? Not all people have the means and not everyone has adequate knowledge.”
So, that’s what brings us once more at the same conclusion: If we opt for a food secure future we must invest on sustainability and education. No matter what we do or where we do it. There is always a way to get along with nature and spread the knowledge we gain though our experience. And that is what Okorie dreams of doing through his farm.Tumblers

The German discounter relocated from the site on Wellington Road in the summer of 2019 and initially placed it up for sale for £1.5m as it opened its new store on the nearby Marina Quay retail park.
It failed to sell and Aldi later cut the price to £750,000.
Now it looks like a deal has been completed with plans for the Animal Trust to take on part of the site with a long term aim of creating nearly 40 jobs at a not-for-profit veterinary practice.
They plan to create four units in the building and sub-let the other three to alternative occupiers.
A planning statement lodged with Denbighshire council states: "The practice will create 8 full time equivalent jobs (3 vets, 5 nurses and admin staff) on opening, with staffing levels expected to grow to 16 vets and 22 nurses and other members of staff after 8 years.
"The job opportunities will primarily be high value skilled/professional positions (i.e. vets and nurses) in addition to administrative and clerical positions.
"Additional jobs will be created by the three separate business units, which has the potential to create between 10 and 20 additional full time equivalent jobs.
"The proposal will, therefore, make a valid contribution towards the local economy and job creation."
The application will now be considered by planners at Denbighshire council..11 nov

Evening chaps,
Welcome to Beyondthebunker.com, a rather lovely little blog site, dedicated to keeping you up to date with the work of myself and Mr Steve Penfold. I’m sure I could write a lengthy intro about who we are and what we do but for now and for the sake of brevity, I shall just give you the facts:
- Beyond The Bunker is a company that produces comic books, films and web content. Essentially, I write things and Steve draws/films them. Steve dreams of one day writing his own stuff, while I dream of being a mermaid with rockets instead of fins. We’re dreamers.
- We rather enjoy the things we have produced so far and hope that you will as well (Steve will no doubt have a slightly more hyperbolic way of phrasing this)
- This site is updated twice a week so you should check in often.
- Toasted teacakes are fucking awesome.
So that’s us. We’re very pleased to meet you and we think your hair looks lovely that way (regardless of what everyone else says). Now that the awkward introductions are over with, we shall get on with filling this site with lots of lovely content for your eyeballs to consume at their leisure.
And just like that, we’re underway!

Savkino Gold Mine is located 400km east of Chita in the Zabaikalsky Province of South Siberia. The mine is owned and operated by UK-based company White Tiger Gold. The property lies in the south appendage of the Ildikan license area and has a surface area of 3.1km2.
The exploration and production of hard-rock gold license was approved to Ildikangold, a Russian subsidiary of White Tiger Gold, by the Federal Ministry of Natural Resources in July 2006. In May 2008, permission was granted to develop and begin operations at the mine.
Production at the Savkino mine commenced in October 2008. The mine produced 18,261Oz of gold in 2012.
The deposit lies within the Smirnovsko-Mikhailovsky Mineral district. It is hosted between the Smirnovskaya and Mikhailovskiy regional fault zones.
The geology at the mine is prevailed by the Savkino anticline which is confined by the Savkino and Mihkailovskiy thrust faults. The Savkino thrust fault contains lower Cambrian carbonate rocks that are penetrated over lower Jurassic terrigenous units.
The mine also hosts igneous rocks such as lower permian granite, Jurassic granodiorite and Cretaceous rhyolite. Most of the gold is contained in the north-east-trending Jurassic granodiorite and syenite porphyries dykes that are positioned by significant hydrothermal revision of the calcareous rocks.
The gold mineralisation is hosted in the gold placer lying in the Lower Borzya, Ildikan and North Ildikan River valleys. It is also hosted in the hanging wall of the anticline. High rated gold deposits are situated in the upper Jurassic dykes along with silica, sericite, pyrite and barite.
Stretching up to 3km long, the mineralisation exists at a depth of 175m. The width varies between 30m and 50m.
According to the latest reserve estimate released in 2014, the mine contains proven and probable reserves of approximately 2.8 million tonnes (Mt) graded at 1.31g/t Au, which is equivalent to 119,350kOz of contained gold. The measured and indicated resources are estimated at 3.95Mt graded at 1.36g/t Au, which is equivalent to 173,220Oz of contained gold. The inferred resources are estimated at 15,660Oz.
Savkino has been developed as an open-pit mine and is being mined using truck and shovel method. The pit was dug to a depth of 178m. The strike length and width of the pit are 1,100m and 400m respectively. The open-pit hosts approximately 12,000m3 of overburden with strip ratio of 4.2.
The run of mine ore is transferred to the primary jaw crusher by conveyors.
The crushed ore is carried to the second crusher for next stage of crushing. The output is conveyed to a surge bin and then to an agglomeration drum containing leach pregnant solution (PS).
The leach solution is prepared by processing the leach solution of cement, lime and barren with dilute cyanide solution. It is disseminated over the heap surface from an array of pipes, wobblers and drip emitters to create the pregnant solution (PS).
The PS comprising dissolved gold passes via the heap surface and accumulates in the pregnant solution pond. The resulting solution from the pond is pumped to a adsorption, desorption and recovery (ADR) building. The gold is absorbed on to actuated carbon from the barren solution and stored in two pachuca tanks.
The gold accumulated carbon is stockpiled in the first pachuca tank and transmitted to a elution and electrowinning circuit. The resultant cathode is smelted with fluxes in an induction chamber and transported to the refinery for acidic and caustic washing and then conveyed to the adsorption circuit. The gold is retrieved from the carbon by using a hot solution of caustic soda.
Phase 2 expansion of the mine increased the processing plant’s capacity from 650,000tpa to 1.7Mtpa and involved the construction of a second pit in the southwestern area of the mine, expansion of existing gold recovering plant, mining fleet, and construction of new heap leach pads.
A new power line was installed, and a new crushing and screening plant with a capacity of more than 9,000tpd was commissioned in January 2013 as part of the expansion.
IFC-Bank provided a revolving credit facility to Ildikangold in February 2011 for the expansion of the Savkino mine.
Ildikangold entered into an agreement with Sberbank in August 2011 for a $10m non-revolving credit facility for the expansion project. A senior secured term loan facility obtained through VTB was also used for the expansion.…It’s a milestone. We made it to 50 days in a row, y’all! I’ve written about 50 Prince songs since mid-April. Halfway to my original goal. 10% of the way to the ultimate goal…yikes. What other artist could you write about for 50 days in a row and think, “I’m only 10% of the way there?” Long live Prince! Let’s keep it going.
Prince was on top of the world in 1985. He was coming off of back-to-back platinum albums, a pile of Grammys and American Music Awards, an Academy Award, and a starring role in his own hit movie. Then he shocked the world by following up Purple Rain with Around the World in a Day. Around the World in a Day was such a creative left turn away from Purple Rain that a few million of the people who had made their way on to the bandwagon in recent years broke their ankles jumping back off. The fools that jumped off missed out on a brilliant album, but that’s their problem. Nowhere on Around the World in a Day is Prince’s creative change more obvious than the third track: “Condition of the Heart.”
After listening to thousands of albums in my life, I think I have a pretty good idea what to expect. While this isn’t always the case, you typically believe an album will come out of the gate with some energetic tracks for the first 3-4 songs to keep the listener interested. Around the World in a Day starts that way with the title track and “Paisley Park” opening the album, two high energy songs. The fourth track is “Raspberry Beret,” one of his most beloved classics. The third track is an all-time head scratcher. “Condition of the Heart.” A grand 6:48 ballad recorded in October of 1984 by Prince alone in Los Angeles while the rest of The Revolution were in Minneapolis rehearsing for the Purple Rain tour. It’s not that “Condition of the Heart” isn’t good. It’s actually a breathtakingly beautiful song. It just doesn’t fit. It seems out of sequence. Every other one of the first seven songs is uptempo and catchy. It should be at the back end of the album with the other songs that fit alongside it. Instead it’s oddly stuck in the middle of an absolutely incredible run of high energy stuff. It’s kind of jarring when you listen to them in sequence. I promise you’ll be thinking to yourself, “This is messed up. Someone put this on shuffle, right?” I would love to understand Prince’s reasoning for putting this song where he did on the album. Prince is well-known for the amount of thought he put in to the sequence of songs on his albums. I wish I knew what he was thinking here. Maybe he was just trying to mess with people like me who expect something more normal.
That said, “Condition of the Heart” is a stunning song. Just not necessarily what I’m looking for when I listen to Prince. I’m going to admit with a fair amount of shame that I quite often skip this song to get to “Raspberry Beret,” “Tambourine,” “America,” and “Pop Life” when I’m listening to Around the World in a Day. He should’ve put this song at the end of the album.Harewood Food and Drink Project

Social media is unquestionably the cheapest and easiest way to get closer to reaching your business’ goals and generate brand awareness. However, a lot of businesses don’t realize what they can do with social media and how important it is to regularly post, analyze, and engage with their followers. Luckily, there are so many different social media management tools that can help you better manage your time without sitting on your computer refreshing your Facebook feed all day.
Realistically, no small to medium sized company should be able to justify spending their time managing their own social media accounts. Frankly, doing so is the same as throwing money down the drain. Hiring an in-house, full-time social media manager is only beneficial to large-scale companies and is otherwise a waste of resources.

He said, "I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.” Uh-huh—and you decided to stage a protest about this, which has all been done before, now? Whatever the reason, I did say that I supported Kaepernick’s inane decision to be disrespectful. It’s America. He’s well within his rights to do this, but don’t whine or complain when the backlash hits you. That’s our right as outraged patriots. Over time, other athletes, like U.S. women’s national team player Megan Rapinoe, also took a knee during the national anthem to show solidarity for Kaepernick before her game against the Chicago Red Stars; Rapinoe plays for the Seattle Reign.
Well, now an entire NFL team could boycott the anthem (on 9/11 no less) during their season-opener against the Miami Dolphins (via KomoNews):."
[…]
Wide receiver Doug Baldwin, never shy about expressing his opinions, took to Facebook to discuss the issue on Sept. 4, using a parable to argue people were more concerned with Kaepernick's method of protest than the issues he raised.
"I think that's what the issue is here," Baldwin said on Wednesday. "We're missing the message in terms of what we're talking about. It's not necessarily about the messenger or about the protest itself. It's about what we're pointing to."
Baldwin and his teammates have discussed a larger protest, but the 27-year-old said he wanted to get "all of my ducks in a row" before he disclosed any plans.
Again, do what you want fellas. No black bags are going to be pulled over your head after the game, but an anthem protest on 9/11 will only make you prime candidates for tool academy. No one is going to talk about racial and social injustice with your antics. It will be how you disrespected the families of the victims from that horrific attack. Protest all you want, but don’t complain if the backlash is swift and brutal. Frankly, this is just nonsense. If any of these clowns were so committed to starting some conversation about race, shouldn’t they have done this two years ago after Michael Brown’s shooting death (which was ruled justifiable by the DOJ) in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014? Where were these national anthem protests then? It’s shallow political theater—nothing more. Oh, and did I forget to mention that Seahawks coach Pete Carroll is a 9/11 truther? Yeah, talk about insult to injury. As for Rapinoe, she’s, uh—upset that the national anthem was played early before her game against the Washington Spirit. This prevented another anthem protest on her part:.”
Statement from Washington Spirit owner Bill Lynch on decision to play national anthem with teams not on field. #NWSL pic.twitter.com/RKgkIyvHUb— Jeff Kassouf (@JeffKassouf) September 7, 2016
Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me? And please don’t say that this was to the detriment of both teams—it's only bad for your protest. Ms. Rapinoe has decided to take a knee during the national anthem. That’s fine. Mr. Lynch decided to play the anthem early. That’s fine too. In the end, wherever you fall in this debate, you’re going to have to deal with differences of opinion, no matter how maddening. At the same time, a 9/11 national anthem protest. To me, that’s just heinous.. Working in tandem with the teaching staff Shamrock students are able to develop in both the academic domain and the social/emotional domain.

England’s Defender Trippier is reportedly searching for a house to Manchester.
The athletico Madrid defender who has impressed since moving to the Wanda Metropolitano won the laliga this season.
He consequently earned himself a place in Gareth Southgate’s squad for the Euros.
It looks as though he’ll be England’s first choice Right-back at the Euros as Alexander Trent Arnold limped off in England’s Game against Austria.
The player has caught the interest of Manchester United as they look for an attacking Right-back to compete with wan bissaka.
Bissaka is solid defensively but he’s less than average in attack, so Manchester United are looking to add a Right-back who can attack against low blocks.
They’ve now identified Kieran Trippier as The solution to that problem and are expected to submit a bid for him in coming days.
They’ll also be looking to wrap up some early deals before the Euros to show their angry fans some intent.We always ask ourselves why users were meant to eat in square boxes of cardboard?

But have you ever wondered how they pay to keep the multi-billion conglomerate running? Well as it turned out, they are not as much “the knights in shining armors” as everyone presumes. In fact, each time you use one of their services, they collect invaluable data about your likes, dislikes, preferences, etc. and sell it to their massive advertising network, Adsense.
Scared about the world knowing about your deepest and darkest secrets? Don’t fret, as we will help in stopping Google from spying on you through this article.
How to Check Your Google History
Believe it or not, deleting your browser history doesn’t delete your Google search history. So, while you are heaving a sigh of relief after you managed to delete your browser history; someone at Google headquarters would still be able to find everything you have been searching for, on the Google’s databases!
To check your Google history:
- Go to.
- Log in with your Google account
- Scroll down the page to the Account Tools section and select Account History
Now you can view, your
- Search and Browsing History – DELETE DELETE DELETE!
- Your Voice Searches and Commands – Stored from the “OK Google” app.
- Places You Go – Every time you use Google Maps
- Information from Your Devices – All your contacts, apps and calendar events you sync from phones, laptops, and tablets
- Videos You Searched on YouTube – Found from YouTube’s History tab
- Videos You Watched on YouTube
How to Check Your Interests
Google is pretty nifty at hiding stuff from getting deleted! Apart from everything listed above, they also store personal information like age and gender to give advertisers a better idea of your demographics.
You can find this information at the bottom of the Account History page, where a very smartly hidden Related Settings section lurks in shadows. Click on Ads, and you can see your demographic information as well as your interests, as collected by Google. Luckily, you can delete all of this information, and even add some if you want ads for a specific interest.
How to Opt Out
If you want to stop Google from assimilating information about you, you can use the ‘opt out of all the targeted ads’ option. Go to the bottom of Ad Settings page, and click on Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads link.
But this will result in dealing with a host of annoying ads which have nothing to do with your interests, unless you use the ad blocker, of course!
You can also return to the Account History page and put everything to pause. This action will stop Google from gathering new information about you. It will also give you a chance to set your interests from the Ads page.

The proposed scheme will see the existing 440,000 sq ft shopping centre transformed into a multi-media centre for the town by 2025.
This will provide a six-screen cinema, music and E-sports venue, 10 lane bowling alley and indoor mini golf course.
The scheme will also include restaurants, a new hotel, 464 flats, new market hall, including a contemporary food hall, co-working space and small offices.
Under the deal, BCEGI will lead the construction programme for the new scheme.
The Leader of Wigan Council, Councillor David Molyneux, said: “These proposals very much reflect the feedback we got from residents about the importance of vibrant town centres during the Big Listening Project in 2018 and the more recent consultation held earlier this year.”
He said Galleries25 would create 475 construction jobs and a further 190 jobs when the scheme opens.
Dongwen Yu, Lead Director of BCEGI, said: “We are delighted to be selected as Wigan Council’s preferred Strategic Development Partner alongside our partner, Cityheart.
“The Galleries project is an extremely important and exciting opportunity to transform the town centre and we are looking forward to working closely with the council, local businesses and the wider community to develop our joint vision.
“The development cements BCEGI’s long term future in the region, a future that we believe will benefit the council and the people of the borough for years to come.”85 River Meadow Lane; Social Circle, GA 30025

Pedro Castillo, the rightful president-elect of Peru, describes his journey from elementary school teacher to trade union militant to the cusp of state power.
President-elect of the Peru Libre party Pedro Castillo talks to supporters during a rally in Lima, Peru. (Raul Sifuentes / Getty Images).
This year we are celebrating the bicentennial of Peru as a republic, yet after two hundred years, we still have a high level of illiteracy, and the homes of my parents and neighbors don’t have electricity, lights, or running water. There’s a totally abandoned health center where once in a while a nurse comes by and maybe you can find a bandage or a few pills for all the families.
As I traveled in rural areas across the country, I found conditions similar to my hometown. Further into the Amazon, conditions are even worse. People there have nothing; they are totally abandoned by the state..
Peru is such a wealthy country but so much of the wealth, such as copper, gold, and silver, goes to foreigners. At the ports, you see an endless stream of trucks taking away the resources of the country and just two hundred meters away, you see a barefoot child, a child with tuberculosis, a child full of parasites. That is why we must renegotiate the contracts with big companies so that more of the profits remain in Peru and benefit the people. We must reexamine the free trade agreements we have signed with other countries so that we can promote local businesses..”BUDGETARY allocations since 2017 to the Ministries of Defence, Police Affairs, Interior and the Office of the National Security Adviser in Nigeria have risen by 65 per cent, but nearly 15,000 citizens have been killed by terrorists and bandits.
Data from the Budget of the Federation reveal that over the space of five years, money allocated for fighting insecurity has increased from N1.13 trillion in 2017 to N1.87 trillion in 2021.
Despite the increased financing of security outfits, 14,359 lives have been lost.
In 2021, a total of 3,241 lives were lost to insecurity between January and August. data from the Nigeria Security Tracker show.
This is a 69 per cent increase from 1,913 lives that were lost in 2017.
The activities of the terrorist group, Boko Haram and bandits, have resulted in loss of lives and properties.
About N7.31 trillion has been so far spent on security in the last five years, The ICIR found.
In 2017, N1.13 trillion was allocated but 1,931 lives were lost. In 2018, N1.28 trillion was allocated, yet 2, 915 people died due to insecurity.
In 2019, N1.33 trillion was allocated but 3,037 lives were lost. In 2020, N1.70 trillion was allocated, yet 3,235 people died.
In 2021, N1.87 trillion was allocated but 3,241 lives were lost.
Despite the amount already spent, the Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Defence on Armed Forces Support Trust Fund Establishment Bill 2021 Babajimi Benson said “Nigeria ranks very low on global defence spending.”
The Armed Forces Support Trust Fund (Establishment) Bill, 2021, seeks to provide the Armed Forces of Nigeria with more funds for modern weapons and enable them to receive required training.
On August 24, The ICIR reported a terrorist attack that was carried out at the Nigeria Defence Academy (NDA) Afaka, Kaduna State, which saw two officers lose their lives.
President Muhammadu Buhari said the attack was regrettable.
As more lives are being claimed, the fight against insecurity in Nigeria continues to demand more money.I think there are some people who really find fart jokes to be unbearably funny. And I have to admit, I’m one of them. Just crack a simple fart joke and I’ll be doubled over in laughter for minutes on end. However, what I’m not a huge fan of are actual farts (just the ones that stink) and fart bombs. Farts in a Can is also making its way onto my dislike list, because I think it’s just a stink bomb in disguise.

From VeteransToday.com
After months of negotiation, the country’s five big mortgage banks agreed to compensate military homeowners for illegal foreclosures and other violations of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.
Wells Fargo, Ally Financial and Citigroup will pay nearly $117,000 plus interest and lost equity to active military members whose homes were illegally foreclosed upon since 2006. JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America agreed to settlement terms earlier this year for violations of the SCRA, which protects active military from foreclosure, interest rate hikes above a mandated cap and other civil and financial obligations.
Interest Rate Refunds
In addition, Wells, Ally and Citi pledged to hunt for internal violations of the interest rate provision, which limits increases to no more than 6 percent for credit obligations. Any military homeowners who paid interest at a rate above that threshold will be refunded with interest plus triple the amount of the refund, or $500, whichever tallies more.
These institutions also agreed to build training programs to educate employees about the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and how it protects those who serve. The companies also vowed to repair any damage they caused to a homeowner’s credit score.
.”
New Safeguards
New layers of financial protection are also set to emerge from the controversy. Service members will be insulated against foreclosure no matter when they obtained their mortgage provided they received Imminent Danger Pay or were stationed away from home within nine months of the foreclosure.
Any military member required to relocate due to a Permanent Change of Station will be afforded the opportunity to receive a loan modification or a short sale agreement with mandatory deficiency waivers.
Anyone who believes their SCRA rights were violated by these big banks can call the Justice Department at 1-800-896-7743. For other potential violations, contact your nearest Armed Forces Legal Assistance Office.Working from home is highly attractive to a lot of people, and with good reason. You can have all the benefits of a traditional job while being able to skip the commute and work in the comfortable setting of your own home. Or maybe you want to skip traditional employment completely and strike out on your own. Working from home is something that will satisfy that itch, too, especially if you want to build a business around your higher priorities (like family, health, or location independence).
No matter why you want to do it, the only way to start working from home… is to start working from home! You need to land that first work-at-home job, or get that first client, or make that first sale if you’re ever going to get your work-at-home dreams off the ground.
It takes some effort, but finding your first work-at-home job isn’t impossible. Here’s some of my best advice for getting out of the office and into your own work-from-home situation:
Decide what you want to do – and how much you need to make.
One of the most important steps in building a successful livelihood is doing something that you want to do. At the beginning of your work-at-home life, you have the opportunity to go after whatever that may be. Do you love helping people and solving their problems? Go into customer service! Have you always wanted to learn new things and tell others about them? Try freelance writing. Maybe you have fun doing random searches on Google (search engine evaluator!), or you’re a born networker and salesperson (direct seller!).
Whatever you enjoy, make it your priority to find a work-at-home position doing just that. Then – with a nod to pragmatism – list another two positions that you’re good at. Maybe you don’t enjoy them quite as much, but still enough while being able to work from home. This will keep your focus narrowed, but your options open.
You should also decide how much you need to make in wages for the job to be viable. Consider what other members of your household are bringing in financially and what your monthly expenses are. Decide on a number. Once you have, only go after jobs that match your number – or accept that you may need to land more than one home-based job. Don’t forget to make sure the hours-to-pay ratio is healthy enough that you don’t overwork yourself for too little return.
Get online and track down the job you want – avoiding scams along the way.
Now that you have your Top 3, you know exactly what to search for. Head over to your favorite job board or job lead websites, and feed those job descriptions into their search bars. This keeps your search narrow and should prevent you from becoming distracted and lost in a sea of irrelevant or unwanted job listings. On some sites, such as Indeed, you can even set up a recurring search and they’ll email you new listings each day.
This is also the stage at which you should do a scam-check on any possible job leads you consider. Being a regular visitor of sites like mine, Real Ways to Earn, Work at Home Mom Revolution, The Work at Home Woman, The Penny Hoarder, or others will help you recognize and avoid. You don’t want to waste your time chasing bad leads – and you definitely don’t want to surrender any personal info to scammers!

Where to Find Remote Jobs
So, you’ve made the leap! You’ve decided that you’re going to make money online, you’re going to work for yourself, and you’re going to build a work-from-home career on your skills and experience. And then you hit your first challenge: where do you find these legitimate work-at-home jobs? The Internet is an ocean of scams and poor-paying work, and you could burn all your energy just finding worthy (and available) work.
Luckily, you have resources like my blog – and I’ve handpicked some of my favorite places to find work-from-home jobs, just for you.
FlexJobs
This job site is both amazing and subscription-based – and it earns both its reputation and your modest monthly investment. FlexJobs is a job board with a robust search feature that filters out all the bad stuff and only allows the good stuff to be posted. When you search for jobs on FlexJobs, you can be sure the job offers have been vetted for legitimacy. They post opportunities for over 50 industries, from editing and writing to business development and human services to project management and web design. When you search, make sure you use Advanced Search and select “100% Telecommute” to find only work-from-home jobs.
FlexJobs charges a monthly fee of $14.99, but you can absolutely get your money’s worth and leave the site whenever you feel you’ve found enough work and don’t need the job board anymore. They offer Skills Tests you can take so prospective employers can see your qualifications right on your FlexJobs profile. You can set up job alerts to get desired job postings sent to your email every day. And they have a “Job Search Tips & Blog” section that can help you improve everything from your résumé composition to how you interview. This is one job board that really cares about helping you succeed!
Craigslist
“Wait a minute!” I can hear you thinking. Isn’t Craigslist just swimming in scams? It’s true that Craigslist has historically had a bad rap as an Internet free-for-all zone. However, it can actually be a great place to find remote (or local) work opportunities. You just need to have common sense when evaluating the job offers, and make sure you don’t engage in any unsafe behavior, such as meeting someone from Craigslist in person in a private place. Just remember: if a work-from-home job sounds too good to be true, it’s almost definitely a scam.
On the right-hand column of your local Craigslist page, you’ll see a long list of job industries you can investigate. Right underneath that, you’ll find a section called “gigs” that includes all sorts of temporary projects from wedding parties looking for videographers to small businesses that need social media managers. If there aren’t many jobs on offer, you can check a box in the left-hand column to “include nearby areas” in the search as well. Use Craigslist to find one-time clients and turn them into repeat business!
How to Find Remote Jobs on Indeed
Indeed has long been a go-to for all job types, not just finding remote jobs. Because of the wide variety of listings here, you will need to do a little prep work to cut down on the number of irrelevant jobs. I suggest searching a few different ways depending on the type of work you are looking for and also to make sure you aren’t missing any good leads. To start any search, you will need to populate at least one of the search boxes; What and Where.
My first search to find remote jobs is “work from home” in the What box. Use the quotation marks around the term to ensure you are being returned listings that include that search phrase only. If you don’t include the quotes, you may be shown leads that include any of those three terms but not necessarily all of them or all of them in that sequence. Use the quotes. You will still need to reach through the job description carefully as you will occasionally run across a lead that says, “this is not a work from home job” thrown in there.
For your next search, type Remote in the Where box. Again, you will likely be returned quite a few listings to go through. If you are looking for a specific role, you may want to try including those terms in the What box. For example, customer service.
Stack Overflow
Stack Overflow isn’t a job board, it’s a community – the “world’s largest developer community” where web developers, app developers, software developers and others come to learn, share their programming knowledge, and grow their careers. In addition to being a place where you can post your questions or help others with their own, they have a “Developer Jobs” section where you can find developer jobs that they promise are free of fakes or recruiter spam. From this page, you can set up job alerts sorted by keyword and location. (Simply enter “Remote” to see the work-from-home opportunities.)
When you sign up with Stack Overflow and start searching for jobs, they give you the opportunity to create your “Developer Story.” This is a unique way to present your skills, certifications, achievements, and portfolio – everything that would go on a traditional résumé – in a way that more accurately reflects your value and goals. Creating your Developer Story allows Stack Overflow to match you to jobs that fit your profile and interests.
Toptal
Toptal pulled their name from “top talent” because that’s what they’re most interested in – finding the best talent and matching them to companies looking to hire. In fact, Toptal touts that they only work with the top 3% of freelancers in the software development and design, and finance industries.You can rest assured that any jobs offered to you via Toptal are legitimate because those companies or individuals wishing to hire via Toptal must sign up and work extensively with them to be connected with any freelancers. This includes big companies, too! Toptal’s clients include Airbnb and Pfizer, for example.
Toptal is an exclusive network, and you must go through a rigorous application process to join their stable of freelancers. There’s a preliminary Skype interview followed by a timed coding test on Codility. After this, you’ll have another Skype interview where you’ll need to walk them through your coding solutions on the coding tests, and then complete another coding test while the interviewer watches you and reviews your work. Finally, you’ll need to complete a pretty comprehensive coding project to Toptal’s satisfaction before finally being accepted as one of their freelancers. If you make it all the way through, you can look forward to setting your own rate and having access to prime projects.
Freelance Writer’s Den
Freelance Writer’s Den is an elite supportive community specifically for writers looking to launch their own freelance writing career. This one’s entirely membership-based, so you must join to get access to their opportunities and materials. They’re also not always open to adding new members, but you can sign up for an account to be notified when they’re onboarding new members. The membership fee is affordable, and they strive to offer extensive value to match. Many of the leads are exclusive to the site. I’ve also known Carol for years and know she despises low-paying gigs.
They also offer extensive training, a series of modules that teach you the business side of freelancing so you can launch a solid business. If you’re serious about your freelance writing career, Freelance Writer’s Den could be a good investment for you.
Reddit’s tagline is that they’re “the front page of the Internet,” so it should be no surprise that you can actually visit the massive discussion site to find advice regarding remote work, tips on how to land work-from-home jobs, and actual job opportunities. It’s a bit more structured than Craigslist – Redditors (registered members) can upvote and downvote posts on each subreddit (discussion board), so legitimate and popular posts should rise to the top while scams or poor content sink to the bottom. It’s free to register, but be careful – there’s a subreddit for every interest, so you might end up enjoying r/cats when you meant to job search on r/freelance!
If you’re interested in searching the remote job market on Reddit, two subreddits immediately stand out: r/WorkOnline and r/freelance. Make sure to use your common sense here, just as on Craigslist – any job that seems too good to be true usually is. The Freelance subreddit is a particularly good starting point as it offers many related subreddits in its right-hand column to help you continue your search past their page. The r/telecommuting subreddit may be useful as well.
Facebook Groups
There are two ways to find remote work on Facebook: you either go looking for work, or you subscribe to groups that share job opportunities. The first way is the most proactive: get out there and find some clients! Join Facebook Groups that are relevant to the industry you work in (if you’re a writer, look for your subject areas), whether that industry is website design or social media management. Then make yourself useful – engage and network with the people who also visit these groups, and look for organic ways to promote your services when you find someone in need.
For the second method, just search for the job types you’re interested in and there’s probably a Facebook Group for you. Give it a try: “freelance writing jobs” turns up Freelance Writing Jobs, while “web design jobs” results in Web Design and Development Jobs. (Please note that I have not vetted these Facebook Groups – these are just examples of what you can find when searching.) You can also search tags like “programmer needed” or “writers needed” to find individual posts looking for freelancers.
Before you apply, create a cheat sheet.
So, you’ve decided what you want to do and even found several job listings that you’re interested in applying for. That’s great! But before you start filling out those applications, take some time and create a cheat sheet. It requires a little time investment up front, but should streamline the application process for you as you go!
Here’s what you should add to your cheat sheet:
- All the usual résumé information, including dates of previous positions and salary information.
- Your answers to common application questions like “Why would you be a good fit for this position?” or “What do you consider to be your strengths?” Now, it’s true that each of those answers should be geared specifically to the job you’re applying for – but since you already know what kind of positions you’re applying for, you can create a template that you can tweak for each application.
- Some of these work-at-home job listings may request a cover letter – write a good general letter that gives you a framework and that you can later adapt with details for each new application.
You can keep this information in a text file on your computer, and just reference it or copy from it as necessary.
Create Your Resume
Not Getting Hired for a Work-at-Home Job?
A work-at-home job search can take months. If you have been applying for longer than that with no success, there may be a few things you should consider:
1. You aren. Read the job description carefully and follow it to the letter. You may be asked to send your resume to a specific email address. Your subject line may need to be a designated phrase. You may be asked to use a certain phrase in your cover letter. If you aren’t following directions, your application is getting deleted. Guaranteed.
2. You don’t have any work-at-home experience.
This is a discouraging catch-22 for a lot of newcomers, but many companies are looking for prior work-at-home experience. How do you get work-at-home experience if you can’t get a work-at-home job?
What these companies are really looking for is the ability to work independently, accountability and flexibility. Maybe you were in charge of your own schedule at your last job. Maybe you’ve run a successful home business or served on a volunteer committee. Maybe you’ve done some freelance work. Play up your strengths as they relate to the position.
There are also a few companies that welcome those without previous work-at-home experience. While they may pay less and offer few hours, they may be a great place to get something to put on your resume. Some even offer great flexibility in the event you are still working an outside job.

3. You are focusing on job history instead of skills.
As you will hear Brie from FlexJobs tell us in the below video, it’s imperative that you are personalizing each application and resume to the job you are applying to. Mirror the verbiage used in the job description. Use a functional resume as opposed to the traditional chronological resume we’re used to. Connect the dots for your potential employer instead of expecting them to figure out how your previous job and the tasks involved with it make you a good candidate for the job you are now trying to get. Use a skills-based resume and customize it to each industry you are applying to.
Remember: your job is to find a job.
When you’re in need of a job, finding a job is your job – so treat it like one. Make sure you keep yourself on a regular schedule, getting up at the same time every day and not staying up all night. (Unless you’re nocturnal! In which case, you do you, but keep it regular.) Whatever your schedule, stick to it and spend a predetermined amount of time each day job searching. For example, your daily schedule might be: spend an hour networking over coffee, spend the next two hours searching and saving job leads, take a break for lunch, and then spend the afternoon filling out applications for those job leads. After you’re done with applications, spend another hour or so networking.
Whatever you do, don’t blow off your breaks! Humans aren’t wired to be all business, all the time. You don’t want to burn out on the application process, then find yourself struggling in the interview process. Keep yourself focused, but also keep it real.
These are some of my best tips, and should have you finding job leads, shortlisting the ones that work for you, and getting those applications out there like a pro.
FlexJobs recently conducted a webinar for our community. During our 60-minute webinar, we talked about the industries and positions most commonly offering remote work. We also talked about avoiding scams, creating a rockin’ resume and where to find legitimate jobs.
If you missed the webinar, you can watch it below. Make sure you have a pen and paper handy to take notes.

1)The term "Current Pano was Taken on the Floor" is a little vague, does this mean that the camera tripod was placed on the floor? Where else would it be placed, on a stair? What are we looking for here?
2) Average height of camera, I know mine is 5 foot 9 inches from the ground, but if I enter that for two sections within a group the two sections do not scale the same.
3) Is the value in the average height decimal feet or inches?
Hi, Leon.
Sorry for the late reply. It took some time to confirm the answer for your questions. Here are the answers.
1. "Current Pano was Taken on the Floor" implies that pano you are seeing in the app has been taken on the floor. Our processing software tries to detect whether a pano has been taken from a floor based on some assumptions, but it could be incorrect, and you can freely change it to make it right. If this information is not correct, the scale factor calculated using the camera height would be incorrect. For instance, when you captured photos on the uneven floor as a stair, you can turn on this option on the lowest pano so that other panos can be adjusted their height accordingly. You can also change this option by right-clicking a pano and turning on the 'On Floor' option. As you said, it can sound a little vague, we will think out a way to explain it in a better way to make it clear.
2. The initial scale of each section is relative, and once you adjust floor by picking a common point and entering the camera height, the scale will be adjusted automatically. Even though photos were taken in the same place, the initial scale can be different, and as a result, the percent of scale can have a different value. But as long as the dimensions you measure on your 3D tour are the same as the actual dimension, the scale value doesn't mean anything. As you can see in this tutorial video, all three sections have different scale percent. Also, that video will help you understand more about adjusting the scale.
3. It's decimal feet if you set your unit as 'ft.' You can change the unit on the toolbar.

Tapentadol (Paliex™, Nucynta™) is a synthetic opioid agonist and noradrenaline-reuptake inhibitor. Similar to and based upon tramadol, although with much weaker inhibition (by design) of serotonin reuptake.
A. Physiochemistry
- Synthetic analgesic of 'amino-cyclo-hexanol' group.
- Unlike tramadol, prepared as only the (R,R) stereoisomer (weakest opioid activity).
- Oral: 50, 75 & 100 mg immediate release, and 50,100,150 & 200 mg extended release preparations.
- No parenteral preparation is approved for use.
B. Pharmacokinetics
- Dose: 50-200 mg bd/qid for immediate release preparations, 50-200mg bd for extended release.
- approximately double potency of tramadol, similar to oxycodone and between tramadol and morphine.
- Absorption - po (only 32% biov)
- increasing doses have a non-linear effect on increasing peak plasma concentration, thus higher doses result in disproportionately higher Cmax.
- Distribution - ~8 L/kg (higher than tramadol).
- Protein binding - 20% (low!)
- Onset 30 min; Offset 4-6 h
- Metabolism - t½ 4h
- hepatic conjugation with glucuronic acid → glucuronides is main pathway (tapentadol-O-glucuronide); p450 metabolism to N-desmethyl tapentadol and hydroxyl tapentadol.
- No known active metabolites
- 99% excreted in urine, 1% in faecies.
- Clearance - 22 mL/kg/min
C. Pharmacodynamics
- Mech - weak mu agonists (30% of action / 18x less affinity than morphine) ; inhibits NAd reuptake (through indirect activation of post-synaptic alpha-2 adrenoreceptors), activating descending NAd (70%) modulating pain pathways.
- CNS - analgesia, good for neuropathic pain, low(er) incidence of tolerance & dependence, lowers seizure threshold, dizziness, sweating, ⇡ ICP.
- CVS - few CVS effects. Some tachycardia and flushing.
- Resp - little respiratory depression.
- Renal - possible caution in renal failure, although no active metabolites even if 99% renal excreted.
- GIT - Nausea & vomiting (less than tramadol), minimal constipation, more biliary spasm than tramadol.
- SEs - interacts with MAOI (adrenergic storm), SSRIs (serotonin syndrome).
- Although thought to have less abuse potential than other common opioids, it is still classed as a Schedule 2 drug in the US, Schedule 1 in Canada, Class A controlled drug in the UK and S8 in Australia.
- Safety of tapentadol in pregnant, lactating women, and pediatric patients is not yet established.

Tramadol is a synthetic opioid agonist and neurotransmitter-modulating analgesic.
A. Physiochemistry
- Synthetic analgesic of 'amino-cyclo-hexanol' group.
- Racemic mixture of two enantiomers + and -:
- (-) Inhibits NAd reuptake
- (+) Enhances 5HT release, inhibits 5HT reuptake, weak mu (& less kapaa/delta) agonist.
- Oral (50 mg capsules, 100 mg tablets) & parenteral (100 mg/2mL) preparations.
- pKa 9.4
B. Pharmacokinetics
- Dose - 5-10x less potent than morphine: 50-100 mg q6h, max 400-600 mg/day.
- 2-3 mg/kg loading, then 1-2 mg/kg q6h.
- PCA IV tramadol: 20 mg/mL then step down to oral (Prof Schug, Perth: 25-50 mg q1h PCA, using up to 1500 mg/24h).
- analgesic efficacy and potency comparable to pethidine
- Caudal: 2 mg/kg
- Absorption - IV, IM, po (80% biov)
- Distribution - 3 L/kg (80% crosses placenta).
- Protein binding - 20%
- Onset 30 min; Offset 6 h
- peak [plasma] after po: 2h
- Metabolism - t½ 6h (12h in renal impairment);
- 85% p450 (CYP-2D6 - also converts codeine → morphine & metabolises ondansetron!)
- Demethylation to 'O-demethyl-tramadol' (M1) t½ 9h - has some activity as it has 6x greater mu affinity than tramadol. Some consider tramadol a prodrug because of this.
- 90% excreted in urine, 10% in faecies.
- metabolism inhibited by quinidine
- Clearance - 9 mL/kg/min
C. Pharmacodynamics
- Mech - weak mu agonists (30% of action) (very weak kappa & delta); inhibits NAd reuptake (through indirect activation of post-synaptic alpha-2 adrenoreceptors) and stimulates 5HT release, so activates desc NAd and 5HT pathways (70%), modulating pain pathways.
- Naloxone antagonises only 30% tramadol analgesic effect. Ondansetron antagonises a further 30% of tramadol analgesic effect.
- CNS - analgesia, good for neuropathic pain, low(er) incidence of tolerance & dependence, lowers seizure threshold, dizziness, sweating.
- stops shivering?
- CVS - few CVS effects. Some tachycardia and flushing.
- Resp - little respiratory depression.
- Renal - caution in renal failure.
- GIT - Nausea & vomiting (30-40%, like morphine), minimal constipation, minimal biliary spasm.
- SEs - interacts with MAOI, SSRIs.
- Quinidine may decrease efficacy of tramadol by inhibiting CYP-2D6, thus decreasing production of M1. Codeine my compete for the same enzyme with a similar result.
- Carbamazepine induces CYP-2D6 decreasing effect by increasing metabolism.

By Tracie Kenyon, MCU President/CEO
One of the questions that I often hear from board members is, “should we offer our CEO a contract?” Before I answer that question, I need to provide a disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and cannot provide you legal advice; the comments in this blog are my opinion only. In fact, I encourage you to seek counsel from a lawyer prior to entering any contract.
Now, with that out of the way, let me share my thoughts. I think that contracts for CEOs are a good idea for several reasons: 1. You can outline specific deliverables; 2. You can offer benefits not afforded to other employees; 3. You can negotiate a graceful exit by not renewing a contract.
I also believe that a contract can keep things from getting too personal; for example, if the employment contract calls for an annual review and one of the parties is balking, the other party can refer to the agreement. Remember that generally speaking, contracts are negotiated at the beginning of the relationship when both parties are in full agreement and should be seeking their own legal counsel to review the document to ensure that it is fair to all.
If you’re hiring a new CEO, I recommend a one-year contract as a bit of a trial run. At the end of the first year, you can negotiate a longer contract as both parties have had 365 days to get to know each other.
I cannot stress this enough: if you’re considering a contract, please contact your attorney! And, as always, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, I’m happy to share my opinion and experience in working with credit unions across Montana.Bauxite Refining To Aluminum Machine

Today's session was with Chelsey Danielle (i.e. 'Red'), an accomplished multi instrumentalist who plays in several bands and also performs as a solo artist. I met Chelsey during the Pearl Earl session from a few weeks ago, for whom she plays keys and sings. She really liked the layout and vibe of the studio, so we discussed doing some of her own solo stuff and shooting a video for it at the same time.
This turned out to be a great idea, not only because she is a talented songwriter, but also because watching her perform as a solo artist is pretty engaging. She has a rather elaborate setup for her live show, and it entails a number of different instruments all going at the same time, while being looped and overdubbed. Specifically she has a drum machine, several percussion instruments, a keyboard, and her vocal which all go through a small mixer. She then lines out of the mixer and feeds everything to a Boss loop station (the big one!), which then goes out to an amplifier that she uses as a monitor. I took a direct line out of the back of the amplifier so that we captured everything that was going on live as well as everything being looped by the loop station.
It's easy to see where her education as a trained musician comes out: she moved seamlessly between several percussion instruments, keyboards, and vocals, and all of this live and in real-time. This is a lot harder to do than it may look, because if you mess up one little thing rhythmically, the whole house of cards comes crashing down. In other words, you have to listen to that mistake looped over and over again. Needless to say she didn't make any mistakes. We only did two takes and they were both great, but we decided to keep the second one.
Sarah Passon of Mixed Fiction shot the video for it, and I can't wait to see the finished product. When you do see it, rest assured that, like the sessions for Shake Music, this is truly a live performance, there is no studio magic or overdubs on this recording.
Be sure to catch Chelsey performing with Pearl Earl or Helium Queens around the DFW area!
Controversial Nollywood actor Uche Maduagwu has taken a swipe at the Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, over his achievements since he assumed office in 2015.

SCORES× Team Sportstar SHARJAH Last Updated: 25 October, 2021 23:02 IST Mujeeb Ur Rahman of Afghanistan successfully appeals for the LBW of Calum MacLeod of Scotland during the ICC Men's T20 World Cup match between Afghanistan and Scotland at Sharjah Cricket Stadium on October 25, 2021 in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. - Getty Images Team Sportstar SHARJAH Last Updated: 25 October, 2021 23:02 IST Hello and welcome to Sportstar's Highlights of the T20 World Cup 2021 match between Afghanistan and Scotland from Sharjah.Afghanistan beat Scotland by 130 runs. The spin duo of Mujeeb Ur Rahman and Rashid Khan spearheaded a clinical demolition of Scotland, taking 9 wickets between them to skittle out their opposition for 60 in 10.2 overs. It was never going to be an easy chase, after Afghanistan's batters posted 190/4, with the openers laying the foundation in the Powerplay before the middle order, buoyed by Najibullah Zadran's 34-ball 59, carried the momentum through the innings and the death overs. Scotland was off to steady start as openers Kyle Coetzer and George Munsey put on 28 runs in three overs. However, Mujeeb's three strikes in the fourth over triggered a historic batting collapse that led to Scotland registering its lowest-ever T20I total.READ FULL REPORT: Mujeeb, Zadran star in Afghanistan's thumping win over ScotlandSCO 60/10 in 10.2 overs: Rashid continues. OUT! First ball gone and DRS confirms three reds. Davey departs. OUT! Wheal knocked over first ball and that's the match! Scotland is bundled out for 60 as Rashid picks his fourth wicket. SCO 60/8 in 10 overs: Medium-pacer Janat to bowl his first. A breather for Scotland as no wickets fall in the over. Six from it as the batters work the singles. SCO 54/8 in 9 overs: Rashid to attack from the other end. FOUR! Connects the reverse-sweep and it runs fine to the boundary. Another appeal for LBW but it might be going down leg. OUT! Greaves sweeps and misses. Greaves chooses to walk. Unlucky for them as replays confirm impact was outside. Just not Scotland's day today. Sharif takes a single to end the over. SCO 46/1 in 8 overs: Mujeeb continues. Audacious from Greaves as he goes for the reverse-sweep...and misses. FOUR! Overthrows as Mujeeb misses a direct-hit chance. OUT! It's a fifer for Mujeeb. Watt is cleaned up. Single by new batter Davey to end the over. SCO 40/6 in 7 overs: Rashid Khan comes in with his leg-spin. OUT! Misses a straight one and crashes into the pads. The decision stands and Leask departs. SCO 37/5 in 6 overs: Mujeeb continues. SIX! Munsey is waging a lone battle. Full and slog sweeps it over square leg. OUT! It was all short-lived as Mujeeb knocks him over. Greaves goes for the sweep straightaway and misses. SCO 30/4 in 5 overs: Naveen continues. OUT! Cross hangs his bat outside off to get an outside edge and Shahzad dives spectacularly to his right to complete the dismissal. Three dots to end the over and Afghanistan is all over Scotland. SCO 28/3 in 4 overs: Mujeeb continues. OUT! Coetzer plays through the line and misses comprehensively. MacLeod comes in. OUT! Given LBW and MacLeod reviews. Wickets is umpire's call and the decision stands as the ball would have clipped top of leg stump. Mujeeb is on a hat-trick. Berrington to face hat-trick ball. Fends it back with a giant front-foot stride. Doesn't pick it this time and loud LBW but turned down. OUT! Another LBW dismissal and Berrington reviews. It's umpire's call again and Berrington departs. SCO 27/0 in 3 overs: Skipper Coetzer to face his first ball. Driven through point for a couple off Naveen-ul-Haq. Slower one and it keeps low to Coetzer and thuds onto his pad. LBW appeal turned down but Nabi will go up. A wasted review in hindsight. Coetzer shuffled very wide outside off and impact was way outside the stump line. FOUR! Slower one again and smashed down the ground. Beaten on the slower one this time. Coetzer with an usual stump guard, standing outside off stump with almost all three wickets visible. FOUR! Picked up over mid-wicket off a back of length slower ball. SCO 17/0 in 2 overs: Mujeeb with off-spin from the other end. Two dots to begin with. FOUR! Munsey swings it over mid-wicket. Just two more come off it. SCO 11/0 in 1 over: Off-spinner Nabi to left-hander Munsey upfront. FOUR! Reverse-sweeps it fine for a boundary. SIX! Luck favours the brave indeed! Reverse-sweep again and the top edge carries all the way over the rope. Two dots and a single to end the over. THE CHASE BEGINSWill Scotland draw first blood today or will Afghanistan continue its unbeaten run? Let's find out.Scotland now faces an uphill task as it will require over nine and a half an over from the outset against the deadly spin trio of Rashid Khan, Mujeeb Ur Rahman and Mohammad Nabi.A clinical batting performance from the Afghans. A perfect start from the openers set the foundation for the middle-order to continue with the assault en route to a big total. The batters used the crease to good effect, going deep and looking to pierce the shorter boundary regularly. AFG 190/4 in 20 overs: Sharif to bowl the last. Chipped over cover for a couple by Najib. Nabi on strike after a single. FOUR! The skipper goes fine and beats a diving Leask. Najib back on strike. SIX! Full again on the stumps and stand and deliver stuff. Pulverized over long-on and it's a huge one again-- 103m. OUT! Full on the legs and Najib hands it straight to deep point. AFG 176/3 in 19 overs: Davey runs in. Najib whips it away fine for a couple. Single next ball. OUT! Low full-toss outside off and Gurbaz looks to slog it straight down the ground but gets the edge. Flies high and easy catch at mid-off. Single to Najib and it's a thirty-ball 50. Nabi starts off with a four down the ground. A brace to end the over. AFG 166/2 in 18 overs: Watt to bowl out. FOUR! In the slot and struck down the ground by Najib. Smashed to deep extra cover but just a single. And we have a review for LBW as Gurbaz sweeps in front of the stumps and misses the ball. Two reds but it spins away and misses leg stump by quite some distance. SIX! Wide outside off and Najib lifts it over long-off. Single to end the over. AFG 151/2 in 17 overs: Wheal to bowl out. SIX! Gurbaz bludgeons it over long-on. Shuffles to the off to get it in his arc and it's dispatched! A couple of runs down square leg and it is being checked for a short run again and then a run out appeal. A single it will be as Gurbaz fails to plough his bat over the crease again but survives the run out review. SIX! Shuffles again and metes out the same treatment over long-on. Wheal now comes around the wicket. Slogged to square leg for one. A quick single off the nick to end the over. AFG 136/2 in 16 overs: Sharif continues. SIX! Slower one and slighly short and Najib plonks it over long-on and that has travelled 106m! Two dots and a single to end the over and Najib will keep strike. AFG 127/2 in 15 overs: SIX! Davey bowls in the slot and Gurbaz unleashes the helicopter shot to deposit it over mid-wicket. Recovers with three singles off the next three balls. Pulls back his length and then delivers the yorker. Flicked off the pads to deep backward square and a couple for Najib. Okay, it will be a single as Najib fails to put the bat over crease line.

He expects a good batting wicket and looks to replicate his team's performance against the West Indies in the warm-up match where it scored 189 batting first before Nabi's triple strikes restricted the Windies to 133/5. Scotland skipper Kyle Coetzer is happy with the outcome of the toss as he says he would have bowled first in any case.

Her first novel, Strangers on a Train (1950), was adapted into a film by Alfred Hitchcock, and her second novel, The Price of Salt (1952), written under a pseudonym, was more recently adapted by Todd Haynes into the award-winning film Carol (2015). The release of Highsmith’s diaries in 2021 will no doubt arouse more interest in her life and psychology—for Highsmith was, by all accounts, a deeply unpleasant person.
Richard Bradford’s Devils, Lusts, and Strange Desires is the third biography of Highsmith to emerge in recent years, and it is by far the most lurid. As is clear from the very first page, which stopped me in my tracks, this is a biography that relishes in the worst that Highsmith thought, said and did. What is unclear, and on this topic Bradford's analysis is very good, is to what extent the murderous impulses recorded in Highsmith’s diaries were “real” or an imaginative rehearsal for her novels. Bradford suggests that Highsmith embedded as many truths, lies and manipulative games in her diaries as she did in her novels, a strategy possibly designed to frustrate future biographers.
Bradford is primarily interested in drawing connections between Highsmith’s personal life and her psychopathic characters, especially the ones in The Talented Mr. Ripley (1955). Unfortunately, the effect of this parallelism is that the mid-20th-century closeted world of lesbian relationships (of which Highsmith had many) is portrayed as something out of gay pulp fiction. Highsmith’s love life was a roller coaster of attraction, obsession, alcoholism and trauma, but a more nuanced biography would contextualize this toxic brew within the homophobia and misogyny of the time. This is not that biography. Nonetheless, readers looking to immerse themselves in stories of very bad behavior will enjoy this deadly cocktail.This piece originally appeared on Everyday Exiles.
What greater desire do we have in our lives than this: being entirely known, being unconditionally loved, and being accepted for exactly and only who we are?
As humans, we are made with desires, passions, personalities, gifts, and emotions. We are all very different, with unique needs and ways that we operate. But I don’t know many people who wouldn’t be fulfilled by being known, loved, and accepted. I’ve recently been reading up on the Enneagram, finding out my type, and learning about myself and what makes me tick. (If you haven’t done this yet, I highly recommend it!) I have learned that my particular type puts great emphasis on authenticity, and being known/loved/accepted for who I truly am, not who I may or may not project myself to be. (Consciously? Unconsciously? That’s for another post.)
So as a Jesus follower, a wife, a mother, and a person who likes to think she’s a good friend, I try my very hardest to show people that I see them, that they are known. I try to show my love without holding back or waiting until it’s required that I show it. (That’s part of the reason I love giving and getting gifts randomly, not just for birthdays or Christmas – just a “thinking about you” gift.) I try to allow those close to me to fully be themselves… ugly parts, struggles, sins, and all. I know what makes me feel valued in a relationship, and I strive to give that to others. I know that being able to come to a friend in vulnerability and not feel judged is such a blessing in my life, so of course I want to provide that safe space for my people as well.
But why is it so hard sometimes? Why is it often difficult for us to overlook what we could perceive as mistakes, or poor choices, or flaws of another kind? How is it that seeing others as God sees them is still so difficult? We all have been made new – If anyone is in Christ, they are a new creation! (2 Corinthians 5:17) The old – the flesh, the sin, the death – has passed away by the power of Jesus’ blood, and the new – the Holy Spirit, the life! – has come! So how can we take this knowledge and apply it to our view of others?
Remember you are holy. In 1 Peter, Peter quotes Leviticus when he says “for it is written, you are holy, for I am holy”. The rest of that verse in Leviticus says God’s chosen ones are “separated from the peoples, that you should be mine.” We have been set apart to belong to God. WE. BELONG. TO. GOD. All of us. The playing field has been leveled, and we Christians are all in the same kingdom, and we belong to God – and to each other. We need no other reason for loving, encouraging, and accepting each other.
Ask for help. Who does the Bible say is our forever Helper? Holy Spirit. John 14:26: But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you. You guys, I LOVE this. What more could we ask than to have a Helper who will bring to mind all that Jesus taught? This Helper will help us to remember how God sees us, our friends, our families, and even – yes – our “enemies” or those we struggle to know, love, and accept.
Love might just look like tolerance. Ephesians 4:2 says this: Be always humble, gentle, and patient. Show your love by being tolerant with one another. Do your best to preserve the unity which the Spirit gives by the means of the peace that binds you together. The Helper also gives unity! By giving us peace, our Helper binds us together! People who are bound together can live in unity and peace much more easily by truly knowing, loving, and accepting each other.
As many times as we are commanded in the Bible to love one another, it seems we should actually follow it. Yes, it’s tough. But when you have that deep, vulnerable conversation with someone, and at the end, you can tell your listening ear was just what they needed? Oh yeah – it’s worth it.Silvan Widmer, Swiss side and old acquaintance of Italian football, commented a RSI tonight’s match against the Azzurri: “We had a good match.

On Salt Spring Island, where housing has always been scarce, a small, aging hotel is at the centre of a crisis.
Salt Spring Island Community Services desperately needs the 18-room Seabreeze Inne to continue housing the 20 vulnerable people who came out of tents in the bush and off the streets during the pandemic.
But the Island’s only hospital, Lady Minto, wants the Seabreeze to house its staff, as it struggles to fill 31 vacant positions — everything from cleaning staff and cooks to technicians and nurses — on an island where vacant housing is “simply non-existent.”
B.C. Housing has been renting the hotel’s rooms on a three-month basis since the start of COVID, but the deal expires Dec. 31, and Seabreeze owner Bob Ma has decided to sell.
The province has not put in a bid to buy the Seabreeze, as it has done with three hotels in Victoria. So the Lady Minto Hospital Foundation stepped in, offering to purchase the Seabreeze for $4 million to address its urgent need to add staff to help protect its current workforce from “burnout” and keep the hotel as a community housing asset. The hotel’s owner has also considered offers to sell it to hotel operators.
“It’s at a tipping point in terms of staff,” said Roberta Martell, executive director of the Lady Minto Hospital Foundation. “A person ends their shift and there’s no one to take over. Some stay. Some come in on their days off. But there’s burnout and some quit and that should be a concern for everyone on Salt Spring Island.”
The island has a population of about 12,000, which swells by the thousands during the summer season. The hospital also serves surrounding Gulf Islands.
Martell said the sale depends on inspections and approval from the foundation’s membership to pull about $2.5 million from its endowment fund, and a fundraising campaign to raise an equal amount or higher to complete the purchase plus repairs and remodelling. Martell said the foundation waited for Salt Spring Community Services to make the first move to buy. She said it has also extended the potential signing agreement into the middle of February, hoping it will give the province and Community Services time to find alternative spaces.
She said the foundation has been meeting with B.C. Housing, Community Services, politicians and Islands Trust representatives about what role it could play in transitioning the Seabreeze.
Rob Grant, executive director of Salt Spring Community Services, accused B.C. Housing of dropping the ball. “[B.C. Housing] has been aware of this for more than year, ” Grant said. “We knew this was a train wreck coming. They sat on their hands.”
Community Services has had about 20 residents in the Seabreeze for more than a year, paying the owner between $1,200 and $1,600 a month for each room, some with kitchens.
Grant said they expected B.C. Housing to continue to provide shelter spaces, as it did in Victoria when Mayor Lisa Helps declared everyone would be sheltered during the pandemic. “But now it will be back to the streets without housing,” he said.
Salt Spring’s original shelter in Ganges is full with a waiting list.
The Capital Regional District owns land on Drake Road, between an affordable housing development and an elementary school, that islanders say would be a good site for the hospital foundation’s housing plans.
“There is the potential of a win-win situation if the hospital foundation were to consider the CRD property, which is already zoned for multi-family housing and has adequate water supply for over 30 units,” Salt Spring Island resident Hannah Brown said in an email. “This property is better suited to hospital staff housing and can provide more units than the Seabreeze.”
But Martell said the foundation has neither the funds nor expertise in building housing.
B.C. Housing said it recognizes there is a need for safe and secure housing for people at risk of or experiencing homelessness on Salt Spring Island.
“We are currently exploring options and doing our due diligence to determine the most appropriate and cost-effective solution for the community to ensure no one is displaced.”

Lena Dunham has never been one to shy away from standing up for women. Girls is obviously a feminist masterpiece, but that’s not even mentioning Lenny Letter, her book, or any of the other myriad projects that she’s done. Her support of Kesha is a recent example of her standout public persona. But of course there are other examples. In a moment reminiscent of her 2014 Vogue cover controversy, Dunham took to Instagram Monday to call out Tentaciones, a Spanish magazine that put her on its most recent cover. “Oh hello Spanish magazine Tentaciones!” Dunham wrote on her Instagram. .” Dunham’s comfort in her own skin is a hugely and obviously positive message for young women everywhere. She models behavior and thinking that is really exemplary. And we should all take a page out of her book for the way she professionally criticized an unacceptable image of herself. More than many women, she’s in the public eye conspicuously not promoting a haute couture model of female beauty. The magazine trumpets that she's changing the face of feminism. So she, appropriately, told them not to change hers.

Certain plants should not be placed near your septic system because their aggressive root systems can cause damage. It is usually best to avoid large, fast-growing trees, but there are other problematic plants that could pose a danger to your septic tank. Avoid these problematic plants to keep your septic system safe:
- Weeping Willows
- Pussy Willow Shrubs
- Japanese Willow Shrubs
- Aspen Trees
- Lombardy Poplar Trees
- Birch Trees
- Beech Trees
- Elm Trees
- Maple Trees
- American Sweetgum Trees
- Ash Trees
- Tulip Trees
These plants aggressively seek out water wherever they can find it and aren’t picky about the source. Their roots can break into the pipes in your septic system and cause septic system failure. Weeping willow trees are the most notorious examples of this.
Mature Trees
Another danger to your septic tank is large, mature trees in the area. These trees need to be as far away from the septic drain field as they are tall. For example, a 60-foot tree needs to be 60 feet away from the drain field. If you can’t achieve this, you can have root barriers installed.

The Doctor-Patient Breakdown
Trouble at the core of the medical economyDespite middling first quarter results, GMP Securities analyst Martin Landry is sticking to his guns on Canopy Growth Corp. (Canopy Growth Stock Quote, Chart, News: TSX:WEED).
On Monday, Canopy Growth reported its Q1, 2018 results. The company lost $4.44-million on revenue of $15.9-million, a topline bump.
Landry notes that the quarter met his expectations, but fell below the street consensus. The analyst says he is lowering his fiscal 2018 forecasts to reflect recent trends of lower consumption by patients, a shift towards lower-priced Tweed Farm products, and elevated SG&A investment. But the analyst is maintaining his “Buy” rating and one-year price target of $11.00 on Canopy Growth Corp, pointing out that the dominant factor of quarter was the company’s continued investment in its future.
“As expected, Canopy’s Q1 results were somewhat muted, reflecting the transitory period for Mettrum’s facility, consolidation of retail platforms, and limited oil products available for sale,” he says. “The trend in rising OPEX is somewhat concerning, as it is expected to continue thus limiting our visibility as to when the company could begin to generate higher operating leverage. Despite the above, with the new extraction system in place, WEED’s sizable inventories suggest a solid runway for growth in extract sales going forward. Our target is derived from a DCF analysis assuming: (1) a discount rate of 9%, (2) two-stage average revenue growth of 22% and EBITDA margin of 23% (unchanged), and (3) terminal growth of 3%.”
Landry thinks Canopy will generate EBITDA of negative $7.5-million on revenue of $84.9-million in fiscal 2018. He expects those numbers will improve to EBITDA of positive $24.5-million on a topline of $172.9-million the following year.
Comment, teachers were checking everyone’s temperature at the front gates of schools. We also had to rescheduled lunch time to make the cafeteria less crowded. As the virus became more of a problem, my school kept getting cancelled until February 12th, the end of the school year.
Now, my school is going to begin again online on April 8th. It has not been decided when to actually bring students to school. The school does keep giving out homework through the internet.
The virus did not affect my life that much. I just do classes at home and do homework for most of the week. I was a bit happy for the fact that I could sleep a bit longer and have some more time to rest compared to the days when I would go to school.
Our neighborhood is usually very crowded with cars and people, but now there are almost no people or cars outside. Most of the people that do go outside wear masks and try their best not to make contact with others.
I went out on Saturday. There were barely any cars (see photo above).
But there were a lot more people using subways than I thought (see photo above).
There were also many people hiking, so I think that we are slowly tying to return to our normal lives again (before COVID-19 came).

In the past, we’ve seen some fun (and delicious) snacks here like Turkey & Stuffing Tamale and Pork at Pastor Naan Taco. But this year you won’t see them here. Instead, there are four items NEW in the menu of this stand.
Cheerful Mashups House
Let’s take a look at the 2021 menu!

We started with the Esquites Carnitas Mac & Cheese, what features Oaxaca and Cotija cheeses with seasoned puffed rice. There are MANY textures that happen here, so depending on your preferences, you may not like this, even though one of our reporters enjoyed it!

Then we had the Holiday spicy wings, which are served with citrus blueberries. These wings had a STRONG sweet taste of blueberries, and also in a little citrus flavor. The chicken itself was really tasty!

Which snack at the Merry Mashup would you try first? Let us know in the comments.Eight years ago I published a book, The Medici Effect, that examines how and why groundbreaking ideas occur at the intersection of different cultures, industries, and disciplines. The book did quite well — it has been translated into 18 languages at this point, become part of the ongoing innovation dialogue, allowed me to present ideas to executives across the world, and to build a unique consulting firm with clients on six continents. So, not surprisingly, I frequently get asked just how I did it.
In response, I usually tell the following story. Once the book had been written, I had to market it. The obvious targets were people in the field of innovation — those working in strategy, R&D, business development, and entrepreneurship. But there are a lot of thought-leaders competing for the attention of that audience. Around the same time that my book came out, so did at least another 15 new books on innovation. My own publisher, HBS Press, published two the very same month as my book — one of them co-authored by heavyweight Clay Christensen. Just getting noticed in this avalanche of concepts and personalities was a challenge. How could a first-time author — not to mention one only two years out of business school — stand out?
One evening, my fiancée (now wife!) came home from her job as a diversity consultant at JP Morgan Chase. We talked frequently about both my book and her work, but had never really made a connection between them. On this day, though, she had just been asked to describe the “business-case for diversity” for her firm. What, they asked her, was the most powerful argument for promoting diversity — outside of ethical and legal ones? As we talked, she realized that the ideas in my book were exactly what she was looking for.
“You say that diverse perspectives drive innovation — whether those diverse perspectives come from different industries, cultures, fields or gender and so on,” my fiancée told me. That, she suggested, was pretty much the most compelling business case for diversity. “I honestly think people would want to hear about it.” She was right. Before I knew it I was presenting the ideas in my book to Steve Black, who at the time headed up investment banking at JP Morgan Chase.
That single conversation changed everything for me. Suddenly, chief diversity officers in corporations around the US started inviting me to speak to their CEOs on how to drive innovation through diversity. In many cases it dramatically changed how a company thought about both diversity and innovation. And, since innovation was on everyone‘s mind, I was soon also working with chief innovation officers and heads of strategy, business development, and emerging markets — anything that required innovation. The demand for my ideas surged and soon went global. The interest took me completely by surprise.
Then one evening, at a client dinner, a strategy executive sitting next to me leaned over and said, “Your side-door strategy has been nothing short of brilliant.” I honestly had no idea what he was talking about and had to ask him what he meant. “Well,” he said, “instead of going directly to chief innovation officers, heads of strategy or R&D folks, you targeted chief diversity officers,” he told me. “And through them you got to people like me.” He was dead serious. “Your strategy,” he said, “was to knock on the one door that other innovation thinkers did not.”
A side-door strategy, I thought. It even had a name. To an outsider this must, indeed, have seemed like a brilliant approach. I knew better, of course. I would be hard-pressed to call my side-door strategy anything but plain luck. Without the moment of realization between my fiancée and myself I might still be fighting hard to connect with innovation officers through the usual channels — along with hundreds of other authors and thinkers. What had seemed like a brilliant strategy was actually a moment of serendipity.
This realization soon led to another question. What if this was the case everywhere? What if all of the well-planned and well-executed “strategies” people have told us about are really the result of unplanned meetings and encounters, random moments and events, serendipity and plain luck? What if the stories behind companies such as Microsoft or Nokia or Starbucks or the stories behind world-famous authors, index-destroying investors and breakthrough scientists had a lot more to do with randomness than we think? What if success or failure is just one unexpected moment away?
Sure enough, serendipity often is the story. By the end of the ’80s, Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer had realized, through rigorous analysis, that Microsoft needed to abandon its still-struggling new operation system, Windows, because of a memory flaw. They partnered up with IBM to develop OS/2, and decimated the Windows team. But a serendipitous, seemingly insignificant, meeting at a party on the Redmond campus between two people, David Weise and Murray Sargent (a non-employee stopping over en route to Germany) led to a teasing joke. That joke suggested a solution to Windows’ problem, and within the hour Weise and Sargent were sitting down to solve the flaw and fundamentally alter Microsoft’s future. Roughly nine months into Google’s existence, Sergei Brin and Larry Page realized they needed to choose between their company and their PhD work at Stanford. They decided to pursue their doctorates, and offered their search engine to Yahoo for $1 million. Yahoo declined (as did others). Lucky thing, that. And in 2004 Paolo Pellegrini, a VP at the investment bank Lazard Freres, was fired — then took on a low-level position at a hedge fund after a lucky phone call. The desperate-to-prove-himself banker found a chart that showed how the housing market was overpriced. His boss, John Paulson, bet large and made $15 billion in a year. “I love that chart,” Paulson would keep saying — but has proved unable to find more of them..
So be open to serendipity, in your organization and in your life. You can take steps to increase the chances of it, too.. Angry Birds was the game-maker Rovio’s 52nd game. You have probably not heard of their 51 earlier ones. If you tried 52 times at anything you would probably have a decent chance at finding something that helped you stand apart, too!
Your organization, career, even life can change in a single moment. Make sure to seize it.

Is Grammarly How To Run Activate Grammarly Addin For Word From University Of Phoenix truly complimentary?
the complimentary version since um totally free is for me i’m a quite frugal person but in 2015 i did get the possibility to attempt grammarly premium and so i wanted you men to be able to see what it resembled i’m everything about conserving money where i can and i wanted to show you what the premium service looks like so if you’re thinking of just sticking with the free variation you can see what the distinction is and understand all right if i upgraded what would i get if you’re thinking about upgrading you can kind of see what it appears like before you go and invest any of your cash so i’m going to go on and reveal you that walk-through procedure complimentary version however i had the ability to include this chrome extension here where i have the ability to produce a new file so say i’m simply typing along i can just click this button and it’s going to start a new document for me that looks exactly like the last document that i was on um see so it’s incredibly handy and i really like having the plug-in since then when i’m writing e-mails when i’m composing a reaction to something on social networks or perhaps on youtube it’s in fact remedying my grammar i seem like individuals are more forgiving of typos and things on social media they might anticipate that i’m just typing a quick action or maybe on my phone but i feel this extra pressure to make it look good due to the fact that site. I have a respectable grasp on grammar and English guidelines already, huge one as I wished to be as comprehensive as I could.

Is Grammarly really worth it?
You read. Composing software has actually never ever been absolutely correct. The majority of software and apps will get most of the typical mistakes and errors, however anything advanced and you’re on your own.
Grammarly has always gone the extra mile– no matter how advanced the mistake or tip, they’ve got you covered.
I wanted to comprehend why. What makes Grammarly different, and why is it more efficient than other products I’ve tried?
Here are some intriguing facts:.
Grammarly’s co-founders have been dealing with writing software application given that the late 90s, and they launched their first software– Mydropbox– in 2002. In simply 5 years, they had nearly a thousand universities registered.
They concentrated on producing a product that would benefit everyone. Both trainees and specialists with scholastic and formal authors, in addition to casual, daily writers with casual writing.
They have an in-house team of deep learning engineers and computational linguists that are constantly at work tweaking their “good writing” algorithms by studying countless pages from research databases.
Yeah this is very handy where i can just come through here this is um you can simply come through here and click things which i really like now when i utilize the free version perhaps really like that i can go through here and it informs me
A grammarly free trial
why something isn’t ideal um and so that’s one of the things i like here where it’s saying fine like you understand this this is kind of a strange order this sounds a little cool you might reword it this method um or this one where it’s like oh you simply need to include a comma as i mentioned prior to commas are my downfall um so i really very simple right um i can just go through and be like yep delete or nope i want to keep that in um fine so it’s saying i utilize this word too often all best so we do not like that we do not like words that are used too typically unless it’s a really purposeful repeating and then i can constantly reverse which is truly nice yeah so in some cases i i see things that they advise and i’m like no that’s definitely going to change.
the meaning of what i’m attempting to put there so it is still an ai system best it is still learning so that’s why i say do not ever simply accept all you know truly go through and examine everything but this is incredibly useful and i really like the innovative settings in the premium variation whereas prior to like i stated i would maybe see three or 4 also do independent posts on the side maybe you’re trying to do your marketing for your book so possibly you didn’t send your marketing blurb over to your proofreader however you still wish to make sure that looks helpful for your book so i hope that this can really assist you fine so what are your ideas on grammarly have you utilized.
it are you sticking with the complimentary variation are you considering upgrading do not have to that’s totally great if you wish to utilize a various modifying software let me understand and i can check that out too um but i hope you found this informational and handy for you as you’re attempting to weigh this choice of whether to update a grammarly premium or not to assist with your books or.
The level of subtlety that Grammarly can attain is unbelievable, and possibly my favorite part of utilizing this tool. How To Run Activate Grammarly Addin For Word From University Of Phoenix
( Nevertheless, on a technical level, Grammarly is not perfect– as I describe further below. Some of its ideas are wrong, which is why you need to focus and filter out the ones that are incorrect).
While all grammar checkers offer the obvious function of highlighting your mistakes, Grammarly Premium goes above and beyond by in fact teaching you why your errors are wrong.
Inspect out their explanation on sentence fragments:.
Here are simply some of the typical grammar and stylistic suggestions I have actually experienced with Grammarly:.
Best comma positioning (prevent comma splices!).
Word overuse.
Word redundancy (words like “really” and “actually” often include little to no meaning).
Phrase and sentence structure.
Adverb overuse.
Ambiguous modifiers.
Confusion of lie/lay.
Inaccurate or unclear pronouns.
Run-on sentences and wordiness.
Tautologies.
” Could of” instead of “could have”.

Statoil ASA and North American Oil Sands Corporation (NAOSC) announced today.
“Today. Statoil believes that by applying its broad technological competence developed through 30 years of experience on the Norwegian continental shelf, there is a potential for increasing the recoverable reserve base.
A pilot production scheme, the Leismer demonstration project, is currently in its final phase of obtaining regulatory approvals. It will have a capacity of 10,000 barrels of produced bitumen per day and first production is expected late 2009/early 2010. The first phase of the commercial project, Kai Kos Dehseh, is planned to come on stream in 2011, ramping up production to around 100,000 barrels per day in the middle of the next decade. The portfolio is expected to yield more than 200,000 barrels per day.
Note to the editors:
The production of unconventional oil in general and extra heavy oil (EHO) in particular is becoming an increasingly important element of the global liquid production. The Orinoco belt in Venezuela and the Athabasca region in Canada represent the world’s two main resource plays for extra heavy oil. The latter is the largest of three oil sands deposits in Alberta, along with the Peace River and Cold Lake deposits. Statoil has important experience with producing EHO from Venezuela where the group has participated in building and operating upgraders of heavy oil.
The development plans for the acquired NAOSC portfolio call for large scale application of the SAG-D-technology (steam assisted gravity drainage), which gives a much smaller environmental footprint than strip mining.

Alison Eastwood Says Dad Clint, 89, Hates His Birthday: ‘He Just Wants to Work’
He may be up there in age, but Clint Eastwood is still out and about working, and he wants that to be the focus and not his birthday, which he isn’t a fan of according to his daughter Alison.
The actor’s second eldest daughter, 47, attended the Last Chance For Animals’ 35th Anniversary Gala on Saturday, October 19, in Beverly Hills, and talked about her famous father and his 90th birthday arriving in 2020. “He probably won’t even want us to acknowledge it. He hates his birthday,” Alison revealed exclusively to Closer Weekly. “I think ‘cause he’s 90. I think he just wants to work and enjoy his life but I don’t think he wants to celebrate it. He hates his birthday for some reason. We’ve all tried to get him into it but he won’t do it. So we’ll see.”
Aside from Alison, the Oscar-winning director also has 7 more kids: sons Kyle, 51, and Scott, 33, and daughters Laurie, 65, Kimber, 55, Kathryn, 31, Francesca, 26, and Morgan, 22. Clint is also quite the grandfather. “I think he’s a good, he’s a good grandpa,” the actress revealed.
This isn’t the only one of Clint’s kids that has spoken about him in the past. Scott once discussed the best advice that he has learned from his father. “I will say that he tells me to listen. Listen more. Keep my mouth shut,” The Longest Ride star told Closer with a laugh in an exclusive interview at the GEANCO Foundation Hollywood Gala. “I’m pretty good at this.”
Scott added that the Dirty Harry star has also taught him to have “lots of patience.”
All of Clint’s children got together late last year for the premiere of The Mule, mainly because the icon believed it was his final performance as an actor. “Clint knows this might be his last film, and he wanted all of his kids to be there,” an insider told Closer Weekly at the time.
We’re just happy to see how close Clint is with all his children!

EPC = DSanlam has been named the fastest provider to release pension funds to clients looking to switch.
According to specialist retirement adviser My Pension Expert, Sanlam typically releases funds within 13 days of receiving the letter of authorisation, whereas the slowest providers can take up to 62 days longer.
The adviser has ranked what it calls the most consumer friendly firms in its latest Retirement Fairness index, which is based on its clients' experience.
The index compares the time it takes ceding providers to release funds to clients based on letters of authorisation and actual fund transfers.
It looked at funds received between April 1 2017 and June 30 2018, where a pension transfer had been completed.
This amounted to 2,124 cases with an average fund size of £47,456 producing an average annual income of £3,090.56 and a daily income of £8.47.
My Pension Expert warned delays in releasing funds could put people out of pocket.
In its experience Xafinity, now XPS Pensions Group, was the slowest provider to release funds, with an average delay of 62 days when compared with Sanlam.
The adviser calculated Xafinity's delays cost customers an average of £597.68.
But Dave Hodges, head of defined contribution at XPS, said the company was confident it was taking no longer than 20 days to release funds in the majority of cases.
He said: "The full process for an end to end retirement quote and disinvestment should take no longer than 20 days, we are fully satisfied we can and do meet this timeline in the majority of cases. Any additional time taken, i.e. delays, is normally due to essential missing information or delays by third parties.
"We are dedicated to improving member outcomes and are supportive of what this research is trying to achieve in terms of raising standards."
He added: "More widely we think there are really big issues that need addressing such as protecting people from being scammed – we are at the leading edge in this area and will continue to do more to improve member outcomes."
My Pension Expert said it feared if industry attitudes did not change there was nothing stopping the delays from increasing further.
The adviser said it would work with experts to drive change in the sector and fight for consumers to be prioritised by ceding companies.
Andrew Megson, executive chairman of MPE said: "The delays of ceding companies to release funds undermines consumer confidence. This is unacceptable. Why should people suffer financially because some ceding companies refuse to put consumers first?
"MPE refuse to accept that the industry can’t change. This is why we are working with experts to ensure consumers are always prioritised by the financial services industry. In such an uncertain environment, the least we can do is give consumers confidence in their retirement plan."
The providers were ranked in comparison with Sanlam. The cost element represents My Pension Expert's estimates of the cost to the consumer caused by the delay.Issue 5 (2022). Call for paper

A Q&A with Evolve Organic Beauty Founder Laura Rudoe
Evolve Organic Beauty create beautiful, artisan beauty products which are natural, organic and sustainable. Their award-winning range are all handmade using the finest quality ingredients and are not only some of the purest, most natural beauty products that you can find but also give gorgeous results. They recently won an Image Beauty Award for their Superfood 360 Serum and Miracle Mask.
Here we chat to Evolve's trailblazing female founder, Laura Rudoe - a former venture capitalist and an alumni of Harvard Business School - about how Evolve came to be and what sets Evolve apart from other clean beauty brands.
Have you always wanted to run your own business?
I have always enjoyed the freedom of creating my own projects - when I was at university I produced dramatic productions - but it was only when I joined the ethical beauty start up NUDE in 2005 that I realised that desire was a thirst for entrepreneurship. I have been interested in business and ethical business my whole career (I was formerly a Management Consultant, Venture Capitalist and studied business at Harvard Business School) but I didn’t actually set up my business until 2008.
How did the idea for Evolve Organic Beauty begin?
I set up Good Ventures - Evolve’s parent company - in 2008 as an ethical development company with the mission to create new organic personal care brands that make a difference. Having been a founding employee of NUDE skincare I knew a lot about what was involved in setting up a business and how to make beautiful, natural products and wanted to make my own. I'm a passionate advocate of ethical and environmentally friendly business as well as natural and sustainable living so all these elements together led me to creating Evolve.
What was your first product? And how did you go about creating it?
One of our first products was our Daily Apple Hair and Body Wash - which we are actually looking at bringing back as a Limited Edition to celebrate our 10th anniversary later on this year. I was inspired by the saying “an apple a day” and wanted to create a clean, green all over wash for hair and body that could be used by men, women and children. It has a fruity natural apple fragrance and contains soothing organic aloe vera and quinoa proteins for skin and hair conditioning.
Can you tell me more about the ethos behind your brand?
Evolve is all about helping people become a little more green by creating high quality, effective, organic products at affordable prices.
Why is clean and toxin-free so important to you?
We live in a modern world that is full of foreign chemicals and toxins that the body doesn’t understand, that cause inflammation and ultimately disease. I am well aware of the impact clean and healthy wellness can have as I have used these strategies to improve my own health and skin.
Do you have a favourite product(s) in your line?
I genuinely love all our products, but my go-to has always been the Gentle Cleansing Melt - another one of the products that has been in the line-up since the start. Most recently I have been loving our brand-new Climate Veil - it’s a tinted moisturiser with SPF 20 - it has taken me a while to perfect but I’m so happy with the final product.
What sets your brand apart from others?
Our artisans hand make all our products in small batches in our studio in Hertfordshire, this not only ensures the freshness and high quality of the products, but by using people instead of machines, we know that our products have been made with care and love. Every Evolve product has the name of the artisan that made it.
You are keen to practice and promote sustainability. What are the key ways in which you are doing this at Evolve?
We feel very strongly about this and are doing this in so many ways... In all areas of the creation and production of our handcrafted products, we strive to ensure minimum impact on our planet and environment while producing natural and organic products that provide the best results. From the start of our products’ life, we source as many raw ingredients as locally as possible. Those that we cannot find locally are sent to us in powder form where possible to reduce our carbon footprint.
We choose to use recycled packaging wherever possible. Our glass bottles are made from 40% recycled glass and are fully recyclable and we use recycled card for all our cartons. When it comes to plastic, we opt for 75% to 100% recycled post-consumer PET plastic, which (unlike PVC) is fully recyclable and if it is put into landfill, it degrades without leaching any chemicals into the soil. We encourage our customers and our artisans to recycle everything they can, and we’re always on the lookout for new ways in which we can reuse or upcycle our used product packaging. We provide our customers with information on how to properly recycle their Evolve bottles and jars and include a link to find their nearest recycling centre. For the more creative amongst our customers we provide a link to our pinterest board that offers some interesting ideas on how to upcycle their empties.
What are you most proud of?
The Evolve team. They help turn my ideas and plans into real life products that can make a difference to people’s skin - which is why I do what I do.

It’s easy to learn, engaging, it brings people together, encourages people to think and laugh together, it involves creativity and communication, empathy and collaboration. It’s easy to store, easy to take everywhere, well-made, well-packaged, creative fun for everyone who plays it – young, old, young and old together.
After playing and playing Rory’s Story Cubes – with children and adults and younger children and older adults, in living rooms and dining rooms and restaurants and school rooms, we have all come to the same conclusion. It’s a Keeper.
It’s the kind of game that you’ll want to keep, so that you can share it with others.
It’s the kind of game you can make your own.
There are many ways to play it. The package gives us a good sample of some of them. More can be found on the Rory’s Story Cubes website. The best are those that you invent together, with whomever you happen to be playing with. You don’t even have to make a story with them. Maybe you can take turns putting them in order and then explaining to everyone why you organized them that way. Or roll a die and explain to everyone why what you rolled is the most meaningful thing in the universe, and then take turns, each player rolling the another die and explaining why it is even more meaningful than the other. Or, roll three dice and then roll a fourth and explain how that die connects all three. Or, using three dice, take turns making up a story that is as close as you can get to being the opposite interpretation of what the three dice stand for.
In other words, it’s an opportunity for you to create your own games – free-form, open-ended, make-up-your-own-rules-as-you-go-along story-telling fun.
It’s a tool as much as it is a toy. You can introduce it to lighten people’s hearts and get them talking to each other. You can use it to break the tension during a meeting, to change the mood at a games party, to bring people together after dinner, to give people something constructive to do together.
The more people you play it with, the more ways you’ll find to play it. Rory’s Story Cubes is not even a game – it’s an invitation to genuine, creative, shared fun – the kind of fun that feels as good after you finish with it as it did when you were playing.Finance and Business Law

Internships are professional experiences that students participate in to gain professional skills and experiences. Internships are structured as learning experiences that combine in-class theory with real-world applications.Eddie Van Halen was born in the Netherlands in 1957, his brother Alex was born two years earlier in 1955. They, along with their family emigrated to The United States in 1965. They belonged to a musical family and both were trained to become concert pianists. However growing up in California exposed the Van Halen brothers to popular music and soon they wanted to become rock stars. Initially Eddie wanted to play the drums and Alex the guitar; however Eddie’s paper route interfered with his practice and his brother quickly became better on the drums. With his older firmly ahead of him in drumming ability Eddie chose to learn the guitar.
After high school had finished the boys played gigs in and around their home town of Pasadena, CA. It was on this circuit that they meet singer David Lee Roth and bassist Michael Anthony who along with the brothers made up the quartet that would become Van Halen. While playing in a club in L.A., Van Halen was spotted by Gene Simmons. Simmons wanted to produce a demo for the band, but unfortunately the demo flopped and was rejected by all the major studios. However a year later at the same club Van Halen was spotted by a producer from Warner Records. He signed them on the spot and soon after in 1978 Van Halen’s self titled album was released. The band had a string of platinum records until 1985 when rifts in the band forced Roth to leave the band.
However the bands momentum couldn’t be stopped. They quickly signed new singer Sammy Hager and the juggernaut that Van Halen had become, continued.
Hager was with the band for 11 years and this period saw one of the bands albums (5150) go to number one, which was a first for the band. In the late 90’s Hager quit and Roth returned briefly for the release of the bands Best Of album. But time had not healed the wounds and Roth was quickly replaced by Gary Cherone, the former front man for the band Extreme.
It is through the band Van Halen that the musical genius of Eddie Van Halen has been exposed. His wild style electrified audiences and created a legion of guitarists keen to mimic his playing. The most commonly referenced song when people talk about Eddie Van Halen is Eruption. Eruption is well known for its distinctive introduction which includes the most well known example of double handed tapping. This technique involved Eddie using both his right and left had to fret the guitar, and using a tapping motion to make the guitar sound out.
This technique was not new, some players had experimented in the 1950’s but Eddie Van Halen redefined the technique. He added speed, accuracy, distortion and a box full of various effects to the mix creating a style that would become an essential tool of rock guitarists for years to come. Also the popularity of Van Halen’s guitar based, solo laden rock caused many other bands to copy their style. It caused a period in music where nearly all popular rock music displayed some degree of virtuoso soloing. This musical trend has been heavily influenced by Eddie Van Halen’s guitar playing.
And here is a more recent live version of “Eruption” (Seattle, 2007); published by Youtube user TeamDZ:

No matter how many times I’ve heard a band perform live, it’s always a different experience for me when I can just put in my earphones, drown out the world and appreciate the music for what it is. Receiving Subject to Slaughter’s debut EP, Eschatology, last week was no different for me.
Having competed in the Wacken Metal Battle South Africa finals in Johannesburg a few weeks back, Subject to Slaughter has definitely selected the best possible time to release this EP. They’re still fresh in everyone’s minds as W:O:A finalists and great musicians. I was a little concerned before hitting the play button on their “Intro” as I’ve found myself listening to far too many metalcore bands recently who all seem to have the same sound. Well, this melodic djent-core band is anything but just another metalcore band. From start to finish this six track EP displays the guys’ desire to have their own unique sound – and they nail it.
As the “Intro” begins with a quiet melodic tune you can already sense that they’re going to pick up the pace and go into something huge. In “Massacre in Paradise” the boys show off some incredibly impressive guitar skills and the rest of the EP stays on par. Eschatology is very well put together and the mixing by Mike Cubic of 7 String Studios is on point. Well done guys on the release of a great EP, I can’t wait to hear what the five of you bring out next.Home Givenchy Women Clothing Dresses Givenchy Dresses

Freestyle skiers copped two Big Air medals in Chur, Switzerland on Friday as Teal Harle of Campbell River, B.C. took men’s silver and Elena Gaskell of Vernon, B.C. won women’s bronze.
Three Canadians medal as winter sport World Cup action resumes Back to video
Harle completed a triple 1260 safety pulled back from 1440 for 98 points. He was bumped off the top step of the podium by Austria’s Matej Svancer, who scored 99 points. Birk Ruud of Norway finished third with 97.25.
“I feel great. I learned that move last week and hoped I’d be able to land it at this competition,” Harle said.
In women’s action, Gaskell scored 91 points with her first jump of the final round — a switch bio 1080 mute grab — and held the lead until gold medalist Tess Ledeux of France scored 95.25 points in the second run and Sarah Hoefflin of Switzerland grabbed silver with 93.25.
It was the fourth World Cup medal of Gaskell’s freestyle skiing career, which had been derailed for 18 months after knee and wrist injuries required surgery.
“To get back to competing and make it to the podium makes me really proud. I wasn’t expecting it, and it’s such a great motivator for the rest of the Olympic season.”
Megan Oldham of Parry Sound, Ont. finished eighth and Olivia Asselin of Levis, Que. did not advance from the qualifying runs. Max Moffatt of Caldeon, Ont. was fifth, Evan McEachran of Oakville, Ont. ninth and Etienne Geoffroy-Gagnon of Whitehorse 20th in the men’s competition.
SPEED SKATING
Canada’s short track speed skaters emerged with just one medal from Saturday’s finals at the first World Cup of the season in Beijing.

Courtney Sarault of Moncton won a silver medal in the women’s 1500-metres at the Capital Indoor Stadium, which will be the Olympic venue in February 2022. Both Sarault and teammate Kim Boutin of Sherbrooke, Que. advanced to the A final, but Boutin finished fifth after being pushed to the outside of the track by a skater who was penalized for the infraction.
“I definitely wasn’t expecting this today,” said Sarault. “During the warm-up, I was having a bit of difficulty with my boots and my blades. I was going into the races just planning to have fun, to try to make the B Final and to work on what I have to do tactically. I ended up with a silver medal, so I’m proud of myself for overcoming what I didn’t think I could and I’m excited for what is next.”
Sarault was passed by three Korean skaters in the last lap, then two of the them crashed in the final turn and Sarault outstretched American Kristen Santos by .009 seconds at the line. Gold went to Korea’s Yubin Lee.
Boutin had a tough day all around as she was bounced from the 500-metre quarterfinals with a double false start penalty.
The men’s team also had a disappointing start to the Olympic season as Charles Hamelin of Sainte-Julie, Que and Steven Dubois of Lachenaie, Que. wound up in the B final of the 1,500-metres and Jordan Pierre-Gilles of Sherbrooke was the lone Canadian to advance past the quarterfinals in the 500-metres, finishing ninth overall.
In the relay semi-finals, the Canadian women placed third and advanced to the B final while the men were penalized and did not advance.

ALPINE SKIING
Val Grenier kicked off the alpine ski season with a solid seventh-place finish in giant slalom action at Soelden, Austria.
Grenier, a 24-year-old from Ottawa, was 1.85 seconds behind gold medalist Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States, but just .55 seconds from a bronze medal.
Cassidy Gray of Squamish, B.C. and Britt Richardson of Calgary did not get past the qualifying run.
The men’s race goes Sunday with Erik Read of Canmore, Alta., Trevor Philp of Calgary and Riley Seger of North Vancouver in action.
FIGURE SKATING
Nam Nguyen was seventh in an 11-man field after the short program at Skate America in Las Vegas, the first stop on figure skating’s Grand Prix circuit.
Nguyen scored 74.32 points and was 20 points off the pace set by leader Vincent Zhou of the United States. Shoma Uno of Japan was second. The free skate goes Saturday night.
The Canadian team of Evelyn Walsh and Trennt Michaud were eighth and last after the pairs short program.
SUMMER SPORTS
And in summer sport action, Kelsey Mitchell of Sherwood Park, Alta. won Canada’s first medal of the Track World Cycling Championships in Roubaix, France on Saturday. She beat teammate Lauriane Genest of Montreal in the women’s Sprint bronze medal final.
“It was great to be back racing and exciting to have both Lauriane and myself in the finals,” said Mitchell. “It’s never ideal having to race against each other but she raced well and I was happy to walk away with the bronze.”
The women’s Team Pursuit squad placed fourth, while Hugo Barrette finished ninth in the men’s Keirin, his best result at a world championship.
Meanwhile, Molly Simpson of Red Deer, Alta. scored a bronze medal at a BMX World Cup in Sakarya, Turkey.
“It was my first World Cup final and I hit it with a third position so I’m pretty stoked about it,” said Simpson. “I just took it one race at a time and just kept it smooth and it went well. It’s just so awesome. I think I’m going to have a piece of cake at home to celebrate once we’re back at the hotel.”

Let’s try to understand why financial analysts are concerned about investors’ money this year. We’ll assess the main risks facing traders when making investing-related decisions, in order to try and understand how to avoid hazards as much as possible. Remember, though, that even the steps we shall mention here are no guarantee, so if you’re going to trade this year on the markets, do be extra careful.

Topsy turvy markets
In a sense, 2021 might even be rougher on investors than the COVID-19 stricken 2020 was. In 2020, we felt a definite slowdown in almost all trading venues, which made us more cautious with the way we handle our money. In that sense, volatility wasn’t such an issue, since traders were loss-cautious from the minute they understood the impact of the pandemic on economies.
We are entering 2021 with a feeling that all of this is behind us. Mass vaccination is already taking place all around the world, and economies seem to show signs of bouncing back. However, this may just be an illusion since the virus is far from gone – and its economic effects as well. Being too carefree with investments may lead to bigger losses, in the case of another wave of the disease, with new and harsher restrictions.
Scammers
If you like to trade from the comfort of your own home, you surely know by now that the online trading world is filled with bad people, who promise you a lot but disappear with your money when it’s time to deliver. Bitcoin scams are not surprising, as are all the other types of frauds related to online trading.
However, 2021 is projected to be a peak year for the cons. Toward the end of 2020, we saw a surge in the commonness of these activities, due to the fact that a lot of people had turned to investing as a source of income in hard times. You can be sure that the crooks are always improving their methods, making tracking them down more complex. That’s why you should always be wary of them – but you should especially take care this year.
A revolt against Wall Street?
Don’t underestimate the importance of the GameStop short squeeze events, and their possible effects on Wall Street in the future. Reminder: What started out as sort of a spoof on a Reddit feed, when users decided to buy massive amounts of a stock which was dropping (therefore raising its price back) ended up with hedge funds and big investors losing billions of dollars in a matter of days. This is more than just a ploy, drafted by a few tech geeks. It may have started out that way, but it has turned into a full-out protest against the way things are done in Wall Street.
That’s why anyone with a portfolio which includes stocks, indices, or bonds – even if it’s not in large sums – should be concerned. This could easily turn into a routine and a practice of sabotage against stock markets. It’s hard to know when it’s coming and be prepared in advance, so investors need to keep an eye out. This is not a reason to abandon Wall Street, but it is a reason to be extra cautious.
Bottom line
There are enough good reasons to invest with care in 2021. However, this does not mean that investors should keep their money in a safe instead. The markets are going to keep being one of the most prominent investment venues this year. Dangers can be avoided with caution, and consulting experts before moving your money around is never a bad idea.

Trading forex: what new traders need to know
Learn before you invest in ForexSevere and Resistant Infections
We live in world where bacteria are becoming resistant to antibiotics. We can expect this scenario to get worse as even though antibiotic use has gone down in general practice, vast amounts of antibiotics indiscriminately in factory farming and few new antibiotics have been invented. We need to have as many methods as possible to deal with this new threat.
These remedies could save your life (for instance in a new virulent flu epidemic).
Vitamin C
High dose Vitamin C is one of the best ways to deal with serious infections. It needs to be built up to bowel tolerance. This is the dose that gives slightly loose stools and is usually 10-15 grams daily. To be effective the Vitamin C needs to be at 80-90% of bowel tolerance. The easiest form to use is Vitamin C powder dissolved in warm water (see Vitamin C leaflet for full details).
Marik published evidence in 2017 that patients with sepsis in Intensive Care Units given intravenous Vitamin C, thiamine (vitamin B1) and hydrocortisone had a nearly five-fold better survival rate (40.4% compared to 8.5% having standard treatment)1. He then treated a further 150 patients with a 1% mortality (normal for sepsis 30-50%). Dr Klenner has demonstrated vitamin C infusions are effective against a wide variety of viruses including influenza, herpes, polio and hepatitis. Why intravenous Vitamin C isn’t used as a standard therapy for sepsis in hospitals is hard to comprehend.
Iodine
Iodine kills bacteria, viruses, fungi and all known pathogens with no resistance. It is very safe. For acute infections use Lugol’s iodine 12.5% (available from Amazon). The dose is 2 drops in a glass of water every hour until symptoms are easier. (French physician Lugol who developed Lugol’s iodine in 1829 used up 160 drops daily with good results in infections. With long-term high use monitor thyroid function.
Herbal Remedies
Herbalist Harold Gaier needed surgery for a complex displaced fracture of his foot. The surgery went fine but his recovery was complicated by a multidrug-resistant MRSA infection. Antibiotics failed to help him. He had to smuggle two herbal tinctures into the hospital: Goldenseal (hydrastis canadensis) and Barberry (berberis vulgaris). He alternated them, taking 15mls four times daily of one then switching to the same dose of the other the next day. He made a complete recovery in three weeks. Unfortunately he needed further surgery, again complicated by MRSA and again unresponsive to antibiotics. He treated himself a second time with full recovery. He has used this combination successfully in many of his patients with complex infections.
Thymus Extract
Dr Burgstiner, past president of the Medical Association of Georgia and an obstetrician and gynaecologist, developed Hepatitis B after puncturing his finger during an operation. Seven years later he was still ill and unable to practice surgery.
While searching for answers he recalled the principle of using glandular extracts for under-functioning glands such as the thyroid and pancreas. If your thyroid dries up you give thyroxine, if your pancreas dries up you give insulin. He reasoned that as the immune system depends on the thymus gland that taking thymus extract would help.
Dr Burgstiner purchased some thymus extract and a vitamin-mineral complex from his local health food store and began taking them. Six weeks later his blood test for hepatitis was negative. An independent laboratory found these supplements gave a 700% increase in immune system activity. He later found that thymic extract without the vitamin-mineral complex did not have the same effect. He then went on to fine tune his treatment, eventually producing Thymic Formula. He found it arrested many cases of Hepatitis B and C, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and helped with systemic lupus and psoriasis. Thymic extracts usually give a significant improvement within one month.
Ketogenic Diet
Microbes need sugar to survive. Vitamin C and sugar also compete for absorption in bacteria. Sugar can double the number of bacteria within 20 minutes. Sugar and refined carbohydrate (white flour, bread, pasta, white rice, cereals) need to be completely eliminated whilst fighting an infection. This diet effectively starves the microbes out by removing their food. This is a tough diet but can make a real difference in the common scenario where an infection is failing to respond to standard treatment.

March 11, 2009 — Practice recommendations to evaluate and treat common childhood poisonings are reviewed in the March 1 issue of American Family Physician. The review highlights the evaluation and treatment of children younger than 12 years who unintentionally ingest toxins.
"Poison control centers in the United States received more than 2.4 million reports of toxin exposures in 2003," write Tamara McGregor, MD, from the University of Texas Southwestern Family Medicine Residency Program in Dallas, and colleagues. "Most exposures involved oral ingestion (76 percent), occurred in the home (93 percent), and were unintentional (more than 80 percent). Children younger than six years accounted for 51 percent of the exposures. Of these, 38 percent involved children three years or younger."
In the family practice setting, clinicians often have to treat children who have ingested substances, most of which are nontoxic. Therefore, clinicians should have the telephone number of the poison control center available and be familiar with the appropriate initial evaluation of suspected toxin ingestion.
In case of poisoning, initial management must include rapid triage and stabilization of airway, respiration, and circulation, followed by appropriate supportive or toxin-specific treatment as indicated.
Clinicians should be able to recognize and treat significant toxidromes resulting from acetaminophen; anticholinergic agents including antihistamines and psychoactive drugs; anticoagulants such as warfarin or rat poison; cardiac medications including calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and digoxin; muscarinic cholinergic agents including carbamates, some mushrooms, and organophosphates; nicotinic cholinergic agents such as insecticides and nicotine; cyanide; ethylene glycol or methanol from antifreeze or rubbing alcohol; iron-containing products such as deferoxamine; opioids such as morphine, hydrocodone, or methadone; salicylate (aspirin-containing products); sulfonylurea; and sympathomimetic agents such as amphetamines, caffeine, cocaine, or ephedrine.
"If physical examination or laboratory findings suggest a specific toxidrome, the physician should consider toxin-specific treatments, such as an antidote," the review authors write. ."
Initial laboratory testing may include bicarbonate level, electrolytes, serum urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine levels to evaluate for renal failure and electrolyte imbalance; blood glucose levels for hypoglycemic ingestion; electrocardiography for cardiotoxicity; prothrombin time for coagulopathy; pulse oximetry for hypoxia; serum acetaminophen level for acetaminophen toxicity; and urine human chorionic gonadotropin levels in female patients of childbearing age.
Depending on clinical and initial laboratory findings, other tests that may be useful include arterial blood gas or pulse oximetry to evaluate for hypoxemia, creatine kinase for nephrotoxicity or rhabdomyolysis, serum osmolality, specific drug levels (eg, salicylates, iron, digoxin, anticonvulsants, or alcohol), urine drug screen for opioid or street drug ingestion, and urinalysis for nephrotoxicity or renal failure.
Except for the most severe cases, gastric decontamination (eg, activated charcoal and gastric lavage) is no longer routinely recommended. When decontamination is deemed necessary, it should be done with poison control center support. Similarly, the use of ipecac is no longer recommended.
Although a child with few symptoms or a witnessed toxin exposure may be monitored at home, some long-acting medications have delayed toxin effects and require additional surveillance. In addition to enteric-coated or sustained-release preparations, some other toxins have delayed absorption, such as carbamazepine; concretions from iron, meprobamate, aspirin, or theophylline; and diphenoxylate/atropine.
Other toxins have a delayed mechanism of action, including anticoagulants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, sulfonylureas, thyroid hormones, or toxic mushrooms. Delayed toxin effects may also result from toxic metabolites, as is the case with acetaminophen, acetonitrile, dapsone, or toxic alcohols. The toxicity of lithium may also be delayed, requiring additional surveillance after ingestion.
Specific key clinical recommendations for practice, all with level of evidence rating C, are as follows:
• After possible or known toxin ingestion, patients with respiratory, circulatory, or neurologic symptoms should be transported by ambulance to the nearest emergency department.
• When evaluating patients with suspected toxin ingestions, the clinician should document the age and sex of the patient, time and type of probable exposure, and all medications present in the home.
• A child who is asymptomatic at first after suspected toxin ingestion may have ingested a delayed-action medication or other substance and should therefore be monitored for a longer period.
• Gastric lavage is only recommended when performed within 1 hour of the ingestion by a clinician experienced in placing orogastric tubes.
• Except when given within 1 hour of ingestion, the routine use of activated charcoal is discouraged.
• For the treatment of suspected toxin ingestions, syrup of ipecac is no longer recommended.
"Childhood poisonings require supportive treatment, including monitoring and continued observation," the review authors conclude. "Low-risk patients with minimal symptoms, nontoxic ingestions, and no expected sequelae may be discharged to caregivers after a short observation period. High-risk patients (e.g., intentional ingestions, patients who exhibit continued toxidromes or prolonged symptoms) should be admitted to the hospital for ongoing treatment and extended observation."
The review authors have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/7HOU3AU6PJHEFLL5KHZOMKR2WA.jpg)
CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCSC) - South Carolina gas prices rose 5.8 cents per gallon in the past week, now averaging $3.07 per gallon, according to GasBuddy.
That data comes from GasBuddy’s daily survey of 3,028 stations across the state and shows gas prices in South Carolina are up 16.3 cents per gallon higher than one month ago and $1.18 per gallon higher than a year ago.

It’s the highest gas price since Oct. 18, 2013, when the price-per-gallon stood at $3.13.
GasBuddy Head Petroleum Analyst Patrick DeHaan said the price of oil continues to “drag gas prices along for the wild ride, leaving motorists on empty.” He says OPEC is holding back oil production despite strong global oil demand and expects even higher gas prices in the weeks ahead.
“Until several bottlenecks ease, including supply chains and low global inventories of oil, natural gas and coal, we’ll be stuck feeling the pinch of rising oil and gasoline prices,” DeHaan said. “The bad news is that for now, all I see is the upward trend at the pump continuing into the weeks ahead with no sign of relief just yet.”
Gas prices statewide ranged from $2.85 per gallon to $3.62, a range of 77 cents.
As of Monday morning, the lowest price in the Charleston area was $2.85 per gallon at multiple locations in West Ashley.
In Columbia, the average price per gallon was $3.01, up 5.2 cents from the previous week. Gas prices rose eight cents per gallon in the Spartanburg area last week to an average of $3.05 per gallon. And in the Augusta area, where the average is now $3.06 per gallon, gas prices rose 7.1 cents from the previous week.19n

Curated from the collection of gallery owners Mehri and Nasser Hosseini, the exhibition will feature more than 40 works of modern art by seven Iranian artists. It is an assemblage of different generations of artists, all born and raised in Iran during different decades and now based in the United States.
Two of the artists -- architect Farshad Farahi and master of Persian Rug Design Mohammad Darehbaghi -- completed their studies well before Iran's 1979 Revolution, when the country was still ruled by monarch Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. The remaining five artists, which include Bahar Behbahani, Shahla Moghaddam, Baltimore-based painter Fariba Gheisour, and Mohammad Darehbaghi's brothers Mostafa and Morteza Darehbaghi, were each born before 1979, but studied and honed their artistic craft after Iran became an Islamic Republic.
The exhibit's juxtaposition of generations conveys how differently the seven artists have translated their respective experiences, as individuals and as Iranians, into their creative works. "Each artist has a different background and interacts with society in his or her own way," says Hermitage curator Mehri Hosseini. "We put their works together here in order to create a dialogue between them. A visitor can compare them to one another and witness the different generational trends."
The exhibition at the Hermitage Gallery in McLean, Virginia runs through January 31. Here are some vivid examples and descriptions of the artworks on display:
New Invitation by Farshad Farahi
Farshad Farahi, whose work has also been exhibited at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, tends to create multi-dimensional works that delve beneath or push beyond the surface of the canvas, often cutting openings or weaving string and fabric into a painted composition. Mr. Farahi says his artwork is much like his architecture: minimalist and free, with an appreciation for light, depth and open spaces. "I always try to be out of the box. My architecture is the same," the artist says. Adds Ms. Hosseini, the curator: "Farshad wants to break all the rules. He has put all his experiences behind him, and now there is a freedom in his work, that I think is due to his maturity."
Spring by Farshad Farahi
In Susan (below), Shahla Moghaddam uses vibrant mixtures of color to express the intuition and character of the individual being portrayed. Her art is often very feminine and free. "Shahla's work, and its unique use of color, is reminiscent of Andy Warhol's," the Hermitage curator says. "She's broken the image of darkness that had been dictated to her in the past. She paints how she sees herself."
Susan by Shahla Moghaddam
Mohammad Darebaghi's Tears in the Rain, pictured below, is one of several paintings by Mr. Darebaghi reflecting motifs of his background in Tazhib and Persian Rug Design. Intricate details reminiscent of Iranian miniature art, and geometric patterns alluding to the tiles and mosaics decorating Iran's many historical structures appear often in Mr. Darebaghi's paintings. "Think of mosque tiles, but in an abstract way," explains Ms. Hosseini of Hermitage. "He incorporates these themes... but it is modern."

Valentine’s Snowman Craft to accompany “My Snowman’s Valentine” poem by Leland Jacobs – My Snowman’s Valentine
Materials needed: Snowman Template – Snowman Template (one for each family project or student), glue, assorted decorations (stickers, craft sticks, construction paper, etc.), and one copy of “My Snowman’s Valentine” poem by Leland Jacobs (linked above) for each child.
Print the poem for each of your students. Read the poem to your students and have them circle or highlight any letters or sight words that you are working on. The Snowman Template (linked above) can be done in class or sent home as a family project for February. If sending home with your students, remind parents that they do not have to purchase supplies for their snowman, but should look for items at home to decorate it with. It is fun to see how each family works together to make creative and interesting projects. Have the children share their snowmen after they are completed at home or in the classroom.
Cardboard Tube Valentine’s Day Craft
Materials needed: One template for each child –Valentine Heart Man Template, empty cardboard tubes (one for each child), glue sticks, tape, assorted papers/stickers for decorations, and crayons/markers.
Print the template (linked above) to heavy paper. Have the children cut out (assist younger children with scissor skills or pre-cut prior to the activity) all the pieces on the template. The large red rectangle should be wrapped around the cardboard tube and taped in place. The smaller rectangles are for the arms. The children can accordion fold (demonstrate first) or simply cut the arms out and glue to the sides of the tube. The heart hat can either be glued or stapled to the front of the cardboard tube. Let the children use markers, stickers, or other Valentine’s decorations to add facial features and finish decorating their “Heart Man.”
Shaving Cream and Glitter Sensory Play
Target has Valentine vinyl placemats that are great for sensory mats. They are relatively inexpensive $1.99 and large enough to create individual play spaces if you do not have a sensory table at home or at school. The above photo was taken with shaving cream, glitter, and sprinkles. Let the kids sample the texture of the shaving cream first as some children prefer NOT to get messy or become anxious about the activity. Be sure to use unscented shaving cream to avoid any potential allergic reactions to the scented varieties. After the children are familiar with the shaving cream texture, add glitter or sprinkles. Ask the children if they can FEEL the difference after items are added. Let the kids make heart shapes in the shaving cream with Valentine’s cookies cutters or stamps. Other items that are fun to use: silicone basting brushes, large paintbrushes, potato mashers, and nature items.

In its fourth week, the History Channel's "The Bible" miniseries has maintained strong ratings above 10 million viewers, continuing to hold the title of most watched television program from 8 p.m.–10 p.m. on Sunday evenings.
The fourth episode of the 10-part miniseries drew 10.3 million viewers, a slightly softer number than its week three ratings of 10.9 million.
Still, the show managed to successfully tap into the key demographic of 3.4 million viewers ages 18-49.
This past Sunday's episode also received a viewership of 3.9 million for adults ages 25-54.
The miniseries, which was produced by Mark Burnett of "Survivor" fame and Roma Downey of "Touched by an Angel," has managed to hold high ratings since its premiere on March 3, during which the show was viewed by a record-breaking audience of over 13 million, while in its second week it drew 10.8 million viewers.
Some are attributing the slight fall in "The Bible" ratings this week to a recent controversy regarding President Barack Obama, when many took to social media platforms such as Twitter to suggest that the character playing Satan in the third episode of the series bore a striking resemblance to the president.
The producers, as well as the actors of the miniseries dismissed this comparison, arguing that it takes away from the true message being conveyed in "The Bible."
Roma Downey, who plays the character of the Virgin Mary in the series, issued a statement calling the Obama claims "utter nonsense."
"Both Mark and I have nothing but respect and love our President, who is a fellow Christian. False statements such as these are just designed as a foolish distraction to try and discredit the beauty of the story of the Bible," Downey said.
Additionally, Portuguese actor Diogo Morgado, who plays Jesus in the miniseries, laughed off the claims that Satan, played by Moroccan actor Mohamen Mehdi Ouazanni, resembles Obama.
"I don't think that's controversial at all, I think that's so funny," Morgado told The Hollywood Reporter in a previous interview, adding that he believes this recent controversy proves the show's popularity because viewers are choosing to focus on "silly things."
Phil Cooke, a Hollywood filmmaker and media consultant who also carries a Ph.D. in theology, wrote in a recent article for The Huffington Post that the mega-success of the miniseries can be chalked up to three reasons: it's unifying, it's agenda-free, and it manages to not only have good individual plots but also tells "the meta-narrative of God and how he deals with humanity."
"The Bible" miniseries will conclude this Easter Sunday, March 31, with an episode featuring the death, crucifixion, and resurrection of Jesus.Shipping?

On Tuesday came the ruling that sets the December 31, 2023 the final term of duration of the renewals, which with the Budget law for 2019 had instead been extended until 2033 in (umpteenth) violation of Bolkestein directive. Now the executive, already called to order by Brussels, will have to intervene. And, punctually, the trade associations representing the managers of the establishments evoke the specter of thousands of lost jobs. While the leader of the League Matteo Salvini increases the dose by claiming that “i Brussels bureaucrats and their accomplices “- the administrative judges – must” resign themselves “and adding, as usual, that”Italian beaches are not on sale“. Obviously, the mayor of Lecce does not agree Carlo Salvemini, which already in 2020 had refused to apply the extension to 2033, proposing, in fact, only a “technical extension” of three years. Now promoted by the Council of State.
“It’s a judgment of historical significance“, Comments Salvemini,” which does justice not so much to our small administration which in recent years, among many hostilities, has taken on the task of proposing solutions and possible ways out on an issue of such enormous importance, but to all citizens Italians, which are i legitimate owners of the beaches“. For which today the dealers pay, in the vast majority of cases, derisory fees, under 2,500 euros per year. “Everyone, old dealers, young outsiders, businesses, associations, must have the right to be able compete transparently for the management and enhancement of this heritage. Beaches are common goods, to be administered in the interest of the citizens, everyone “. The administrative judges, meeting in plenary session, have in fact established that from 2024 there will be no possibility of further prolongation of the current regime, with the consequence that the sector will be subjected to competition rules in force in the rest of Europe. A peremptory deadline established precisely to stem the continuous slippage of the transposition of the directive Bolkestein which since 2006 plans to compete for beach management.
On the opposite side Antonio Capacchione, president of the Italian Bathing Union adhering to Fipe / Confcommercio, which reserves the right to “read the reasons for the sentence with due attention” but already defines it “disconcerting even before that shocking because it differs from consolidated jurisprudential guidelines, including constitutional ones, to protect company property, work and legal certainty “. The bathing association reserves the right to decide “the initiatives to be undertaken for the protection of tens of thousands of families of honest workers thrown into utter anguish for the prospect of losing their jobs and their assets “. Similar complaints come from Confesercenti Northern Tuscany – according to the president of Versilia Francesco Giannerini “The ruling threw in the despair thousands of families who now see years of hard work and above all investments at risk “- and the president of the seaside resorts of Lido di Camaiore (in Versilia) Marco Daddio, which speaks of “hit from persistence on a sector that employs thousands of families, local workers, and not multinationals of dubious origin ”.
Along the same lines, the Carroccio with Salvini and the undersecretary for agricultural, food and forestry policies Gian Marco Centinaio, according to which “we are facing a sentence that risks annihilate an Italian system made up of SMEs, often family-run, to the benefit of large companies “and” it is difficult to hypothesize which criteria will be followed in 2023, given that this is a sector with over 60 years of history and it certainly cannot be pretended that the previous market never existed. Criteria that without a mapping of the market are impossible to determine “. The Democratic party with Dario Stefano instead he takes a stand in favor of the tender: “Enough delays and enough useless renunciations to give an adequate regulatory response, taking advantage of the more than generous amount of time that the council of state has granted, up to 2023”. Although “this part of the pronunciations is the least convincing because it creates a period of deductible totally creative, perhaps justifiable only as shock absorber“.Goals and Philosophies

This expert should be able to inform you of the best responsive action, and hydro jetting could be a solution they recommend. But what is hydro jetting plumbing?
What is Hydro Jetting?
Hydro jetting is a highly effective way to clean out drains and main sewer lines, removing any clogs or blockages preventing the drainage from flowing as it should. A hydro jet is made up of a large water tank with a hose attached. A kitchen hydro jet blasts water into plumbing drain lines at about 1500 PSI (pounds per square inch), whereas the main sewer line jetter blasts water at about 4000 PSI.
When you get a professional plumber to clean your drainage system with a hydro jet, they will use a special set of jetting nozzles that vary depending on the size of your drain, type of clog you have, and the amount of build-up in your drainage system. Different nozzles are able to contort and control the high-pressure water spray so the water can cut through different types of build-up. The hydro jet is even capable of slicing through tree roots.
How Does Hydro Jetting Work?
So you know what hydro jetting is, but what is hydro jetting a sewer line specifically? What happens during a cleaning?
A professional plumber will feed the nozzle of their jetter into your drain or pipeline where the blockage is. The nozzle will vary depending on your drain size and what material is clogged in your drain, but as it enters and encounters the clog, the high-pressure jet stream tears through the material so it begins dissolving.
The process works by using gravity and high water pressure to help the home’s plumbing system lead the clog out of the home and into the local sewer system. Working from the bottom up, your plumber will insert the nozzle and hose downstream of the clog, moving upstream and cleaning and unclogging as they go. All debris that is dislodged gets moved down the pipes by gravity, flushing safely out of the system.
Whether your clog is a clump of food, thick grease patch, or type of lodged fabric, hydro jetting can get it out. Your plumber must have the expertise to know what amount of water pressure is necessary to handle the job. This varies depending on what type of pipes you have, their condition, and the clog. They may need to deliver as many as 20 gallons of water per minute to clear your blockage.
What Can be Removed with Hydro Jetting?
A great number of plumbing clogs can be solved with hydro jetting, including the following:
- Clogged hair
- Soap residue
- Grease collections
- Food blockages
- Fabric, such as wash cloths
- Dish sponges
Hydro jetting plumbing is even capable of resolving issues where tree root infiltration occurs, as well as mineral build-up in the drains.
How is Hydro Jetting Different from Other Sewer Cleaning Methods?
Hydro jetting is more effective, less disruptive, and often safer than many other sewer cleaning methods. It is more effective at removing larger, more difficult materials contributing to drainage clogs. It is more thorough in clearing out all aspects of a clog, such as grease deposits, whereas other plumbing clearing methods might leave a residue or small chunks behind.
Hydro jets are also longer and more powerful, meaning they can clean longer sections of pipe more effectively. They can also take on bigger blockages better than many other traditional plumbing cleaning methods due to their power. Even though they are more powerful, they are also safer and clear out pipes with far less risk of damage.
Due to the power and process of hydro jetting plumbing, it also cleanses away odor-causing bacteria in the drains. So hydro jetting a sewer line not only serves to clear away clogs, but it also reduces foul smells in your drains.
Signs You Could Benefit From Hydro Jetting
If you are experiencing any of the following problems in your home, you may need hydro jetting:
- Your drains smell bad. A foul odor can indicate a bad clog forming in the drain system. Since the clog captures more and more organic waste, that waste will simply sit and rot in the drain. Sometimes it attracts little fruit flies that gather around the drains in the kitchen and bathrooms. The clog and flies can eventually even attract vermin and become a health hazard to you and your family.
- Slow drainage. If your bathroom and kitchen drain keeps getting slower and slower, then there’s a problem somewhere in the drain. It could simply be a clog, but it could also be tree roots since they often times penetrate the sewer line looking for nutrients in the waste water. It could also be a damaged drain that has caved in due to shifting ground or some other cause, like a burrowing animal. If your toilet won’t drain at all and simply using the plunger doesn’t solve the problem, then you’re dealing with a serious issue. You probably have a clog further in the sewer line.
- Strange sounds. When clogs build-up and water is slow to drain, it can create gurgling and bubbling noises in the drain.
- Standing water. If you have a serious clog, then the water from the drain system will eventually back up. You’ll first notice it in the shower and bath since those drains are closest to the floor. If the problem gets worse, you’ll notice it in the sinks and your toilet, as well.CAMPING FOR GROUPS
We provide our open spaces for scouts and other such groups to camp at the centre. Sleeping in a tent is a great way to really experience the outdoors and our open spaces at the back of the centre make an ideal camp ground, surrounded by the Burren Hills. There is space available for up to 10 large tents with more space left for games or pioneering activities, and it is possible to light a campfire in our fire pit. There are no towns nearby so on a clear night the star gazing is amazing!
Water taps are freely available, access can be provided to toilets, showers and drying room within the centre. We can advise about separating waste for recycling and food waste.
On site facilities include a small orienteering course. We can advise you about local hill walks.
Adventure activities can also be booked through the centreClaire Howard

I was also in the dolors thinking I had no more books left in me, which is a GIGANTIC NEON BILLBOARD SIGN that I’m not thinking clearly and I need to call a time-out for self-care.
On days like that, the best bargain I can make is “just get through today. If you’re still breathing when you go to bed, it’s a win.” When things get truly dire, it’s “just get through the next 60 seconds.” I haven’t had a 60-second day in a long, long while, and gods willing, I won’t ever again. I’ll take the “just getting to bedtime.”
In any case, the sun has risen on another rainy day, and I feel scraped-hollow but mostly at peace. I’m thinking of adding Greek to my daily language rounds, simply because it seems a good way to understand botanical terms. Also, if one is set to learn Latin, one must at least nod to Greek. Or so I’m told. We’ll see if the alphabet breaks me.
So today is for eyeing the next hill. I’m not sure if it’s the vampire smut novella, or if I want to go in a different direction. Someone asked me for a scarecrow moment (oh, you’ll recognize it when you see it) and my very favorite editor is asking me for epic fantasy. Plus there are other things I want to get done, but I’m not in a condition to really make the decision of what to put into the hopper just yet.
I’m taking a page from the transtheoretical model of change, which is just chock-full of useful applications. I’m not deciding what to work on just yet, I’m deciding to decide. Which is a small and very useful distinction, one I wish more people were familiar with. If you don’t know a change/project is possible, if you haven’t even entertained the notion, you’re cut off before you start. Setting aside time to think over possibilities, deciding to decide, is a good thing.
Of course, it’s pouring outside, and I’ve a run to get in. The physical misery will no doubt force me to make a few decisions, most likely accompanied by swearing. At least when it’s raining this hard I might not get bees trying to fly into my mouth.
Small mercies.
5 thoughts on “Deciding to Decide”
Weren’t you just juggling at least three books a few weeks ago? I guess it’s true…feast or famine.
Yeah, I had Love, Bite and the revisions for Afterwar on my plate, and ongoing Roadtrip Z…now two of those are off my plate and the third’s still ongoing but I’ve worked ahead on it. Maybe I’m feeling decompression, too. I’m not myself when I’m not frantically juggling.
That sounds like some sort of horrible eldritch curse…
“I will make their days few and their lands barren. I will send birds to strip the roofs from their houses, and bees to fly into their mouths. Then will they know that My people have My protection.”
Small mercies, indeed.
The bee didn’t DO anything. It just bumbled around and left hurriedly once it realized where it was. As a curse, it’s pretty weak.
Well, maybe the actual curse was directed at the bee, then.The lives of four college friends, as they venture out into the real world- with one friend hiding a dark secret that wreaks havoc on all relationships when the secret is out.

Edith Sitwell and Ottoline Morrell were two English eccentrics pinned to his mood board backstage – the former partial to clothes with a medieval flair, and the latter into Edwardian and Victorian silhouettes. Both women were six feet tall, and knew and entertained each other, and both had donated gifts to the British Museum – hence the location. Both women were out of sync with the fashions of their day, which only stoked Moralıoğlu’s intrigue.
While its silhouettes were carved from the first half of the previous century, Moralıoğlu twisted them out of their prim lines and switched opulent fabrics for “poor” ones, using instead embellishment as his richness factor.

Personal data are being processed in every educational institution, higher education institution and innovative digital education. This processing of personal data includes students, employees and interest groups data. This is especially the case at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences.
Processing of personal data takes place all the time at Metropolia’s Educational activities, RDI activities, in the processing of employee data and all collaborative projects and projects to which Metropolia has embarked. Due to the nature of personal data, the processing of it involves certain statutory obligations. These obligations are called controller obligations.
Therefore, the Privacy Policy of Metropolia has been established, which is approved by senior management and concerns data processing of Metropolia's own staff, students and third parties (including further education and business clients).
Metropolia's data security policy has also been updated in February 2019 and it reflects data protection policy. Both are in comply with the GDPR. Data Security and decisions on information systems reflect on data protection and vice versa.
Both “Metropolia’s data protection policy” and “data security policy” documents are in comply with statutory obligations, based on both EU and national law (such as General Data Protection Regulation “GDPR”, Act on the Protection of Privacy in Working Life, ePrivacy directive, Act on Openness of Government activities, EU’s directive on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies, national Act on the Provision of Digital Services and Act on Information Management in Public Administration).
Metropolia does also apply Finnish Institutions of Higher Education Code of Conduct which is accepted by Finnish Institutions of Higher Education and approved by the Finnish Data Protection Ombudsman’s office. First part of the Code of Conduct, which has been approved by the Data Protection Ombudsman’s office and already published, concerns data protection of study information administration.
Finnish Institutions of Higher Education are working on Code of Conduct for Study Data and Research Data Protection, which both will be ready by 2020-2021. When these are ready, Metropolia starts to apply them.
Legislation on personal data
Please note that English translations from Finnish laws are not official, only Finnish and Swedish versions are legally binding. English translations might not be up to date with the established law in Finnish and Swedish.
EU’s General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR for short has been applied in all EU/EEA member states from 25.5.2018.
Finnish Data Protection Act has been applied from 1.1.2019 and it repealed Personal Data Act. Data Protection Act complements EU’s General Data Protection Regulation.
The Finnish Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman is enacted to be the highest authority overseeing data protection laws in the Data Protection Act. This includes the right to impose an administrative fine on breach of data protection laws described in the GDPR Article 83. The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman has the right to impose an administrative fine to a data controller or data processor up to 20 000 000 euros or four per cent of the annual global revenue of the preceding financial year (applies only to enterprises), whichever of these is greater.
Data Protection Ombudsman Anu Talus or other officials in the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman has the right to carry out inspection visits while carrying out their job, and to ask data controller to present a record on processing activities pursuant to Article 30 of the GDPR.
Act on the Protection of Privacy in Working Life. The act covers key labor privacy issues by creating procedures for working life needs.
The translation of the name of the law is outdated in this case, Information Society Code. The law regulates the confidentiality of electronic communications, direct marketing and privacy.
Act on Openness of Government Activities determines, for example, which personal data can be released from the Authority and to whom.
Act on Information Management in Public Administration regulates and determines from 1.1.2020, for example, common data security requirements for the use of information systems throughout Finnish Public Administration. Risk management requirements are tightened, change management is required to document, log requirements for certain systems enter into force and transition to electronic case management and archiving is enshrined in the Act.
Act on the Provision of Digital Services (doesn’t have an English translation). The Act implements the EU Accessibility Directive in Finland.

These files need to be delivered immediately to 30 of their customers, each of whom is paying the organization for this timely information.
Solution: Normally, when there is a set of automated file transfer actions, all of those actions execute one file after the next (i.e., send file to customer 1, send file to customer 2, send file to customer 3, etc.), which means the last file of the 30 might be transferred much later than the first. Using Enhanced File Transfer™ (EFT™) Enterprise Event Rules the administrator enabled the “parallel file transfer” registry option to automatically deliver this file individually to each of the 30 recipients. When the registry option is enabled, the automated transfers occur in parallel, so that all the customers receive the file at the same time.
Key Benefits
- Met SLAs
- Eliminated problem of incomplete file transfers
- Simplified complicated workflowsA man’s body that was found on Niles Canyon and Palomares roads Sunday has been identified as 26-year-old Max Lopez-Balmes of Fremont.

"He was my best friend we would do everything together," said brother Elias Lopez. "Justice is to find the guys or people who did it."
On Sunday, two hikers noticed Lopez-Balmes’ body near the railroad tracks adjacent to Niles Canyon Road about a mile east of Palomares Road.

EghtesadOnline:. Financial and technology shares dropped the most. Stocks in developed Asia, China, South Korea and Indonesia fell more than 1 percent, while Japanese markets are closed for a holiday, Bloomberg reported.
Investors are paring positions on speculation that equities, recently at multi-year highs amid record-low volatility, may tumble further as tensions escalate. Trump stepped up his campaign of pressure on North Korea, promising a response to any strike against America or its allies. U.S. equities slid the most since May.
"This situation is beginning to develop into this generation’s Cuban Missile crisis moment," Rob Carnell, chief economist for Asia at ING in Singapore, wrote in a note. The only diplomatic outcome that may now satisfy the U.S. is if North Korea abandons its nuclear ambitions, he wrote.
Some still believe that market impact from North Korea’s provocation is likely to be muted as MSCI Asia ex-Japan Index tests a trend line supporting the benchmark since its low in December.
"Historically, the market impact from North Korea’s nuclear provocations has been limited," James Cheo, Investment strategist at Bank of Singapore wrote in a note on Friday. Geopolitics only matter when it induces either growth or an oil shock."

It can be mild or debilitating, sharp or diffuse, last an instant or be a chronic condition. From the development of pain medicines to “the placebo effect”, modern medical science has sought to understand the mechanisms of pain and discover what substances have an active effect on alleviating pain.
Whatever form it takes, when we’re in pain, we seek relief. But how can you be certain of what you need? Are all pain relief medicines the same? There are so many out there. What is the right type for my specific pain? When managing your own health, including pain, start with a conversation with your healthcare provider.
Hunger, lack of sleep, dehydration and lack of exercise can all bring on head pain and a general feeling of malaise. If you are in good health, before you reach for pain medication for a headache, consider remedies such as eating, drinking water, exercise and rest. Still get that occasional ache or pain? Then an over-the-counter medicine may help. But which does what?
There are a few well known painkillers in use in most countries. Among them
Some over-the-counter medicines combine these active pain relief ingredients or put them together with other substances/actives such as caffeine and codeine.
Many people have questions about the side effects of pain medications such as paracetamol and how those pain medicines might interact with other drugs. That’s why it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider and pharmacist and tell them about all medication you’re taking. They can assess your needs and current treatments and provide you with the latest information and guidance on how to take needed drugs safely.
They can answer such questions as
Dealing with a child in pain can sometimes leave you feeling helpless. You want to be sure that any painkiller you give a little one is safe. It’s good to get the latest guidance on which medicines, such as paracetamol, are suitable and effective in babies and children and what dosage should they receive.
Whatever’s on your mind, we can put it right
Let’s use it right.

Following on with our business franchise series at Eden Exchange, we spoke with David Myles, Franchise Support Manager for Gutter Knight, the leading Gutter Guard franchise in Australia. David described his past in the NRL and his involvement in the Gutter Knight franchise. David also discusses Gutter Guard’s point of difference in the industry and what it takes to be a successful franchisee in the sector.
Eden Exchange: Hello David, Thank you for this opportunity. First off, Can you tell us a little about what Gutter Knight is and the services it provides? Notably what is the difference between Gutter Knight and other Gutter based franchises?
David Myles:. Thanks for the invite guys. Gutter Knight is a family owned and operated Gutter Guard company. Our Head Office is based in Brisbane however are currently in 13 locations around Australia and expanding rapidly. Our core business is to supply and install locally manufactured products which keep leaves and debris out of gutters. The greatest point of difference of Gutter Knight and others is the background of Brian Brown and myself. We are not tradesman or previous Gutter Guard installers, we come from a Business Coaching and Consulting background which is very unique in the Franchise industry and a big reason why our Franchisees are so successful.
Our Franchise system and ongoing support/coaching, allows our Franchisees to follow a proven system and process which is not only simple to follow but is very easily scalable while keeping great profit margins. This gives them the freedom and choice to run their businesses in 3 ways depending on their lifestyle and goals. The first option is to do all the work themselves eg make the sale then do the installation. The second option is to outsource all of the work. The third option is a combination of the two. What this means is that while our Franchisees run their own businesses, we are invested in their success therefore throw all of our support and resources behind them to ensure they are building a great business. We are totally upfront with this and our Franchisees love it!
Eden Exchange: Can you tell us a little bit about your professional background and what your current role is in Gutterknight?
David Myles: I’ve always had a head for businesses, even as a kid. My first business was hiding in the bushes on the 7th hole at the Keperra Golf Course and waiting for the golfers to hit the ball in the bushes. I would then find their ball by the time they came down and sell them back to them for 50c. After a while other kids wanted in so I ended up having them go find the golf balls, bring them to me where I would buy them for 20c then go and sell to the golfers for 50c or $1. This was much more than the $2 a week my parents were giving me for pocket money.
I played in the NRL (National Rugby League) from the time I left school until I was 30. Actually if I am honest I was too old and slow by then so they kicked me out! As a player in the NRL I developed a lot of skills which have been integral in this next phase of my life. When I knew my career was coming to an end I started to network more actively with sponsors and other business leaders. After football, I met Brian Brown (no not the actor). Brian is now my business partner and the Founder of Gutter Knight. Brian had a Business Coaching and Consulting company in which I began to work in.
My current role in Gutter Knight is based around supporting our Franchisees with the growth (personal also) of their businesses to ensure they are building a business which can support their personal goals and lifestyle they are wanting for themselves and their families. I also grow the brand as a whole to ensure we continue to gain market share as a group and also attract the RIGHT people into our Gutter Knight team.
Eden Exchange: As the Franchise Support Manager of Gutter Knight, how did you become involved with the Company?
David Myles:. This is a pretty cool story. My bookkeeper at the time came to me while I was Business Coaching and told me of a client of hers who unfortunately had a child with Leukemia, which had forced her to leave her job to look after her child. The husband has a business which was installing Gutter Guard based on the southern end of the Gold Coast. At the time, I had never even heard of Gutter Guard! As a favour and it was the right thing to do, I agreed to help him out to get his business back on track so he could support his family and take some financial stress off them. Within 6 weeks we had the business do its biggest week. By the end of the second month we had just done his record month. By month three, the business had doubled. They were over the moon and he was well and truly on his way to building a great business, which could be flexible enough for them to do what they required to support their child as well as not worry about money.
I had always wanted to franchise a business. I never knew what, however it has always been a goal of mine. I thought about it for a while before discussing it with Brian Brown. We agreed to run a pilot in Brisbane. I then did the right thing and contacted the client who I had assisted with his Gutter Guard business and out of courtesy asked him if he would like to be involved. He politely declined and wished us luck. From there we ran the business as a pilot for 2 years with the view of Franchising when we believed we had the systems and processes down pat so we could duplicate the results. That was 6 years ago now and the business has gone from strength to strength.
Eden Exchange: Has the business exceeded all expectations so far? Can you elaborate on what is involved in creating a business like Gutterknight? What obstacles did you encounter along the way?
David Myles: As far as expectations go from an outside point of view, we are certainly well and truly above where many thought we would be. Within 6 months we were the manufacturers largest local client and with 18 months we were their biggest client nationally which includes Bunnings, Tradelink etc. However internally we always had a belief and knew Gutter Knight would be successful and quickly become a leader in our industry. I don’t mean to come across as arrogant, we just believed in what we were creating and also the Franchisees we have been lucky enough to have come in to the business. Creating the business has been a real journey for us all. It has been one of huge personal growth and development and been a lot of fun. Not to say there hasn’t been obstacles along the way, there certainly has. One of them being my naivety with the complexity, legalities and time required to actually turn a business into a Franchise. This is where I have been blessed to be involved with Brian Brown as he excels in the governance, processes and systems development. This was a real learning curve for me and gave me an appreciation of the process.
Eden Exchange: Australia is considered to experience the harshest climates in the world, wth notable flooding, scorching heat, high wind storms and highly temperamental seasons. How does Australia’s climate and weather patterns impact on your demand and the development of your product?
David Myles: We are constantly looking to improve our products for our customers, it is a core focus to ensure we are always a head of the pack. We have some very exciting new patents coming out which will again boost us ahead of other competitors out there. Weather patterns can play a role throughout the year however this is mainly through awareness of our customers. Storm season for example normally brings with it news reports around maintaining your home, being storm safe etc which draws attention to the customers that they may need to do something with their Gutters. Heavy rain and also bush fires, again through organic news does bring more awareness about the requirement of a Gutter Protection system, however I wouldn’t say it has a large impact on our business. It certainly is a driver at these parts of the year for our Franchisees however we have many other drivers and markets we create ourselves which have a greater impact on our Franchisees’ businesses.
Eden Exchange: According to your website the Gutter Knight business model is based on continuous improvement to product and service. What developments are you focused on in regards to service? And what improvements to product are you considering in the future?
David Myles: Service to our customers is our number one priority. We have the simple philosophy of treating all customers exactly the way you would like to be treated. We believe that starts with communication, gratitude and respect. All of our internal and external systems are designed around these three core values. We are in the business of serving our customers. Without them Gutter Knight would not exist. Because of this, we are constantly surveying clients, updating and refining our processes where required to ensure that every interaction with Gutter Knight from a customer point of view is a positive one. We are also realistic and things go wrong from time to time. When this happens, we do not shy away and rectify whatever we need to ensure a positive outcome for the customer and Gutter Knight. We have some very exciting product improvements coming up later this year with a focus on improving installation time so that our Franchisees and installers can install much more product in a day increasing their capacities and businesses.
Eden Exchange: At the moment you only have a limited number of franchises across Australia. What is Gutterknight looking for in potential franchisees and what personalities work best with the Gutterknight model?
David Myles: Yes, having a limited amount of Franchises available ensures the success of our Franchisees. Our business is not suitable for everyone, we have knocked back people wanting to be involved and will continue to do so if we believe they are not the right people to join the team. Gutter Knight is a people focussed business and has a strong team focus so anyone who comes in must be adding to the group. When the guys on the Sunshine Coast do something good, that affects the guys in Perth and vice versa, it also has the same affect if they do something not so good, therefore finding the right people with the same personal values as Gutter Knight is crucial to us. We are focussed on only bringing 4 to 5 new Franchisees on per year, this allows us to ensure we spend enough time with prospective Franchisees to see if it’s a good fit for both parties and also to give them the training and support they deserve when they come on board. This gives them the foundation to build a sustainable and profitable business. In five years’ time, we will be the known Australia wide by customers, builders, architects as the go to guys for Gutter Protection. I think we will do it in 3.
Coach ability is a key factor. Our best Franchisees have never been on a roof before, some don’t get on now either, however they have extremely profitable businesses all because they were coachable. Honest and ethical, these are core values of Gutter Knight. People who have a desire to better themselves and create a better lifestyle for their families, we are a family owned an operated business and treat each other as such. We are a growth oriented company, both personally and professionally. Team focus, you must be able to work as a team. Together as a group we are much stronger than individuals. We have private online portals which all Franchisees engage in, share stories, have a laugh and also share successes with each other to help in their businesses. We have a vast range of personalities which is great, we have ex corporates, ex footy players, ex photographers, ex miners, ex drafties, ex sales guys all however share the same core values as mentioned here. In short, we have a great group of Franchisees that are all great people and a lot of fun to be around.
Eden Exchange: Thanks David. It has been a pleasure talking to you and we hope to hear from you again soon.

PNG govt inquiry says UK academic's intimidation claims don't stand up
By Richard Ewart on Pacific Beat
The PNG government's Higher Education Secretary says he has found no evidence to support allegations of threats and intimidation targeting the now former vice-chancellor of the University of Natural Resources and Environment in Rabaul.
Following his sudden departure, UK citizen Professor John Warren, wrote to his staff, claiming that a court order was about to be served on him, and after consulting his lawyer, and the British High Commission, he had decided to get out of Papua New Guinea as quickly as possible.

Ok, honest comment… dint read the full post… too tired n too much to do… 😀
My comment— i thot the movie was tooo long n not as aha oho as ppl claimed it was.. some told me- no point in ur being alive if u’ve not seen Avatar yet… i saw it,and am like “ok, the spl effects, blue ppl were good”, but rest of it, sorry doesnt cut it with me!!
You have written well, Vishesh.
Yes, we need action more than just love !!! As you rightly said, the Earth has been and will be here, we are the ones who’ll be damned. Lets awake to reality !!!
Gud review.
I like what u said … its so wonderful if we cn keep the child in us alive forever. And yes, we need to act and nt just react!
Well done, Vichu. Liked your take on this. And, like Aaroo, I too enjoyed the ‘special effects’. But nothing more. It wasn’t a path-breaking movie. I mean, the ‘hero’ – instead of taking the ‘primitives’ along with him into the new world, actually turns regressive, and chooses to continue with the same sort of life? Seems impractical to me. But yes, your message, to rediscover ourselves, is great. Better than the movie, if I may add 🙂
This is a very good review. It is very thoughtful and you have brought out various aspects as to what it means! Great work!! I like it when you said that ” So we should watch out for ourselves.” That is a point that does not usually occur to us, so busy we are in being green! Good point!!
Keep writing such reviews Vishesh!
I liked the movie a lot but many people esp guys didnt like it at all!!
@aarti: where were the special effects? 😛

Living in the right housing makes a huge difference to whether you are able to live independently, socialise with others and enjoy a full and active life for as long as possible. People’s housing needs often change over time, perhaps due to frailty, disability or the need to have others around to support them. The three-storey house with the large garden could well suit the needs of a growing family, but might prove difficult for an older person with mobility problems to maintain or heat. Many young adults with learning disabilities choose to live independently and supported housing helps them to do this. Accessible and adapted housing can help you to maintain your independence, remain in your community and choose how you wish to live your life. Sheltered housing and extra care schemes provide the balance between independence and support. The right home for you is somewhere you feel safe, you can move around easily, and you can live as independently as possible (with some support if needed). Home is somewhere that feels right, where you can be part of the community (if you wish) and can easily reach the services you need, either on foot, by car or on public transport. Homelessness If you are homeless or you are at risk of becoming homeless, your local council has certain legal duties towards you, even where there is no legal duty to provide you with housing.

Chelsea attacker Hakim Ziyech hasn’t received any international call-ups since his infamous fallout with Moroccan national team head coach Vahid Halilhodzic. That trend is seemingly set to continue into the future, with Ziyech unlikely to be called up for next year’s AFCON tournament, scheduled to be held in Cameroon from 9th January to 6th February.
According to Moroccan outlet Al Ahdath Al Maghribia (via Le360), Halilhodzic decided not to call up Ziyech, with his belief that the Chelsea player will not be able to withstand the high heat and humidity that characterize the climate in Cameroon during this period of the year. Halilhodzic also feels that Ziyech’s physical condition is not up to the requisite standard, since he isn’t a starter at the club-level with Chelsea.
Those claims sound preposterous no matter how many times you read them, so of course Ziyech’s omission has nothing to do with those aforementioned reasons, and everything to do with the differences between the player and the manager. The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) will try to act as a peacemaker, and try to persuade Halilhodzic to reconsider his stance.
From a Chelsea perspective, it won’t be the worst thing if those persuasions fail to lead to any fruitful outcome, with extra depth during a busy period all the more helpful (especially with Chelsea set to lose goalkeeper Édouard Mendy to the tournament anyway, as a Senegalese national team representative).

SATURDAY, MAY 30, 1908. FRIENDLY NATIONS. Pea-cehas greater victories than war. and the visit of the President of France to England is of the highest significance. Our Cartoonist hits off the situation beautifully by picturing the moody figure of the supposed spirit of Napoleon surveying England from the cliffs and ruminating on the many changes which have taken place in the history and feel- ings of the two races to make the visit of the President of France in an official capacity to England possible. War is not yet a thing of the past, but there has 1)een a great change in the direction of the arts of peace. The greatest service which a statesman can render his country is not a grand scheme of bluff and grasp which might involve war and misery over the face of a continent but he is re- garded as the great man who can further the peace of nations and bring peoples to a right understanding of each other. The official visit of the President of the French Republic and his reception by the King is a remarkable instance of how far the arts of peace and the power of .a.L- T:1_L_L L_L_ T:" .:J cue c,nienie oetweeu LDglana ana France have proceeded. It formed not only a remarkable demonstration in international cordiality and understand- ing, but of the changing ideas of pomp and power. Republican France was le- ceived on equal terms by Monarchical Britain. Well might the Cartoonist pic- ture the spirit of Napoleon ruminating on the change that has come over the face of Europe since the days of inter- national fear and race hatred, fostered by ideas and systems which have been passed into the lumber-rooms of history, to be regarded as queer illustrations of the slavery of custom and the tyranny of political -and international creeds. The Franco-British Exhibition which haS\ been opened in London is the outward symbol of the friendship which has been established between the twu peoples. President Fallieres rejoices at the change which has overcome the two peoples, and observes that formerly on both sides of the Straits people as a rule thought of landing only to fight." To- day they meet for the purpose of a hand- shake. The King of England to-day spends his holidays in France. Previous Kings of England fought there, whilst the great dream of Napoleon's life was to invade England. The demonstration at Boulogne, the camp; of the Grand Army which was to conquer England, must have recalled the past to the minds of the French people as they gave vent to their enthusiasm at President Fallieres' mission to England. To-day the rivalry is in the warmth of expressions of friendship on the two sides of the Channel, and the profitable rivalry in trade and in mental and commercial attainments. The Franco-British Exhibition should accom- plish and make secure the international cordiality and understanding between the French and British peoples which the King, playing the role of ,peace- maker, so nobly commenced
For many years the Conservative party toyed with promises of Old Age Pensions. The party stands irrevocably committed to the proposal, but nevertheless, now that the Liberal Government has brought forward a scheme as a practical measure upon which there is no going back, the Tory party and all their journals can- not conceal their opposition. It is not an open opposition but a miserable cavil- ling at the Government proposals. The so-called arguments which they use are ridiculous in the extreme, and are too thin to mislead anyone. The pension of five shillings at the age of seventy is criticised as a miserable pittance which is not worthy of serious consideration, and at the same time it is asked where the ruinous sum is to come from to pay them. The logic is like that we once had from Primrose platforms and of the kind we are accustomed to from Tariff Reform speakers. Perhaps the most ridiculous criticism of the old age pension is the statement that the pension of five shillings at the age of seventy will destroy thrift and its incentives among the working classes and other supposed immoral effects are seen. Questions have been asked about the pensions to ex- Cabinet Ministers, and it has been ex- plained that they run from a mere matter of twelve hundred a year to two thousand. There is no suggestion that pensions on this scale have demoralising effects on the recipients. Only the poor with their "five shillings, at the age of seventy, are to be "robbed of incentives to thrift."
The method for getting men out of bed early in the morning by Act of Parlia- ment and pushing on the clock is so generally favoured that there seems to be every prospect of its besoming law. There is nothing said about going to bed earlier, but tired Nature may be left to look after that. Corporations, including- Llandudno, are in favour of the proposal, and have passed official resolutions-- in support. A Colonel in the Territorial Army is eager for the reform because it would give the men more daylight in which to fire off their shots at the ranges. As at present arranged the men have to go straight from theirworkto the ranges, and then evening and twilight come before the firing has been concluded. The new Daylight Bill will bring about a new heaven and a new earth in many departments of life, for it seeks to compel early rising just on the days when it is easy and pleasant. The Daylight Bill is receiving blessings from all sections of the community. All that is needed to be done, after the Bill has become law, is to push on the clocks officially, and the nation receives the extra daylight Sim- plicity could no further go. What an amount of daylight, including energy and health, not unaccompanied by pleasure, the nation has lost simply because some- one did not think of the Daylight Bill before.
The Suffragettes are displaying a strange lack of knowledge of human nature. They expect to be allowed ta break up meetings, silence Liberal can- didates, annoy Ministers and supporters of the Government how and when they will, but they confess their annoyance and make strange allegations when their own little lesson of hooliganism is taken up and turned against Ihemselves. They surely should not complain against their own tactics, which they declare to have been so successful. Their obstruction has led to the making of "martyrs," and yet they object to others running the risks of martyrdom against their own cause. Wales has rapidly learnt the lesson of the Suffragettes and applied it with vigour. The result is that the Suffragettes are refused a hearing in Cardiff, Swansea, and Llanelly. A meet- ing for women only fares no better than an open gathering, for girls are as apt pupils as the boys and men in ringing r;1 r_l bells and drowning speakers. The Premier has expressed his sympathy with the votes for women movement, and Mr Lloyd George is, and has long been, a supporter of the reform, but the Suffragettes single them out for annoy- ance and interruption, whilst they leave alone Tory and Unionist speakers and candidates. The opposition of a section of the Suffragettes and their leaders to Liberalism and the party is now made clear, and they have themselves to thank for the disorderly meetings which have taken place in South Wales. There is no question of freedom of speech in South Wales, the disturbed meetings and the silencingof speakers on the Suffragette platforms are only a passing phase of the game of tit for tat, which is being turned on the opponents of Liberalism who fight under the banner of votes for women.
What is coming over the South Wales local administrative authorities ? Tenby has made itself famous for desiring to ex- clude representatives of the Press from its meetings, and is eager to retain powers of privacy and exclusiveness which are not good for any local ad- ministrative body to possess. Aberyst- wyth, on the otherhand, has distinguished itself in noisy gatherings, in which all the ordinary courtesies of debate have been thrown to the winds. Every topic raised forms a subject for noisy wrangles and personal recriminations, and other public bodies have provided scenes." The Bridgend Board of Guardians' meet- ing was described as a bear garden over a matter of raising the clerk's salary. At a previous meeting extraordinary allegations were made against a section of the members, accusing them of wasting public money in lavish grants of out-door relief. When the proposal for the increase of salary came up the tables were turned upon those who, whilst opposing out-relief to the poor readily supported an increase of salary, and the proceedings became up- roarious. One member asked whether the Board-room was to be made a bear garden, whilst a reverend member con- temptuously denounced the arguments of the other side as rotten." There were statements about being choked down," and accusations of persons who could never take a licking." The busi- ness was continued amidst a good deal of disorder." We live in strenuous times.
On Wednesday afternoon P.C.'s Andrew and Martin found a man in Salubrious-passage, Swansea, in a state of collapse, barely able to tell them that he had in misadventure drunk something from a bottle which must have been poison. He was taken to' the Guild flail and given an emetic, afterwards being conveyed to the hospital. His condition is not regarded as serious.
Natives Sharply Punished CA v ALRY CHARGE. Enemy Appeal for Mercy Nahakki, Monday.—On Sunday the British troops attacked and routed 3,000 Utman Khels, who lost 100 killed. The British casualties were slight.-Reuter. Hadd, Sunday.—To-day dawned with every prospect of a good fight. The Utman Khels, 3,000 in number, were strongly placed on our line of advance. Camp was struck at dawn, and soon the enemy were heard, strongly en- trenched in large numbers, drumming and shouting. Three hundred men of the 57th Rifles were despatched to a lofty hill on the right, entail- ing a long, arduous, and hot climb. to turn the enemy's left flank. The movement being suc- cessfully carriedout, the guns were directed on the central position, where the enemy were seen in large numbers behind sangars on the open plain. They opened fire on both flanks, our guns replying at 12.20. Our very first shot was successful, num- bers of the enemy being seen rushing away to safer cover, their swords gleaming in the sun- light. This evacuation turned a promising fight into a hurried retreat. Our guns heavily shelled the retreating enemy, while the 21st cavalry charged and scattered a party in the open, killing a score of them. Later five Ghozis, who were hiding in a small ruin until our advanced troops passed, open fire on the centre of our column. Their fire was unpleasantly hot until they were sur- rounded. Despite the short range they did little damage. The Utman Khels, who have never pre- viously been punished, lost 100 killed, Our losses were one native killed and nine wounded. The day's operations should have a quieting effect.—Press Association's Special Service. Merciless Punishment. The Times correspondent, in a graphic description of the fight, says that the enemy were found holding a succession of nullahs across the valley, with foot-hills on both flanks. At midday, when all. the dispositions were complete, the British advance began. The enemy at first appeared to disperse, but remained holding the nullahs, and about 3 p.m. we were heavily engaged. The advanced guards of the 53rd Sikhs, however, seized the heads of the nullahs, and the closing of the ac- count with the Utman Khel which dated from 1897 began. Never in a long experience of frontier war- fare, adds the correspondent, have I seen so many tribesmen simultaneously exposed to the merciless lash of shrapnel. Maxim, and maga- zine. They were whipped from, the nullahs to the hillside, and from the hillside to the crest. Incidentally, the 21st Cavalry caught a small posse in the open and sabred them.
ENEMY'S HEAVY LOSSES. Simla, Wednesday.—Before leaving the Am- bahar Mullah and the Utman Khel country General Willcocks destroyed the towns at Gum- bati, the Jirgah having failed to come in. The enemy's losses in the fighting at Kharga are admitted to have included 140 killed, four leading Maliks being among the dead. In consequence of this severe beating ad- ministered to the Utman Khel, Sir James Willcocks marched to the Nullah Killi un- molested, and there was no sniping of the camp on the,25th. The heat is intense, but the spirit of the troops is excellent, and the Army Bearer Corps is doing splendid work. All the wounded are improving.Reuter. Horrible Dust Storm. Nahakki, Wednesday.—A fearful dust storm raged at Nulla yesterday evening, lasting 12 hours. No shelter was obtainable, and officers and troops had a horrible experience. Dinner was impossible, and the beds were full of dirt and horrid insects. We escaped the fury of the storm at dawn, and were glad to proceed. General Sir James Willcocks and General Barrett, who joined yesterday, marched to Yakhdand, destroying towers en route, and then returned here. The tribes have either submitted and paid fines, or were considdered to have been amply punished.-Press Associa- tion Special Telegram.
MACBETH AT CARDIFF. The popularity of Shakespearean plays was again demonstrated on Thursday night by the attendance at the New Theatre,Cardiff,when Mr William Mollison and his excellent company produced Macbeth." The famous tragedy has so often been presented that one might have been excused the thought that the play would not equal as a draw some of the other items in Mr Mollison's repertoire, but Mr Wm. Mollison is perhaps seen at his best in the character of Macbeth. Hia elocutionary powers MissEVELYN McNAYas Lady Macbeth." I in the soliloquies were strikingly displayed. Miss Evelyn McN ay as Lady Macbeth was full of strength and suhtlety. Mr Wm. Calvert gave a fine impersonation of the part of Mac- duff. Mr Harold Neville appeared as Banquo, and Mr Henry Deas as Malcolm, proving capable and clfever exponents. The other members of the company also did their work well. The scenery and effects assisted to make the representation of the tragedy one of the finest ever witnessed in Cardiff.
REFUSED TO LIVE IN." Herbert John Hamm, a window cleaner, of Holton-road, Barrv, sued his former employer, Thomas Cooksley, for JE4 4s in lieu of notice at the local Police Court yestertlay. Mr T. Preece Prichard called plaintiff, who declared that because he refused to go and live in he was told on Mohday thatOie was not wanted. No notice was given him. Cross- examined by Mr J. A. Hughes,- plaintiff de- nied being guilty of any misconduct or neglect, and said he had come late because they used to give and take in the matter of time. Defendant declared that plaintiff had dis- charged himself. In reply to Mr Prichard, he said he did intend to discharge the man if he would not come to live in. After a lengthy hearing the magistrates made an order for the amount claimed with costs, a counter-claim for CA 4s damages for leaving without notice being withdrawn.
WILLING TO MARRY. At Newport yesterday D. Scannell, a young wharf labourer, living in Granville-street, was ordered to pay 3s a week for the support of the child of Maria Morgan. The latter, who is 18 years of age, said she had to go to the workhouse, where the child was born, and de- fendant had visited her there. He had also promised to marry her and had published the banns. Defendant did not appear in court and was unrepresented. Mr Griffiths, warrant officer for the guardians, said defendant had written to him saying that he was willing to marry complainant as soon as he got constant employment.
INDIGESTION IS SLOW STARVA- TION. Food is to the human body what fuel is to a furnace. Without the aid of food the body starves and dies, just as a furnace fire dies, grows cold. when not supplied with fuel. Un- digested food is simply decaying food so long as it lies in the stomach it is fomenting and giving off noxious gases and acid fluids that poison the blood and flow with it all through the system. You cannot be healthy in such a condition. You must surely lack the snap, the energy of mind and muscle, of brain and body, which are necessary to secure success in this age of competition, of strenuous effort in every walk of life. You must keep up with the proces- sion or else fall by the wayside and be lost sight of in the hurly burly for success. When your food fails to supply nourishment through rich red blood, you are being starved in muscle and nerve-starved as truly as the man who has nothing to eat—only yours is slow starvation. Mother Seigel's Syrup, the great remedy for indigestion, has had 40 years of unvarying success all over the world. By aiding the organs of digestion to perform their work naturally, it has given health and cotnfort to millions. We have thousands of letters attest- ing such cures. Here is one from— Mr W. A. Nicholls, of 22, Walpole-road, Clifton Hill, New Cross, London, S.E. Writ- ing January 11th, 1908, Mr Nicholls says :— For a long time I was a martyr to indiges- tion, and feared that it would be n. permanent condition with me but I was quite wrong in that opinion. A course of Mother Seigel's Syrup entirely freed me of my* trouble, and now I am brighter and better in every way." Mother Seigel's Syrup is now also prepared in -Tablet form, and sold under the name of Mother Seigel Syrup Tablets. Price 2s 9d per bottle-one size only. I
r THE CLIFF MURDER. ACircumstantiaf Case. LIFEGUARDSMAN ON TRIAL. The Assize Court at Winchester was crowded on Thursday when John Francis McGuire was placed upon his trial for the murder of Emma Sheriff on the cliffs at Southbourne, near Bournemouth, on the 18th February last. The accused, who is 21, was formerly in the Life Guards. He had been on a visit to Miss Sheriff at Bosr.ombe, and after he was sup- posed to have left the girl mysteriously disap- peared, and her dead body was subsequently found on the Southbourne cliffs. McGuire, who was immediately arrested, alleged that he was in London on the night of the tragedy. The prisoner yesterday maintained the cool and self-possessed demeanour which characterised him throughout the preliminary proceedings at the Police Court and before the Coroner. He entered the dock with a military bearing, and in reply to the charge answered in a loud and firm voice Not guilty." One of the jurymen was challenged by the prisoner, and he left the box. Mr Justice Lawrance was the judge. Mr Radcliffe, K.C., and Mr Raymond Asquith (son of the Prime Minister) prosecuted on behalf of the Treasury. The accused was defended by Mr Hawke and Mr Alabaster. The trial aroused considerable excitement in Winchester and large bodies of police were on duty outside the court to keep back the rush of people who were anxious to gain admission. Mr Radcliffe, in opening the case for the prosecution, said the case was marked by some unusual and peculiar features. The body of the deceased, he explained, was discovered on a cliff 30 feet high and in a very lonely spot with a couple of handkerchiefs forced into her mouth. With the exception of one ring, she had not asingle portable article in her possession, not even a purse or a handbag, although she in- variably wore a fair amount of jewellery. Upon an examination of the body being made, it was found that the whole of the left side had been flattened in, causing considerable internal hemorrhage and shock, from which Miss Sher- iff died. These injuries could not have been self-inflicted they were probably caused by kicks or by pressing of the knee—more likely the latter—and at a time when the victini was in a recumbent position. The manner, in which the death was brought about was unusual, and counsel suggested that the woman must have heen inurdered hy someone who was on sufficiently friendly terms with her that they would both sit down on the bank or something of the kind. The deceased had absolutely no "man acquaintance except the accused. She was a frail, delicate, rather nervous little woman, precise in her habits" and neat in her appearance. Her regard for the prisoner was of a very affectionate char- acter, and their relations were those of at- tached brother and sister. Never from first to last had the couple had any titf or dispute. A CRUCIAL POINT. Counsel then related the circumstances of the prisoner's visit to the deceased, and quoted the letters which passed between them before he went to stay with the girl at Bo;;combe early in February. The correspondence showed that Miss Sheriff addressed the prisoner as My dear Sonny," that she expressed the hope it will be good to be happy once again, and signed herself, Your loving sister, Emmie." Mr Radcliffe expressed to the jury that at the time when the accused was visiting the deceased he must have been in great stress of money, as was shown by the transactions he was having at the time in pictures, and it was obvious that he must. get money somehow or from somewhere. He next drew attention to what happened on the 18th of February, which was the crucial day in connection with the murder. The question was where Macguire was that day. It was clear that he was in London that afternoon, for at 2 o'clock he gave a shoeblack named Wingrove, outside Victoria Station, London, two letters to post. He was also at his lodgings at midnight at Piinlico, London, on that date, and the question was where was lw in the meantime. The prosecution alleged that he left London probably by the 10 past 4 train from Waterloo, that he corn- mitted the murder and returned to London bv the train from Christchurch at 10 minutes to. 9. Soon after 8 o'clock that night he was seen in the neighbourhood of the murder. A conductor of a tramcar had picked him out as the man he believed to have ridden on the car that evening. He was also positively seen by a Mrs Nutter-Scott in the tramcar that evening going in the direction of Christchurch. This lady noticed that he got into the ear breathless, that he was nervous, and was biting his,lips. The prosecution urged that these persons were witnesses of truth, that their testimony must be accepted, and if this were so there was the clearest evidence to support the theory of the prosecution that the prisoner left London in the afternoon, committed the murder, and then returned to town. The time of the arrival and departure of the trains would leave the accused a little over an hour to meet Miss Sheriff and commit the deed. It was true that there was no 1 evidence to show that accused left Christchurch that night, but it Was probable he went over the bridge, and jumped over the railings and caught the London train. The letters were given to Wingrove to post as part of a blind to cover up prisoner's tracks and to make be- lieve that it was impossible for him to have been in Bournemouth that evening, as he must have been in London. There were also certain letters found on the accused when Arrested. Counsel pointed out as an extraordinary peculiarity that the jewellery which the de- ceased invariably wore should have been truss- ing when the body was found, and that after- wards it should have been discovered in various places in Miss Sheriff's dwelling, but not where she was in the habit of keeping it. The only pei-son who had an opportunity of getting this jewellery, and a motive for putting it back, was the prisoner. Counsel's opening statement occupied nearly two hours. Overcome by Heat. The hot rays of the sun were very trying to the constables on duty outside the court. During the luncheon interval one of the men was affected apparently with sunstroke, and, falling against a wall sustained a nasty scalp wound. Upon the Court resuming, evidence was given by P.C. Ayres, of Boscombe, who des- cribed the condition of Miss Sheriff's clothes when he made the examination. The officer was being examined with the view of showing that it was a case of outrage when he fainted in the witness-box. Water was given to him, and in the course of a few moments he recovered and continued his evi- dence. He said that it was the fact that an- other lady was missed at this spot a day after Miss Sheriff's body was found. Her hat was found, but the body had not been recovered. Evidence was given by Dr. Simmons, a local practitioner, who stated that the deceased had been subjected to very serious injuries, and death was caused by shock. Counsel Was there any sign of outrage or of attempted outrage ? Witness No. none whatever. Dr. Pepper, the Home Office expert, said death was caused by shock and hemorrhage, which had been produced by violence. The injury was not self-inflicted, and could not have been caused by accident. It was prob ably due to injury caused by the knees. He thought the body was dragged some distance. The case was adjourned. The trial of John France McGuire for the murder of Miss Sheriff was resumed at Win- chester yesterday, before Mr Justice Law- rence. A cordon of police was drawn up out- side the Assize hall to keep back the large crowds which sought admission. The prisoner entered the dock in an unconcerned manner. He glanced cheerfully round the court, and then sat down to listen to the evidence. The first witness to enter the box was Miss Lily Hatchjwho is in servient Boscombe, and was a great friend of the deceased. She stated that she saw Miss Sheriff on Monday evening, February 7th. She made a statement, and appeared very worried. The witness did not, however, give reasons for the deceased's worry to the jury, as it was not admissible from the legal point of view. Witness said she saw Miss Sheriff again the next morning, and that night she left her home for the last time. Miss Hatch related seeing prisoner at Bournemouth the day after deceased was missed. There was nothing unusual in his demeanour. In the course of conversation he said he slept at the Salisbury Hotel, Boscombe, on the Monday night, and didn't see Emma on the Tuesday. The witness told the Corrt that deceased generally wore jewellery, and she thought it improbable that she would have gone out on the fatal night without wearing the trinkets to which she was accustomed. Miss Royce, another intimate acquaintance of deceased, also told the jury that Miss Sheriff was in the habit of wearing a gold watch and chain. She was a very precise girl, and also put her jewellery into. the proper jewellery boxes. She told how excited she and the other acquaintances of the deceased were when it was discovered on the Wednesday that the girl was missing. The prisoner arrived at the girl's lodgings that afternoon, and expressed surprise that she was missing, and at once went round to the police station and the hospital to make en- quiries about her. The -witness had known Miss Sheriff for some .years, but had never known her have anything to do with any man except McGuire. She was very unsociable as regarded men. After Miss Sheriff was missing witness was with Mrs McGuire, the mother of prisoner,, deceased's lodgings in Palmerston-road, Bos- combe, when Mrs McGuire handed her letters which, she stated, wore of no importance. The witness burnt them. In cross examination Miss Royce said the letters were given her by Mrs McGuire quite openly. Witness did not know by whom they were written, but she was at liberty to have looked at the letters if she had thought pro- per, there was no secret about them. Miss Sheriff invariably wore a brooch or something. She was aware that one of the brooches was still missing. Detective-Sergeant Smith, of the Metropoli- tan police, deposed to what happened when he arrested the accused at his lodgings in Den- bigh-street, Pimlico, on Friday, February 21st. Witness told prisoner that he was arresting him on suspicion of having caused the death of Miss Sheriff. McGuire replied," I heard about it to-day. A friend wired me from ] Boscombe and I saw it in this afternoon's papers. 1 have just come hack from Cannon street. I last saw her on Monday, and left her ) in Palmerston-road after we had been for a walk. She is more like a sister to me. I left Bournemouth on Monday evening and have not been back since. I should like to write to my young lady at Rochester." When at the police station witness searched the accused. He- found on him 31d and some pawn tickets. On searching McGuire's lodg- ings the same night witness came across a large number of documents and some evening newspapers. Answering Mr Hawke, for the defence, Smith said he was quite sure the prisoner stated he had not been back to Bournemouth since he left on the Monday. My Hawke: I suppose you know as a matter of fact that he was in Bournemouth on the Wednesday and left his name and address with the police. Witness said he believed that was so, but it was not within his personal knowledge. Detective West, of the Bournemouth Police, told the Court that at McGuire's lodgings he discovered about 50 pawntickets and con- tracts, which since October 31st showed a face value of a little over JE70. At the station he was formally charged, and was told by West that it had come to his knowledge that prisoner was at Bournemouth on the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday in the week of the murder. McGuire made no reply. The prisoner was then taken to Bournemouth and charged again. He did not reply. In the prisoner's possession there were found a couple of letters dated from Denbigh- street on the previous Monday night. They were sealed but not etamped. One was to Miss Sheriff, and stated" I have arrived quite safely hope you and mother enjoyed yourselves this afternoon. Give mother my love. I shall be looking for a letter from you, dear. No more from your loving brother Frank." The other letter was to his mother, saying that he had arrived all right and expressing the hope that she would continue to improve in health. Mr Hawke, in the course of a very brief cross examination, elicited from wit- ness that none of the pawntickets related to Miss Sheriff's jewellery. Evidence was next given by the police, show ing that the jewellery which was at first miss- ing, was found in Miss Sheriff's lodgings a few days after the murder. Some was in the sitting- room and some in the bedroom, which in the meantime had been used by Mrs McGuirs and Miss Royce, and was formerly occupied by prisoner. A portion of the jewellery was found in a box under a bed, and there were also 16s in money there. The lost key of Miss Sheriff's bedroom was also found lying on the floor of this bedroom about a week after the date of the tragedy. It was also stated by the police that a de- scription was given to them of an unkempt man who was found suspiciously lounging about Southbourne on the Sunday after the murder. Enquiries had been made, nut no such dangerous-looking individual had been brought to their notice. FATHER OF McGUIRE'S SWEETHEART. Henry Hayman, a Rochester picture-dealer, who became acquainted with accused a couple of years ago, then gave evidence. He said McGuire was formerly engaged to his daughter. That lady had missed a couple of her brace- lets, and prisoner wrote her that he had taken them as a surprise to have her name engraved on them. Subsequently, however, they were faund pledged in London.
Church Commission. A VEIN OF PLEASANTRY. WESTMINSTER, Thursday. Is co-operation in religious matters really possible between Anglicans and Nonconfor- mists in Wales to-dayWe heard this question discu^ed from many points of view this morn- ing, and Mr D. M. Richards, of Aberdare, who was in the chair, very fairly and lucidly de- scribed the Nonconformist attitude. The question was introduced by the Lord Justice, and from some remarks which he dropped it is anticipated the chairman in his report will suggest, as one way of promoting such co-operation, the abolition of the legal barriers which now prevent a clergyman of the Established Church from appearing in a Non- conformist pulpit, This, however, would be merely playing with the difficulty that exists, In the Principality the objection, as the wit- ness emphasised, is to the Establishment. Towards the Church of England as a spiritual force Nonconformists entertain the heartiest goodwill. The Archdeacon is slow to believe this, a.nd he led "us to infer that Wehh clergymen re- ^ardi-he opposition of Free Churchmen to a State Church as an attack upon the clergy. The witness, amidst some laughter, clinched matters by inviting the Archdeacon to occupy the pulpit at the Congregational Church in Aberdare of which he is a deacon, and the Archdeacon asked whether, if he did so, he would be allowed to don his surplice and ob- serve the Church of England ritual. Well, that would be a strange sort of service to some jf us," responded tne witness, who a little sarlier bad sagely remarked, It takes two to co-operate." 1 There must be give and take, and co-opera- fcion does not coi^aist, as Anglican leaders seem to think, in the fulfilment of an ancient prophecy of the bees returning to the hive. The onus of co-operation, declared the Rev. Morgan Gibbon, lies with the Church of Eng- land. And then the subject was dropped. After many delays and difficulties the Con- gregationalists' evidence is now nearly com- j pleted. The Rev. Eynon Lewis, who to-day < gave the official statistics, is the third witness J who has appeared on behalf of that denomina- tion, and in the case of all three the proofs offered were materially cut down by the chair- ] man. Mr Lewis, for instance, to-day offered statistics relating to the Welsh churches of the denomination in England, but these being clearly outside the terms of reference were rejected. Unlike all other religious bodies, the Congre- Rationalists have submitted statistics for 1306, the reason given to-day being that the schedules for 1905, the year oelected by the Commission, are not available. At first sight it would seem that the Congregationalists would reap an advantage by taking this course, for their figures would behefi from the normal annual increase but the probability is, having regard to the reaction following the revival, that the Congregationalists will lose more than they will gain by not adhering to the original year. The Congregationalists appear to have ex- perienced quite exceptional difficulties in com- piling their figures, and they were to-day sub- jected to some severe tests. On the whole, however, the conclusion come 1 to is that the figures submitted very fairly represent the position of the Congregational churches in the country. Mr D. A. Thomas, M.P., spent some hours at the inquiry to-day, being specially interested in the evidence of the Aberdare witness.
CARDIFF PUBLIC WORKS. The Battle of the Bridge. Cardiff Public WorksCommittee onThursday decided, subject to the Council adopting the suggestion of the Finance Committee, that Mr Harpur should prrceed with the plans for the new Monthermer-road Bridge with all speed. The mover, Councillor Morgan Thomas, understood that, as far as Lord Bute was concerned, the matter was closed. Councillor Chappell: 1 am sure that the people of Cardiff would not think that it was corrupt, in view of the General Election, for the Sute to do what is morally rhht, even if not legally binding—that is to support the committee. Councillor Mander (presiding) I rule Councillor Chappell: Why should he go scot free ? Councillor Mander Are you coming in the chair, or am I to be chairman ? Councillor Chappell Here's a man going to get Councillor Mander made vigorous uae of his hammer in the endeavour to call Councillor Chappell to order, and was eventually success- ful. It will be remembered that at the last meet- ing of the Finance Committee a communica- tion was received from Lord Bute declining to give the Corporation any financial assistance in carrying out the improvement. The Finance Committee recommended that the work be proceeded with, and this is subject to confir- mation by the Council. Broadway Improvement. It was reported to the Committee that the relaying of Broadway from Clifton- street to Fox-street would cost £4,847. The Chairman, asking the opinion of the Committee as to whether the work should be let out by contract or executed by the (Corporation, said that when the latter carried out the Clifton-street improvements a memorial was received from the tradesmen in that thoroughfare thanking the department for the expeditious way in which the work had been done. It was pointed out that considera- tion had been given to shopkeepers' wishes. It was decided to adopt the report of the Sub- Committee recommending that Mr Harpur (City Engineer) carry out the work, the actual asphalting being done by a French firm.
SATAN REBUKING SIN, St. Petersburg, Friday.—Commenting on King Edward's impending visit, the Russ- kveznamya," the chief organ of the Union of Russian People, says that the traditional enemy of Russian people is sending its Monarch to Russia in order to secure a rearguard for India, where warlike tribes, headed by Afghanistan, are struggling for liberty against the oppression and exploitation of England. The journal repudiates the idea of any kind of alliance with Great Britain, which it describes as a deceiver and abuser of confidence, using the simpletons among the nations as lemons to squeeze and discard.— Reuter.

IIj. mil.. — — Hyne the Bigamist. SEQUEL TO SENSATIONAL CASE. At Bristol Police Court on Thursday W. Gur- ney Winter, 8, Argyle Mansions, Cricklewood, L. E. Sayer, Holmsley Crescent-road, New Barnet, and Claud Taylor, editor of the Weekly Dispatch." were charged with con- spiracy to pervert the course of law and justice in connection with the trial of Arthur Hyne, who is now undergoing a sentence of seven years, for bigamy, running concurrently with five years for matrimonial frauds. Mr B. R. Vachell prosecuted on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Muir represented Taylor. and Mr James defended Winter. Mr Vachell referred to various articles pub- lished in the Weekly Dispatch contempo- rarily with the record of the Police Court proceedings against Hyne, who was arrested in November and charged with fraud. He ab- sconded and was rearrested in January, being brought before Sir George White on the 17th, and again on the 21st, when very short state- ments were made by the prosecuting solicitor. On January 19th the Dispatch published articles with big headlines —" Charge of mar- riage frauds. Remarkable accusations against a mysterious dentist. No triflers wanted." A good deal of the story was given in the paper before the evidence in court, and the people responsible for the paper seemed, as early as January 19th. to have placed the case in the category of what was called matrimonial frauds. In the same issue appeared an article entitled the Modern Blue Beard," and refer- ring to the notorious bigamist Wltzhoff. Mr Vachell said that Winter, who was a solicitor, telegraphed to Hyne stating that he had been instructed to defend him, but it had never transpired from whom his instructions came. If the editor of the paper were not too scrupulous, by engaging a solicitor, he could obtain copy, even if it was not to the advantage of the defence. Mr Muir stated that Winter was never, directly or indirectly, connected with the paper. Mr Vachell referred to other articles which appeared whilst the case was in pro- gress, speaking particularly of one at the time of the trial, headed Notorious bigamist committed for trial." There was no evidence to justify that. Mr Vachell also alleged tbatRayer,who was a casual journalist, obtained admission to the prison as Winter's clerk, and had access to the prison and every- body concerned. Mrs Hyne (or Westen) entrusted photo- graphs and letters of Hyne to Winter to realise money, but on the understanding that they were not to be used until after the trial, but the photographs appeared in the Dispatch before. When taxed on the subject Winter and Sayer denied it. Mrs Hyne also pawned a ring, which Sayer redeemed to sell to raise money for the defence. He told her that the ring was not worth more than it was pawned for. Mrs Westen had been unable to recover the ring or obtain any further advances. Mr Holmes Gore, Magistrates' Clerk, gave evidence as to the police court history of the Hyne case. Mr Tyrrell, trom the Bristol Town Clerk's office, also gave evidence, saying that Winter introduced Sayer to him as managing clerk. At one hearing Winter complained that prisoner had been prejudiced by the extraor- dinary statements made by the London and provincial press. Mr James asked why his client was charged with conspiracy on January 19th, when he was not at court between November and January 24th. Mr James expressed a desire to have one of Mr Tyrrell's replies entered, but the clerk said it was not evidence. Mr Winter They never will take down any- thing in my favour in this court. Witness said one article appeared in the Dispatch before Winter came to the court. Permission was granted Winter to examine in place of Mr James. A telegraph official produced the original tele- grams sent by Winter to Hyne at Horfield Gaol, and also sent to Sayer from the Leices- ter-square branch, demanding the return of the ring to Alice Bell, failing which proceedings were threatened. Winter denied all knowledge of a third telegram. The head warder at Horfield said Winter in- troduced Sayer as managing clerk. He pro- duced the record of their visits. Evidence was given of Winters and Savers' visits to Horfield Gaol, and an officer from the Sheriff's Court, Aberdeen, produced a docu- ment of the Court sfeowihg a claim by a woman named Peters or King against Lewis blater, alias Hyne, alias Leader, alias Westen. Witness was shown a statement of the case quoted by the" Dispatch," and said reporters would have access to such statements written by pursuer through solicitors. The case was then adjourned. Mr Winter, at the outset yesterday, said his solicitor, Mr James, was unable to represent him owing to important business in London. He claimed the Court's indulgence for his un- enviable position of having to conduct his own rase, and having a fool for his client. He also applied for a statement as to how he was charged with conspiracy, claiming that he had had no connection with Taylor. The Magistrate (Major Rulnsey) overruled the application. One of Hyne's Wives. The first witness was Alice Esther Maria Westen, who married Hyne at Manchester in L905. She was attractively dressed in a pretty biscuit-coloured costume, with hat to match. She stated after Hyne absconded in November 3he subsequently rejoined him at Aberdeen, md on his rearrest followed him to Bristol. On January 25th Winter and Sayer called on her it Bristol. Winter said he was instructed bo defend her husband by a friend nf hers, but she had never been able to find out who the friend was. He introduced Sayer M his clerk who took full notes at the interview. Winter asked if she had any photos of herself or husband and family, and subse- quently she handed some over. Winter sug- gested they should be published, expressing the opinion that each might realise £2. She stipulated they should not be published until after the trial and they agreed. She identified the photos in the Weekly Dispatch and also the originals. After their publication she taxed Sayer, who said London reporters had worried him for news, and know- ing she was in want of money parted with the photos. He referred her to Winter for the money realised. The solicitor said We can't go into those details now." She saw an article headed Notorious poly- gamist committed for trial," and Sayer said he did not know how it got in the paper. She suggested proceeding against newspapers, but no actions were taken. Wrote His Life-Story. At Horfield Prison her husband wrote his life-story. Winter objected to evidence concerning the articles which appeared after the trial, basing the objection on the prosecuting counsel's own words in the opening statement that after the sentence the Press were free to comment. The objection was overruled. Mrs Weston also told how she became warned that Sayer was a reporter. When taxed by her with being a newspaper representative, i e laughed and told her not to talk rubbish. Winter told her he would give her money for the photographs and the matter in a lump sum, suggesting it would^amount to £100. Evi- dence was then taken from Mrs Westen regard- ing the diamond ring pawned by her in Bristol in November. It was intimated that this portion of the evidence did not concern Taylor. The ring was pawned in November. She wished for money on it, but didn't care to go to the pawnbroker's. Winter said the clerk could go for it. They called for the ticket, but she, having been told they were reporters, didn't, care to part with^the ticket. Then Winter suggested slie should sell her furs to pay for the defence of'her husband. She said, No I may have to sell them later on when my babies are hungry." Winter pressed her to get the money for the defence, and she subsequently handed the ticket to Sayer. De- spite her requests, she had been unable to re- cover the ticket from Sayer or obtain extra money. A budget of correspondence was produced, and in one letter Winter wrote to witness :— I have never received any of your money or property whatever, neither have I had any dealing in the matter with the Weekly Despatch.' Witness gave evidence of a visit by her to the Dispatch Office. She saw Taylor, who said that Sayer was not on the permanent staff. Taylor also said Sayer offered him news on the Hyne case and also asked for an advance, which was refused. Sayer subse- quently brought the news, and was paid. Taylor refused to divulge the price. She saw Sayer at his house and asked for money for the story. He said no money was due, and said he had not sold it. She sug- gested that he should accompany her to Tay- lor. Sayer said he could not Taylor had only given him his fare. She also asked him for the ticket of the ring, and Sayer said he had redeemed the rign, but Winter pawned it again in London. She had interviews with Sayer and Taylor.
FTRETTCARDIFF. Thousands of Sacks Alight. The Cardiff Fire Briga.de went out on Thurs- day night in charge of Superintendent Geen to a fire at Leckwith-road. A telephone message was received at the Central Station from Mr David Humphries, of 4, St. John's- crescent, at 10.35, stating that some stables at the back of Church road were alight. The hose cart from the Canton station was des- patched, and the tender with the brigade from the Central Station also proceeded at once to the fire. They found a loft above the stable, used as a warehouse and containing about 10,000 empty sacks, was well alight. Half the sacks were ablaze. As the fire was being ex- tinguished the sacks were removed to the road below. The roof was slightly damaged by the fire, and also a quantity of basket covers. Four horses were in the stables at the time of the outbreak, but they were removed to a stable close by. The fire was confined to the loft, and the loss is estimated at about £60, against which the owner is not insured. Frederick Field, a son of the occupier, Mr Job Field, was at the stables feeding the horses at 10 p.m., but did not go into the loft, and could not say how the fire was caused. Three women had beenworkingwith the sacks during I the day, and when they left at 7 o'clock everything was apparently safe.
SECOND EDITION; Dressed Like a Nurse. j CARDIFF WOMAN'S FRAUDS. A bold scheme for getting- money was folded at the Newport Police Court vesterda., when Margaret Burns,.aliasDaviesand Barnet Sandown-place, Cardiff, about 30 years of age. and dressed like a nurse, was charged with taining by false pretences small sums ofmone1 from various people in the neighbourhood.. Mr Lyndon Cooper, who prosecuted, saI these offences had been carried on pretty ø. tensively, and it had been a difficult matter to bring them home to prisoner. Prisoner nolf leaded guilty. The wav itwaS done was explained by SeliD* Tyler, Milner-street, who kept a shop. Pri3' oner visited her and represented herself canvasser for Messrs A. and G. Taylor, phOto; graphers, and told complainant her name h8l' been selected by this firm from the register and they decided, for the sake of advertisiCe their business, to confer a boon upon het. This consisted of a fine mirror worth 35s, 0lj condition that she paid 5s. The woman h3** no doubt of the bona fides of the offer, a»d pawned her boots and handed over the 5s. Evidence was also given by other cotØ. plainants, in which the trick played waS similar. Detective-sergeant Tanner made the arrest* an d prisoner then told him she had obtained 30s in Newport. He also found a receipt boo* with the names and addresses of 29 people 111 various towns in the Valleys. The brother of the prisoner, a Newport roan. said prisoner had been a schoolmistress. She had married a Barry tradesman, who sold Up f his business and went to South Africa, and It was beheved he had since died. It was tb6 first time she bad been in a court, she had children in Cardiff, and she had travelled for tea company in Cardiff in order to support het" self and children. The Bench said they would give defendant chance, and fined her 30s. The brother the fine.

BORIC ACID IN SKIM MILK. TECHNICAL OFFENCE AT CARDIFF. On March 11th William James Cox, dairy* man, of 47, City-road, was summoned by Strange, food and drugs inspector, at Cardiff for selling skim milk not of the nature, sub' stance, and quality demanded, it being adul* terated with 0'016 per cent. of boric acid. Ensor (town clerk's office) appeared to prose* cute, and Mr G. F. Forsdike defended. E^i* dence had already been taken, the case £ been adjourned pending the decision in a Court case. The Stipendiary now stated that, he under a misapprehension when he adjourned the case, because here there was an absolute prohibition of boric acid, and the case upon which there wat an appeal in the High Court was under Section 5. Mr Forsdike pointed out that the milk carOf from Somerset, and had been in defendant's possession less than two hours when the inspeC' tor took the sample. Skim milk was used fc* baking purposes. Where a man gave notice to purchasers that preservatives were in the milfc the Board of Agriculture had laid down regulr tions allowing one in 40 grains per gallon. pre- suming the defendant had given the notice re* quired, then his percentage would be less one quarter of what the Board of Agriculture L paid gould be put in. This was the first Coux~bad been ch»rfc§d, aqtd only got tiM* skim milk to oblige a customer. The Stipendiary said something had beeØ done which the statute prohibited, and al" though the conviction did not reflect on th6 defendant as to his commercial honesty, bØ must remember that the public must be pr°* tected, and if the public asked for a pure article they must have it. Defendant was fined £2 and costs. The charge against Edith Blanchford, who sold tW milk to the inspector, was withdrawn.
SALVATION ARMY INDICTED. Some Strong Allegations. Some exceptionally strong statements were made yesterday at Caxton Hall, WTest* minster, regarding the Conduct of SalvatioO Army joinery works in London. The occasion was a meeting called by the London District Committee of the Amalgamated Society 0 Carpenters and Joiners to protest against alleged sweating which takes place there. Mr Will Thorne, M.P., who wired regretting inability to preside, said, Hope SalvatioØ Army will soon be wiped out and all such sweating organisations." Mr G. Kebbell, a London solicitor, William Booth is simply and purely a trad" ing philanthropist, and on a colossal scale." Mr S. Stennett, secretary of the Carpenters and J oiners' Society, quoted many figures to show that men employed by the Army were paid sweated wages, and asked if there waf any valid reason why the Salvation Arrcif should ask a man because he was destitute to make for 2s that which any other buildef would have- to pay 10s for. It was simply scandalous that the Army should recruit froC* poor individuals on the Embankment, find out their capacity for work, and then rob and sweat them. He would give the Army credit that when they worked men overtime they paid time and a quarter—they credited the men with 3d an hour! (Laughter.) Tha.t. was not all. Three weeks before and two weeks after the Salvation Army self-denia" week the men did not receive a penny piece. (Shame.) A resolution denouncing the threefold system of sweating, truck payment, and underselling practised by the Salvation Army at Hanburf" street joinery works, calling for its immediate abolition, and demanding fall and public inquiry into the conduct of the ifistitution, W*3 adopted, and it was decided to hold an opeD air demonstration on the subject.

Russian authorities say they have finished building a barrier dividing the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow forcibly seized in 2014, from mainland Ukraine.
The Border Directorate of the Federal Security Service (FSB) branch in Crimea said on Dec. 28, 2018,.
Moscow denies interfering in Ukraine's affairs, but the International Criminal Court ruled in November 2016 that the fighting in eastern Ukraine is "an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation."

Los Rojiblancos need to win and for Qarabag to at least avoid defeat at Roma at the same time for Diego Simeone’s men to avoid a premature exit and fall into the Europa League.
Costa forced through a return to Atletico after three seasons at Stamford Bridge featuring 59 goals in 120 appearances, plus two Premier League titles, but is ineligible until January due to their transfer embargo and has remained in Madrid to work on his fitness.
.”
Simeone and Luis insist Atletico’s sole focus will be on beating Chelsea in Champions League Group C.
“We don’t have to be looking about what happens in Rome,” Simeone said. “We just have to think about us.”
Meanwhile Cesc Fabregas says he.
Fabregas was initially out of favour last season in Conte’s first campaign. He had made only four appearances at this stage last year; this season it is 18 after he showed his worth.
“Well, I would be lying if I say that I wasn’t worried,” said Fabregas.
“I wasn’t playing, I wasn’t really part of his (Conte’s) initial plans and at that point you can do two things.
 is a first choice in Conte’s favoured 3-4-3 and 3-5-2 formations, but the 30-year-old playmaker is out of contract in June 2019.
Chelsea’s policy is to offer players 30 and over only 12-month contract extensions, but Fabregas is not concerned by that.
“I am only 30. What is 30? Nothing,” Fabregas added.
 believes Fabregas has plenty of years remaining at the top.
“He is still young for sure,” the Blues boss said.
“When you are 30 years old you have at least five more years. He’s a winner in his mind, in his mentality, for this reason he is very strong.”
Since the 3-0 loss at Roma, Chelsea have won five of their six games — the draw at Liverpool the exception — scoring 14 goals and conceding twice.
Given the saga surrounding Costa which saw the striker return after three years at Stamford Bridge, Conte was evasive when asked if would give him additional satisfaction to see Atletico slip into the Europa League.
The Italian, who is again without defender David Luiz (knee), said: “I think we must have great respect for Atletico Madrid and for the whole team, not only for one, two, three players. If the whole team after tomorrow’s game has to play Europa League, it can happen.”Shearwater 17 HYBRID chamfers
Submitted by Oceanrower - Thu, 2/4/21 » 11:49 AM
Hi all. I’m a bit puzzled. I’ve cut and joined my plywood for the base and sides of a Shearwater 17 hybrid (plan build, not kit) and am now at the chamfering edges stage. The manual (page 29 if it matters) is telling me to chamfer the TOP edge of the side panel to 45’ . That can’t surely be right. I need to glue sheer clamps and then plane them down in the other direction! I could understand it on a completely stitch and clue boat but not a hybrid...

And a supplimentary question,
Do I need to steam the sheer clamps? It's a hell of a kick up at the stern. Could I cut a row of slots in the top of the sheer clamp to help it bend? It's not 'that' structural, surely!

Dear Oceanrower,
Shear clamps on Shearwater 17'? I have built the regular 17 (not the hybrid) and there are no shear clamps. Just some tricky fillets and glass tape in some hard to reach spots along the hull/deck interface. I know the cheaspeake design has shear clamps do you mean that?
looking at my SW 17, if you do need to do shear clamps, the bow would be fine, but the stern does have a difficult looking bend.
I guess you really need someone who has done a hybrid SW 17 to pipe up.

Hi Joel,
The manual I have definitely has 12mm x 18mm sheer clamps.
I can understand that on a complete stitch and glue kayak that the 45' bevel would make sense. I just really don't understand why I would need to do that when, only a few pages later, I'm told to bevel the other way to follow the deck forms!

let me take your questions one at a time:
chamfers/bevels - the 45 degree bevels should only be on the inside of the plywood-to-plywood seams. the top of the side panels should be beveled to match the deck forms and that beveling should be in conjunction with beveling the shear clamp to match the curve of the deck forms. so while i don't have the manual you have in front of me, your reading ahead and 'puzzling it through' is correct. the build gallery (construction pictures and some of the you-tube building resources (where people document their construction) confirm your conclusion.
do i need to steam the sheer clamps - typically no. they may be a bit more flexible then you think and should be able to make it. if not, you could cut some slots, or heat the wood or steam it...but i have not had to use steam in similar builds. fwiw, i also typically take a half round router bit to the inside lower - inside facing edge of the sheer clamp to make if a nice half round surface. to your point, it is not structural, and i find by doing that i save some weight and avoid any sharp edges on the inside of the boat.

Thank uyou, hspira,
Clearly, on a hybrid, there are no side panel to deck forms (if you mean a plywood deck).
The strip deck is meant to overlap the edge of the stitch and glue hull which is where my confusion came in. I couldn't see the point of putting an inside bevel on the hull and the bevelling the other way once I'd installed the hull formers to shape the edge of the stripped deck..
As I said earlier, first boat so probably not explaining myself too well...

This weekend The San Antonio Symphony will be performing back to back concerts at The Majestic Theatre featuring hits from the majestic catalogs of Queen and Led Zeppelin. Creator and arranger Brent Havens will conduct the ensemble, backed by a full electric band as well as two crack singers.
Queen, a band whose depth and range is surpassed by few, if any, harnessed all the camp and drama of an off-Broadway closing night cast party with the sincerity and skill of an on-Broadway box office smash, touching on themes of suicide, rotund derriéres, and sassy teases strapped with dynamite and laser beams.

Led Zeppelin - famously dubbed by The Who's Keith Moon and John Entwistle, who expected the combustible band members to live up to their namesake - are no strangers to musical appropriation, as they are, The Cramps aside, the best cover band of the last forty-five years (if one does enough digging into blues standards and plagiarism accusations). This, however, in no way diminishes their capabilities as generators of a strut-factor 10, (you can even strut to 'em while seated)! "Kashmir" is an obvious choice for The Symphony, but the discerning ear would benefit from "Since I've Been Loving You," "When the Levee Breaks," "Traveling Riverside Blues," or "Black Mountain Side." I'll be stoned.Behavior Health Professional - LGPC/LCPC or LMSW/LCSW - Part Time (LaPlata & Leonardtown, MD)

HOW IT ALL BEGAN: One quiet night, about three decades ago, a 10-year old boy lost his dad, tragically leaving young Jason without the father he adored. Jason’s mom placed 200-plus phone calls across Oklahoma, trying to find a support group for grieving children.
No one was able to help this family until Charlotte Lankard, a counselor with INTEGRIS Baptist Hospital, answered her call. From there, Calm Waters was born, providing a safe place for thousands of children and families who need support after a loss due to death or divorce.

Congressman Trone Hosts Equity and Justice Roundtable on Women’s History with Hagerstown Mayor Emily Keller, Hagerstown City Councilmember Tiara Burnett, and Girls, Inc. of Washington County
WASHINGTON — Today, Congressman David Trone (MD-06) hosted a roundtable discussion with Washington County leaders on women’s history and the importance of empowering the next generation of leaders. During the conversation, the group reflected on the progress made by women over the course of history and the need to come together to break down gender inequities and support the history makers of tomorrow.
You can watch the conversation here.
The panelists included:
- Mayor Emily Keller, City of Hagerstown
- Councilmember Tiara Burnett, Hagerstown City Council
- Maureen Grove, Executive Director, Girls Inc. of Washington County
- Clara Tavarez, Member, Girls Inc. of Washington County
“This conversation was a great opportunity to reflect on the progress we’ve made in the fight for gender equity and discuss what work still needs to be done to create a more equitable future,” said Congressman Trone. “I’d like to thank each panelist for sharing their perspectives on how we can empower the next generation of women leaders.”
“Representation matters….We always talk about how important it is for little girls to see people in office or in leadership positions that look like them. But I think it’s equally as important for little boys to see women in positions of power….It’s so important, especially for our children, to look up and to see diverse leadership,” said Hagerstown Mayor Emily Keller.
“We’ve shown time and time again that we’re up to the challenge. At one point women couldn’t even have a job…but now here we’re running our own companies, we’re in elected roles, we’re mentors, and we’re out here making changes,” said Hagerstown City Councilmember Tiara Burnett.
“We’re teaching girls to be assertive and [to] advocate for themselves….We want them to face challenges with courage and compassion, but [also] to be change agents for equity and for tolerance that the world so desperately needs….This generation is the one that’s gotta do it, this generation of women.” said Girls Inc. Executive Director Maureen Grove.
“[My] main piece of advice is to surround yourself with people you know are going to support you and have a strong community that supports you — like Girls, Inc. of Washington County does for me,” said Girls Inc. member Clara Tavarez. “I think it’s very important for kids that there are people like them in government or leadership positions in general. I’m Dominican. Seeing there’s not a lot of Hispanic women in government makes me want to go into the government.”

Basic Information On Emsam
Emsam, a dermal patch is used to treat serious and major depressive disorder. Prominent and persistent depressed or dysphoric mood lasting nearly every day for about two weeks is termed as a depressive disorder. Selegiline, the active ingredient acts by restoring certain natural substances in the brain. Emsam is used as a transdermal patch which is a form of supplying a drug in a controlled manner for absorption through skin. The advantage in this method is that the medicine is delivered directly bypassing the small intestine and liver greatly minimizing adverse hypertensive crisis or abnormal spikes in blood pressure. Emsam is recommended only for adults.
Precautions / Side Effects For Emsam
Your doctor will help you evaluate the clinical benefit against increased risk of suicidal tendencies while using Emsam/Selegiline or such antidepressant drugs for patients below the age of 24. The risk may be less in older patients. Remember that this medicine is not recommended for children below 12 years even with modifications. Give beverages containing caffeine or chocolate in small quantities and consult doctor if you are giving any cough or cold preparations containing dextromethorphan. Do not ever cut the brand or generic Emsam patch into smaller pieces. Wash your hands thoroughly after applying the patch and before touching your eyes. Discard the used patch after folding so that the sticky side sticks to itself and ensure that children or pets do not get to touch it.
Minor to moderate reaction on the site where the Emsam drug patch is applied may occur. In a small number of cases, you may also expect other possible side effects of brand or generic Emsam; for example, chest pain, neck pain, diarrhea, constipation, changes in sexual function, gain or loss of weight and increased cough. Your doctor may gradually increase the Selegiline dose or vary the regimen and periodically evaluate the treatment in consultation with you based on the response and the side effects.
Emsam Dosage
The recommended starting dose of Selegiline is 6 mg/24 hours which may be increased up to 12 mg/24 hours. Apply a new Emsam patch everyday on a new site. Wear only one patch at a time. Before applying a new patch, remove the old patch by using a medical adhesive remover or baby oil. Wash both this and the fresh site (which has no calluses/injury/irritation) with soap and water and dry. Take out the new Emsam patch from the pouch only just before use. Remove half of the protective backing; place the sticky side of the patch on the prepared area. Now pressing with fingers at the corner on the back of the patch, stretch the patch across simultaneously peeling the other half of the protective cover. With a little practice, you will be able to do this so that patch is sticking smoothly without any folds/bumps.

A low-level bascule bridge to West Seattle was constructed in 1924. By the 1960s, there was a lot of discussion about how to replace it as the large number of ships in the Duwamish Waterway required frequent opening, causing traffic jams. Plans for a high bridge, without a drawbridge, began in the 1960s. In October 1973, Councilmember John Miller released a statement that read "After several years of planning and hearings, the moment of decision has arrived on the West Seattle Freeway...." Funding had been received from Forward Thrust and the State's Urban Arterial Fund. But the State withdrew its funds in 1976 due to bribery and scandal, and by 1978 the bridge project was considered dead. When the ship Antonio Chavez hit the bridge in 1978, action was no longer optional. Councilmember Jeanette Williams chaired the Transportation Committee and took on the project. Some people wanted to repair the existing bridge, some wanted a curved bridge, some wanted a bascule bridge, some wanted a low bridge and some wanted a high bridge. And some thought a tunnel would be a good idea. In April 1979 City Council approved a plan for the West Seattle Freeway Bridge and after a decade or more of construction the bridge was dedicated on August 9, 1991. It was renamed the Jeanette Williams Memorial Bridge in 2009.
The Transportation Committee approved Resolution 26055 on April 5, 1979; the Full Council approved the resolution on April 9, 1979. It stated the Council's preference for Alternative Number 10 as the final plan for the West Seattle Freeway Bridge. Councilmember Hill was the only dissenting vote.

Blake Shelton is staying put. The singer told Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb on Today on Tuesday (May 24) that he is not leaving The Voice, despite rumors that he has moved on from the televised reality singing competition.
"I’ve heard many rumors that I’ve been fired," Shelton admits. "I don’t plan on going anywhere. I’d like to stay there as long as I can. Of course I'm going to stay there!"
Miley Cyrus and Alicia Keys will serve as judges next season alongside Shelton and Adam Levine.
"The moron is coming back, too," Shelton says of Levine. "It's going to be a lot of fun."
In addition to his new album, If I'm Honest, Shelton will be featured in the upcoming animated film Angry Birds. He is also keeping busy filming The Voice, as well as has several tour dates lined up this fall.

Winston agreed to a one-year deal in New Orleans, giving him a chance to rehabilitate his career behind future Hall of Famer Drew Brees and under the eye of coach Sean Payton. After selecting Mississippi State's Tommy Stevens in the seventh round, the Saints now have four quarterbacks under contract for the 2020 season.
"Being a part of the New Orleans Saints, being a part with Drew Brees, Taysom Hill, Sean Payton, coach Joe Lombardi, coach Pete Carmichael. When you think about that room, that's like a Harvard education in quarterback school," Winston said Tuesday on Instagram. "I want to put my ego aside ... and think about my family, think about my career.
"There was no better position than to be in the same room with someone that I really looked up to, someone that I admire since I've been playing this game in Drew Brees."

Former #Bucs QB Jameis Winston joined Charlie Ward on Instagram Live to explain his decision to join the @Saints. #WhoDat pic.twitter.com/pM6ZIO71Ew
Though this agreement was reported earlier this weekend, it made sense for the Saints to wait and make it official.
According to a provision in the new Collective Bargaining Agreement, by signing Winston after the 3 p.m. deadline Monday (April 27), the Saints put themselves in position to get a compensatory pick in next year's draft for quarterback Teddy Bridgewater, who signed with the Carolina Panthers.
The New Orleans Saints' are expected to sign former Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston, and fellow quarterback Taysom Hill said o…
After a crazy quarterback carousel stopped spinning this off-season, Winston was one of the few former high-level starters who were left without work. He spent the first five years of his career with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where he had a roller coaster tenure.
There, Winston made the Pro Bowl as a rookie and in his last season recorded the 12th individual season of 5,000 or more passing yards in NFL history. In between, he was suspended three games for an off the field incident and benched for Ryan Fitzpatrick, and he became the first player in more than 30 years to throw 30 interceptions in a single season.
The Buccaneers decided to move on from Winston this offseason, electing to sign three-time MVP Tom Brady instead, leaving Winston without a professional home — and likely without a starting opportunity.
He chose to sign with the Saints, where he will certainly work behind the scenes as a backup for Brees and insurance in case of injury to the Saints' multipurpose talent Taysom Hill.
But this one-year pact has a chance to pay off for Winston as well. He will become a free agent again next season and has a chance to learn from two of the NFL's best in Payton and Brees.

“Nearly 4,000 beach closings and swimming advisories were issued by the state and local governments in 1995” (Beach 1). This statistic shows that America’s beaches are progressively becoming more polluted. The American society today should take full advantage of the opportunity of having beaches also try and keep them as sanitary as possible. Beach pollution is known to be one of the biggest global concerns in the world. But what is beach pollution? Beach pollution is the unsanitary conditions of the worlds beaches and seas. Our California beaches are becoming more and more polluted, hence why parents aren’t taking their children to beaches. Wildlife is greatly endangered by pollution causing issues like death or extinction. Animals are affected as much as humans. Litter and human waste contribute to marine and beach pollution, which dangers the environment causing harm to animals and humans.
Beach pollution is considered to be one of the biggest controversial issues in the new era. Beach pollution not only affects the habitat of the marine life, it also has effects on human hosts who are exposed to the wastes in put out in sea. Beach pollution is wastes combined overtime to create/form a type of bacteria in which spreads illnesses, Usually caused by tainted waters from industrial factories. Beach pollution affects wildlife drastically from killing marine life also abusing the coral reef with pollution. Human waste pipelines that are not properly taken care of and leak through to the waters contribute as well. Due to non-properly maintained pipelines, human feces and other wastes are overflowing within the lines and forcing it to squeeze into the water streams. Beach pollution does not necessarily mean direct dumping of wastes into the sea itself. Twenty miles off shores and coastlines are industrial factories that are too far to discharge wastes. These long traveled distances of wastes from factories and humans are combined together through the same sewage pies and travel towards the sea. Although there are many factories and humans living off shore, this can result in major malfunction of pipe thus causing water to pollute and contaminate living organisms within the miles of its radius.
One of the main causes of beach and marine pollution, are people who abuse the privilege and litter; disregarding the law. “Seven billion tons of debris is entering the world beaches annually” (Beach and Ocean 1). The debris can range from human wastes to debris from vehicles that chemically alter the balance of pH in water in the atmosphere: known as “acid rain”. These wastes all contaminate water in different ways. The results of pollution cannot only be found in pipelines, but beach pollution can be contributed from even sixty miles out. The affects that this has on marine beaches are devastating; it also shows the lack of care and awareness to the inhabitants and habitats themselves. Items that are being polluted can be restrained. Things like empty bottles being left, used napkins, leftover food being left on shore, also big reason bonfires.
These few things may not seem as dangerous to this environment as you think but in reality these few things affect beaches drastically. “In 2011 the number of closings and advisory days at ocean bay and great lakes reached its 3rd highest level since NRDC began tracking these events 22 years ago” (Executive 2). This can result in many profits in the area to be at all time lows. On top of that, the area that Hurricane Katrina hit, in New Orleans, already had been economically devastated and the BP oil spill has contributed to the New Orleans struggle to establish economic prosperity. Although there are many organizations dedicated to cleaning up beaches, the task is simply overwhelming without the general public doing their part. Not only is it affecting mankind but also harming wild life, and other animals. This results in many ways of transferring infections to other hosts, if contagious, or contaminating our food chain.
Many propositions have been issued on how to prevent beach pollution from exceeding beyond its full capacity. To help beaches avoid such disasters, there are certain programs that the government does to help keep the beaches clean issue many beach clean-up crews. Is it enough to prevent every beach from decaying, the answer is no, but it does help a bit. “The BP (British Petroleum) oil spill, which began with the April 20, 1010 explosion on the deep water horizon rig and ended when the well was capped on July 15 2012” (Executive 2). This devastated economic interests within the region. Not only did the BP oil spill ruin profits, but also caused local fisherman and other marine small time businesses to be put on hold from their income because it was out of their hands. Oil spills are bad enough to get passed by and a spill that continued on for 4 months is aimlessly long and dangerous.If there could be a way to maintain humans from littering their waste from beaches, next step would be to prevent Government officials to keep and enforce strict regulations on their oilrigs and not allow such disasters and catastrophes to continue. Oil and water are two different compounds not allowing them to “mix” or “come together” develop a chain of debris. The NRDC concludes, “The spill affected beaches along the Gulf of Mexico, in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida” (Executive 2). Unfortunately executive failed to mention all the ports and economic catastrophes all along the coast of the nation Mexico. This is a very serious health warning, which should have been taken care of more seriously because in the long run, beaches are going to compile too much waste and waters wouldn’t be bale to be drinkable anymore.
Pollution that has been left alone for a number of days/weeks often decays into millions of pieces of bacteria left behind for other organisms to attract. The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) has estimated “up to 3.5 million people became ill from contact with raw sewage from sanitary sewer overflows each year” (Executive 2). These numbers are devastating, but not enough to trigger and alarm public health services. The EPA understands how severe these situations are, but 3.5 million people are a very small fraction of the population being exposed and falling ill. This can be controversial because not everyone could be getting sick as the result of the water but by the air itself and weather conditions. Beaches have been known to have some of the worst unsanitary conditions, some try and prevent it but non-biodegradable wastes have been piled up to keep on living on other bacterial cells. “Illnesses associated from the beach water include stomach flu, skin rashes, pinkeye, respiratory infections, meningitis, and hepatitis” (Executive 2). Children are more vulnerable than adults because weaker immune systems that have not been exposed to wastes as much as adults. The NRDC is finding new ways to commute to this devastating dilemma. The young, the elderly and those with weak immune systems must be careful, “they are most likely developed illnesses or infections after swimming in the polluted water” (Beach 2). Although there are other beaches, some just are to horrifically pollute to even be heard of.
Many bodies of water near urban areas are highly polluted. This is the result of both garbage dumped by individuals, and dangerous chemicals illegally dumped by industries. The main problem caused by water pollution is that it kills life that inhabits water-based ecosystems. “Dead fish, birds, dolphins, and many other animals often wind up on beaches, killed by pollutants in their habitat” (Kuipers 1). This results in many bones and other useless objects to wash up shore where individuals such as babies play in the sand. Since infants and children usually put their hands in their mouths or eat without washing their hands, this can transfer the germs into them and cause them to get sick. It is an invisible fight against germs and microorganisms that make it hard for humans to really understand beach pollution. It is also considered to be an invisible threat to human health.
Many try to argue that beach pollution is quite possibly the only way to maintain a more sanitary living condition for the American society. The statement is sea floor where small seafloor critters clean it up. Unfortunately, these small sea critters are having a tough time keeping up with the heavy demands of pollution being emitted to sea. Thus is compiles up and sits there till pathogens reach the surface where there is more sun thus becomes more abundant and energetic to infect a human host.
The effects of beach and marine pollution have been devastating to the oceans environment and ruining the marine animal’s habitat. It has affected many parts of the earth, for example, global warming, melting of the polar ice caps, and extinction of marine species.
Beaches that adults and kids who want to enjoy a day at the beach but also leave there trash behind. Another cause of beach pollution is the raw sewage spills that run straight into the ocean. They should be more considerate because people do swim in the ocean, also would like to swim in an ocean with sanitary conditions. Affects of beach and marine pollution can be crucial and deadly. Our society should find a way to handle this because it can cause harm to humans causing asthma and we really should take care of the environment if we are living in it. The ocean is filled with disease causing bacteria that can really harm the many people who swim in the ocean. with the power of all human and help from the government, beach coastlines should be able to be tolerable without becoming ill.

Sandeep Kaur.
The significance of these findings is that they help guide us in how to care for the patient. IV antibiotics will need to be started ASAP to combat the infection which is indicated by several factors: elevated temperature elevated WBCs neuts and bands wound culture cellulitis and the thick yellow drainage from the wound and unable to bear weight. Miss G also need CT of left leg and MRI can give the better result with the other lab work like CMP CK ABG HgbA1C to rule out DKA and also to know how well her blood sugar is. Miss G need monitoring of the vital sign. Because when a patient is septic the HR goes up or down. Surgical consult will be helpful too.
The fact that she cannot bear weight and reports being in bed for 3 days suggests that she is most likely dehydrated and suffers from malnutrition as well. An IV should be started for fluids possibly a banana bag or LR in order to rehydrate as well as give her body the proper nutrients to help with wound healing.
This patient needs wound consult because of open leg wound with left leg redness. The wound should be cleansed and properly bandaged twice daily depending upon the amount of drainage that continues. Its possible that a wound-vac might be needed as the patient also suffers from diabetes and has poor circulation. Need to mark the red area in order to see if the redness is increasing. Leg should be elevated for the swelling. Calf measurement needs to be done to check if the leg size is increasing.
Since the patient is complaining of pain which is evident by her not leaving her bed for 3 days She needs around the clock medicine for pain.
Routine lab draws will need to be made as well until the infection is under control that way you can ensure that the infection is not getting worse and monitor the effects it is having on her body. Since diabetics function and process things differently than normal a CBC and CMP would be helpful to monitor organ functions. Also I would order a FSBS AC and QHS along with oral diabetic medications depending upon the HgA1C level and FSBS results. This will not only help wound healing now but it will help control further issues in the future.
It is also obvious that Ms. G would greatly benefit from education on diabetes. Although we do not get the information to know how this started or what her blood sugar levels have been it most likely started from a consequence of poorly managed diabetes. Since diabetics suffer from poor circulation along with neuropathy they do not feel wounds the same way a non-diabetic would. This could have started from something as simple as a nic from shaving her legs but left untreated it turned into something much worse. A diabetic should always check their feet and legs thoroughly each night before bed to ensure all skin is intact. Nutrition should also be something to educate on. Not only is nutrition a huge factor in managing diabetes it also plays a vital role in wound healing. The body cannot heal without the proper nutrients and it is especially difficult if you are a diabetic. Pt needs podiatrist to have her feet checked and nails cut. Pt needs education on blood sugar check and how to give insulin and also a nutritionist to help understand DM.
Another thing to consider upon discharge is whether or not the patient will require home health services. Stating that she lived alone no body to help with food and she is in the bed for three days. This shows the self-neglect of the patient. Assistance may be required until the leg is fully healed.Pt needs homecare and a program like Meals on Wheels that deliver meals for her. Other option is skilled nursing facility. This patient also need emotional support. Powerlessness is a huge issue with this patient. Her lack of function is the contributing factor. She is dependent on others. An equal portion is directly related to her perceived lack of control over decisions. This patient needs a therapeutic relationship. Nurses should spend oneonone time with her keep commitments provide encouragement listen attentively be empathetic. Allow patient to share her feelings. Encourage participation in selfcare and selfmanagement activities so that patient feels less powerless. Giving realistic praise assists the patient in developing positive feelings and enhances selfconcept. All feelings are personal and have meaning for the patient. Support groups can serve as a helpful means to improve interpersonal coping strategies. Counseling with therapeutic goal setting has been shown to be helpful.

The previous Sulli savings, for which Muslim women were ‘auctioned’, shows exactly why it must never be complete.

Quality and detail of the design were also a priority. The challenge was the lighting, which we designed to fit a sloping ceiling. By using recessed long profile luminaires combined with detachable directional spots, we successfully and elegantly managed the lighting and thus made it a significant part of the space.
: The scale of the interior materials was minimalistic - dark grey micro cement and dark wood of the floor combined with the white of the roof.
Fixed furniture such as kitchens, cabinets and wardrobes were followed by an earthy broken colour scheme. Loose furniture complemented the space with shapes and understated accent colours freshened with pastel cobalt blue in the textiles.
Tranquillity, quality and timeless style were the goal of the project and it was achieved with the cooperation of all parties involved in the project.Delhi Capitals skipper Rishabh Pant and starter Prithvi Shaw were visibly upset over their loss to Kolkata Knight Riders in Sharjah on Wednesday.
Delhi Capitals (DC) was left crestfallen after a heartbreaking loss to Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2021 Qualifier 2 at Sharjah Cricket Stadium in Sharjah on Wednesday.
After watching defeat for most of KKR’s innings, DC came back in the game’s death overs with some disciplined bowling to put KKR on the back foot.
The team led by Eoin Morgan, chasing 136, needed 13 runs from the final four overs, but a mini collapse saw KKR needing six runs from the final two balls.
With Ravichandran Ashwin taking back-to-back wickets and hitting a hat-trick in the game’s penultimate installment, it looked like DC would pull off a memorable comeback.
However, KKR’s Rahul Tripathi had other plans and gave Ashwin a six to give KKR victory and a place in the final. While the KKR camp celebrated victory, the CD’s form of defeat left their players devastated.
DC captain Rishabh Pant and starter Prithvi Shaw were visibly upset at the loss and both were seen wiping tears.
Shaw fell to the ground in tears and was picked up and comforted by his teammates as an excited Pant watched him from the sidelines.
DC coach and former Australia captain Ricky Ponting was seen offering a few words of comfort to Pant as he wrapped his arms around the 24-year-old Indian.
Previously, DC posted 135/5 in 20 overs, with Shikhar Dhawan scoring the highest at 36. KKR was sailing in response, boosted by the initial partnership of 96 runs.
Shubman Gills 46 and Venkatesh Iyers 55 helped put KKR in a strong position before DC fought back to bring the game to the last end.Last week’s column paying tribute to the late Jack Tennant on the 20th anniversary of the Cochrane Eagle, the newspaper he founded, drew some truly grateful responses.
“How blessed you were to have known a man of such wisdom,” said Ottawa reader Ros Weeks.
Fellow columnist Ron Gobeil, of Parksville, BC, agrees. “You must find it special to have met people of that calibre, who leave an indelible mark which never seems to fade,” he wrote.
Well, Jack sure left an indelible mark on aerospace industry leader Sandford McLeod.
“Jack Tenant was a true giver,” he said.
Sandy had met Jack some years ago while running as MLA for Banff-Cochrane. Jack’s on-the-streets experiences as an alcoholic “gave him so much human understanding,” Sandy said.
“Jack interviewed me twice and we reminisced about that time in his early troubled youth. He knew Vancouver very well, especially the down-and-outer Water Street area,” which Sandy also knew well from his social work studies. “Jack’s life journey is a truly remarkable legacy reflecting the very strong, committed journey, prominently giving all he had in and around Cochrane.
“It’s the frontline hitters like Jack that make the difference.”
And speaking of making a difference, it’s my own experience that even just being in Jack’s presence could make a difference – sometimes in serendipitously delightful ways, as, for example, my encounter with a raspberry ruby at his table seven years ago. (See my Aug. 28, 2014 column.)
Jack was visiting with fellow photographer Stirling Clark at the A&W.
But what really caught my attention as I approached their table wasn’t so much the topic of their conversation as the beautiful red gem between them on the table. It was only about a centimetre across, but as the sun hit it, it glowed. Was it an . . . uncut ruby?
Now, rubies have held a special place in my imagination ever since I read the 13th century Persian poet Rumi’s piece, “The Sunrise Ruby.” It’s a conversation between lover and beloved. As preserved in Coleman Barks’ translation (The Essential Rumi), the lover says:
“I’m a ruby held up to the sunrise…. The ruby and the sunrise are one....”
For me, Rumi’s reference to the ruby and the sunrise being one had become a metaphor for our lives in this world as gems through whom the Sacred gives beautiful expression. No, we are not the sun itself, but we are the instruments through whom the sun beautifies the world around us.
So, about that ruby on Jack’s table. It was sitting right there in the bright morning sun. It was glowing gloriously in the middle of Jack’s otherwise empty paper plate. But neither Jack nor Stirling seemed to pay any attention to it. For all they cared, it might as well have been just a glob of raspberry jam.
And you know? That’s exactly what it was: just a glob of raspberry jam! In the eyes of many, it might seem totally insignificant, just like you and I may feel at times in this life.
To me, however, it was a raspberry ruby, an instance of sacred serendipity in the midst of life’s journey, and an example of the beauty that Jack radiated among all with whom he associated.

I am a frequent reader of “Jesus Creed,” a blog by North Park University professor Scot McKnight. He is discussing Christopher Wright’s book, The Mission of God, at the moment. Today he brought up a good point. I include below an excerpt from Scot’s article and my addition to the pot of comments.

My comment:
Scot:
I have a some chapters in my latest book about “Israel as the Vessel” and “The Nations as the Goal.” You are right to say that Israel did not do well in its priestly mission. God worked through Israel in spite of Israel, bringing the BIble and Messiah and transforming the world.
I love the mutual blessing theme of Genesis 12, which R. Kendall Soulen develops at length in The God of Israel and Christian Theology. It sounds like Chris Wright gets that too. God’s way of redeeming the world is mutual blessing.
In my book, The World to Come, I say that Israel had three ways of incorporating non-Jews: Conversion (like Caleb or Ruth, joining the family), Participation (the sojourner who was invited to make offerings and keep Sabbath and so on with Israel), and Invitation (like Solomon praying in Kings that people from the nations would worship at God’s temple). Yet, though we see these examples and more, clearly Israel did not heed God’s call to priestly mission. But we could ask ourselves: was there any better plan God could have chosen? I think not.

When installed properly, both are virtually stain- and scratch-resistant. However there are key differences in the way they need to be cleaned and cared for to maintain their original condition and beauty.
Tile Types
It is important to recognize the differences between the two materials. Porcelain is a man-made ceramic product, while quartz is a natural, durable mineral which is found naturally in crystalline form. However, quartz tile is not 100 percent pure quartz; it is a mix of approximately 90 percent quartz grain and an epoxy binder. The main difference between these two materials is that porcelain is porous and in most cases will require sealing at the time of installation.
Video of the Day
Initial Sealing
The most important step to ensure easy and effective care throughout the life of your porcelain floor is the addition of a penetrating sealer. These are commercially available from your local hardware store and do not require professional application. First, clean the floor thoroughly. Then apply the sealer to the floor surface in a thin even layer and allow to dry. The sealer will fill any microscopic gaps and voids on the surface of the porcelain, preventing dirt and stains from penetrating the surface of the tile.
Care and Maintenance
To extend the life of both porcelain and quartz tile: - Use mats at entranceways to prevent excess dirt from being tracked inside. - Vacuum regularly to help prevent dirt buildup. - Clean up spills immediately to minimize damage to your tile. - Always follow the care instructions provided by the tile manufacturer if available.
For porcelain tile: - Beware of using black-soled shoes or high heels without a rubber sole as these can mark or chip the tile. - Never use ammonia, oil-based or artificially colored cleaning agents as these can discolor the tile and grout. - Stick to water-based sealants, as these are nontoxic and more environmentally friendly.
Cleaning Method
1) Vacuum or sweep the floor. 2) Saturate the floor with an appropriate cleaning solution. For porcelain tile: a solution of 1/4 cup of vinegar mixed with hot water in a bucket. For quartz tile: warm water and soap, or a mild household cleaner. Do not use vinegar on quartz. 3) Allow to sit for five to 10 minutes but do not allow the solution to dry. 4) Scrub any stubborn stains in the tile or grout with a plastic brush.
5) Wipe away dirty solution. 6) Rinse with clean water. 7) Dry the tile with a clean cloth to prevent water spots and increase shine.
Grout Care
Without the proper treatment, grout can become discolored or cracked. As grout is a porous material, penetrating grout sealer should be applied once or twice a year. This is widely available as a spray-on product that can be easily applied to your porcelain or quartz tile floor. Stained or dirty grout can be cleaned with a soft scrubbing brush using the cleaning solution appropriate to the type of tile.Spent a couple of hours on a sunny day at The Blue Lagoon and got me some
freckles. I love having freckled sun kissed skin during the summer.
If you are ever in Iceland, visiting the Lagoon is a must. I can't seem to think
of a better way to spend a sunny summer day than chilling in the hot lagoon
with a summer drink or ice cream with some of your friends. Plus the color of
the water and the remains of the lava are so gorgeous.
There is no better feeling than a clean and organized room, clean sheets and
some fresh flowers on a Friday afternoon.
Breakfast in bed! Strawberry yogurt with granola and bananas, my favorite
breakfast aside from banana pancakes.
Some of my favorite beauty products. Make-up brushes from MAC and Essence
of Beauty, nail polishes from Essie, highlighters from Benefit and NARS ( a must
have to get that summer glow).
Saturday nights outfit. Coral dress and statement necklace by H&M, borrowed
from my sister. I have that dress in black (of course..)
Baking cupcakes for my best friends 22nd birthday party. These pictures were
taken before the cupcakes got a little more adult.
Another great week behind me! Even though I had a issue with lack of inspiration and irritation from
the endless bad weather I still had a lot of fun and relaxing days. My best friend turned 22 so a couple
of us met this weekend to celebrate and we baked her some cupcakes and an explosive balloon cake
(that did not go exactly as planned, but it still was so much fun..). In a little over a month I start at my
summer job and after 9 months of no job or school, I am really excited. I am so excited for summer
that it's all I can really think about - sun, shorts, freckles, the blue lagoon and fun with friends!

itsthevworld.blogspot.comAdam’s Peak sri Lanka is a blessed and, in a sense, a cult place, which is sought to visit not only the inhabitants of a small country on the island of Ceylon, but also foreign tourists. It is located on the second most important mountain, the height of which is only 300 meters lower than the highest point on the island – the top of Mount Piduruthalagala. Adam’s Peak is the most visited place on the island, as well as a cult object for representatives of different faiths.
Geography
Once upon a time, from the Indian subcontinent to the state of Sri Lanka, a long dam led across the ocean, the origin of which is still disputed by scientists. In the 15th c. it was destroyed by the consequences of a strong earthquake and since then pilgrims have lost the opportunity to come to the shrines of Adam’s Peak by land.
Sri Lanka is a small country located on an island in South Asia. It is washed by the waters of the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal. The island is mostly a coastal lowland, in the center of which rises a mountain range.
Flora and fauna
Anyone who gets to the island state, will certainly fall in love with its unique beauty. The lowlands and mountains of the island are covered with dense vegetation, and many corners of this land are reserved. There are a lot of parks and reserves on the island, which are protected by the state. Unique flora is represented by:
- unique medicinal plants;
- more than 150 species of orchids;
- relict ferns;
- flowering wild plants.
Having visited Sri Lanka, you can get acquainted with the amazing animal world. In the protected forests of the island live wild boars, bears, porcupines, monkeys, foxes. Crocodiles are found in swampy rivers. Sri Lanka will make a indelible impression on lovers of the animal world. When climbing Adam’s Peak in the spring months, you can see incredibly beautiful butterflies, many of which do not live in other parts of the world, as well as birds listed in the Red Book.
Sea and climate
The monsoons have a great influence on the formation of the climate on the island. Most of the precipitation falls during the summer months, the rains almost completely stop in November. The water here in any season has a comfortable temperature for swimming – not lower than +26 degrees. The shores of the island are washed by the waters of the Indian Ocean, but to be more precise, then, once in different parts of this beautiful land, you can swim in the Manar, Bengal Bays, as well as in the Polk Strait.
Despite the fact that the beaches of the island are not too equipped, they do not cease to attract tourists with rocks, underwater grottoes, mysterious caves, excellent opportunities for diving. In the bays there are rare species of fish – tuna, marlin, oyster lives. And in the north-west of the island, high-quality pearls are mined.
Adam’s Peak
What attracts tourists to Adam’s Peak? First of all, a unique attraction is the imprint of the foot, which, according to representatives of different religions, belongs to Adam, Buddha or Shiva who descended from heaven. For the people of Sri Lanka, Adam’s Peak is a sacred place and everyone must visit here. Tourists arrive at different times to climb the mountain, but the largest flow of foreigners is observed from December to May.
After climbing the mountain, the locals, most of whom are Buddhists, pray, falling to the sacred footprint, and perform rituals. Tourists at this time inspect the area, make breathtaking and delightful photos, admire the delightful views. Surrounded by fog and dense vegetation, Adam’s Peak really seems to be a mysterious place, bringing people something unknown and sacred.
“I heard a lot about Adam’s Peak and, going there, prepared thoroughly. I will say right away that you need to think through everything to the smallest detail. Handrails, which, by the way, are not everywhere on the stairs, are ice, so it is better to take gloves. Sitting on the bare cold stones of the top is not comfortable – I took a folding seat, warm things are necessarily needed, including a hat. The wind is piercing.”
Climbing Adam’s Peak
Going to the main attraction of Sri Lanka, you should know that the ascent to Adam’s Peak is long and difficult. But, despite this, to their surprise, tourists meet on the trail and disabled and elderly people and young children, most of whom are locals.
The way to the main shrine of the island takes at least two hours. It is best to climb in the night and early morning hours, when the sun has not yet risen, and the air has not heated up from the hot rays. Guides recommend taking with you on the road:
- water or drinks;
- warm clothes;
- Lights.
For foreigners, tours usually start at 3 a.m. Coming out at this time, you can expect that, having climbed to the top, an incredibly beautiful dawn will open to the eye and it will be possible to photograph the sun rising from behind the ostrogs of the mountains.
“We went to Adam’s Peak in May. The weather was excellent, the island was the usual heat. The enthusiasm with which we began the climb began to fade halfway through. Several times we stopped near the chapels to sit and relax. Going down because of fatigue wasn’t much easier. Photographing the main shrine of Sri Lanka is forbidden, but from here you can take magnificent pictures of the horizon line with a blazing dawn. “
Stairway to Heaven: 5200 steps
To the main shrine of the island is a long staircase of 5200 steps. In some places they are destroyed, which makes the ascent difficult. Climbing the stairs you can relax in several tea rooms, where drinks and food are sold. The staircase is illuminated by lanterns, and if you look at the slope of the mountain at night, thanks to the lights, it looks especially impressive.
On a not too wide staircase is always very crowded. Two streams – up and down – move simultaneously, like two snakes crawling in different directions side by side. In some places, the staircase becomes more gentle, and in others especially steep, turning into wooden bridges, along which travelers cross gorges with mountain streams and rivulets.
The higher you climb the steps, the colder it becomes, and the wind literally penetrates to the bones, so it is recommended not to remove jackets and jackets. To forget about the cold of tourists and locals makes the sight of the rising sun, and a bright yellow sunset plunges into a state of awe even not too religious people.
“We climbed Adam’s Peak in November. The weather was disgusting, Cold. At this time, the stairs are not illuminated by lanterns. A beam that hits from a portable flashlight, allows you to see no more than a meter of steps under your feet. We saw monkeys along the way. At the top you can go to the temple, but you need to take off your shoes – your feet are very cold. But the very realization that we were able to rise and see this sacred relic – the foot of a man, is delightful.”
Place for pilgrims
If foreigners most often climb adam’s peak to admire the sunset and the view from the top of the mountain, the locals come here to perform a sacred ritual. Both young and old climbing to the top, strive, squeezing through the crowd, to approach the footprint and touch it with their lips. It does not matter which of the four religions the believer belongs to.
Climbing to the holy place does not end even in the rainy season, when climbing the stairs is not only uncomfortable, but sometimes dangerous. In good weather, the glare of the sun is reflected on the one-and-a-half-meter foot, giving it a special mystery. Next to the observation deck on the top of the mountain, several temples have been built, which can be visited by representatives of different religions.
Still climbing the stairs, you can see several temples, awakened monks, who begin to engage in everyday chores. At the top of the mountain there are several temples, the main of which is Buddhist. And next to it there are chapels belonging to different denominations.
“For physically unprepared people, climbing a mountain is quite difficult. My legs hurt for a few more days, and during the ascent I kept thinking about why I would do this. But, having climbed Adam’s Peak, I did not regret that I got involved in this adventure. A magnificent landscape, a beautiful Buddhist temple, the sacred relic itself – the foot. From the sight of people who kneel before her, there is some indescribable feeling. “
Butterfly Mountain
The locals call the mountain and Adam’s Peak Sirifada, which means “Glorified Footprint”, but this attraction of the island has another name that it received, thanks to the huge number of butterflies arriving at the sacred place in the last hours of their lives and ending their short existence here.
Inside the stone foot, rainwater often accumulates, in which you can see a huge number of butterflies. It is believed that they fly to the sacred place to end their lives next to Saman, a sacred mystical deity who the locals think provides protection to the mountain. Those who believe in this legend call the hill butterfly Mountain or Samanaly Kanda.
“A rather heavy climb justifies the admiration you feel when you climb Adam’s Peak. The magnificent landscape, dawn and the view of the sun rising above the peaks is simply indescribable. Even the photos don’t convey all the splendor. And yes, it is better to take water with you, you will definitely want to drink, and local merchants sell drinks here at a very high price. “
On Adam’s Peak climb tourists from different countries. If for locals this hike is an integral part of the life of every believer, then travelers make this journey to get acquainted with one of the main attractions of Sri Lanka and admire the beautiful landscapes. Undoubtedly, the best time to hike is the winter and spring months, when it rarely rains on the island, and the weather is quite comfortable to climb the steep stairs. In the summer, when the rainy season begins in Sri Lanka, slippery steps can be dangerous.New Huddersfield Town signing Tommy Elphick comes to the club not only looking to add competition to Jan Siewert's centre-back options, but to act as a trusted senior general in a dressing room that contains more than a few younger faces - and if you ask any of his former managers or teammates, he is perfect for that role.
The first positive omen for Town fans is that Elphick has been involved in no fewer than four promotion campaigns over his career.
First, he helped Brighton finish as League One champions in 2010/11, earning the respect of then-Seagulls manager Gus Poyet for his exemplary attitude after losing his place in the side due to the undroppable form of his teammates.
Poyet said: "He has been a true professional, impressive. Many other players in his situation would be moaning and complaining and trying to leave but he has been outstanding in those terms.
"He wasn’t happy but he was training, even more than the rest. He asked to train a few days when we were off, he asked to play in the reserves and we had to stop him because they were not the best games for him.
"I think it’s an example for the rest of the players and they are the players you want at the club. It’s been an absolute pleasure to have a player like that during a difficult time for him."
Elphick missed the entire 2011/12 season for Brighton with an Achilles injury, and upon making a successful recovery moved across the south coast to help Bournemouth finish as runners-up in the same division two years later.
The 6'2" defender was then ever-present as captain during Bournemouth's Championship title-winning season in 2014/15, and started all of the Cherries' first five games in the Premier League before going down with a recurrence of his Achilles injury, which kept him out for much of the season.
Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe was full of praise for his skipper upon his departure in 2016, telling the Bournemouth Echo: "Tommy has played a key role in the incredible journey we have been on and has been a big part of a team which has created some wonderful memories for a lot of people and everyone connected with the club would like to thank him for his efforts.
"He has been an incredible servant and the most successful captain in the club’s history. He led the club and the team with real distinction, both on and off the pitch. He was also a great ambassador and someone I really enjoyed working with.
"Tommy has a real winner’s mentality and that was very evident to me as soon as I started working with him. He never lost it for a second and was always fiercely determined to do his best at all times. He is a person of great character and an inspiration to all, especially his team-mates.
"A lot of what Tommy did our supporters didn't see. The way he was with his team-mates in training and the way he communicated with the squad away from the pitch were top class.
"You need players to set the standard and the culture of the football club and Tommy was a fierce protector of everything we did. That is why I think him and I had such a good relationship and why everyone in the squad respected him so much."
He recovered well enough to earn a move to newly-relegated Aston Villa in summer 2016, and spent the first half of last season on loan at Hull City.
The impact he made to the Hull side is revealed through the statistics: the Tigers conceded 1.22 goals per game with Elphick in the side, but 1.64 per game without him - an increase of 34%. Coincidentally, one of the goals they conceded without Elphick was scored by the man himself, as he got on the scoresheet to help Villa to a 3-1 win on the opening day of the season.
That convinced the Villans to bring back their former captain for the second half of the season, and he started 10 games in a row from New Year's Day onwards before suffering a fractured ankle in the 4-0 win over Derby that would serve as a preview of Villa's eventual playoff final triumph.
True to his reputation, Elphick continued to behave as a consummate professional behind the scenes, with Tyrone Mings - who also played with Elphick at Bournemouth - lauding him for his impact behind the scenes even during his imposed absence.
Mings told Villa's official website: "Tommy has been brilliant. He’s really helped. He’s a big influence in the dressing room. He’s a big character.
"You can’t underestimate him here – and for me settling in either.
"I obviously played with him at the start when I joined. He’s a good player. He’s a good talker.
"Obviously, off the field, I have known him for a long time and he’s a really top guy. He’s helped me."2.0 L, 4 cyl, Auto (S6), Regular Gasoline

On this Memorial Day weekend, many in the area might be laying by the pool, but imagine laying by this pool.
If you’ve got $1.4 million and want to live in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, that can be your life.
This five-bedroom, five-bathroom home boasts, in the house description, that a former Flyer was once the owner. While it does not appear to be his current residence, Flyers legend Bobby Clarke has been quoted as saying he lived in this location, but moved after realizing the house was too private and he enjoyed having neighbors.
That’s good enough for me.
As for the house, it’s located in a private area of New Jersey and is just as beautiful on the outside. While the inside could use some updating, this could be the perfect project home for someone with a lot of cash. The backyard speaks for itself, with that tremendous pool, where you could party like it’s 1975, and tennis court. The inside also has tons of room for entertaining to go along with a beautiful kitchen and bedrooms with tons of closet space.
This home was, presumably, purchased by Clarke in 1982 for $350,000 and doesn’t appear to have had much work done on the inside. That being said, it looks like this house has incredible bones and could have the makings of something spectacular with a little elbow grease.
So, if you want to say you lived in the same house as an NHL Hall of Famer and have a pool that maybe even Gritty would come over for a dip in, this is the one for you.

Three Victorian Australian Wool Network (AWN) clients have recently received returns up to 8000 cents per kilogram for their elite ultrafine and superfine fleece lines.
The top price in the nation last week went to the Mibus family's Glenara Merino stud at Dunkeld, Vic, when a line of 13.7-micron wool sold for 8000c/kg.
Glenara stud principal Trevor Mibus is a fourth-generation superfine woolgrower, having been in the family since 1920.
Mr Mibus said the 8000c/kg was well beyond their expectations.
"We were hoping for about 5500 cents as there had been wool selling for around that mark and up to 6000 cents," Mr Mibus said.
"It is well above what we have sold for a while. I went back 10 years and couldn't find anything near that.
"In 2012 we made $20/kg and in 2019 we sold four bales for $18-$19/kg."
 515 hectares," he said.
"Our average micron is 16.2, but I have a few clients who want these finer types."
Paul Reid, and his father Bill, from Bairnsdale had their expectations exceeded when a line of 13.4 micron wool attracted 6600c/kg.
Mr Reid said he was pleasantly surprised by the auction outcome.
.''
We're very happy. We know the ultrafines are hot at the moment but this certainly exceeded our expectations
The season also opened on a high note for Leon Phillips of 'Rosari' Wodonga when his ultrafine offering was knocked down for 8100c/kg.

Market hits sweet spot for fine wool growers, but for how long?
EMI lifts but market remains volatile," Mr Shelley said.
"They have stuck with it through years of market volatility and are now being rewarded for the quality product they are delivering.
"The Mibus' have very good sheep with high quality wools. This wool will be processed in Europe for a specialty order. The market is pushing very hard for these types of wools and we haven't seen this in a long time.''.''

Normally, intelligence and education are aides to acquiring true beliefs. But when an individual has non-epistemic belief preferences, this need not be the case; high intelligence and extensive knowledge of a subject may even worsen an individual’s prospects for obtaining a true belief…
Later, he says,.
As we approach an election, we should be in awe of the irrationality being expressed. Read Huemer’s essay before you vote.

Nov 5 2006 at 8:30pm
I thought Huemer’s article was interesting, even while flawed.
First, why was it interesting? I think it is true that people make political and economic decisions “irrationally” in the sense those decisions are often motivated by the desire for validation. That is, one might adopt a certain political belief for reasons of social image. Likewise, one might buy an extra fancy automobile for reasons of social image. Both decisions derive from an irrational insecurity concerning one’s worth. It is also true that many people do gravitate towards facts that seem to support their normative beliefs. This is called confirmation bias. Either confusion leads them one to fail to recognize that IS is not OUGHT or alternatively, rationally believe that others will confuse the two and thus it is best to advocate one side of the other of a contested factual issue.
Overall, the article offers nothing non-obvious as a proposed solution to such irrationality, except for traditional answers: heightened awareness of our biases, a careful examination of the evidence, etc. This is mostly good advice, but there is nothing new here.
I do have some criticisms for this article. It appears to me that the author exhibits the very irrationality that he examines in the article.
His first mistake is talking about “political disagreement” in general. Much better would be to talk about the subset of political disagreement to which these biases are most applicable. The set of things that we label “political” is huge. A large subset of political disagreements are simply irresolvable by reference to facts, but are simply moral to the core.
An example of a moral disagreements are views on abortion and animal rights. At what point does a “human” life worthy of protection by the government begin? At conception, at viability, at birth, or at some other time? The political disagreement here is completely unresolvable with reference to any facts that might come into existence.
That the author makes much of the correlation between beliefs about abortion and animal rights is misguided. The number of people with strong beliefs about animal rights is exceedingly small. The vast majority of people eat meat that is produced by killing animals. The vast majority of people, those against abortion included, do not think we should inflict unnecessary suffering on the animals we kill for food. So, empirically, the number of people on each side of the abortion issue is quite large. In contrast, most people agree about animal rights.
To the extent that there is a small correlation here, it should not be suprising. Many people who are against abortion are against abortion for religious reasons. And that same religion instructs that animals are here for our use. Should we really be suprised that the many religious people who oppose abortion are not animal rights activists? Should we even be suprised that many people who have sympathy for born animals do not have much sympathy for unborn fetuses? I don’t buy the argument that a belief in protecting animals must be logically correlated with a belief in protecting fetuses. It all depends on how you conceptualize the world. For the author to assert these things should be logically correlated is to do nothing more than elevate is own conception, which is not particularly rational (nor irrational) but is rather merely his arbitrary conception not shared by most people. From a secular and neutral perspective, there is no non-arbitrary answer to the question of how much weight animal rights activists ought to give to the fact of birth and there is no non-arbitrary answer to whether or not religious people ought to belief all the religious doctrines that they are taught.
Another problem with Huemer’s article starts right from the beginning. .”
Actually, most people, at least in the United States, agree on a vast number of political issues. Should murder be legal or illegal? Illegal. Should sex with children be legal or illegal? Illegal. Should someone accused of a crime have a right to a trial to determine their guild or innocence, or should we just lynch them? Trial. Should elected officials be able to murder, rape, and torture common citizens? No. Should we torture the animals we kill for food. No. Etc. Etc. The number of political issues we agree on is enormous. In the sense, politics is not that different from these other subjects.
Overall, this is only the tip of the iceberg concerning the serious problems with Huemer’s article. But I will mention the most serious, and I think irrational problem. Huemer has a thesis to advance. That most political disagreements are due to irrationality, rather than, say, normative disagreements. This is an empirical question. Yet what I see here is that Huemer has very strong beliefs, and he is not really talking about the empirical data that would help resolve his claim.
We do know this. Political disagreements can be thought to arise from irrationality, normative disagreements, and probably most often, both. We also know that Huemer has arbitrarily elevated on source of disagreement and downplayed his others using an arbitrary and particularized conception of the world. It appears to me that Huemer is adopting the conception of the world that most likely advances his thesis (as when he asserts that normative beliefs concerning the protection of animals should be correlated with normative beliefs concerning abortion). That is in itself irrational. Overall, Huemer irrationally gives more weight to one cause of political disagreement than another, using an personal conception of the world rather than either looking to empirical data or alternative (and I would argue, more persuasive) conceptions of the world. So he is irrationally arguing for irrationality as the primary cause of political disagreement. Amusing.

voting hardly matters unless one’s vote has a seizable power. In modern democracy the power of vote is so miniscule and close to an epsilon tending towards zero that its exercise or not hardly makes a difference to the person who excercises it. Voting will be only effective when a persons action results in clustering of large of epsilon votes into a number which though is small is still larger than insignifcant epsilon.
Modern democracy and corpoerate society sufferes from the this principal agent problem wherein due to distribution of the principal’s power into large number of miniscule entities called voters or shareholders the actual power still remains with the agent, who understands that it is impossible for all the principal to cluster into a seizable population in order to enforce that the agent works on the behalf of the principal and not indulge in self-fullfilling endeavors.
Hence, any form of democracy or corporate structure is bound to have principal agent problem in voting

I agree with Raj Yashwant. Voting does not have sizeable benefits for the individual exercising the vote. That Mankiw votes tells us that he is not merely maximizing his utility by following his lower-order inclinations, but is instead aligning his actions with some other principle.
Overall, there is no doubt that as Raj says, the principle agent problem exists for both democracy and corporations. In both cases, the agent is only partially accountable to the principle. However, in both cases, there is some accountability. Voters in a democracy do exercise some discipline, as does the legal system. Markets in the corporate contexts also provide some discipline. (Of course, one wonders how much in the corporate contexts, where managers who run a corporations badly enough to be subject to a corporate takeover save themselves with so-called golden parachutes that provide enormous compensation.)

I find it bizarre that anyone should expect humans to be rational – given our evolutionary history, and the fact that our extra intelligence is mostly social intelligence – to do with understanding, predicting and manipulating the behavior of others.
The near-impossibility of arguing people out of political, social and religious beliefs is the same phenomenon as the impossibility of arguing deluded patients out of their false persecutory or jealous beliefs.
This is because we evaluate these things in the light of assumed intentions, not ‘the facts’. So, the same comment from a Democrat or a Republican is interpreted quite differently, becuase we assume different motivations.
The trouble is that we tend to assume morally-wicked intentions of people with whom we disagree. This leads to a lot of trouble.Clickfunnels And Paypal could brainstorm a method. Clickfunnels And Paypal.

Increasing access to the great outdoors doesn’t refer only to large projects, such as setting aside parks and preserving working land and waterways. It can also be accomplished at a local level to ensure that people have access to the outdoors in their own communities.
We are proud to play this role within the conservation movement. We work specifically within The Conservation Fund’s Resourceful Communities (RC) program to create opportunities that preserve the rural landscape, lift people out of poverty and celebrate our partner communities’ unique cultures. RC focuses on capacity building for grassroots organizations, increasing community-level conservation opportunities. We work with a network of 700 grassroots and community organizations, and we take a balanced “triple bottom-line” approach that generates environmental stewardship, economic development, and social justice benefits.
In Henderson, NC, we’ve had the privilege to partner with Green Rural Redevelopment Organization (GRRO), a nonprofit organization that is revitalizing the landscape by converting empty lots in the middle of the city into micro-market farms. Complete with walk-up farmstands, these micro-farms are creating profitable entrepreneurship opportunities and increasing access to fresh, healthy local produce in an economically-depressed food desert area.
GRRO is headed by Henry Crews, who started a community garden in the empty lot beside his house after retiring and moving back to his hometown of Henderson, NC. People were very interested in this community garden and wanted to join him in raising produce. He turned the community garden into a demonstration farm.
After seeing the demand for his products, Crews knew he needed to reach out and make connections to increase production of his garden. GRRO has formed partnerships and promoted collaborations among agencies across the city, including local government agencies, police, and schools. With these relationships, they have been able to secure contracts to transform vacant lots in the city of Henderson into micro-farms.
Without connecting these gardeners to the world of farming by USDA standards, these communities in Henderson would be missing out on resources, and the city of Henderson wouldn’t reap the benefits of the beauty gardening work can add to these communities.
As the Community Food Coordinator for Resourceful Communities, Jesalyn supports GRRO and other community organizations that are increasing access to local foods in low-income areas. RC provided a grant to help them purchase the materials necessary for getting their project into action. Her role has been to provide training and technical assistance in
GRRO continues to make a significant impact on their community. Their model promotes environmental stewardship through their commitment to growing organic produce through sustainable farming methods. Their demonstration garden is often used as a community space to do environmental education, and residents are spending more and more time outdoors and eating more healthy local foods. Their project also promotes sustainable economic development by increasing local small-business entrepreneurship opportunities. Individuals are starting their own small businesses as farmers while meeting a local need: the demand for fresh produce in a food-desert area.
GRRO's model also promotes social justice on a number of levels. Their work supports farmer-entrepreneurs of color who are selling accessible healthy local food in a low-income food desert area. Moreover, through their work, they are turning former empty lots into community assets, increasing access to both healthy food and safe, accessible outdoor opportunities.
The Conservation Fund is redefining conservation to make it relevant to the lives of everyday people in all communities. Our partnership with GRRO is a great example of how community-scale conservation work emphasizing small landscapes is just as important and effective as projects focused on large acreage, and can make significant, positive differences in communities.“We wanted to create a super premium Finnish vodka that truly embodies Tom of Finland – something bold, daring, flirtatious and playful, just like the artist’s renowned work,” said Olli Hietalahti, CEO of Spirit of Tom.

Asymptotic Analysis: Meaning of Function Domination - Expii
What do we mean when we say exponential functions dominate polynomials, or that linear functions are dominated by quadratics? Domination is a highly informal term relating two functions. We say that one function dominates another if the magnitude of the ratio of the first function to the second increases without bound as the input increases without bound. You can phrase this in terms of infinite limits at infinity.The cross section polisher is used for two different purposes:
It can be used - according to its original purpose - for a smooth ion polishing of materials cross-sections that cannot be processed by other means such as mechanical or electro-chemical polishing. This gives the possibility to perform cross-sections of stacks of different materials, powder particles, porous materials, or even plastics and paper. Figure 1 shows the procedure for producing a cross-section through a fracture surface, unveiling the deformation processes happening underneath the surface. Therefore, the rough fracture surface is filled with epoxy and subsequently the argon ion beam removes material that is not protected by a sputtering mask (Figure 2).
The second, even more important purpose, is the pre-preparation of materials for subsequent FIB-production of miniaturized specimens for micro- and nano-mechanics, as documented below:(IN)JUSTICE INTERNATIONAL WELCOMES YOU
In Our Fight Against:
Conflict, Struggle, Divergence, Incarceration, Discrimination, Segregation, Exclusion, Marginalisation & Violence.
WHO WE ARE
(In)Justice International is a not-for-profit multidisciplinary global collective accessible to all
Our aim is to uncover, expose and publicise injustices/atrocities committed against the environment, Indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, refugees, disabled people, the so-called ‘troublesome youth’ and people from poorer class backgrounds. Injustices inflicted against gender ‘difference’ is also an important consideration. Moreover, research from social policy, sociology, politics, disability studies, human geography, economics, criminology, legal activism, migration studies and investigative reporting are reflected in our dissemination of such nefarious acts through books, journals, newsletters, workshops and annual conventions.
Although many of our techniques deployed are considered to be separate disciplines, this is not the case. Each complements each other. Rather than being confined to public administration, legal definitions and descriptions of socio-economic conditions as they are manifest in a specific moment in time, the uncovered revelations of ‘social harm’ and heinous practices will go beyond empirical declarations to explain why—whether it be good or bad—society and/or the economic environment has come to be in the condition that it is. Genocide, war, class, gender, social exclusion, (institutional) discrimination and racism, migration, (social) media influence and public perception/actions are prominent aspects of our dissemination process in a dedicated opposition to (anti-)social injustice.
On one side of the coin, theoretical knowledge combined with an awareness of influential social theorists (of the past or present) helps in the understanding of why political polices and directions are embarked upon. On the other, the use of factual and statistical data underlines the consequences of such policy making. Indeed, with this theoretical knowledge and factual reinforcement, it is then possible to devise a solution to destructive/oppressive circumstances when possible and necessary. Historical analysis and theory in conjunction with knowledge of economic socio-political conditions, influences and outcomes also enhances understanding and, with this combination of theory and factual information (historical or contemporary), a more critical, wide-ranging approach can be taken toward the actions of government: thus, the strengths of our interdisciplinary approach is to equip our books, journals and workshops/conventions with the necessary tools to promote deeper more holistic interpretations of what the likely consequences of political decision-making could/does result in and, in so doing, provide a platform upon which effective action, remedies, resolutions and recompense (should such consequences already be apparent) can be instigated and achieved.

"Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does"Covid-19 and
animal research
The Covid-19 pandemic has required international collaboration by the biomedical community on an unprecedented scale. Animal research has played a critical role in helping researchers understand the virus itself, the mechanics of its transmission, and the safety and efficiency of all the vaccines so far produced to bring the end of the pandemic a step closer.
EARA has produced a global interactive map to show what biomedical research was conducted using animal models, the species used and its location, including in 24 European countries.
How were animals used in the lead up to Covid-19?
The vaccines for Covid-19 were developed in record time, with three successful vaccines available within a year of the disease emerging. This was because animal research had already paved the way for basic research and drug development to go ahead without delay once the genome of SARS-CoV-2 had been established.
Mouse models used to study the disease had already been generated years previously, for the study of other coronaviruses such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Disease (MERS). As mice are not directly affected by the coronavirus themselves, the availability of this model meant that the disease could quickly be studied in the context of how the virus would affect human cells, without the need to breed a mouse with the specific mutation.
Vaccine research was also already in progress before the emergence of Covid-19. mRNA vaccines have been under development for many years thanks to initial research in mice and the understanding the mRNA could be manipulated to produce an immune response in the body. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine also relied on previous generation of part of the vaccine which had been trialled as a candidate for vaccines against coronaviruses. Once the SARS-CoV-2 genome was available, the researchers could add this to their existing knowledge to generate a vaccine more quickly.
Which animals were used to help us understand Covid-19?
Before a vaccine can be developed, scientists first had to understand how to stop the spread of the virus in the body and how it interacts with cells and tissues. To do this, an animal model was often studied to help improve understanding of the biology of the viral infection.
Key animal species used in this research included:
Mice and rats – genetically altered mice that have had their immune systems modified to mimic the human system have been used to understand how the virus can affect the immune system and cause disease symptoms.
Ferrets – research has shown that ferrets and other members of the weasel family (e.g. mink) can be infected by coronaviruses and exhibit similar symptoms as humans. This makes them a useful tool to study the symptoms of infection, as well as how the virus can spread from animal to animal.
Monkeys – thanks to their similarity to humans, monkeys are a valuable model to understand how the virus will affect the immune system. While most research is conducted with rhesus macaques to understand the workings of the virus, baboons have also been used to study the potential consequences of Covid-19 infection in an older population, or in patients with underlying diseases.
Hamsters – these animals are also susceptible to infection by coronaviruses, and were used extensively in SARS research in the early 2000s. Research conducted with hamsters highlighted the potential benefits of transferring blood serum from individuals who had recovered from Covid-19 infection to patients currently suffering with the disease.
Dogs – studies showed that dogs could be trained to identify humans with a Covid-19 infection using their sense of smell, which has been trialled in airports as a means of screening arrivals.
How are animals used while developing a vaccine?
When researchers have a vaccine candidate, it must first go through preclinical testing to ensure that the vaccine is safe and effective. This is often first conducted in mice to investigate whether an appropriate immune response can be generated, and later in monkeys to see how well the vaccine can protect an individual from infection.
Were animal tests skipped while developing Covid-19 vaccines?
During the Covid-19 pandemic, the European Medicine’s Agency issued new advice which allowed researchers to conclude efficacy trials in animals alongside the first Phase I clinical trials in humans, speeding up the vaccine development process. This article from AP News gives an excellent overview.
However, no animal testing stages were actually skipped in this process. The initial preclinical safety testing in mice and monkeys is necessary before progressing to clinical trials, to ensure that the vaccine is safe, and will not make the infection worse or have unwanted side effects. This overlapping of the early phases, rather than sequentially, was due to data evidence from the animal trials that this was safe to do so.
How is animal research used to develop other treatments for Covid-19?
A variety of animal species have been used during the search for treatments to help reduce symptoms for those who have been infected with the virus. Research in Belgium into potential antibody treatments has involved the use of llamas and alpacas, thanks to their ability to produce smaller forms of antibodies, known as nanobodies that are effective in blocking the SARS-CoV-2 route of entry into cells.
Large mammals such as pigs and sheep have also been valuable in Covid-19 research, for the production and development of ventilators which have been essential for patients with severe Covid-19 infections.

It is facilitating and providing services to the communities, organizations, government and other national and international agencies since 1999. Aranya has well experienced professionals with a maximum of 25 years of experience in environment and development sectors.
About ARANYA
Aranya Agriculture.
VISION :
Achieving Ecological and sustainable agricultural livelihoods through permaculture farming practices for a Green Globe..
OBJECTIVES:
ENHANCED FIELD PRESENCE/PERMACULTURAL PRACTICES - A RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES
Aranya has developed Permaculture farms in 11.5 acres (5 hectares) in Bidakanne village, Jharasangam mandal, Medak district, Andhra Pradesh with ecofriendly methods , i.e farming without disturbing the laws of nature. All the permaculture practices are being followed vis-à-vis seed sowing to seed storing. This farm has the resilience to vagaries of nature. Regenerating the soils along with agricultural practices is unique in this farm. As a result the production has increased many folds in comparison have been propagated in several other areas too for individuals and communities, these are also model farms adaptable for subsistence farming in rain fed areas. The permaculture farm involve environment permaculture.
PRO-POOR INNOVATION – SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOODS PROMOTION THROUGH NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
ARANYA believes on sustainable agriculture and mostly subsistence farming systems for enhanced food security and ensures sustainability of livelihoods through Natural Resource Management. The sustainability depends on the management systems to access, control and manage forest, water, soil, and vegetation and livestock resources.
Major NRM initiatives in Adilabad
A) Soil water conservation works
B) Biodiversity Conservation
C) Water resource management
D) Green Resource management & development
In tune with Aranya’s objectives, programmes on Natural Resources Management were launched and implemented since 2001 and till day being continued through several projects .
A ) SOIL WATER CONSERVATION WORKS
WATERSHED PROGRAMMES
The Successful implementation of food for work programme by involving local communities and women which attracted the attention of the local district Administration resulted in ARANYA’s services requisitioned by DWMA (formerly DPAP) to implement Watershed Programme in 5 villages in the Nyalkal Mandal in 2001-02, viz., 1. Nyamathabad, 2. Ramtheertham, 3. Rukmapur, 4. Shamshallapur, and 5. Tekur.
These 5 watershed villages are very challenging as soil was degraded to a big extent, where ARANYA is still struggling to create model watersheds without compromising on certain issues like community participation, transparency, accountability and ethics. It is the strong conviction of ARANYA that by implementing watershed programme effectively most of the natural resources can be well conserved. ARANYA conceives watershed programme not as a simple activity/project but as an integrated approach to conserve the natural resources, which requires commitment and ideological base.
As a part of this project the following activities have been carried out;
VEGETATION DEVELOPMENT :
Soil erosion losses majorly can be arrested through vegetation development and Aranya focuses on these conservation practices integrating them in farm management through promotion of bund farming,live fences,contour/terrace farming,orchard management,seed dibbling practices,stylo broadcasting to check erosion e.t.c.Such practices have been promoted and implemented in cohesion with the operational activities of several projects like watershed,TDF,APLIP,APCBTMP and through all permaculture development projects with special focus on Arid and semi Arid areas emhasising adaption by small and marginal farmers.
B ) BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION :
SEED BANKS DEVELOPMENT
As a first step to kick start the Biodiversity activities seed production has been taken up in these villages by organising formal groups of farmers. These Farmers’ Groups also started the savings on the lines of Self Help Groups’ concept.
Initially ARANYA procured superior quality seed with good yield pedigree from the villages and distributed them in 5 village in Kadam Mandal in Adilabad district: 1) Masaipet,2)Lachanna Yellapur, 3)Narsapur, 4)Yelgadapa and 5)Petharpu selectively for two farmers in each village provided they return 1.5 times the quantity provided. These farmers provided with foundation seed were given orientation training on seed production, taken for exposure/learning visits also follow ups were done to monitor their progress.
More number of farmers joined the scheme in the following seasons and was supplied seed on similar conditions. This way the villages have become self sufficient in respect of seed availability. This scheme actually an age old informal practice whereby every village had such Seed Bank was revived. Farmers were explained about the importance of these banks and made aware of the necessity to restore such good old practices. The local Agriculture Officer and the govt Agriculture department was also involved to provided technical and advisory support to the farmers.
Several Biodiversity conservation works have been undertaken by Aranya as an environmental organizations through several practices adopted in other projects like NEAC, NATECO, also promotion through APLIP,TDF & APCBTMP.
C) WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT
Aranya focused on water resource management by promoting several alternative managing systems focused on practices like multi cropping to shift from mono cropping, crop diversification practices in command areas, micro nutrients applications ,conjunctive use of water ,early nurseries under bore wells and so on majorly through participatory irrigators management as a part of implementation of Swarna medium irrigation project since 2007,later also covered 8 minor irrigation tanks, Also recently in 2012 through SEMP Social and Environment management programme under AP water sector reforms is taking up interrelated activities in water logged, saline and seepage regions of command areas, identifying problem, remedies, facilitating linkages between govt. and farmers and implementing the requisite practices.
SYSTEM OF RICE INTENSIFICATION
NABARD promotes the new innovative technologies for betterment of farming community. SRI elaborated as System of Rice Intensification in paddy is one such technology through which the farming community gets benefited with more yield, revenue, water resource management and practice of an eco friendly system. Aranya as a PIA is effectively implementing the SRI projects in command areas of three mandals (Nirmal, Dilwara and Sarangapoor) since 2010-11 in Adilabad District.
The activities of facilitation by Aranya include engagement of facilitator services, training on SRI concept, identification of farmers for SRI adoption, orientation on advantages of SRI concept land preparations , nursery raising ,transplantation, hand holding support, providing timely input support and monitoring of the progress.
D) GREEN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT & DEVELOPMENT
INTEGRATED AGRISYSTEMS/TREE BASED FARMING
The natural ways of farming, alternative farming practices and forest farming has always been the core philosophy of operation of Aranya ,APLIP project since 2007 covering 2 mndls, 2300 farmers and TDF since 2008 covering 12 mndls, 1000 acres/tribal hamlets are few brick stones which paved way and are going on for establishment of the above said tree based farming adaptations. Specially through TDF, Aranya is enabling 1000 acres horticulture plantation for the tribal families under which each family is supported by an acre of fruit plantation (Mango and Amla) and is taken up in 3 mandals of Adilabad since 2008 to empowered and enhance sustainability of livelihoods for 1000 tribal families in seven years.
Through Natueco farming practices initiated since 2010-11 in two villages ie Dhani and Jam villages of Sarangapoor mandal of Adilabad district, Aranya is implementing establishment of 20 demonstration plots through 10 Gunta model and development of Homestead gardens through Gangamma model.
Sustainable livelihoods promotion has been done by several of the following activities through several operational projects.ma-training centers in unit areas to be covered under NATECO and inter related projects. The eventual aim is to provide knowledge based resources to small and.Take Me Away

cleaning supplies, carpet extractor, vacuum cleaner, vacuum cleaners, cleaning carpets, portable carpet extractor, carpet spotter, carpet fan
Article Body:. Carpet extractors rented from janitorial distributors are usually in better condition and provide more suction. These professional types of portable carpet extractors can usually be rented for a little more than the cost of renting one from a local hardware or grocery store. Also by going to a professional cleaning supplies distributor you are likely to find better carpet cleaning products than at your local grocery store.
When you go to rent your carpet extractor make sure you have the janitorial supplies distributor go through the workings of the machine thoroughly. Janitorial distributors sell professional and industrial carpet cleaning supplies everyday and are well versed in recommending the right carpet cleaning products for your individual needs. Always ask if there are other attachments that can be rented for the carpet extractor so that you can clean your furniture and drapes at the same time. If you’re going to rent a carpet extractor for a 24 hour period is advisable to get as much use out of it as possible.
After you have purchased all your carpet cleaning chemicals and have rented your carpet extractor it’s time to start cleaning your carpets. First try to move as much furniture out of the room as possible to have a clear path for extractor. Vacuum the carpet thoroughly to remove as mush large debris as possible before using the carpet extractor. If you have extra dirty traffic lane stains it is recommended that you spray these areas with professional traffic lane cleaner and follow the manufacturers’ recommendations for use. It is usually easier to spray traffic lane cleaner onto the dirty areas with a common garden pump up sprayer. Make sure to clean the garden pump sprayer before use to remove any residual chemicals from gardening.
After the traffic lane cleaner has had time work you can beginning extracting the carpets. When mixing your extraction solution for the carpet extractor, make sure to follow the manufacturers’ recommendations. Mix the precise amount of water with the extraction solution and try to get the water as hot as possible. When you extract and clean carpets hot water will get your carpets cleaner than using cold water. When you are using a carpet extractor make sure to make a cross hatch pattern with your cleaning lanes. First do the entire room in strips going one way the extract over the strips at a 90 degree angle going the other way. After you have extracted the entire room it’s time to perform a thorough rinse of your carpets. When rinsing the carpet extract the room with cold water to remove any detergents and extraction solution. If you do not rinse your carpets thoroughly your carpet can act like a dirt magnet after it dries. At the end of your rinse cycle the dirty water coming out of the extractor should be a lot clearer than when you started.
After you have extracted your carpets use a dehumidifier and carpet fan if possible, to speed up the drying of the floor. Damp and slowly drying carpets can cause mold and bacteria to grow in the carpet padding. Carpet fans sometimes known as carpet air movers dry the floor quickly by blowing large amounts of air over the carpets surface. The dehumidifier will take the water out of the air as the carpet dries and make your living conditions a little less humid. After your carpets have dried use a vacuum cleaner to remove any hair and lint brought to the surface of the carpet due to the carpet extraction process. Before returning the carpet extractor back to the rental store make sure it is clean and in the same condition you checked it out in to avoid any extra fees for cleaning the unit.PARIS, Sept 12 (Reuters) – VisitorsAdvanced Search

It will enable consistent SD-WAN assurance, application performance and security policies.
MEF is seeking to impose a little order on the fast-and-loose world of software-defined networking (SDN) by becoming the official steward of a growing niche: software-defined wide-area network (SD-WAN) managed services.
Formerly called Metro Ethernet Forum, MEF is a nonprofit international industry association principally tasked with furthering the adoption of Carrier Ethernet networks and services. The group says it's "enabling service providers to create a global ecosystem of networks that deliver agile, assured, and orchestrated services for the digital economy and hyper-connected world."
In seeking to standardize managed services that provide SD-WAN functionality, the association said it will leverage its existing LSO (Lifecycle Service Orchestration) Reference Architecture and Framework (MEF 55), which provides APIs to impose consistency of performance, policy and security of such services orchestrated across multiple provider networks.
The SD-WAN managed services arena features several industry players, including CenturyLink, Cato Networks, Masergy, Versa Networks, Silver Peak, IBM and more.
MEF said its SD-WAN service implementation community has already formulated six major SD-WAN managed services use cases as part of its OpenCS (Open Connectivity Services) SD-WAN Project work, to be followed up by LSO APIs that can "enable consistent SD-WAN assurance, application performance, and security policies, which include telemetry data feeding back into LSO analytic platforms for various AI automated use cases."
Companies spearheading that project include Riverbed and VeloCloud Networks, while Amartus, Cox, Fujitsu Network Communications, GBI, Huawei and Nokia/Nuage have also contributed. Furthermore, Silver Peak and Versa Networks recently joined as MEF members to also contribute to the SD-WAN work.
Along with guiding SD-WAN service implementations, MEF will also promote education efforts via the newly created SD-WAN Market Education Project, created to explain MEF's position on SD-WAN and how it relates to other initiatives dealing with orchestrated Layer 1-7 services enabled by LSO APIs. The association will provide educational materials such as white papers, webinars, workshops and use cases.
"Businesses are demanding WAN flexibility to control costs as they migrate applications to the cloud and see SD-WAN as an option to address this," said Pascal Menezes, CTO of MEF, in a statement last week. "To meet these demands and remain competitive, service providers are looking to integrate SD-WAN into a portfolio of orchestrated services delivered in a seamless, automated fashion. MEF is uniquely positioned to bring together managed service providers (MSPs), orchestration experts, and SD-WAN vendors to address this challenge and accelerate SD-WAN managed service deployments on behalf of the enterprises."
MEF said SD-WAN will be featured in proof-of-concept demonstrations, workshops, sessions and keynotes at the Nov. 13-16 MEF17 global networking event in Orlando, Fla.

The last campaign of Saint Laurent Paris divided the time by before and after, Hedi Slimane took the control of the house to expose the new generation’s manifesto, the “don’t give a fuck” attitude of the era.
An irreverent style, a spirit of rebellion and independence that gets deep into the younger generations and reflects into the fashion culture aswell. A new old movement that reactivates the punk and the wasted youth scene. All of these can be found represented by iconic characters of the industry, like Cole Mohr, Yuri Pleskun and Cara Delevingne (British Top Model), famous world wide by being faces of fashion brands, grunge editorials and style that represents the movement. One of the most popular london tv shows, Skins, also promoted this style, showing young people wasted and partying like the world is ending, what we have called the “don’t give a fuck” attitude and generation. There are several iconic images and inspirations that bring back the grunge which affects deeply into the fashion houses, the new collections and editorials.
Looking through the not so old YSL collections you can find many concepts but same style, classic cuts, colors and hats that mixed with pearls created a “new look” that it was sofisticated but still punk. Now the fashion house have put down the sofisticated and classy look to become a street wear brand, reflecting the new spirit of youth that breaks the rules and hang out with friends, a opened way of life that keeps growing in the younger generations by the popularity of the skate culture, which shares the same ideals and aesthetics, freedom all time.
The Saint Laurent grunge look brings back the scottish shirt, the flaccid fabrics and the rocker boots, remembering us to Kurt Cobain or Courtney Love, icons of the 90’s grunge, the typical “Trainspotting look”. Oversized pieces and long flaccid shirts are part of the trend and it’s part of the industry, appearing in editorials and fashion films, a cool look that represent the state of mind of people on the streets.
The change that involves the fashion house Saint Laurent Paris it also involves the culture and the society, this won’t be the last time that we will see grunge again, it has inspired many fashion houses and campaign, the concept of the 90’s grunge will endure and will be embraced by many brands, magazines and cultures. It’s an “I don’t care” to the whole massive movements, to the retail and to the rules, it’s a mind changing and a way of expressing youth, it’s a rebel thinking agaisnt the common and the good manners, agaisnt potilical views and goverment structures, a youth escape.Concealed Coalition

Their lifestyle is shrouded in mystery. With their disappearance from the galaxy 100,000 years ago, the only records left behind about Forerunner society is the scattered relics, ruins, and artifacts. What is known is that the Forerunners had a caste system composed of Builders, Miners, Lifeworkers, Warrior Servants, and Engineers (in that respective order). Despite the Builders being the highest rate in Forerunner society, the Ecumene Council dictated most Forerunnner affairs and policies.
Just before the Forerunner-Flood War began, there were approximately 22,691,100,000 Forerunners situated in the Orion Arm. This doesn't account for those elsewhere in the galaxy. After the war, that number reduced to about 60 Forerunners.
Contents
History[]
The Forerunners had an empire that spanned across the entire galaxy and their civilization had controlled more than half of the worlds in the Milky Way. Their technology was superior to that of the Covenant and Humankind. In fact, much of the Covenant's technological achievements and religion is based off of recovered Forerunner relics. The United Nations Space Command had even reverse-engineered this technology and integrated it into their own devices.
In their time, the Forerunners were encountered by an intergalactic parasitic disease known as the Flood. The Flood was intelligent and motivated with the single purpose of consuming all life in the galaxy. The parasite spread across hundreds of Forerunner worlds and infected trillions of Forerunners. The more the Flood spread, the stronger it became. It could absorb the memories and knowledge of its victims and use that to coordinate effective strategies against its prey. The parasite could even use the Forerunner's technology in combat.
05-032 Mendicant Bias was the strongest artificial intelligence constructed in order to combat the Flood. Despite its impressive intellect, it fell victim to the logic plague that the Flood used to overpower AI constructs. Mendicant Bias suggests that it had not succumb to the Flood and instead infiltrated the Flood. Bias made the Flood stronger so it would persuade its makers to activate the Halo Array which was the only way to stop the Flood.
While the Flood pressured the Forerunners, their greatest military commanders watched from the Ark and coordinated the ongoing battle at the Maginot Line. This Line was established as a defensive perimeter to protect the remaining worlds in Forerunner space. Mendicant Bias had destroyed the Line, but when he did, the Forerunners had already activated the Halo Array.
The Logician was assigned as an overseer to the Halo Array. He would remain on the rings and assist their monitors; however, he spent most of his time on Installation 01 conducting experiments to stop the Flood. Installation 04 is one of the rings that was left abandoned by the Logician. Fortunately, the monitors were able to care for these rings on their own. Delta Halo hadn't been so lucky though, because it had outbreak issues and maintenance problems.
In 753 B.C.E., the Chulorg made contact with Installation 01 and settled on the ring along with the Logician. The Logician was viewed as a wise and knowledgeable God. In approximately 150 A.D., the Logician abandons the Chulorg and Beta Halo to investigate a signal he received from the Elder Codex.
In his absence and the absence of the Forerunner from the galaxy, civilizations across the galaxy were profiting from Forerunner technology left behind. Eventually, the humans and the Covenant came across the Halo Array. Installation 04 was destroyed to prevent the activation of the ring and spread of the Flood. Installation 05 was discovered and glassed when the Flood outbreak began. The Ark was even destroyed to prevent the activation of the entire array.
When the Logician noticed the destruction of these installations, he returned to Installation 01 to discover humans and Chulorg fighting over the ring. The Logician threatened to destroy the two factions. Putting aside their differences, the humans and Chulorg formed an alliance and defeated the Logician.
Technology[]
The Forerunners have a technologically advanced civilization that is capable of constructing or terraforming entire worlds, building weapons of mass destruction, developing teleportation technology, and constructing robotic and artificial intelligences. Even among their kind, the Halo Array is considered one of their greatest and horrifying achievements.
Halo Array[]
The Halo Array is a network of seven ring worlds scattered throughout the galaxy and acting as weapons that can obliterate all life in the galaxy once activated from the Ark. The Halo Installations have their own environments and structures designed to house life forms during the Conservation Measure. However, the rings are capable of generating a pulse that can destroy organic matter. When the rings are activated simultaneously at the Ark, their pulse radius can cover the entire galaxy, destroying all life and potential Flood food sources. The weapons were designed to starve the Flood. While the galaxy is being cleansed, the Ark and its inhabitants survive from outside the destruction range. Shield Worlds were designed to safeguard life from inside a Slipspace bubble that will protect all from the effects of the array. Installation 01 is distinguished from the other rings because it also serves as a testing ground for ongoing experiments to eliminate the Flood or find a cure should the parasite return. The Logician was designated as the Overseer of the Halo Array; however, he left most of his responsibilities to the designated monitors while he focused on the experimentations on Installation 01.
Helena Fortress[]
The Forerunners have settled on hundreds of worlds and left behind numerous artifacts and technology. Helena was one of their fortress worlds dedicated to their military effort against the Flood. There is a military base on the world; however, it was left guarded and protected from outside visitors. When the UNSC colonized the world, their people were unable to access the fortress because of an invisible dome shield. The fortress has a teleportation portal that connects to a weapons cache on Coral. The portal is no longer accessible as of 2554 due to the destruction of the cache. There are other structures on Helena, but they don't appear to have as great of significance as the main fortress.
Coral Weapons Cache[]
Coral is a distant world that was on end used by the Forerunners presumably as a weapons locker. There is one known structure on the planet that runs deep underground. It contains weapons on end used by the Forerunners during the Flood war. These weapons were studied by the New Colonial Alliance and used to manufacture laser-based weapons. The structure had a teleportation system with portals that connected the Coral to other installations such as the Ark Portal and Helena.
Catalyst[]
The Catalyst is a Forerunner petrification device that turns organic matter into a substance that can fuel their starships and other mechanisms. The Forerunner miners had used this artifact and others like it to turn plant life and deceased animals into fuel for their ships. Because of their beliefs, it was never used on living organisms, with the exception to plants. The Covenant had discovered the Catalyst and it eventually fell into the Jiralhanae's hands. The Catalyst was brought to Roost after the war, and it was stolen by Martin Stone, a cyborg soldier working for the Oversight Committee of the Office of Naval Intelligence. Chairman Ian Rivera saw the artifact's potential as a weapon and sold it to the Nova Adonis whom he believed would use it against the Sangheili and other former Covenant species.
Venedico Artifact[]
The Venedico Artifact is a component used in Forerunner Slipspace drives that is necessary for opening the portal into Slipstream Space. The Covenant discovered this artifact on Venedico a couple of years after glassing the planet. Codenamed: CONDUCTOR learned that the Covenant had found something profound on Venedico, and Spartan-II Silver Team was sent to recover the device in Operation: VERTIGO. The mission was a success, and the device was brought to Algolis to be studied. This technology was reverse engineered and integrated into the UNSC Harbinger as a prototype. It was be further integrated into other starships following the Human-Covenant War and would allow the humankind to travel through Slipspace at faster speeds.
Bliss Collection Field[]
In 2557, the BXR Mining Corporation uncovered an alien structure while mining the silicate glass from Bliss. The structure was beneath their mining facility and it spanned 125 kilometers in diameter, approximately the same size as the Ark Portal. The UNSC uncovered the rest of the artifact and examined it. One of their soldiers had accidentally activated the machine and it shot a power beam towards the planet's local star. The remnant faction of the Office of Naval Intelligence had learned of this through their sources and sent agents masked as BXR employees to infiltrate the structure and turn off the device. ONI managed to shutdown the machine and gather intelligence on the artifact. Resulted from the event, Bliss' star was reduced in size and it was predicted that this would have a negative effect on the already glassed planet.Job Title: Senior Research Associate - Microbiology

LEAVE A FEEDBACKWe have been cooperating with Diopas, a net manufacturer based in Greece, since 2017. Not only are they offering their premises to house a collection point for ghost nets or waste nets we collect in the Northern part of the country, but they are also facilitating as a link between Healthy Seas and aquacultures, fishermen and their sports clients.
To understand more about the process of net manufacturing, we asked Ioakim Diamantidis, production manager of Diopas:
Q: How did the fishermen and fish farms react when you approached them to give you their waste nets for Healthy Seas?
Ioakim: Everyone was positive to the recycling and really liked the fact that they would be a part of such a great act.
Q: What are the reasons fishing nets are destroyed and lost or must be abandoned in the sea?
Ioakim: During the fish catch procedure, nets may be caught by mistake on a rock or on any other object in the sea bottom and that leads to the accidental loss of nets. It is worth mentioning that fish farms have fewer net losses than fishermen, as the nets in the cages of a fish farm don’t touch the bottom of the sea. Additionally, fish farms give larger quantities for recycling than fishermen, considering the nets that are used in the cage are thicker than the nets that fishermen use.
Q: Has Diopas recently made any innovations in designing and manufacturing of your nets?
Ioakim: All the raw materials that DIOPAS uses are fully recyclable. We are collaborating with research centers and are already discussing new projects that will have to do with innovations in designing and manufacturing fishing gear that can be traceable/recyclable/unharmful.
Q: What were nets made of in the past? When did fishermen start using plastic nets?
Ioakim: In the past, nets were made of cotton and other plants. Fishermen started using nylon and polyethylene nets from 1960 onwards.
Q: Are nylon nets popular with fishermen or do they choose other types of plastic nets? For what reason?
Ioakim: Nylon nets are the most popular nets for fishermen as nylon is a material that is durable and cheap at the same time.
Q: What are the types of nets most commonly used by fishermen in the Mediterranean/Greece? Which are deadliest and how are they different?
Ioakim: The types of nets that are most commonly used by fishermen in Greece are the gill nets and trawlers. Due to the fact that nets appear almost invisible underwater and this is why they are called ghost nets, they can easily become deadly as they continue floating in the sea. They lose their purpose but not their power.
Q: Ιs organic fish farming gaining territory in Greece? If yes, how is this effecting the fishing net production as far as the environmental measures that need to be accounted for?
Ioakim: Yes, organic fish farming is gaining territory in Greece. In case of organic fish farming, our nets are made of materials that are even more eco-friendly (they don’t contain copper oxide) and need less water consumption to be washed. Additionally, we use a different antifouling for impregnating the nets that is eco-friendly.Invisalign

What is Invisalign?
We are proud to offer Invisalign® clear braces. Invisalign is a system that has revolutionized teen and adult orthodontics. The system enables you to achieve a straight and beautiful smile without the inconvenience posed by traditional braces. There are no wires or rubber bands. You simply wear a series of clear plastic Invisalign aligners that gradually shift the teeth into position over time. You are able to clean your teeth easily, and the aligners may be removed while eating, drinking, and during special occasions.
How Invisalign Works
Your Invisalign aligners are fabricated using 3-D computer digital imaging and impressions of your mouth. These molds act as “clear braces” that fit easily over your teeth and they gradually shift your teeth into place. The Invisalign system helps Dr. Ho predict the stages your teeth will go through while shifting into place so that your aligners are personalized for your needs.
Every two weeks you will change out your new set of aligners. Your new aligners will be slightly changed to help continue to shift your teeth into position. Treatment can be as short as six months to two years depending on your case. Most people get the desired results in less than one year.
Invisalign Candidates
Invisalign is the perfect treatment choice for many people. If you have crowded teeth, your teeth are overlapped or crooked, or you have a significant over-bite or under-bite you are a good candidate for the Invisalign system. This system is an attractive option for people who lead active lifestyles or attend special events and may want to remove their aligners. Invisalign® is also a smart option for adults who may feel self-conscious at the prospect of wearing traditional braces. With Invisalign clear braces your orthodontic treatment is virtually undetectable, and you can go about your day-to-day activities with confidence.
Contact Westlake Hills Dentistry today for more information about adult orthodontics, including Invisalign clear braces, today. Don’t forget to ask about teeth whitening as a complement to your new, straight smile!Advertising and commercial photographers, photographic.

Statement
Timing and Lack of Consultation on Minimum Wage Hike Disruptive to Mississauga Businesses
Business Caught Flat Footed with Departure from Schedule Wage Increases
(Mississauga – November 2, 2021) – The Mississauga Board of Trade (MBOT) stands with the Ontario Chamber of Commerce (OCC) in expressing our deep concern about the recently proposed increase to the minimum wage at a time when many small businesses are least prepared to absorb it after months of revenue losses and mounting debt.
Today, Rocco Rossi, President & CEO, Ontario Chamber of Commerce, released the following statement in reaction to the Government of Ontario’s proposed minimum wage hike set for January 1, 2022.
“We are in favour of fair compensation and wage increases that are planned and done in consultation with the business community so that businesses have time to plan and implement the changes. We also recognize that workers have been impacted by the pandemic and higher cost of living.”
“Many businesses are still grappling with the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, including cashflow constraints and the increased cost of doing business; this is no time to add to their costs. The way the proposed changes are being implemented, leaving employers with less than two months to plan, will have considerable administrative and financial impact amidst a pandemic and after 20 months of duress.
“We are disappointed in the lack of consultation on such a significant policy shift and departure from the scheduled wage increases. It is dangerous to bring in major new labour reforms without addressing or protecting against unintended consequences, such as job losses, rising consumer costs, service cuts, and economic hardship for businesses and our greater economy.
“We ask the Government of Ontario to work with us and other business organizations to ensure that a sudden and unplanned minimum wage hike does not do more harm than good. The government needs to re-evaluate the timeline and consider debt forgiveness for impacted businesses to support this unanticipated change in policy.
“We look forward to working with the government in reviewing the current minimum wage, to ensure any increases are tied to fair and transparent reasons, with sufficient notice to allow business owners to prepare.”
The Mississauga Board of Trade (MBOT) also commented on today’s announcement.
“Many small businesses in Mississauga will be significantly impacted in 2022 by this announcement,” said Trevor McPherson, President & CEO, MBOT. “After the devastating impact of the COVID19 pandemic on the very businesses that will be most affected by this large increase to minimum wage, we hope they will be able to survive next year.”

The new ADVANCED ROCKER & CONCAVE (ARC) is the culmination of a two-year pursuit of peak slalom ski performance. A fresh, new direction in regards to ski width, rocker and concave have led us to the greatest slalom ski design in the history of the Denny Kidder brand. No gimmicks, no gadgets, just the perfect hull shape. This is the prior generation ski in the ION product line.
Nate Smith – has this to say about his new ARC, “ With the D3 ARC I am confident that increasing my World Record at 43 is only a matter of time …”
Natural Radius Rocker Profile – Creates a tight radius turn that starts with ease and finishes completely.
Aggressive Concave Depth – Allows the D3 ARC casts outbound better than any ski D3 has ever produced.
Tip to tail bevel design – The bevel assembly of the ARC stays consistent from tip to tail to allow a smooth precise water flow. This keeps the ski moving even when aggresively attacking the shortest line lengths.

At Ken Garff Honda this afternoon, there were two customers closing deals on natural gas cars. It costs a mere 63 cents per gallon to fill up these types of cars.
"Six years ago we sold one car. Today ... last year I sold 105. This year we'll probably double that," said salesman Ron Brown.
Brown admits there are drawbacks. He says this is not a car to drive cross-country because there are few spots to fill up with natural gas.
Brown says you aren't going to make it to Reno or Denver in one of these cars.Intense Hydration Serum

In an age of social media there’s no challenge to sharing a meme or retweeting a popular thought. But living it out requires action. In the world, out of your comfort zone, difference making action.
The first step on the road to Missio’s first preview service was for a group of people to join a missional community. This was a small group of us gathering together weekly. Many churches have small groups, or life groups, or any number of differently named things that all function in a similar manner. I have been a part of a handful in my life. They often center around a group study in people’s homes. Maybe they include a meal or snack. Kids are likely playing with each other while the adults meet. Far too often, that’s as far as they go.
Our missional community started meeting together only days before COVID-19 led to gathering restrictions across the country. But God’s work will still be done, and we proceeded forth over Zoom those first few weeks. As the weather warmed, we progressed to back yards and fire pits. We shared our stories with each other. We studied God’s Word, and what it means to be missional. And then, we took a critical step forward.
We left the comfort of our immediate surroundings and tried to reach people. Reaching people isn’t merely talking to them about Jesus or handing out a tract. It’s building a relationship. It’s being available for them. It’s becoming part of their lives, and them part of yours. Our simple step forward in this was a regular cookout in a local park, and inviting people to join us.
We met some interesting people, some of whom we haven’t seen again, some who we see often. We heard stories and gained new compassion for those less fortunate. This park often finds homeless people wandering through, or people who have ingested substances the body should not partake of. Families with children had deep conversations about things they saw, and had eyes opened to realities of the world we don’t see unless we get out and be missional.
We have made efforts to help a family get back on their feet. Another family has immigrated from different parts of the world and we’ve been able to share in their cultures and meet more of their friends at parties, and were able to throw a baby shower for them too!
From showing up at a park, and inviting people to join us, we have made new friends, learned more about the world and our own community, and have also seen people express a new faith in Christ! Establishing relationships with people allows us to speak into peoples lives, and when they’re ready, help them take their next step in Christ. Disciples making disciples.
From the critical first step of being missional, comes the second piece that so many church groups get stuck in. We broke apart. That isn’t to say that there was a big disagreement and we all parted ways. Rather, we grew as a missional community over a year, not just in relationship with each other, but in number as well. And as missional relationships grow outside of our core group, there comes a time when you must multiply. For us, one missional community became three.
Now is our chance to take all that we learned over the last year and share it with others. It is an opportunity to establish the DNA of a church that doesn’t just meet on a Sunday morning, but meets in groups on a regular basis. Groups that are part of each other’s lives. Groups that are bold enough to get out of their comfort zone and make a difference. Groups filled with people who are ready to meet people that don’t go to church, who have different life experiences, cultural backgrounds, and political views. Groups of people who don’t get stuck in another small group bubble, never to multiply or make a difference in the lives of those who aren’t just like them.
This is just a handful of paragraphs of me spewing out a tiny fraction of what’s been happening in our lives over the last year, but their are a few takeaways those of you in church should take with you.
- You need to be in a close knit group.
- That group needs to get out of their safe space and live on mission.
- The group needs to multiply.
It’s painful to multiply. It means you won’t be meeting as often with people you love and rely on. But it also means we’re growing as believers, and inviting other people into a wonderful experience.
I’ve been reading through a number of books this year, the most recent of which has been Simple Church. It recently pointed out that when Jesus was here, he spent all his time with a small group. His small group was 12 people. There’s something to be learned from the number 12, as it’s a size where people can be intimate with each other. As group sizes grow, it’s a lot harder to share the important things that need to get out. When our groups are approaching the size of 20 we need to take a hard look at multiplying. But now I’m digressing, and a key point the book made was that Jesus didn’t have a Plan B.
Ponder on that. No Plan B.
Jesus put everything into the disciples, and it was up to them to carry forth the mission. He died on the cross for us, and those disciples traveled the globe to share His sacrifice. They planted churches. They made more disciples. There is power in small groups.
So what is your next step? Are you being called to join a group? To multiply your group? To join a church plant? To start a church plant? Maybe God wants you to move to a neighborhood where you’ll have more impact. Or maybe He wants you to move to a new city? You could become a pastor. You could start volunteering at your church (looks are deceiving, a church ministry with enough volunteers is a rare thing). You could volunteer as a group somewhere in town, and be relied on to be there regularly. You could stop doing the weekly Bible study that has mostly the same 30 people from the last 10 years and make a friend who doesn’t go to church. All the Bible knowledge in the world is useless if we never do anything with it.
Regardless of where you are, big town or small, a church of 1000 people or a church of 40, there is opportunity for you to live on mission. There’s a lot of need in the world if we stop long enough to look for it. If we quiet ourselves long enough to hear God speak. Sometimes He tells us to take a very small step, and sometimes He tells us to do something terrifying.
Pray about where you’re at in life. Listen for God’s guidance. If it isn’t uncomfortable, it probably isn’t what God wants for you. Outsized impacts come from our discomfort.
Love Jesus. Live Sent.
Great thoughts on small groups. This is definitely a challenge and change that we need to make in multiplying our groups.57 is an easy clean holster designed for use with the TR-659 Adapter and TR-630 Battery.

ABSTRACT
The use of (ICT) in logistics has been advocated to enhance the performance of the logistics sector especially in the seaports. A huge number of researches showed the importance of using RBV in analyzing performance. RBV however has been adopted in accordance to address the implication of IT on performance for many years, and the latest findings on “IT-performance” relationship is very unclear to make a conclusion. Therefore, further study on application of this theory in the ICT-performance relationship in port industry. This study seeks to examine the impact of ICT implementation on Penang Port Sdn. Bhd. (PPSB) performance. This research is exploratory in nature and the data was collected through a series of interviews. The result from this study shows that there are impact on the ICT usage, container management and Smart-Rail system on port performance. However, this study indicates that port security system does not give an impact towards achieving overall port performance. This study found that technology resources raise internal and external capabilities, which in turn affect port performance. Port resources positively affect organizational efficiency through its impact on internal capabilities thus directly impact the port performance. The results of this study provide direction for investing and managing organizational it resources to achieve competiveness.

One common mistaken belief is that sex must come normally, be simple, and call for minimal initiative. The reality is that while some people possibly in this way, others are not.
Sex is natural, joyous, and distinctly personal.
I did not learn that in college. Rather, sex ed suggested memorizing lists of sexually transmitted illness in class packed with chuckling high schoolers. I rested on old wooden bleachers while guest audio speakers informed my peers and me that premarital sex would make us “chewed-up items of gum tissue” or “items of tape that were utilized a lot they no much longer stick.” We were informed no one would certainly want us if we weren’t a virgin.

Thank You – Sexuality|Sex Positive Therapy: Male Full Body OrgasmsThe U.S. Navy announced Tuesday that it will court-martial the officers who commanded the USS Fitzgerald and the USS John S. McCain last summer when they collided with other craft in the Pacific Ocean. They will face charges of negligent homicide, dereliction of duty and hazarding a vessel. In response to the collisions Navy Secretary Richard Spencer ordered a fleetwide review of strategic readiness. An independent team of civilian executives and former senior military officers delivered their sobering report last month.
The episode should serve as a wake-up call to military and civilian leaders alike. The U.S. has entered a new age of peer and near-peer competition for which the Navy is unprepared, according to the review’s findings. A much diminished fleet has been overloaded with tasks in recent years, yet the number of ships deployed around the world has remained constant. The Navy has managed this by increasing the time that ships and their crews spend at sea. “The net result has been a dramatic increase in the operating tempo of individual ships, and accompanying reductions in the time available to perform maintenance, training, and readiness certification,” according to the review’s authors. “The growing mismatch between the supply and demand of ships taxed fleet personnel and consumed material readiness at unsustainable rates.”
Accidents are inevitable under these circumstances. While enlisted sailors are spending more time away from their home ports, junior officers are spending less time at sea than is necessary to develop what the review calls “deep maritime operating skills.” Sailing a desk on a headquarters staff has became a path to timely career advancement. The review recommends freeing up officers from staff requirements so they can spend more time honing their war-fighting skills. It also urges a better fiscal balance among the operation of ships, equipment maintenance and personnel training—all vital, all expensive.
The most problematic recommendation requires acknowledging a difficult political reality. The Navy must communicate to political leaders “that the higher cost and time to achieve established readiness standards will mean less Navy presence worldwide.”
In September, the Government Accountability Office told the House Armed Services Committee that more than a third of the ships in the Navy’s Japan-based Seventh Fleet had expired warfare-training certifications. The review calls this a “normalization of deviation,” a problem that will persist so long as the Navy lacks the resources to fulfill its obligations.
If implemented, the review’s recommendations would restore the Navy’s readiness to respond to threats and flare-ups as they present themselves. But how, and at what price?
One option—a bad one—is for the Navy to reduce its global presence. As the review’s first sentence acknowledges, the Navy’s global primacy “is being challenged as it sails into a security environment not seen since before the collapse of the Soviet Union.” If achieving naval readiness requires ceding control of the seas to aggressive rising powers like China, Russia or Iran, it won’t be worth it.
A better alternative is to increase the size of the fleet so that necessary maintenance, repairs and training can ensure America’s ability to project naval power from the Western Pacific to the Eastern Mediterranean, from the Arctic to the Arabian Gulf, and to other areas of current—and future—competition with rivals. At the top of this list must be the Baltic and Black seas, where Russian influence is expanding.
As a candidate, Donald Trump pledged to increase the size of the Navy from approximately 275 combat vessels to 350 or more. But in December the administration’s national security strategy document signaled a shift in the president’s thinking. While the document claims the Trump administration supports modernization, acquisition reform, improved readiness and a “full spectrum force,” it does not call for a 350-ship fleet. When it comes to sea power, the U.S. is lowering its sights.
A flexible Navy that retains the ability to respond to threats as they emerge and a fleet large enough to defend vital U.S. interests are not mutually exclusive. But the Trump administration appears to have concluded that since lawmakers are unlikely to pay for construction of a large number of new warships, it won’t even ask them to. It’s a different vision for America’s naval future from the one Mr. Trump outlined on the campaign trail. He was right then; he is wrong now. There’s still time to reverse course.December 1, 2008
Background:
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), Office of Public Health and Science, is seeking comment on a draft guidance document entitled, “Guidance on Important Considerations for When Participation of Human Subjects in Research is Discontinued.” The draft guidance document, when finalized, would provide OHRP’s first formal guidance on this topic. The draft document is intended primarily for institutional review boards, investigators, and funding agencies that may be responsible for the review or oversight of human subject research conducted or supported by the Department of Health and Human Services. The proposed guidance document would provide guidance on important considerations for when participation of human subjects in research is discontinued, either because a subject voluntarily chooses to discontinue participation during the course of the research, or because an investigator terminates a subject’s participation in the research without regard to the subject’s consent. OHRP will consider comments received before issuing the final guidance document.
Submit written or electronic comments by January 30, 2009. Comments may be submitted by any of the following methods: (1) E-mail to discontinueparticipation@hhs.gov and include “Guidance on Discontinuation of Subject Participation”, including any personal information, will be made available to the public upon request.
The draft guidance can be accessed at: or.

Frank has long history with his former Odd Future affiliate Tyler and they prove to be a perfect fit once again with none other than Jay-Z holding down the intro. This incredible new song "Biking" changes beats throughout with mellow instrumentation and hip-hop percussion that kicks in almost halfway. Frank flawlessly switches between singing and rapping on his verse and we already can’t get enough of it.
He also shared a trailer for Blonded radio 003 with a snippet of the song here.
In episode 002 of Blonded Radio frank premiered another amazing new single “Chanel” along with its remix by A$AP Rocky. It’s not clear if these are loose singles or a part of a bigger project, but either way we’re just ecstatic to be getting even more new Frank songs. Enjoy!The Exercises of Peter Feuchtwanger

In the second exercise we begin from our lap, using the other hand to lift the arm to the keyboard at the start. Between each note group we throw the hand back to the starting notes CDC (121) with minimum break in sound (quasi-legato). We land on the notes of the descending scale firstly with the 2nd finger, then 3rd, 4th and 5th. As in the previous exercise, the finger that ends the group is flat, all knuckles collapsed, the thumb hanging off the keyboard and the arm also hanging passively.

- Therefore, the source of security group rule of your EC2 instances is not an IP range, it's a security group.
- So we're going to link the security group of the EC2 instances to the security group of the load balancer, which is an enhanced security mechanism.
1. Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
Step 1: Create an Instance
Add the script below into User Data:
#!/bin/bash # Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom) # install httpd (Linux 2 version) yum update -y yum install -y httpd systemctl start httpd systemctl enable httpd echo "
Hello World from $(hostname -f)" > /var/www/html/index.html
Create / select an existing security group
Now we have lauched a new instance
Step 2: Create a Classic Load Balancer
Leave "Create an internal load balancer" unticked, because we want to access it from computer, so we don't keep it private.
IPv6 is not supported by CLB
The path for health check is
/index.html
First, we perform a health check at
/
Copy the public IP in URL and get the response:
Which also works well at
index.html:
So this is the configuration:
Add EC2 Instances:
Then a new CLB is created successfully
Open the URL of DNS name of our CLB, the response is the same as if we had used the public facing IP, which means the CLB is working:
Note that one of the reasons why the CLB is out of service is that the rules of security group are not correct, for example, there's no port 80 available on the security group.
Change the inbound rule to tighten the security:
First, delete the existing HTTP rule;
Second, create a new rule with the source being the CLB security group.
In that way, we're allowing any traffic from the security of CLB into the security group of EC2 instances. We want the ELB to access the instances, and we don't want users to directly access the instances.
Now if we try to access the public IP of the instances, we get an endless running cycle, but accessing from DNS name of the ELB is still working well.
So now, we can access the EC2 instances only through the ELB. We have enhanced the security. That is a very common pattern in AWS.
Add two more instances:
Add the new created intances into it:
Refresh the page, get a new EC2 instance replying, which means the load balancer is indeed load balancing the requests.When sitting idle (not seeing any heavy usage for anything in task manager over 10% anyway), how loud should these fans be? If I'm sitting here not even using it with the power adapter plugged in it seriously sounds like the fans are at full blast sometimes.. Seems like when I unplug the charger it slows down after a few seconds then eventually they turn off. Is this normal? It is kind of annoying for $1700 laptop to make so much noise just sitting idle, but if theres nothing to do about it, it is what it is. Thanks
Hey austinramsay. This is the first report of loud noise while sitting idle that I've seen.
Can you e-mail me at luke_presley@dell.com? I'd like to try to get some more information from you and see if we can figure out what's going on.
Hi Luke
A couple of us are having same issue ate notebook review forums. I'm sure as more people receive there new xps 13 you will get way more complaints about this.
I just emailed you about this.
I am have the same problem too. I just dealt with a bad battery issue which dell sent a replacement one and now the fan's speed is always at the highest speed. I had xps 9350 and it never gave me all these problem. Any solution on the fan speed (noise) yet?
After the latest BIOS update my fan goes a lot more than before. In fact, on the previous BIOS version I don't recall hearing the fan once. I'd say it's on 20% of the time now.
My Dell XPS 13 9370 has just started experiencing the fan grinding (not high revving fan) issues. I have updated the BIOS and various drivers as suggested by Dell support but nothing has worked.
I have attached a video of the problem. I'm not sure if the fact that I have Dell 'Complete Care' means that I will be able to get a laptop replacement instead of just a fan replacement if need be or not?
Got mine a few days ago. Doing nothing the fan works crazy like the laptop wants to fly!! The fan starts working usually when I'm charging the laptop. How serious is the issue?
I also hear a weird noise (coil whine) on the top left side when I plug in the charger.
Hi Luke,
I have the same problem, the fan is particularly noisy when I use the dell D6000 docking station.
Will write to you if that is OK, as it is a big pity that such a nice laptop is so loud.

From remote work to food delivery and curbside pickup at restaurants, from digital entertainment to on-demand health and wellness services, the COVID-19 pandemic forced even avowed fans of brick-and-mortar businesses to adjust to virtual interaction with the businesses they patronize. And even as things slowly return to (sort of) normal, this touchless way of doing business doesn’t appear to be going away.
If your customers and potential leads have scattered off to the cyberwinds in the past year, how do you find more? The key is to be where they are—and that’s where multichannel marketing (also known as omnichannel or cross-channel marketing) can come in.
If you’ve never heard of multichannel marketing… and even the idea sends you into a tizzy because you already have your hands full with one-channel marketing, don’t panic: You may already be doing it without realizing it.
The following FAQs offer the basics for taking your marketing to the next level.
Q: What is multichannel marketing?
A: Multichannel marketing is a marketing strategy that works on the theory that customers are more likely to buy when they can use their favorite channel. It’s all about the choices both existing and potential customers have to communicate with your brand—and it makes it easy for them to switch between channels if they choose to do so. Those channels can include:
A brick-and-mortar store/office
Your website’s e-commerce store
Catalogs
Phone ordering
An email newsletter
Social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn)
Google My Business and/or Google Ads
Q: What’s so great about multichannel marketing?
A: You’ll reach more customers on the channels where they’re most likely to make a purchase. Grandma Sue might never look for deals on Facebook, but she’ll order from a paper catalog in a heartbeat. Granddaughter Sara, on the other hand, haunts Instagram daily, looking for the latest products endorsed by her favorite influencers. You’ll also be able to get customer feedback that allows you to make more informed decisions about your products and services and proactively fix issues.
Q: Okay, I have those channels. That means I don’t have to do anything else, right?
A: Not exactly. If you’re active in any or all of these channels, you’ve taken the first step. However, for effective multichannel marketing, you’ll need to tailor your marketing content to and speak the language of the audience in each channel.
Q: Uh…speak the language?
A: Social media followers tend to fall into different personality types, depending on the platform(s). It’s possible that not all of these channels are right for your business, but if you keep these brief profiles in mind, you’ll be able to speak the right language for the audiences on the platforms you do use.
Facebook is the place for news, updates, interaction and connection. It’s how family and friends stay in touch with each other, so you may find a real diversity of ages and backgrounds among your followers. Warmth, personality and humanity will go a long way toward building a connection here.
Instagram is the place to see and be seen. It’s all about the visual: carefully curated photos and other content. Followers tend to skew younger here, so work with visuals in mind and offer a casual, friendly and followers “meet” your business and get an idea of your products and services. Keep posts professional and share interesting content about your company or industry in general.
Google My Business and Google Ads will reach a broader, more diverse audience. This is where many prospects will meet you for the first time so try extra hard to put your best foot forward here. It may be the place to include great reviews to highlight your professionalism, sincerity and credibility.
Q: What about emails, newsletters or snail mail? Should I bother?
A: Yes! Email and newsletters are a good way to keep in touch with your audience. People are hungry for readable, credible and informational content. And given the screen fatigue so prevalent these days, snail mail is having its moment in the sun again. A fun and intriguing postcard or catalog offers a nice change of pace.
Q: Do I need to do a different campaign in each channel?
A: If you have the time and energy, go for it. But you can also take one great idea and use it between all channels, adjusting the voice and look to match the audience. For example, a newsletter can reward loyal customers with a discount coupon while a video on Instagram offers followers an exclusive sale preview.
Wrapping it up…
This article only scratches the surface of multichannel marketing, but it offers a good roadmap to get you moving. And you can start slow. For example, if you know your potential customers aren’t on Instagram, skip it and focus on the channels where you know prospects are..Back to issueBOLLYWOOD actor Sonam Kapoor said in a recent interview that she keeps herself away from the buzz on her personal life in the media by focusing on things that matter.

With its well-known efficiency and reliability, WordPress is a great option if you’re looking to build a custom website while leveraging the existing content management system (CMS) for its ease of use. However, even though using WordPress to build a custom website can save coding time, there are still many issues that can arise. If you do encounter any WordPress issues, don’t worry, because you are not the only one.
In this article, we’ll go through the 5 most common WordPress fixes, but first, let’s go through what errors can occur in the first place.
Contents
1. The WordPress White Screen of Death (WSOD)
2. 500 Internal Server Error
3. 404 Error
4. Connection Timed Out Error
5. Stuck in Maintenance Mode
6. Conclusion
The WordPress White Screen of Death (WSOD)
Perhaps the most infamous WordPress issue is known as the White Screen of Death — an error that turns your entire webpage into a white, blank screen. This is typically caused by a number of PHP and database errors, but the most common fix is to test your plugins. Here’s how:
Your plugins may be causing compatibility issues. To test them, start by deactivating all of your plugins simultaneously. Head to the Plugins screen in your WordPress dashboard and use the Deactivate option listed in the Bulk Actions drop-down menu.
Once there, you’ll need to connect to your site using your SFTP credentials and then locate the folder named wp_content/plugins. After you rename this folder, you’ll have automatically disabled all plugins. If you want to reactivate them, you can simply change the folder name back to plugins.
Next, you’ll need to re-enable all plugins (one at a time) to test the site after each one is activated. This’ll allow you to tell which plugin is broken, as the site will go back down as soon as you enable the broken one. You can then deactivate the faulty plugin once located, and contact WordPress developers if any additional support is needed.
500 Internal Server Error
An often irritating error that may arise is the 500 Internal Server Error, which provides you with little to no clues about what the underlying cause may be. You may have even seen this error when simply browsing through the internet, as it commonly occurs when there’s some sort of issue with a user’s browser. Here are the steps you’ll want to take to fix the 500 Internal Server Error:
To initiate a full backup, you’ll need to save copies of your WordPress files and databases somewhere local, such as your desktop, then back up your site’s files using an SFTP client. Once connected to your server, locate the WordPress files you want to save — these will include your WordPress core installation, plugins, themes, images, and more. To save the files, simply right-click on each of them and select Download.
To back up your database, log in to phpMyAdmin and select the database you want to download from the left-hand panel, and then click on the Export tab. You’ll be required to choose either a “Quick” or a “Custom” export, but the “Quick” export will likely work properly unless more advanced options are needed.
Finally, click on the Go button to start your download. Once your website is safely backed up, you’ll be able to work within your website to troubleshoot the 500 Internal Server Error, which can include but is not limited to: reloading your page, clearing your browser cache, or accessing your error logs.
404 Error
Similar to the 500 Internal Server Error, the 404 error, or “Page not found” error, provides very little explanation but typically indicates that your browser cannot find the URL you’re trying to access. Before trying to troubleshoot this issue further, ensure that you haven’t misspelled the URL incorrectly and that there are no errors with your Domain Name System (DNS) settings. If the 404 error persists, follow these steps to eliminate this pesky issue:
You’ll first want to try resetting your permalinks by heading to your WordPress dashboard and navigate to Settings > Permalinks > Save Changes. After this, reload the pages you were trying to access — if you still get a 404 error, you’ll need to restore your .htaccess file.
Access the file by using an SFTP client such as FileZilla or DreamHost file manager (we’ll use the DreamHost file manager as an example). Open your DreamHost panel and navigate to WordPress > Managed WordPress in the sidebar.
Find the domain you’re having trouble with and click the Manage button while also making sure the Details tab is selected at the top. From here, click on Manage Files, then locate the folder that coincides with your domain name. Click on the file name and select Edit from the list of options. Paste in the default .htaccess file for WordPress, then go ahead and save the file.
Finally, go back to your WordPress dashboard and click the Permalinks button to refresh your website. Proceed to set up a 301 Redirect if you still see the 404 error by utilizing a WordPress plugin such as “Redirection.” This tool will enable you to quickly implement a WordPress too many redirects fix.
Connection Timed Out Error
This error is self-explanatory— your server’s been struggling to load your website and has essentially timed itself out. Usual causes for this error include other sites having overtaken your server’s resources or your site has exceeded its maximum amount of bandwidth.
To resolve this issue, consider upgrading your hosting plan, as a larger plan may help avoid slowdowns and downtime since your site will no longer be affected by any surges in traffic on other websites.
It’s also recommended that you optimize the speed of your site, eliminate any plugins that require an abundance of server resources, and check to see if your theme is slowing down your site’s performance.
Stuck in Maintenance Mode
Maintenance mode is an automatic feature on WordPress that briefly disables your site while it’s being updated. Typically, this process is quick, but if the update had to be canceled before it was completed, your site may get stuck in maintenance mode permanently.
This is an easy problem to fix — simply open up an SFTP again, access your site’s main folder, and delete the file called .maintenance. Make sure to also reload the failed update, as this error indicates that it wasn’t successfully completed.
Conclusion
Although rare, WordPress errors do emerge and can seem frustrating to deal with at first glance. However, resolving these issues is generally easier than anticipated, and following the steps we’ve listed will help you get back on your WordPress site in no time!Product Overview

Since the pandemic started, more than 217,000 people have died in the United States.
The United States reported 60,000 new infections on Wednesday, the highest since August.
"It's quite concerning," Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert, said told ABC television. "We really got to double down on the fundamental public health measures that we talk about every single day because they can make a difference."
According to a Reuters analysis, 25 states have so far set records for increases in new cases in October.
All midwest and northeast states have reported more cases in the past four weeks than in the prior four weeks, with the number of new cases doubling in states such as Wisconsin, South Dakota and New Hampshire.
In the midwest, daily new cases hit a record on Wednesday, with more than 22,000 new infections. The positive test rate tops 30 per cent in South Dakota and 20 per cent in Idaho and Wisconsin.
Ten states on Thursday reported record increases in new cases, including Wisconsin with 4000 new cases. "Our numbers are high and they're growing rapidly," state Health Secretary-Designate Andrea Palm told a news conference.
"We have now surpassed 1000 COVID-19 patients who are in the hospital. In some regions of our state, our ICU beds are 90 per cent or more full," Palm said.
California remains the state with the most total cases followed by Texas, Florida, New York and Georgia. Those five states account for more than 40 per cent of all reported COVID-19 cases in the nation.
With both cases and positive test rates rising in recent weeks, New York City has closed businesses and schools in neighbourhood hotspots.Ryo Miyaichi has signed for German 2.

Jump Start The Heart originated in 1989, inspired by the desire to provide more effective CPR training to healthcare providers. Jump Start The Heart taught classes in Louisville, KY to healthcare professionals in hospitals, nursing homes and home health agencies. The classes were taught sporadically and by "word of mouth." In 1994, Jump Start The Heart relocated to Lexington, KY and used a bartering system in order to obtain manikin use. Again, based on "word of mouth" advertising, the company grew. Jump Start The Heart was geared to only healthcare and childcare providers during that time. In 2005, with business classes and direction from Community Ventures; Jump Start The Heart grew into a new location with an expanded customer base of all persons (laypersons and healthcare providers alike). In 2011, Jump Start The Heart expanded class offerings to include Advanced Life Support skill testing. In 2019, Jump Start the Heart added American Red Cross CPR/AED/First Aid classes to our class schedule. In April 2020, Jump Start the Heart added Provisional CPR/AED/First aid classes to class schedule to meet the Coronavirus19 health guidelines.Jeanette Winterson Quotations

The truth is that clothes manufacturers grow to be successful partly because they’re created by people who are captivated with clothes. You wish to be a trendsetter, and having a radical understanding of the economic system and the fashion business will preserve your ideas contemporary.
Vogue designers apply design and artwork principals to clothes and attire or accessories in ways in which make clothing both practical and aesthetically lovely. Communication abilities: Trend designers often work in teams all through the design process and due to this fact should be efficient in speaking with their group members.
As well as, it could be mandatory for some fashion designers to relocate, because employment opportunities for style designers are concentrated in New York and California. Many style designers work in-house for wholesalers or manufacturers. Nearly all of vogue design programs in a fashion show that reveals off what students have realized and designed.
As you show your self and your design abilities to your employer, you could possibly move up within the ranks and be answerable for more style design-related tasks. In some circumstances, a self-employed vogue designer may have a clothing line that bears his or her name.

Soaking and boiling the chickpeas is the prerequisite to make this salad. Few tips to Soak and boil the chickpeas are shared in the Tips section.
Take Boiled chickpeas, Dice onion, tomato and cucumber and mix them.
Dice the avocado. I prefer to add it in the last so that they dont turn mushy while stirring.
How to Make Classic Salad Dressing -
Add lemon juice, olive oil, crushed pepper-corn and salt. Let it sit for 10 minutes.
Combine the salad dressing with Chickpeas and chop handful of coriander leaves and add to it.
Give a nice stir and then add avocado and stir it nice.
Soak with chickpeas overnight (minimum 6-8hours) in water so that water is just the double amount of the chickpeas.
In case you forget to soak chickpeas you can boil water and pour the steaming hot water on chickpeas and soak it for 2 hours, your chickpeas would be read.
PRessure cook the chickpeas for 10 minutes to boil them. Don’t forget to add salt while boiling chickpeas then you would need less salt in the salad.

RICHMOND, Ind. — On Sept. 1, the Townsend Community Center on the city's north side will close.
When it will open again will be determined by how fast the center's board and the Richmond Housing Authority can raise enough money to make needed renovations.
"It's going to be at least a half-million dollars that we need in order to do the roof as well as the interior infrastructure things that we'd like to do to bring it up to code, up to snuff," said Derek White, executive director of the Richmond Housing Authority.
White and the rest of the housing authority's board joined members of the Townsend center board for a town hall meeting Thursday night at the facility.
In all, more than 30 people turned out to hear an update on the center's future and ask questions about what comes next.
The Richmond Housing Authority board bought the Townsend center mortgage in January in an effort to make sure much-needed repairs to the 50-year-old building were made. Two roof support beams in the building had cracked as the result of roof leaks, and the housing authority authorized stabilizing work to keep the roof from collapsing.
That project has been finished, but more work still needs to be done.
In addition to a new roof for the facility, which in itself is estimated to cost about $250,000, there are several renovations on a wish list for the interior of the building.
"We have to look at the heating system right away. Boilers aren't working. Air conditioning's not working as you can tell," said Ron Maze, a member of the housing authority board.
"We want to come in here and totally redo this floor. We want to paint every room in here. We want to put new carpet down or tile in the corridors. We want to give it a complete face lift inside."
But the most important work to be done is the roof, White said.
"At this point, it's like baseball. Right now, we're trying to get on first base, and first base is the roof."
Where the money will come from for the renovations is unclear at this point. Several fundraisers are in the works, and the housing authority is looking for any grants that might help out as well.
When the facility eventually reopens, White said he's already had interest from organizations that would like to use space there.
"There is an interest from several entities in the city that want partnerships with Townsend," he said.
One of those groups apparently is Reid Health, which White said has expressed interest in starting a clinic at Townsend.
The meeting also was used as an opportunity to clear up the relationship between the housing authority and the Townsend board in the wake of the mortgage sale.
"We own the facility, but we're not running the programs," White said. "Townsend's still responsible for whatever programs are going to run.
"We're not here to try to lord it over anybody. We're just here to get the facility fixed and then move forward with programs and so forth and other tenants that will be in here with you all."
White alluded to communication problems in the past between the housing authority and previous iterations of the Townsend board, but those appear to be in the past now.
"Townsend and Richmond Housing Authority, we are working together and we do have an open line of communication," said Lucinda Wright, president of the Townsend board.
"What we have to do is speak positively. All this negative stuff got to go," White said. "This is a community center for the community, not just for the north side, for everybody."
One immediate effect of the center's closing is that the after-school program will move to Starr Elementary. The program will run 3-6 p.m. Monday-Friday starting Sept. 18. Participating students who don't attend Starr will be taken by bus from the center to the elementary and then dropped off at home at the end of the day.
To make the after-school program work, Townsend is looking for donations of supplies and volunteers. Anyone interested can call (765) 444-4163.
Wright said community participation will be a major factor in getting the center back on its feet and ensuring its future.
"My prayer and my charge to everyone in here is to think about how you can use your talent and your gifts and your funds to best help Townsend Community Center and what you would like for us to be because Townsend is dependent on each and everyone of us in here," Wright said.
"Our community is interdependent on every single one of us."Wokingham Town councillors turned down an opportunity to twin with a French town last night.
Fontenay-Trésigny had asked the council to consider a town-twinning arrangement.
Wokingham is already twinned with Erstadt in Germany and Viry-Chatillon.
Fontenay-Trésigny is 43km south east of Paris, 24km northeast of Melun, 28km south of Meaux and 36km northwest of Provins.
It lies in the heart of the Brie in the centre of the department of Seine-et-Marne.
It has about 7,000 inhabitants known as Trésifontains.
Nicki Payler at the town council said a newly elected councillor at the French town had contacted Wokingham Town Council to suggest the twinning scheme.
She said it was a view to organising cultural exchanges with students.
The town has a 17th century château of the Marquis de Trésigny and a magnificent ruin of the Château du Vivier dating back to the 14th century.
It also has a spectacular swimming pool called the Centre Aquatique.
However Wokingham town councillors decided not to twin with the Trésifontains last night because the town is already twinned with a French town.Product Code: CCN282

Ryan DM., Paterson DJ.
Catecholamines restore cardiac contraction depressed by hyperkalaemia (raised [K+]O) and acidosis, yet in exercise hyperkalaemia and acidosis are tolerated during beta adrenergic blockade. To test whether the negative effects of raised [K+]O are offset by a non-adrenergic hormone, angiotensin II (AII) was given to rabbit papillary muscle (All 75 nM, n = 9) and rabbit isolated working hearts (All 5 nM, n = 8) perfused with 8 and 10 mM K+ Tyrode at 37 degrees C. A similar protocol was also performed in a further nine isolated hearts treated with propranolol (1 microM) and prazosin (1 microM). All caused a significant (P < 0.01) increases in contraction and aortic flow in normal Tyrode and maintained aortic flow during high [K+]O. In the papillary muscle and isolated heart treated with adrenergic blockers, high [K+]O reduced the stimulatory effects of All, but contraction and aortic flow was still significantly greater (P < 0.01) than in high [K+]O alone. These results show that All can ameliorate the depressive effects of high [K+]O on the heart. The local release of All in the heart during activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the rise in circulating All during exercise could therefore play a role in protecting the heart from hyperkalaemia.We also have other merchants like Bella Optical.

Kind enough to answer my endless questions and then built me an outstanding pair of wheels at a keen price. Recommended.
These guys are the real deal! Ditch the chain bike stores as these guys give you real service and know literally everything there is to know about bikes. Every time I go in there I leave with my problem solved. Cannot more highly recommend!
Was searching for a decent service for my BMC, was quoted 1-2 weeks by the douchey big chain places. Called up these guys at 13:30 in the afternoon and despite having wheel builds and other stuff to do still managed to fit me in for same day turnaround and to get my bike looking like the sexy wheel demoness she was when I first got her. I wont expect that every time, don't worry, but has endeared me enough to not have to consider going anywhere else now. Also ended up paying less than first quoted. And a pretty motherf**kin cool little place to boot! You really get the impression they genuinely care..
Really helped me today, two flat tyres fixed in minutes. Friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable. A great shop, just go and have a look and say hello. Thank you for you help, it was much appreciated.
Never experienced a better cycle shop - unrivalled knowledge, understanding, turnaround time; completely honest and to the point. A refreshing change and a very welcome addition to North London, preaching the original Local Bike Shop philosophy. Forget your Evans' and Cycle Surgery - Support your local dealer!
Five Stars
Amazing service , Mark and Jamie are very friendly and the best bike mechanics in london !!!
Great Independent Place. Service was fast, friendly atmosphere and the price is fair. I had to come back after a week because of a recurring puncture and the guys fixed it again free of charge. Definitely recommend it.
Amazing shop, best bike shop in North London and possibly the best in London. Amazing knowledge and excellently priced. Top notch
Love this place, always friendly, prices are always fair. Great service. Would always recommend.
Friendly helpful and great price
A great workshop, super friendly pair of guys who certainly know their way around a bike! Had mine serviced a couple of months ago and it's been ticking along perfectly. Support this fantastic local independent bike shop!
Went to SBC after a hearing a lot of great feedback from riding buddies and wasn't disappointed. Kind enough to answer my endless questions and then built me an outstanding pair of wheels at a keen price. Recommended.
I've visited SBC a few times for various parts and a few small maintenance and repair jobs on my bike. Even if you only spend a few minutes in the shop its clear that for Jamie and Mark bikes aren't just a job but a passion, and this is reflected in the way that they approach their work. With a 'no job is too big nor too small' and 'can do' attitude I found them welcoming, informative and interested in providing the right service for me and my bike, rather than trying to 'up sell' expensive parts which I didn't need (though their range of high end components is also pretty impressive!)... Despite their thorough knowledge of all things bicycle related, I've never felt patronised or belittled when visiting them, unlike certain other bike shops where I've often been frustrated at being made to feel stupid by staff... SBC take pride in their work, and are always welcoming, honest and thorough. I can't recommend them highly enough, and will always make the trip from south London when I need to!
One-of-a-kind bike shop ran by really friendly folk.
Excellent service, best dudes, so helpful and friendly. Built a custom Brother for me,runs like a dream, they modified a rack for the front. Highly recommend this place for any aspect
Cool shop that is very customer focussed and also not overpriced. The guys are knowledgable and my bike is always perfectly tweaked in there too
Shop looks great, friendly staff, got me back on the road in no time! Thanks guys! Definitely use again and recommend to all my friends!
Great independent bike shop with friendly, helpful staff found me what I was looking for
had two sets of custom wheels built by these guys and they also put my last bike build together , all perfect and still running like new - shops amazing and staff helpful and really friendly ...I pop by sometimes just to say Hi and see what's new - I'll never go anywhere else from now on ...
Your go to Bike Shop... For all Wheel Building skills and Great Service in a Fantastic Shop SBC is the only place you will return to again and again.
Great mechanics, great dudes, totally original bike shop. Had a custom build done in the summer at very reasonable price, been running like a dream for over 8 months now. Also worth going down on a Thursday eve to catch a semi regular dj set -- and check out the impressive interiors.
You can always rely on the boys to do a solid job with excellent advice too. I never considered getting my bike worked on but after it was done it felt like a slick new whip :) Highly Recommended thanks.
SBC is one of the best bike shops in East London if not the whole of the city. I would highly recommend paying them a visit!
Cool shop.. Great mechanics and best tunes!
Great little self-made independent bike shop. Perfectly kitted out workshop, quick turnaround and friendly staff. The way a bike shop should be. Rather then selling you new stuff, they will fix it for you. Competitive prices too.
I have had many a bike built by Mark and Jamie over the years. The bikes have evolved with my needs. From fixed gear lo pro, to cannondale tourer for riding through the Loire Valley in France, to carbon mountain bike for the perils of Epping Forest, to the latest easy riding ladies bike, keeping me riding to work till 8 months pregnant! Now with a little one in tow, I hope to be back on the bike soon, looking forward to my latest SBC creation :) Thanks guys!
Awesome shop! Mark helped me choose a new bike and fit everything for me. See you for my next service :)
fantastic shop! Honest and helpful service. Recommend to everyone.
Been here a few times for small and big jobs, a coupla times jobs other shops have not been able to tackle. As well as being super fast and good mechanics they are also very inviting and friendly. Also a sick space with an arcade machine and cool art is on the walls.
Some of the best mechanics I've found in London, been taking all my bikes there since it opened and been perfect service everytime
No bulls*!#. Fast honest professional service. Wont go anywhere else now. Thanks guys.
I haven't cycled for years, so went in to SBC with only a vague idea of what I really wanted for a new bike. I got straight up, great advice from both the guys there and they built me something custom using a second hand Cannondale Mountain Bike frame set up as a town bike. It's super comfortable and I totally love it... Feels great to support an honest independent business where you feel like they really care about whats best for you and your budget...
Jamie and Mark are some of London's best bike mechanics. They have looked after many of my bikes in getting them race ready and sometimes at such last minute moments. The prices are highly competitive, it's nice going somewhere and not feeling ripped off when you walk out but instead having a great experience, a nice chat and most importantly a rad working bike. Highly recommend that even if these guys are not your local bike shop, you should make them your local bike shop.
Great bike shop and very friendly service! Went it at 6pm after work and they did the work I needed there and then with no need to book the bike in. Will definitely be returning for an future work to be done to my bikes.
It's a far cry from the common cycle shop. In all the good ways. I've went there to change a broken brake cable and met Jamie, extremely helpful chap, who told me the same thing I was told in my previous cycle shop: most of the parts needed replacing. But unlike the other store he didn't try to sell me a bike and instead gave me a very competitive price to exchange the parts and do all the work and to top it up he even clean the bike without me asking.

These guys are awesome. Went in for a couple of bits, got all of them. Also asked about a chain and cassette for my bike, they said they could do it today. Two guys that are passionate about bikes who went above and beyond for me. To reiterate what another reviewer said it's a far cry from the blandness of the chain shops. Use these guys!
They are just great! Quick, fantastic job on the bike and really friendly!
Well my lovely old Cannondale bike which is actually 25 years old and well loved, but neglected was lovingly and excellently restored just a few weeks ago and I love it to bits now. It rides and feels fab again. They did such a good job. Professional, attentive and effective. I love my bike again.
Great guys who really know their stuff around a bike. Quick honest and awesome!
My beloved Brompton bicycle with a flat, where to go and get it fixed? Well I found this gem of a bike shop on the internet in the N1/Hackney area. It's an independent bike shop which is great, owned and run by two very friendly guys. The shop is filled with bicycle memorabilia and I loved the vintage chopper. Well worth a visit and very competitive prices. I would definitely use them again.
A bike shop is only as good as the mechanics who work there. In this case, they're bloody brilliant.
Living just across the road I thought I would try my new local bike shop. I needed a headset and forks fitted to a newly revamped bike. Dropped it off and popped home to collect some extra bits that were needed and when I returned it was virtually done. BB chased and faced all done while having a chat. This is such a refreshing departure from large chain, clueless bike shops. Give them a go, you won't be disappointed!
Great mechanics who really know what they are doing and are very helpful
SBC is the perfect local bike shop. Jamie and Mark know everything there is to know about bikes and they have a fantastic work shop with every tool you could think of. Last month the guys built me a brand new dynamo hub equipped wheel in two days - very speedy. Yesterday I took a wheel with a broken spoke into the shop. 20 minutes later I had a working wheel. Thanks guys!
Unquestionably the best bike shop in London. Proper mechanics doing a proper job. Cool guys to boot. View and reply
Nice honest guys,quick and efficient, polite and the best thing is its very local to me..Not a rip off shop...
I had my bike built here. Shop is rad, super friendly, independent and well stocked- a far cry from some of the other places dotted around the area. These guys were only too happy to share information and chat about my bike as they worked on it, the workshop is right in the window so you can see what they're doing as they do it- both the guys in the shop are mechanics and have been around for ages. It's nice to know the person fixing your bike owns the place and cares about the service you get. Would definitely recommend!
How a bike shop should be. Quality workmanship, quickly done, for a fair price by guys who know and ride bikes. Walked in, got a buggered star nut replaced there and then and was back on my bike in under 10 minutes. This area sorely needed a decent bike shop and this is it.
They put the rad in radial.Nursing Oncology Doctoral Programs

Your Support Makes Plowshare Possible
We live simply and well and we are careful with our resources. We raise money before we spend it therefore our debt is low and we are financially solid. We are an excellent investment.
Yet we have needs. We also have lofty ideals which we strive daily to manifest in concrete reality. Though our basic needs are met through the operating budget we need help each year for maintenance and repairs. With 4 homes, the community building, the barn, outbuildings and 200 acres maintenance is a sizeable and ongoing expense.
We are saving to build a care house so we can continue to meet people’s needs as they age and require more assistance.
It is our hope and intention over the next few years to create a significant endowment for tuition assistance. Is this audacious? Probably yes. Can it be done? We think so. Through generous support we have started a Tuition Assistance Fund of which only the interest is used. With God’s grace, your philanthropy and by putting one foot in front of the other we will walk toward the ability to meet those in need regardless of financial ability.
We are a small organization which, in order to preserve our unique character, will remain small. Our vision is mighty, our will is strong and we want to do more. Can you help us?

I was thinking about the words we sometimes say to each other, “Have a great day!” But what does that mean? What does it mean to have “a great day”?
When I was young, I measured “a great day” by how much fun I had. A great day meant a day of enjoyment, pleasure, and fulfillment.
When I was in high school and college and in my early adult years, I measured “a great day” by how much success I had. A great day meant achievement – and being recognized by others for it.
When I got older, I measured “a great day” by how much work I got done. A great day meant getting a vast number of things done related to my work.
How do I measure “a great day” now? I think it is changing. I think my values are slowly becoming a little more like the values of God.
At the end of the day now, when I look back, I don’t measure the greatness of the day by how much fun I had. Or how much success and recognition I gained. Or even necessarily how much work I got done.
I have a new measurement of “great” and it comes from the words of Isa – Jesus (the Injeel, Mark 10:43):
There’s nothing wrong with having some fun in life or being successful or getting a lot of work done. But when I think of those things, I have to be honest. All of them are focused on. . .me.
God wants us to focus on others – their well being. Jesus not only taught this, he exemplified it in everything he did. Jesus was the epitome of greatness and this was how he described his lifestyle and mission:
I am learning that “a great day” does have a metric – a standard of measurement – but it is not the selfish, me-centered metric that people in this world often use. No, “a great day” is a day of serving others. This is the metric of greatness that Jesus taught and lived. This new way of thinking helps me to ask these questions as I lay down my head at night:
How many people did I serve today?
How many people did I help today?
How many people did I encourage today?
How many people did I put before myself today?
How did I give and sacrifice and authentically love today?
It’s definitely a different definition of what is “great.”
God bless you, my dear Muslim and Christian friends.
And I hope that you truly have. . .“a great day”!And many more a lot of the key phrases below will let you increase the substance as to what you may be saying to a person’s chitchat associate as well as allow you to in your own time as well as think over the issue.

A map created using /give can be any map by using the Map parameter to specify the map number desired. E.g. /give [player] minecraft:filled_map{map:5} gives the specified player map_5. If no data value is supplied it defaults to map_0.
How do you quickly fill a bedrock map in Minecraft?
In bedrock use a /fill command from the corner of the maps coordinates to the opposite corner. You may have to do this multiple times in smaller chunks as there is a block limit per command.

In doing so, the court upheld a 7th U.S. Circuit Court ruling that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 does not pre-empt Illinois' HMO Act.
The decision is a blow to the insurance industry, which has been fighting the current system of state-governed external reviews. Health plans, arguing that divergent laws raise costs, say they are not opposed to external review but want a federal standard.
"The great danger is that with costs already skyrocketing, employers navigating varying state laws may be forced to reconsider whether they will offer health insurance for their employees," said Donald Young, M.D., president of the Health Insurance Association of America, Washington.
Federal law, however, says nothing about the right to second opinions, said Justice David Souter, writing for the majority. He was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer.
The case centered on Debra Moran, who approached her doctor in 1996 with pain and numbness in her right shoulder. Her primary-care physician recommended that Moran's insurer, Rush Prudential HMO, approve surgery by an unaffiliated specialist. Rush denied the request on the grounds that the procedure was not medically necessary and proposed that Moran undergo a different procedure with a Rush-affiliated physician. Moran made a written demand for an independent medical review of her claim, as allowed under Illinois' HMO Act.
A state court ordered the review, and the panel found the treatment necessary. Rush again denied the claim. While the suit was pending, Moran had the surgery recommended by her primary-care physician and amended her complaint to seek reimbursement. Rush moved the case to federal court, arguing that the amended complaint involved a claim for ERISA benefits.
A district court opinion treated Moran's claim as a suit under ERISA and denied it on the ground that ERISA pre-empted the HMO Act. That ruling was reversed in the 7th Circuit, which the Supreme Court upheld.
In the minority opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the ruling "undermines the ability of HMOs to control costs, which, in turn, undermines the ability of employers to provide healthcare coverage for employees." He was joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy.The actress who first played the role of Janine Butcher in EastEnders is now a hot shot Google executive.
Rebecca Michael appeared on screens as Janine in 1989 through to 1993.
Her footsteps were later followed by Alexia Demetriou until 1996 before Charlie Brooks took over the character of older Janine in 1999.
Now Rebecca is in a completely different role as the director of global marketing at Google Search and augmented reality, according to her professional LinkedIn profile.
She's approximately 5,000 miles away from Walford, located in California.
The star began her early career in acting as a youngster.
Rebecca has since flourished into a completely different industry after landing herself a job at one of the world's biggest tech companies.
She has been working at Google for 12 years, successfully building her way up to higher roles in the business.
The former actress started as an associate industry manager and she has an impressive CV.
It may come as a surprise to some but her career change has been publicly known for years.
Janine's final appearance on the BBC soap was in 2014 which was played out by Charlie.
The villainous character was not killed off which means she could always return in the future.
Charlie, 39, previously teased a return for Janine on Loose Women in July 2019.
She said: "I could potentially [return] – I always say the same answer, never say never. She's in France swanning it up with Scarlett."
She added to Heart Breakfast: "I always say, 'Never say never'."
Since quitting the soap, Charlie underwent a career change herself.
On Instagram last year, the actress revealed she is part of a new business venture called iampro.

Cai Zhenhua, 53, the former top coach to the national table tennis team, was named president of the Chinese Football Association yesterday. Cai is a former world table tennis champion and household name on the mainland. He vowed to improve the performance of the national soccer team in a sport that happens to be the favourite of President Xi Jinping's. "We will never forget the 1-5 defeat to Thailand that the national team suffered last year. That day - June 15 - was a day of shame for Chinese soccer," Cai was quoted as saying, referring to a humiliating showing against its smaller Southeast Asian neighbour in Hefei last summer. The defeat triggered widespread criticism of the team. Xinhua described the match as a humiliation and a tragedy for Chinese soccer on its Sina Weibo account, even before the final whistle had been blown. Cai, who also serves as the vice-president of the government's State General Administration of Sports, takes over as president of the soccer association from 75-year-old Yuan Weimin, who had held the post since 1992. Cai has overseen soccer matters in his role at the government organisation since 2010, but his new role is likely to him give him greater clout within the sport. Cai was a highly successful table tennis player, winning four world championships in the 1980s. His accomplishments continued in a career as coach. He quickly built up the men's and women's teams, dominating the world championships and Olympic Games over the next two decades. He became the vice-president of the state sports administration in 2007. China has a huge number of soccer fans. Xi is a noted enthusiast and has repeatedly called for improved performances from the national team. During a trip to Indonesia last year, he expressed the hope that China would qualify for the World Cup finals. However, the sport has been plagued by corruption and an endless series of scandals. Several top soccer officials, including two former head of the mainland's soccer leagues, have been jailed for accepting bribes and match-fixing.

Had we been able to turn the clock back, we would not have sat Shiva. Would you sit Shiva on the basis of a hole in a helmet?"

The Mindy Project is easily my favorite comedy on television. Sometime last year it snuck past Parks and Rec and captivated my attention.

The B.C. government is taking its first steps to speed up municipal zoning approvals, identified by a review in 2019 and an expert panel earlier this year as a key obstacle to increasing housing supply.
Legislation introduced this week by Municipal Affairs Minister Josie Osborne would remove the automatic requirement for public hearings when zoning bylaws are amended, as long as the changes are consistent with official community plans. It also allows local governments to delegate decisions on minor development variance permits to staff.
“To ensure transparency, the proposed amendment for public hearings requires local governments to provide public notice of the rezoning bylaw before the bylaw is considered at first reading by a municipal council or regional district board,” the ministry said in a statement Oct. 26.
Neil Moody, CEO of the Canadian Home Builders’ Association of B.C. welcomed the first changes recommended in a development process review that was completed in 2019.
“Streamlining the development approval process and making it more efficient and meaningful to the public are critical changes that our association has been advocating for,” Moody said.
Jill Atkey, CEO of the B.C. Non-Profit Housing Association, urged municipalities to take advantage of the changes and “consider seriously whether public hearings are necessary for affordable housing projects that are consistent with community plans.”
A B.C. expert panel chaired by former NDP cabinet minister Joy MacPhail had similar conclusions in a report released in June called Opening Doors: Unlocking Housing Supply for Affordability. It called for provincially-led planning to overcome a local public hearing process that “amplifies the voices of the few rather than the needs of the community at large.”
The B.C. government has yet to comment on its proposal for the province to impose land use rules around transit lines and other major projects funded by federal and provincial governments. Finance Minister Selina Robinson rejected a recommendation from MacPhail’s committee that the annual homeowner grant be discontinued, since it subsidizes people who already own their homes.

As the Patron Saint of ecology, animals, and nature, St. Francis of Assisi praised all creatures as brothers and sisters under God, understanding the connection we have with the earth and all living things. In November 2018, the Conventual Franciscan Friars of Our Lady of Consolation Province launched the Franciscan Earth Care Initiative as a public and spiritual commitment to modeling the Franciscan vision of environmental stewardship and sustainability. Thanks to our generous donors St. Francis Friary, in Zambia, joins Holy Cross Retreat Center in Mesilla Park, NM, and Mount Saint Francis Center for Spirituality in Mount St. Francis, IN, as the third major solar panel installation. These installations will allow our friars to become more self-reliant in the face of a critical national energy crisis. To see these installations and our other projects, follow the Franciscan Earth Care Initiative on Facebook and Twitter!
St. Francis Friary Solar Project
A True Ecological Gift!
by Friar Katongo L. Chilambwe OFM Conv.
St. Francis Friary in Zambia has been blessed with an invaluable Franciscan gift. Recently, the mission, through Our Lady of Consolation Province, received a generous donation with funds raised by Dr. Robert Barnet and his wife, Dr. Carol Taylor, for
the purchase and installment of a solar kit comprising of 36 solar panels, six inverters, and eight lithium batteries.
This gift comes at a time when Zambia is facing an unprecedented energy crisis as a result of decreased water levels at the central hydropower station at the Kariba dam, thus drastically affecting electricity generation. Zambia experienced the full impact of climate change in the form of drought in the 2018-2019 rainy season in most parts of the country, especially the southern region.
Due to overreliance on hydropower, the poor rains caused Zambia to incur an energy deficit of nearly 80% of electricity generation. As a result, the main power utility company has introduced rolling blackouts for long as 18 hours per day. However, in mitigating this energy crisis, the government is investing in several additional solar, hydro, and thermal power, which may be a long time coming.
St. Francis Friary has been adversely affected by constant and prolonged power cuts. Six hours of electricity per day, often in the middle of the night, left Zambia crippled. The mission has struggled to irrigate its vegetable gardens, water the lawn, and operate communication devices, among other activities. Not anymore!
“The newly installed solar equipment provides 24 hours supply of energy to the mission, thereby normalizing its day-to-day activities.”
Solar at the mission qualifies as a “true” Franciscan ecological gift, conscious of St. Francis’s care for the environment and wildlife. The friars at the mission engage in simple lifestyles that promote the integrity of creation and ultimate responsibility for
the earth or as Pope Francis refers to our “common home.” Part of the friar’s eco-conscious lifestyle is the keeping of chickens, goats, pigs, and (yet to be realized) fish farming. Another eco-driven initiative is the manufacturing of organic manure from animal
waste for growing vegetables.
Solar energy at the mission adds a more robust initiative of investing in renewable energy. Additionally, with the installed solar panels, the mission can cut costs of electricity, thereby increasing its support for the vulnerable people through both the Social Teacher program of Fr. Andrew and the student support program of Br. Tony.
Our solar program is a true Franciscan ecological gift. Moreover, it is an aid in living out our Franciscan ideal of sharing what we have. We send thanks to the OLC Mission Advancement Office and its generous donors for the donation of funds for solar equipment.What are products?

It got a long time because of it to find level of popularity, even if by way of example, the “Bollywood” trend trend, which suggests well-known HinduOrBollywood fashion clothes, come forth while in the nineteen eighties this craze was related to neighborhood style that combined traditional attire with stylish neighborhood have on.
A designer titled Raymond Weil produced the Bollywood movement popular. Having said that, Bollywood is different considerably since then, just like most the latest fashions. For starters, european outfits variations evolved into most liked in India, which resulted in the lowering of the Indian significance selling price for Bollywood garments. In addition, Bollywood attained international reputation when Rajkumar Kohli, an Indian acting professional, turned renowned in addition to a main acting professional in Hollywood videos, such as Friday, Wanted, Cool Hands, and Swing Vote. Rajkumar Kohli’s accomplishment assisted available gates for other Bollywood superstars, who quickly followed his actions and have become profitable themselves.
The latest fashions can be troubled by govt plan. The introduction of the Indian Currency Management Act (FCMA) this year has led to a significant loss of foreign currency business. The Act claims that all values has to be appreciated in Indian rupees. This is to lessen foreign exchange wear and tear, which often can add to the competitiveness of Indian firms. The Act has caused specified retrenchment while in the ship field, as Indian exporters anxiety they will likely lose a few of their dangerous current market advantages as a result of new Act. This measure was approached by a lot of Indian organization residences who saw it as an effective means of safeguarding their discuss on the worldwide sector.
Elizabeth-tailment has expert quite a few alterations in the last several years, however. The standard thought of electronic-tail was limited to the purchase of electronic digital goods for example laptop add-ons and video game titles, and cellular phones. With the admittance of electronic-the business sector within the Indian economic climate, a plethora of purchaser items happen to be announced into the shopping online space or room, leading to an dramatic increase of the market. Outfits as a result of a part of the last century observed an extreme transform with new releases currently being presented for a swift fee, consequently. The swift pace of modify saw the actual fashion ethos remaining substituted with a fresh one, epitomized by the zingy, thigh and some unattractive models that swept the Indian visitors this chair was created area of the 20-very first hundred years.
The 1st 10 years with the new hundred years found many international the latest fashions inside Indian marketplace. Indian products from the initial several years were popular trend by an influx of Western design methods and silhouettes, that were foreign from Western fashion market sectors. Indians commenced prefering to stores over the boundary to acquire garments that were reminiscent of the models put on in the western world. Due to the advent of age-business, the Indian trend business could now experience a complete modernize, with plenty businesses delivering numerous apparel at cost-effective price points, due to lower expenses.
However, quite possibly the most well-liked and conspicuous difference in Indian products may be followed towards ncm (quick for National Clothing Code) activity, which found Indian younger generation donning own and ethnical outfits (in stark form a contrast to your uncontrolled popularity of US fashion latched onto by rap designers inside eighties). The identify (quick for National Clothing Code) movement was began so that you can handle a cultural difficulty, but the movement does a wonderful job of adjusting the Indian psyche, because of its vivid, leading edge, and eye-popcorn designs. These styles also full of energy the entire Indian clothes industry, as native clothes once considered ‘obscurity’ ended up gotten back by Indian manufacturers. Today, I’m nevertheless has a major role in Indian trends due to the revivalists, who have kept the history in existence. NCL’s ideal side of the bargain has probably come from the incontrovertible fact that it’s got stored the Indian design landscape interesting and aids it get over the essential declare it found alone in over the eighties.
So, that’s the plan: this short clarification of the various minor and major trends in India. We’ll try and record each wave, as Indian the latest fashions are normally modifying. Remember: whatever you see is only a pattern! This is of each one is really as diverse because the unique.

After Sarajevo and East Sarajevo, which will host the 2017 European Youth Olympic Winter Festival (EYOF), were replaced by Erzurum, which will host EYOF in 2019, dynamism started in the provinces of the region.
Erzincan and Sivas, especially in the region of the province to get a share of the giant organization is already starting to lobby, one of the active 3 ski center in Gumushane 13 annual silence continues.
Turkey in terms of proximity to the city center will be perhaps the only, history, tourism and skiing can be done in one of the Süleymaniye Ski 13 annual blew ilerlemeyiş is causing demoralisation in everyone who love to ski.
Süleymaniye Ski Center, which has been attached to the development plan of Suleymaniye Neighborhood, which has been a site of SIT for years, could not be stepped on with various reasons, and the skiing national team coach answered the questions of GÜMÜŞKOZA about the organization in Erzurum. Yakut said that the European Youth Olympic Winter Festival, which will be held in 2017 in Erzurum, is not too late to be turned into an opportunity in Gumushane.
Yakut said that 99 is one percent of the competitions to be held in Erzurum. There is a time, bir he said.
”THE OPENING OF SÜLEYMANİYE WILL WASTE THE BIGGEST OWN WITH THIS ORGANIZATION IN OLYMPIC SETTING“
Yakut underlined that large slalom and ladies' slalom races can be done in Suleymaniye Ski Center. Yarış Slalom big slalom and Super G races will be held in EYOF European short games.

12 AY USED
Yakutiye said they knew there was a plan for Suleymaniye, but the region is not too late for the master plan to use 12 months. We do not know whether this plan is forward-looking or not. As far as I know, a two-person facility has been put in place. After the 2-3 season, perhaps this dual facility is worth. At least 4 and 6-6 are required. Or a job in a gondola with 8. And the back of the mountain has to be used. There are longer tracks. Should not be restricted to a valley. The main runway at Suleymaniye Ski Center is equipped with at least 4 and 6 can be met by the chairlift or 8 personality gondola. Otherwise, if it is done with a dual-cable-car, it will come up in the years to come. Because he can not handle the capacity, Çünkü he concluded..”
Unlike her erstwhile friend Ivanka Trump, Chelsea Clinton doesn’t have a clear role on her mother’s campaign. On one hand, she had a full campaign schedule before she gave birth to her son, Aidan, in June, logging 100 campaign appearances, and was in the room with her parents and the campaign’s top strategists on the morning of the New Hampshire primary. She piped up to encourage her mother to embrace the “Breaking Down Barriers” theme that she was about to reject. She is someone in the room — at least sometimes — whose voice Hillary listens to. “They seek her counsel regularly, at least as long as I’ve been around,” says someone who has worked with the Clintons.
Chelsea’s reserve is interpreted by some staffers as aloofness, her position and lifestyle as the entitled status of a high-maintenance heir to power.
This is certainly an image she and her parents promote: Chelsea Clinton, who introduced her mother as the presidential nominee at the Democratic National Convention, is no longer the curly-haired daughter bouncing around Air Force One. She is a professional adult, a working mom, and a figure of stature equal to that of her parents. For a while, the Clinton Foundation was renamed the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. At the Clinton Library in Little Rock, there are three oversized photographs of the Clintons hanging in the hallway, and Chelsea Victoria Clinton is featured as prominently as her mother and father are.
In one of Hillary Clinton’s first public appearances after leaving her post as secretary of state, she and Chelsea held an event together in Washington about Chelsea’s great passion: elephants. “Elephants really are a national security issue, because the ivory trade funds terrorism,” says someone who worked with Chelsea. “She is not afraid to stick up for issues that people don’t want to for whatever reason. She is just fearless about stuff like that.”
When Ivanka Trump introduced her father last week at the Republican National Convention, her role was clear: She was the polished young adult who could humanize her blustery dad; as a millennial(ish) woman with relatively liberal views, she offered a different lens on Trump himself.

With Chelsea, the role is much less clear. Her father Bill has already stepped up as a character witness for Hillary’s domestic side, and as a wealthy, Manhattan-based philanthropist, she doesn’t exactly offer a new angle on a candidate knocked as a fully credentialed member of the global elite. She has also, despite her intense privacy and reserve, made some bad decisions. She took a $600,000-a-year job as an ill-defined NBC correspondent, making it look like greed runs in the Clinton genes. She took over the scandal-plagued Clinton Foundation. Though married to a hedge-fund manager, she is the daughter of two public servants, and she raised eyebrows when she posed on the cover of Elle in Bulgari and Gucci. She lives in Manhattan in a $10 million apartment that is the length of an entire block.
In part, because of an outsize role she seemed born into, she is not beloved by Clinton campaign staffers. Her reserve is interpreted by some on the staff as aloofness, her position and lifestyle as the entitled status of a high-maintenance heir to power. She has a chief of staff because she also has a staff.
Campaign staffers have also had to clean up some of her mishaps on the trail. In January, when Clinton and Bernie Sanders were still holding to their pledge not to attack each other, Chelsea went after Sanders on his health care plan. Chelsea, who has a master’s degree in public health and teaches the subject at Columbia University, said Sanders’ plan would “dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the CHIP program, dismantle Medicare and dismantle private insurance.”
“I don’t want to empower Republican governors to take away Medicaid, to take away health insurance for low-income and middle-income working Americans,” she said in New Hampshire in January. “And I think very much that’s what Sen. Sanders’ plan would do.” This was a mischaracterization of the plan, and the Clinton campaign was left trying to walk back the mistake, even as it was trying to beat Sanders in the New Hampshire primary.
Not surprisingly for a woman who went through adolescence in the White House, and whose adolescence occurred during one of the most salacious White House scandals in American history, as her father’s dalliance with an intern was exposed — Chelsea Clinton took a long time to feel comfortable in the limelight. As a consultant at McKinsey & Co., and then an associate at Avenue Capital — a hedge fund managed by major Clinton donor Marc Lasry — she kept to herself and didn’t want to be seen as someone valuable only for her last name. It wasn’t until she hit the campaign trail with her mother in 2008 that she came to recognize — and embrace — the power of being a Clinton. “She realized she has a voice that people wanted to hear from,” said an associate of Chelsea’s, of her first experience speaking before thousands of people. “It becomes a bit heady, and that’s when she realized it. I think Chelsea ended up really finding herself then.”
Even as she has taken up a more public role, both at the Foundation and the campaign, she was, according to the people who know her, profoundly uneasy about her mother’s decision to run again. She is deeply loyal to her mother, who in June told Ellen DeGeneres while on her TV show that Chelsea is her “main support system.” But she’s also worried about what it will mean for her very nice, and as-normal-as-possible life. “She loves coffee, she loves her dogs, she loves her kids,” says a former Clinton colleague. She knows she will have to give up a lot if her mother becomes president. As she told Vogue’s Jonathan Van Meter, “My father was governor when I was born — I was on the front page of the newspaper the next day.”
If Chelsea has remained a mystery, despite America’s long exposure to her, this prolonged time in the public eye might have something to do with it. She hasn’t dropped the protective behavior she has cultivated over the past two decades.
“I would describe her as somebody who listens and is very thoughtful before she responds and speaks,” says the former Clinton colleague. It’s true: Her Twitter feed is so restrained, it makes Hillary Clinton’s look raucous and rollicking. And from Day One of Hillary’s campaign, Chelsea told her mother that she could not use the grandchildren she so desperately wanted for political aims. And despite the fact that Chelsea, in her campaign appearances, invokes her daughter, Charlotte, and son, Aidan, as the reasons she would rather entrust the nuclear codes and Obama’s legacy to her mother rather than to Trump, we will not be seeing photos of her children on Instagram the way we see Ivanka’s progeny. Whatever her role now, we can expect it to be played with her guard up. As her best friend from Little Rock told Van Meter: “She’s always lived her life as if she’s being watched.”

Pulse and Bloom is an interactive and social art installation that visualizes participants’ heartbeats and invites people to share and sync their human heartbeats in a rhythmic pattern. Pulse and Bloom is one of the largest biofeedback installations of its kind, allowing 40 people to visualize their heartbeats simultaneously.
Pulse and Bloom consists of 20 lotuses of varying heights of 10 to 14 feet with pulse sensors mounted on the base of the stem. When a participant places their hand upon the pulse sensor, the stem and the flower in the sky start to beat with their heart. Furthermore, when more than one person places their hand upon the pulse sensor, the stem starts to pulse with both participants’ heartbeats, making it possible to watch how heart rates of diffrent people in intimate spaces start to beat in sync, much like fireflies flashing in patterns.
Arranged in a circular matrix, the 20 lotuses contain LED lights wrapped around their stems and LEDs inside the flowers at the top that are activated when individual participants physically interact with the lotus. Each lotus is equipped with two pulse sensors, each located on a Hamsa Hand, that when pressed by one or two participants translates the participants' heartbeat into pulsing LED lights within the lotus, visually projecting their heart into the flower in the sky. As more people begin to interact with the different lotuses, visualizing their heartbeats in pulsing lights, we begin to see the effects of each person’s heartbeat on the other and the effect of meditative synchronicity unfold.
Pulse and Bloom received the Burning Man Honorarium Art Grant in 2014 and has been featured in a host of international press (BBC, NBC, TechCrunch, The Guardian and more).

They will be published Thursday and Friday for many developed countries.
This is an opportunity to come back to the issue of growth. That which allows the improvement of the standard of living and which conditions the dynamics of employment and the sustainability of social systems. In the short term, economic policy is essential, in the medium and long term, it is more collective choices, trade-offs that must be validated collectively.
On Thursday 29 and Friday 30 October, the first estimates of the growth figure for the third quarter of 2020 in developed countries will be published. After the ruptures observed last spring during the lockdown, a significant rebound is expected in all economies in order to reduce the extent of the second quarter negative shock but also to regain a satisfactory pace of growth.
But why growth? why want to find growth at all costs? Is this reasonable?
On this question there are two issues to distinguish. The first is that of the short term: why is it necessary to find a sufficient level of growth year after year. The second is associated with a longer scale as it is related to the standard of living profile over time. The questions asked are not of the same type.
Growth in the short term
In the short term, the dynamics of employment and incomes are conditioned by that of current growth. The target for the economic policy and policymaker is therefore to maximize growth to promote employment and income.
On the graph, we see the simple relationship between GDP growth (which measures activity) and employment growth: the higher the GDP growth, the greater the employment. The objective of economic policy may be to enrich growth with jobs, so that for a given GDP growth rate, more jobs are created. On this point in France, we see a change from 1993.
The horizon here is that of the economic situation and the electoral cycle.
After a negative shock on activity, a growth acceleration will also allow an improvement in tax and social revenues, facilitating the rebalancing of public finances. Social dynamics are very dependent on the growth of activity. The ability to finance social systems depends on the possibility of redistributing part of this growth in economic activity. It also means that, because of the constraints, it is difficult to deny the importance of growth unless you take the risk of destabilizing the whole of society and social systems.
This is why it is necessary to implement all possible measures to regain growth after the health shock. This reduces the risk of weakening the entire social system.
Long-Term Growth
Growth, in a more classic sense, is the ability to increase the standard of living of every citizen. The correct measure then is GDP per job, which is called productivity. This measure of the standard of living has multiplied by 5 since 1950, in France, until just before the health crisis.
We see, through its long growth, that there were several periods. Catching up after the war, the break-up in the mid-1970s and very little progress since the financial crisis. Growth is what will make it possible to improve everyone’s conditions and to implement redistribution systems so that everyone can benefit from the comfort provided by the rise in living standards.
A Few Remarks
Growth in productivity and standard of living is the combination of many factors: competition, innovations, capital accumulation, human capital, demographics and institutions. In a framework of strong international competition, those who are in retreat runs the risk of being dominated by a competitor and ultimately weakening the country’s own ability to maintain its standard of living. This is why the issue of growth is complex but that of decrease is even more so because the standard of living is permanently affected.
I will come back tomorrow and the day after tomorrow to the collective choices to be made but also to the externalities caused by this growth dynamic. Pollution, climate, overexploitation of the globe are all factors to be faced with growth.

the most grateful acknowledgements from all who have received them.
2. Temporal mercies from the womb till now, Psal, cxxxix. 14. These call for the most thankful acknowledgments every day, for they are new every morning. And we ought to be thankful for mercies conferred, not only on ourselves, but also on others, particular persons or societies. So did the apostle as to Philemon, Phil, ver. 4. • I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers. And so he did as to the Philippians, chap. i. 3. "I thank my God, upon every remembrance of you.' Secondly, Let us consider the necessity of thanksgiving.
1. It is all that we can render to God for good or benefits received, Hos. xiv. 2. namely, to acknowledge debt, and be thankful. Ingratitude among men is reckoned a great sin and scandal, and fixes an odious character on the person: but how much greater a sin and scandalous offence is it to be unthankful to God for the mercies which we enjoy, and that we never deserved at his bountiful hand! It is the character of heathens, Rom. i. 21. O let it not be that of Christians! 2. It is the way to get more.
Unthankfulness mars the course of divine communications ; but to the thankful it is opened, Phil. iv. 6. Ingratitude among men provokes the liberal person to with-hold his hand; and so does it provoke the holy God, the giver of all good, to restrain his favours. Alas! it is more natural to us to ask than to give thanks, Among ten seekers (the lepers), whom Christ cured of a very inveterate disease, there was but one thanker; and he is specially noticed in the gospel-history. We should never beg a mercy from the Lord, without heartily thanking him for all we have formerly received, as this is the ready way to procure more.
Thirdly, How should we give thanks ? With enlarged hearts, wondering at undeserved goodness; with deep humility for mercies conferred on such mean and unworthy creatures; with hearty resolutions to improve them for God's glory and honour; and with warm desires to receive more favours from the hands of God, our bountiful benefactor.
I shall conclude with a few inferences.
1. To live without prayer is a godless and graceless life, It is no better than the life of beasts, unsuitable to the ra. ţional nature of man, contrary to the design and end of his creation, and highly unbecoming one who is a candidate for immortality. It exposes the sinner to the severest strokes of God's justice; and, persisted in, will land him in hell
. O let us all be excited to a life of prayer, remembering that we cannot be Christians without it. To pretend to be a Christian, and not to live a life of prayer, is a palpable contradiction.
2. The missing of the answers of prayer is our own fault, we pray amiss. If we always prayed in faith, and in the manner formerly observed, we would not be disappointed. Let us then be induced to pray in a right manner, and wait particularly on the Lord for gracious acceptance, and a favourable answer.
3. It is through Jesus Christ that the communication with heaven is opened and obtained. Let us then pray in his name, depend upon his intercession, and present all our petitions to God through him : for him the Father heareth always.
4. We need the Spirit of prayer, in order to our praying aright. Let us then cry incessantly for the Holy Spirit, and his influences; for we know not what to pray for as we ought. Let us look for his quickening influences to quicken our dead hearts, and warm our frozen affections, that we may send up our hearts unto God, and wing our desires to heaven.
5, Be exhorted to give yourselves unto prayer in all the sorts of it. Be men of prayer, as David was Psal. cxix, 164. • Seven times a day do I praise thee.' How may this shame many Christians who pray but twice a-day? And how does it condemn all who restrain prayer before the Lord ? O let us be induced to make conscience of this important and delightful duty; without the exercise of which, we behave no better than the beasts that perish, and are a company of ungrateful monsters, that shall be turned into hell, with all the nations that forget God, Pray evening and morning, and at all convenient seasons.
Be always in a praying frame, and be devout and lively in all your applications to the throne of grace. Omit no season of it, not even amidst your daily employments; for even then ye
may
send forth pious thoughts towards heaven, and maintain communion with God while you are engaged in your daily labours : Pray without ceasing.'.
I'might have spoke of occasional and stated prayer ; of public, private, and secret prayer; and of ordinary and extraordinary ; but I shall drop all these, and only give you next a discourse on secret prayer.
A DISCOURSE ON SECRET PRAYER.
MATTH. vi. 6.- But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy
closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.
AVING opened unto you the nature of prayer in ge
in the text.
Lord's
prayer, it will not be improper to discourse a little of that too much neglected duty, secret prayer ; concerning which our blessed Lord gives directions in this passage of scripture. And this he does negatively, ver. 5. cautioning against performing that important duty with vanity and ostentation, to gain the applause of men. (2.) Positively,
Wherein consider, 1. The duty itself urged by the Lord. And in it we may observe,
(1.) The duty supposed: When thou prayest. That this is to be understood only of secret. ii. 4. Therefore we must understand here solemn secret prayer; which, in the text, the Lord takes it for granted that his disciples made conscience of.
(2.) The place to be chosen for it: Enter into thy closet; that is, a secret place, where you may be out of the view
of others; for secret prayers are not to be restrained to secret chambers, as Christ's praying on a mountain does evidence.
(3.) The care that we should take least our secret place become public: Shut thy door, so as others may not see thee, and so thou fall a sacrifice to hypocrisy, vanity and ostentation.
4.) The duty itself commanded : Pray to thy father which is in secret. Where we have, [1.] The object of prayer, thy Father, namely in Christ; intimating to us, that when we go to God, we should go to him as he is our Father in Christ, able and ready to help us, and reconciled to us in him. [2.] A designation which the Father gets, which is in secret; who knows as well what thou sayest in a secret place as what thou sayest in public; for he is omniscient and omnipresent.
2. The motive whereby he presseth secret prayer, viz. God's reward, who will openly reward service done in secret, which the world knows not of. And those who make conscience of this duty in faith and fervency, are no strangers to those rewards and advantages that are to be met with in this heavenly traffic.
The text affords the following doctrine. Doct. •Secret.
I. I am to confirm the doctrine, or shew that secret prayer is a necessary duty incumbent on all. This will be clear, if ye consider,
1. Christ's express command in the text, which is to us instead of all reasons. His will is a sufficient ground of our duty. He commands nothing but what is just and right in itself, good for us, and conducive to his glory. And the command of God should be a prevalent motive
spent much
with all to practise constantly this duty, which is attended with so much pleasure and profit.
2. The Spirit of God, by the apostle, Eph. vi. 18. calls for it, “Pray with all praying,' viz. all sorts of prayer, of which secret prayer is one. There are many exhortations to this duty in holy scripture, which manifestly shew the importance and necessity of it; such as that, 1 Thess. v. 17. • Pray without ceasing;' which must denote secret prayer, as well as other kinds of that exercise.
3. The practice of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath set a fair and striking example of this duty to all his followers. He was in strict propriety a man of
prayer, and time in this delightful exercise, as we may see from Matth. xiv. 23. “And when he had sent the multitude away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.' 'Mark i. 35. And in the inorning,. • He that saithsalmist says, Psal. v. 3.
Psal. v. 3. My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.' And how often this holy man was employed in this exercise, he tells us, Psal. lv. 17. • Evening and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.' Which practice of his may make even the best of us blush, who usually confine our secret devotions to the morning and evening, and perhaps on very slight occasions intermit sometimes one of these seasons. But this pious man, though a crowned head, and involved in much business, was yet oftener at the throne of grace; for he says, Psal. cxix. 164. “Seven times a day ! will praise thee.' D that we could imitate so noble an es. ample of sequestration and retirement from the world! Thus also Daniel : kneeled upon his knees three times a-day, and
gave thanks before his God,' chap. vi. 10. and Vol. III.

Insurer Withdrawal: What You Need to Know Emily A. Vlasich, Senior Counsel, Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty This presentation does not constitute legal advice. Please consult you own counsel for guidance on any legal matters.
What is withdrawal? • Most people think of a total withdrawal from the market. • E. g. Hawaii 431: 3 -215 • (a) “No insurer other than a life insurer shall withdraw from this state until its direct liability to its policyholders and obligees under all its insurance contracts then in force in this State has been assumed by another authorized insurer under an agreement approved by the commissioner. ” • Assuming insurer must replace policy contracts with its own • Prior to withdrawal, insurer must give notice to DOI and publish withdrawal in local newspaper • Insurer must surrender certificate of authority
Do all states have withdrawal filing requirements? • About half of the states have some kind of formal notice/review/approval requirement • CA, CT, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, KS, LA, ME, MD, MS, MO, NV, NJ, NY, NC, ND, OK, OR, PA, SD, TX, UT • Other states do not require approval for withdrawal, but insurers are still bound by cancel/nonrenewal requirements, obligations under the insurance contract, etc.
Why do states care about withdrawal? • Availability of insurance in the marketplace • Effect on agents • Other consumer protection issues (confusion, uncertainty, comparable coverage, etc. )
Other actions can trigger “withdrawal” statutes. • Depending on the state: ▫ ▫ ▫ Exiting a line of business Exiting a sub-line of business Exiting a “class” of business Terminating a program A block nonrenewal Transferring to an affiliated underwriting company
Examples: • California 674. 5 -674. 6: (a) No insurer shall cease to offer any particular class of commercial liability insurance without prior notification to the commissioner. • an insurer shall notify the department at least 60 days prior to the date it intends to withdraw wholly or substantially from certain lines of insurance, including most commercial and personal lines. Upon receipt of the notice, the commissioner may request and review additional information, as deemed necessary, and investigate the market conditions to determine whether that insurance may become not readily available in the voluntary insurance market as a result of the withdrawal. • "intent to substantially withdraw" means an insurer's intent to nonrenew in excess of 50 percent of its current policyholders in the line of coverage upon their next renewal.
Examples: • North Carolina 58 -41 -45 • Terminating Line of Business: Except as provided in G. S. 58 -41 -30, no insurer may terminate, by nonrenewals, an entire book of business of any kind of insurance without 60 days prior written notice to the Commissioner; unless the Commissioner determines that continuation of the line of business would impair the solvency of the insurer or unless the Commissioner determines that such termination is effected under a plan that minimizes disruption in the marketplace or that makes provisions for alternative coverage at comparable rates and terms. • 58 -7 -15: “kind of insurance” = line of insurance
Examples • Connecticut 34 a-44 • Any insurer licensed to do business in this state, or authorized to do business on a nonadmitted basis, which intends to discontinue offering or substantially reduce its writings in a line or subline of insurance in this state shall send, by registered or certified mail, or deliver to the Insurance Commissioner written notice of its intent to take such action at least sixty days before the initial notice of cancellation or nonrenewal is delivered or mailed to the insureds. This section shall not apply to life insurance policies or annuity contracts.
Examples: • Connecticut Bulletin PC-34 • The term "subline of insurance" means major classes of a line of business. Such categories identify a particular type of risk or operation. For example: liquor liability, products, and daycare sublines of "Other Liability"; garages, school buses, taxis or sublines of "Automobile. " • The term "substantially reduce" is interpreted as follows. If an insurer has been writing a line or subline of insurance and it nonrenews or cancels some of its risks in that line or subline of insurance then it is reducing its writings. For example, when an insurer nonrenews or cancels some of its auto body repairer accounts, then there has been a reduction in writings for the subline of garage insurance. Whethere has been a substantial reduction in writings is dependent upon factors such as the number of risks written by the insurer, impact on the market, etc.
Examples: • New Jersey NJAC 11: 2 -29. 2 • "Withdraw" or "withdrawal" means the nonrenewal, cancellation, or termination of policies, or surrender of authority to transact the business of insurance in this State, or any insurer action that is equivalent to a withdrawal from the business of insurance in this State which may include, but is not limited to, the elimination of a rating system, termination of agency contracts, reduction in agency commissions, restrictions on agency solicitation or binding authority, insurer refusal of applications or declaration of a dividend to an affiliate, when such action or actions exceed those occurring in the ordinary course of business. Whether the above activities are equivalent to a withdrawal shall be determined by the Commissioner on a case-bycase basis. • "Withdraw" or "withdrawal" also means the transfer to another insurer of insurance business pursuant to an assumption agreement as defined herein or a portfolio reinsurance agreement as defined herein.
Examples: • New Jersey NJAC 11: 1 -22. 2 prohibits block nonrenewing entire lines or classes of insurance, except pursuant to a plan filed and approved by the commissioner • NJAC 11: 1 -22. 1 defines "block" and "class" as any group of insureds, however defined or designated, to which a common plan or program of cancellation or nonrenewal applies.
Framework for determining whether withdrawal requirements are triggered • Are there any formal withdrawal requirements? • What is the statutory line? Statutory line definitions vary by state and do not always match up with the annual statement line. ▫ E. g. Homeowners vs. professional liability • What action are you taking? Review against withdrawal requirements.
Statutory Line: TX Example • • • Ins s 861. 201 Kinds of insurance authorized (a) A general casualty company may: (1) insure a person against: (A) bodily injury, disability, or death that results from an accident; or (B) disability that results from disease; (2) insure against loss or damage that results from an accident or injury sustained by an employee or other person, for which accident or injury the insured is liable; (3) insure against loss or damage that results from an accident to or injury sustained by a person, for which loss the insured is liable, other than employers liability insurance under Subdivision (2); (4) insure against loss or damage by burglary, theft, or housebreaking; (5) insure glass against breakage; (6) insure a steam boiler, elevator, electrical device, or engine and any machinery or appliance used or operated in connection with a steam boiler, elevator, electrical device, or engine;
Statutory line: TX Example (cont. ) • • • (7) insure against loss or damage from injury to a person or property that results accidentally from an item described by Subdivision (6); (8) insure against loss or damage by water to goods or premises that arises from the breakage or leakage of a sprinkler or water pipe; (9) insure against loss that: (A) results from accidental damage to an automobile; or (B) is caused accidentally by an automobile; (10) insure a person, association, or corporation against loss or damage that results from giving or extending credit; (11) insure against loss that results from the nonpayment of the principal of or interest on a bond, mortgage, or other evidence of indebtedness; (12) write marine insurance, which may include insurance against the hazards and perils incident to war; or (13) insure against any other casualty or insurance risk, other than fire or life insurance, specified in the company's articles of incorporation that: (A) may be lawfully made the subject of insurance; and (B) is not otherwise provided for by this chapter. (b) A general casualty company may engage in one or more of the activities specified by Subsection (a).
Pop Quiz: Is a filing needed? • • • Ceasing to write home and auto insurance Terminating a renters insurance program Ceasing to write medical malpractice insurance Ceasing to write taverns and bars Moving business to new property product filed in affiliated company • Ceasing to write surplus lines liability • Selling an underwriting company
What is in a withdrawal filing? • Varies by state • Generally, lines, policy count, premium, agents affected, whethere is a replacement carrier. • Communications to insureds, including nonrenewal notices • Notice can range from 30 days to 13 months
Other Considerations • Nonrenewal requirements ▫ State notice requirements ▫ Additional requirements in policy contract ▫ There may be an offer by a replacement carrier
Other Considerations • Agent relationships ▫ If a program termination or withdrawal effectively terminates an agent relationship, need to consider the laws effecting agent terminations ▫ Often there are exceptions in agent termination restrictions for withdrawals that are filed and approved. ▫ Laws and agent contract address notice obligation to agents ▫ MGA – need to terminate underwriting authority or claims handling agreements, per contract
Other Considerations • Certificate of Authority – some states require the surrender of the certificate of authority for some period of time • Withdrawal of product filings – some state require filings to be withdrawn once all business is nonrenewed. • Brand risk – leaving a line where there is a market availability problem can be high profile. E. g. med mal; coastal property
Questions?A SOUTH Korean-based corporation is being tipped to finance former Hong Kong First Division club Sea Bee's comeback next season. The company plan to take over Sea Bee's registration, left vacant by the now-defunct Ernest Borel. Details of the corporation's bid are sketchy although it is understood that a middleman is piecing together the deal. Sea Bee spokesman Tsui Kwok-on, the former team manager of Ernest Borel owned by Sea Bee president Lam Wai-wah, said the Korean corporation had not approached them directly.

Stonnie L. Pollock
Fasken Oil and Ranch, Ltd., Midland, TX
In 1984, Ed Matchus, a WTGS Life Member, and his team of Midland geologists, laid out a cross section based on well cuttings that captures all the stratigraphy of the Wolfberry play, WTGS 84-79 Permian Basin East to West Cross Section. Application of the WTGS 84-79 cross-section enhances stratigraphic interpretation of the formations within the Wolfberry Play. The western portion of the Wolfberry play is defined as a northwest-southeast fairway delineated by the western margin of the Midland Basin and the Wolfcamp shelf edge along the eastern side of the Central Basin Platform. Most operators drill and complete wells with multiple-stage fracs within the Strawn, Wolfcamp, Dean, and Spraberry formations. The Wolfberry interval in this part of the basin represents both conventional and unconventional reservoirs within a very thick stratigraphic interval (as much as 4,000’). This interval includes Pennsylvanian to Guadalupian aged formations, which comprise slope and basinal deposits. The Wolfberry play is unique, due to the very thick stratigraphic interval that consists of multiple lithologies deposited in various settings. The heterogeneity of numerous lithologies, depositional facies, and pore types create both challenges and opportunities for implementing effective spacing, drilling, evaluation, and stimulation techniques. Revisiting valuable resources such as the WTGS 84-79 E-W Cross-Section allow collaboration of the knowledge of those who have preceded us with new reservoir models and advanced drilling and completion methods. Integration of these resources will improve our ability to recover more hydrocarbons from the Permian Basin.

What Does Professional Growth Look Like?
Updated: Jun 23, 2020
Growth, both on a personal and a professional level, is vital. The alternative is stagnation and decay.
It's never comfortable to admit that you are not perfect, to admit past mistakes, to take responsibility for the things you have and have not done. Just like people, businesses can get set in their ways.
But just like people, businesses should not want to find themselves on the wrong side of history.
In the past few weeks, following the murder of George Floyd, thousands and thousands of businesses and corporations have responded, in one way or another, to the Black Lives Matter movement.
These responses have varied hugely in terms of content and quality, and reception to these responses has varied in kind. So, what separates the fake from the genuine? How can you tell them apart?
Well-received responses to the situation have
1. Been thoughtful
Well-considered, un-rushed
Carefully worded
Demonstrative of real care and concern
2. Been nuanced
More than a single, surface-level statement
Invested in accurately representing situations of injustice
Maintained a continual level of investment and engagement
3. Been active
Time pledged
Effort pledged
Money pledged
Petitions/phone numbers/email addresses/contact addresses shared
4. Been honest
Expressed in a truthful and non-performative manner
Previously held ignorances and ongoing privileges acknowledged
5. Been black-focused
Black voices are elevated
Black creators are spotlighted
Black opinions/ideas are heard, appreciated, and correctly attributed
To grow is not easy. Often, it is difficult and raw. The term "growing pains" exists for a reason, after all. It hurts to become something new.
But it hurts far, far worse to die at the hands of a person who should have served and protected you. Black Lives Matter. All lives cannot matter until black lives do.

Sinn Féin spokesperson on Community Development, Paul Donnelly TD, has welcomed the publication of "long overdue" government legislation to deal with the illegal and dangerous use of scramblers and quads in our communities.
The Dublin West TD said:
“I welcome the publication of this legislation that will see powers finally being given to the Gardaí to tackle this scourge on our communities.
"However, it would be remiss not to point out that both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Ministers and TD’s told Sinn Féin that this could not be done, yet today’s publication has proven that we were right.
"This legislation is very similar to legislation that I and other Sinn Fein TD’s have been trying to progress through the houses on many occasions over the past number of years.
"We look forward to working with the government to ensure that this is enacted quickly.
"The most important steps that must take place following the passing of this legislation, is the implementation of these new laws by the Gardaí.
"We will be seeking a meeting with senior Garda management to ensure that a strategy is put in place to enforce the laws and that they have the resources available to them to do so.
"Sinn Féin in government will ensure that the Gardaí have all the resources in place to end this scourge on our communities."Kew Gardens Osmanthus Rose Hand Wash

Houses on the market come in all shapes and sizes as well as conditions. Real estate investors seek out fixer-uppers because they want to flip the property. Everyday individuals may pick a house that requires several upgrades because they want to turn it into a home. Not because they want to flip it. One way to balance the cost of upgrades and the property is to obtain a favourable home loan interest rate. You can see the effects of several rates with the Best Rate Mortgage Calculator.
Best Rate Mortgage Calculator
The Best Rate Mortgage Calculator only has four inputs. You enter the estimated property value and loan amount. Then, pick between full documentation or low documentation. Lastly, pick a fixed interest rate or variable. The output is an array of mortgage deals with their corresponding interest rate and repayment amount. For your information, the repayment is displayed in weekly, monthly and fortnightly instalments.
These results are estimates and hypothetical scenarios because the actual home loan approved entails much more documentation and analysis.
Completing Home Upgrades
The latest features and technology advancements are integrated into the newest homes. Your home may not be old but benefits from new windows, a modern water heater and smart-home appliances. New homes often include smart thermostats, energy efficient cooling and heating systems. Older homes with solid bones can sustain the installation of these systems, too.
You may not be interested in turning your new house into a smart home. The property may still need upgrades such as a new roof, insulation and fresh coat of paint.
As you inspect the property you have your eye on, take into account how much the upgrades will cost. If the property is dilapidated, the lender may request an assessment before they agree to fund the home loan. If it passes the lender’s scrutiny, keep the property’s cost in mind. Next, aim to garner the best possible interest rate so that the cost of the mortgage is low.
The Impact of Interest Rates
A lender charges its home loan clients a fee for the funds lent in the form of interest rates. Market conditions decide quarterly interest rates. Rates are charged as a percentage based on the principal amount borrowed. Well-qualified clients tend to receive favourable rates. Market conditions can favour all borrowers, too, because sometimes, it is about having good timing.
An individual faced with the costs of several home upgrades has to balance those costs with the mortgage. Consulting with professionals like us makes the process smoother. Plus, our access to proprietary technology and information helps us help our clients.
Best Rate Mortgage Calculator Conclusion
There are a variety of home loans and interest rates on the market. Our Mortgage House Best Rate Mortgage Calculator is available to you as well as our professional opinion and expertise.Fine Tea Collection A range of high quality exclusive loose teas, packed in collectable embossed caddies. More

Marcus Watson had been waiting all season to get in the lineup, recovering from a strained knee ligament.
Finally pulling on a Nipissing Lakers jersey to make his season debut, he made the most of it.
Watson scored the game-winner 2:48 into overtime, converting a feed from Conor O'Donnell on a two-on-one, as the Lakers pulled out a 2-1 win over the University of Toronto Blues in front of 1,430 fans at Memorial Gardens, Friday.
“It was like Christmas morning for him,” O'Donnell said, a reference to the gift he gave Watson for the game-winner.
Actually, it was just how they drew it up. Before they went out together for a shift in the 4-on-4 overtime session, they made plans.
“The puck came off the boards and I picked it up but I saw he (O'Donnell) was a little ahead of me and I didn't want to take him offside, because he was offside a couple times this game, so I one-handed it to him,” Watson said. “We actually talked about it on the bench before. He said, 'If I have the puck, you go back door and if you have the puck, I'll go back door.' So I listened to him and we scored.”
It was the first goal of the season for Watson, a second-year forward from San Jose, Calif., who had eight goals and 15 points n 20 games as a rookie last year.
“It was good to finally get out there and play and help the guys out anyway I can and I ended up helping out in a pretty big way,” Watson said.
The game ended on Watson's deke to the backhand after a 2-on-1 break, but the first 62 minutes were about as gritty and physical as any two teams could get. The Lakers outshot the Blues 33-32, but that probably could have been the count of big hits and after-the-whistle bumps in front of the net.
“That was probably the toughest game we've seen in the OUA since we've been in the league,” said Lakers head coach Mike McParland. “I thought that was our best 60-minute effort of the season.
“To get Marcus Watson's speed back in the lineup made a difference at the right time, when it was 4-on-4. I thought both goalies were outstanding tonight and for the fans, for the price they paid, they got great entertainment, getting to stay a little bit longer. The two points for us is what's most important, but it was a hell of a team effort.”
Lucas McKinley had opened the scoring in the second period, deflecting Jeff Leaist's point shot past Blues goalie Garrett Sheehan.
The Blues responded early in the third period when Kyle Venture went upstairs over the blocker of Lakers goaler Daniel Spence.
McKinley now has four goals in his last four games, and with five goals on the season, has surpassed his season-best from each of his first two seasons.
“Right now, McKinley and (Matt) Paton have just been outstanding in leading our forwards,” McParland said. “Lucas and I had a small talk before the season, because I've always believed he's an outstanding player, but he just hasn't been consistent enough.
“He hasn't played a bad game since the start of the season. I'm really happy for Lucas with how hard he's playing. He shows up every night.”
With the win, the Lakers (6-6-0) moved back to the .500 mark, looking to continue climbing in a tight OUA East division, where they are tied with three other teams two points behind second-place Toronto (6-3-2). The Lakers boarded the bus after the game to travel to Kingston for a Saturday road game against the Queen's Gaels (5-3-2).
“Tonight, we started the night in seventh place, but we're only three points out of second,” McParland said. “This win was important for us and tomorrow, we have to go to Queen's with the objective of getting some points. Hopefully, we'll get a better start than we had there last time, but I'm optimistic because I think Queen's is one of the teams that fits our style.”They put up a very large backyard fence for us in just a few days. Very fast and they literally didn't leave anything behind for us to pick up. The group of guys were so polite and professional. Highly recommend these fellers!
Ashley Fordlee Posch
Cody installed a fence for me in April 2021. He was very quick on getting the material on order and got it installed quickly. Fence was installed perfectly. He had a very good price compared to other fence installers in the St. Cloud MN area. I would recommend Integrity Fence for any fencing projects you may have.March can be a great time to fly to Karachi from Oakland, California with a flight ticket averaging about $1,032.

End of story. We wanted speed and now we get it folks are worried. I remember when we came into the league Bo made a comment somewhere along the lines of making teams change our style. I like speed. The slow plodding crap at LB we have had the pas 2 years save David has got to go. Our front four does their job, weight at LB matters even less. Now their OL gets free shots on our LB's................. Bo (or other staffer) also made a comment earlier about bringing the guys along and allowing them to make plays instead of thinking so much. I think after last year, Bo realizes the importance of speed and athleticism. He is really trying to get our best 11 on the field on O, D and ST. It is going to be a good year. Something about the practices (to date), the lack of "traditional" coach speak and perceived depth and players confidence is just different this year. Speed is nice, but if that and athleticism is all they have, we will get exploited in other spots. These guys have to have football smarts, along with the athleticism and speed to get on the field. Bo just released a presser and just said speed isn't everything. I agree with you, its going to be a good year. I just hope we have two players who can step up at DT and give us that push up front we have needed since '10. The Huskers won't see a non-spread team that is worth a damn until the last four games of the season. I'd rather have Gerry until it shows that we need more beef on the field. Quote Link to comment

July 18, 2021 (PRLEAP.COM) Entertainment NewsCrystal Mortem and the Library of Eternal Knowledge, a new book by Bradlee Love, has been released by RoseDog Books.
After a massacre on a faraway world, Guardians Dash and Petey are sent to find a lost friend. But all is not as it seems when the dreaded Duxin Empire frames them for the crime. Now they must embark on a journey to prove their innocence and discover an ancient crystal that houses the entire knowledge of the universe.
About the Author
Bradlee Love grew up watching sci-fi and fantasy films. His love of adventure and mystery is what inspires him to write. There's nothing better than the feeling of being taken off guard by something. That excitement of expecting one twist only to be hit with another you didn't see coming. It's like a game you play with the reader. Can they work it out before it's revealed? That is the cornerstone of all writing, the breadcrumbs. Love's favorite thing is creating fun and interesting characters. And exploring those characters in a different light. It's essential to have a character that can make you laugh. Make you sympathize with them, or make you hate them. That's where Love starts his writing. He begins with the characters, then builds the world around them.
Crystal Mortem and the Library of Eternal Knowledge is a 416-page paperback with a retail price of $25.00 (eBook $20.00). The ISBN is 978-1-63764-965In January 2016, I established Makara Center for the Arts, a volunteer-run nonprofit library & art center in my hometown.

The Massachusetts Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) requires retail electricity suppliers (both regulated distribution utilities and competitive suppliers) obtain a percentage of the electricity they serve to their customers from qualifying renewable energy facilities. The RPS began with a compliance obligation of one percent in 2003, and increased by one-half percent annually until it reached four percent in 2009. In 2009, as a part of the Green Communities Act of 2008, the RPS Class I annual obligation was set to increase by 1% annually and a new RPS Class II was created for existing renewable energy facilities. Each Class has different annual compliance requirements as well as different eligibility criteria for qualifying facilities .
Suppliers meet their annual RPS obligations by acquiring a sufficient quantity of RPS-qualified renewable energy certificates (RECs) that are created, traded, and tracked at the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) Generation Information System (GIS).
The NEPOOL GIS tracks all electricity generated within the ISO New England (ISO-NE) control area and fed onto the New England grid, as well as electricity exchanged between ISO-NE and adjacent control areas. For each megawatt hour (MWh) of electricity, whether renewable or not, one serial-numbered, electronic certificate is created and added to the NEPOOL GIS account of the Unit that generated the MWh. Certificates that represent renewable generation are coded accordingly and known as renewable energy certificates or RECs.
What are RECs?
Electricity produced by new renewable energy generators qualified for the RPS is generally broken into two products:
1) The electricity production that is consumed on-site or delivered to the grid
2) The positive environmental attributes associated with then energy production.
RECs represent the second product. One REC is created each time a qualified facility generates 1 megawatt hour (MWh) of electricity. In order for retail electricity suppliers to meet their annual compliance obligations established by the RPS, they must purchase a number of RECs equal to the percentage for that particular compliance year. For example, in 2020 all Suppliers will be required to purchase an amount of RECs equal to 15% of the total electricity they serve in Massachusetts.
Before a facility can generate RECs at NEPOOL GIS, the facility must first apply to DOER and receive a Statement of Qualification certifying its eligibility.
While REC values are generally determined by market supply and demand in a given compliance year, DOER plays a role in establishing a parameter on market prices by setting an Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) Rate. This serves as a ceiling price and allows suppliers to meet their annual obligations by making payments at this rate in lieu of purchasing RECs. For every MWh a supplier is short of meeting its compliance obligation, it must make an ACP to DOER. The ACP Rate therefore incentivizes retail electricity suppliers to purchase RECs from qualified facilities at an amount lower than the ACP Rate in order to meet their compliance obligations.. New renewable energy facilities are those that began commercial operation after 1997, generate electricity using any of the following technologies, and meet all other program eligibility criteria:
- Solar photovoltaic
- Solar thermal electric
- Wind energy
- Small hydropower
- Landfill methane and anaerobic digester gas
- Marine or hydrokinetic energy
- Geothermal energy
- Eligible biomass fuel
RPS Solar Carve-Out
On January 1, 2010, new regulations were filed that established a requirement for a portion of the RPS Class I renewable energy requirement to come from solar photovoltaic (PV) energy. This carve-out supported over 650 megawatts of new distributed solar PV energy facilities across the Commonwealth and stopped accepting new applications with the launch of the RPS Solar Carve-Out II Program in April 2014. Eligible facilities generate solar renewable energy certificates (SRECs) and will continue to do so until 2023, after which the facilities will generate Class I RECs.
RPS Solar Carve-Out II
The second phase of the Solar Carve-Out Program began with the promulgation of changes to the RPS Class I Regulation on April 25, 2014. The program was originally designed to continue supporting new solar photovoltaic (PV) installations until 1,600 MW of capacity was installed across the entire Commonwealth, but was extended in February 2016 and March 2017 as DOER was in the midst of developing a successor incentive program. The program is actively accepting applications for new PV facilities and will continue to remain active until the launch of the new Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) Program sometime in 2018. Eligible facilities generate SREC IIs for a 40-quarter period from the time they are qualified, after which they generate Class I RECs.
RPS Class II Renewables
Similar to RPS Class I, this class pertains to generation units that use eligible renewable resources, but have an operation date prior to January 1,1998. Therefore, RPS Class II provides financial incentives for the continued operation of qualified pre-1998 renewable generation units. Eligible facilities generate Class II RECs and the annual percentage requirement varies from year to year per a formula in regulation.
RPS Class II Waste Energy
This class includes generation units that are classified as Waste Energy Generation Units and are located in Massachusetts. Typically these units burn solid waste at extremely high temperatures to generate electricity or steam power, in addition to providing funding to support recycling programs in Massachusetts. Eligible facilities generated Class II Waste Energy Certificates (WECs) and the annual percentage requirement is fixed at 3.5% per year.
Alternative Portfolio Standard (APS)
The Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (APS) was established as of January 1, 2009, under the Green Communities Act of 2008. The APS offers a new opportunity for Massachusetts businesses, institutions, and governments to receive an incentive for installing eligible alternative energy systems, which are not necessarily renewable, but contribute to the Commonwealth's clean energy goals by increasing energy efficiency and reducing the need for conventional fossil fuel-based power generation. Similar to the RPS, it requires a certain percentage of the state's electric load to be met by eligible technologies, which for APS include Combined Heat and Power (CHP), flywheel storage, and efficient steam technologies. Eligible facilities generate Alternative Energy Certificates (AECs) and the annual percentage requirement increases by 0.25% per year indefinitely.
Clean Peak Energy Standard
The Clean Peak Energy Standard is designed to provide incentives to clean energy technologies that can supply electricity or reduce demand during seasonal peak demand periods established by DOER. The Clean Peak Energy Standard (CPS) was part of An Act to Advance Clean Energy, which was signed into law in August 2018. Clean Peak Resources include new Class I Renewable Energy Resources, Existing Class I / Class II resources that are paired with an Energy Storage System, Energy Storage Systems, and Demand Response Resources. Any qualified resource that generates, dispatches or discharges energy to the electric grid during a Seasonal Peak Period will generate Clean Peak Certificates. Clean Peak Certificates can be sold to retail electricity suppliers, which are required to meet a baseline minimum percentage of sales each year. DOER is charged with establishing four Seasonal Peak Periods in which resources must operate, determine a metering and verification protocol to ensure that all data is collected, reviewed and reported in a consistent manner, set the Alternative Compliance Payment rate and procurement process, and establish annual compliance requirements.
Clean Energy Standard (CES)
Overseen by Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection
In response to the Global Warming Solutions Act (GWSA) and the resultant Order 569 that stipulated greenhouse gas emissions reductions for the Commonwealth, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) promulgated the Clean Energy Standard (CES) through 310 CMR 7.75.
Beginning in 2018, the Clean Energy Standard (CES) sets a minimum percentage of electricity sales that utilities and competitive retail suppliers must procure from clean energy sources. The minimum percentage begins at 16% in 2018, and increases 2% annually to 80% in 2050. The CES is met through acquisition of Clean Energy Credits (CECs) or by making an Alternative Compliance Payment (75% of RPS ACP from 2018 to 2020, and 50% of the RPS ACP thereafter).
- RPS Class I compliance (13% in 2018) counts toward compliance with the CES (16% in 2018). Thus, the net incremental CES requirement for 2018 is 3%.
- Any RPS Class I qualified generation attributes will also qualify for CECs.
- Technologies that meet the emissions and vintage requirement will qualify for CECs, as well as energy procured under the 2016 Energy Diversity Act (e.g., 83d).
- Existing customer contracts on or before August 11, 2017, will be exempt only for incremental CES obligation over and above the RPS obligation in any year.
- Banking will not be allowed until 2021

Arg759-Lys879
Accession # Q86WJ1
Applications
Please Note: Optimal dilutions should be determined by each laboratory for each application. General Protocols are available in the Technical Information section on our website.
Data Example
Detection of Human CHD1L by Western Blot. Western blot shows lysates of Jurkat human acute T cell leukemia cell line, DU145 human prostate carcinoma cell line, and HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. PVDF membrane was probed with 1 µg/mL of Sheep Anti-Human CHD1L Antigen Affinity-purified Polyclonal Antibody (Catalog # AF6959) followed by HRP-conjugated Anti-Sheep IgG Secondary Antibody (Catalog # HAF016). A specific band was detected for CHD1L at approximately 115: CHD1L
CHD-1L (Chromohelicase/ATPase DNA-binding protein 1-Like; also ALC-1) is a 98-118 kDa member of the SNF2/RAD54 helicase family of proteins. It is expressed in hepatocytes, possesses ATPase activity, and likely promotes chromatin remodeling at sites of DNA damage. It also is considered an oncogene. CHD-1L upregulates ARHGEF9 trabscription, an action that promotes Cdc42 activity with accompanying filopodia formation and EMT. It also binds apoptosis-mediating Nur77, blocking its migration from nucleus-to-mitochondria. Human CHD-1L is 897 amino acids (aa) in length. It contains a helicase ATP-binding domain (aa 58-223), a C-terminal helicase domain (aa 351-513), a coiled-coil region (aa 38-675) and one Macro domain that binds poly-ADP-ribose and targets DNA damage sites (aa 704-897). There are at least two Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites. There are multiple potential splice variants. One isoform contains an alternative start site at Met114, a second isoform possesses a deletion of aa 43-246, a third isoform shows a three aa substitution for aa 363-897, and a fourth isoform combines a 16 aa insertion after Arg386 with a five aa substitution for aa 425-897. Over aa 759-879, human CHD-1L shares 94% aa identity with mouse CHD-1L.

The team though has accomplished many things but once thing that they failed to control was the “Wheel of Time”. The weather is still terrible and unbearable. The story becomes a thriller when we observe that Rand and Min are in a hurry to reach their destination. We don’t know why they are in such a hurry and Cadsuane too show curiosity in their haste as she goes behind them.
The book is also with certain revelations as we come to know about the leader of the Black Tower a man that was kept hidden in Path of Daggers and A Crown of Swords. Now finally they know who their enemy is, still fighting him is not that easy for anyone. There is also a search going on for Faile which gives us the hint that the character would have a strong relationship with the plot that is not yet revealed.
At the same time Rand is with an army which is quite difficult to handle as it is a mixed one with people of different tribe joining in for a final show. The daughter of the nine moons, however, steals the show when she arrives in a gigantic way and it is her marriage that plays a crucial role in the war.
Kate Reading and Michael Kramer still hold the narration department and from the looks of it one can expect that they would go on till the end of the series. The arrival of new characters is also well handled by the two as they provide extreme care to each and every character of the war.

Ashleigh Whittaker reports.
TRANSCRIPT
The Eels hope the League will approve the retirement paperwork soon.
If Watmough’s injury is deemed career-ending, that would put the club under the salary cap.
But the Parramatta senior officials embroiled in the salary cap scandal are proceeding with ongoing legal action.
Some say that’s a waste of money.
Eric Grothe Snr, Eels Legend: “So over one-million dollars, way over one-million dollars now, with the current court case, now this on top of that, who knows how far it is going to go.”
And in AFL, the Western Bulldogs are preparing to take on the Adelaide Crows tomorrow night at Etihad.
Jake Stringer’s lack of form has been downplayed by his coach.
Luke Beveridge, Bulldogs Coach: “His performance has been great at times and probably not up to his standard at other times, we don’t expect him to go out and win the game for us.”
Lachie Hunter has been cleared to play after passing a concussion test.

Throughout the day, up to 180,000 pilgrims will make the three-hour walk from North Sydney to Randwick Racecourse, where Pope Benedict XVI will tomorrow celebrate the WYD mass.
Braving the dark and cold, the first wave of several hundred started from North Sydney at 6am (AEST), with others joining in at Milsons Point, Kirribilli and the city.
French pilgrim Jean Baptiste, 20, who's been surviving on four hours sleep a night since the start of the week-long WYD, said the early start would demonstrate pilgrims' commitment to their faith and spread the word of Jesus Christ.
"That's why we're here today, to witness, to spread the word," Mr Baptiste said.
"I hope all young people who don't believe in God will have something today that will trigger something in their brains."
The WYD cross and icon were carried by pilgrims over Sydney Harbour Bridge just as dawn broke.
American pilgrim Brenda Schoeninger, 28, called home to Denver, Colorado at dawn to tell her family she was one of 13 pilgrims to carry the cross.
"I was just up the front, I didn't expect to be able to carry it," she said.
"Even with 12 others it was really heavy and it made me realise how heavy it was for Jesus.
"I think it helped me reflect on myself and my own faith."
The chants of "Aussie Aussie Aussie" and New Zealand warrior cries gave way to reflective prayers and a slower pace as the cross and icon entered the pilgrimage to cross the bridge.
"I've been to the last three World Youth Days and this is definitely the highlight of them all," 24-year-old Sandie Millar from Belfast said.
"To be able to walk over the Sydney Harbour Bridge with all these people really makes this pilgrimage."
The WYD cross was then placed it in a vehicle to transport it to the racecourse.
Sydney Harbour Bridge was closed at 2am (AEST) for only the third time in its history while roads in the city centre and 25 suburbs have also been closed for the pilgrimage.
Sydney woman Kylie Goddard, 46, said the procession brought a welcome bright feeling to the city as she waited for a job interview on Pitt St.
"I don't mind that the city is shut down," she said.
"It's great, they seem to be very happy and they're lighting up the city."
Tonight, the pontiff will participate in a vigil at the racecourse with the young pilgrims.
Many will camp out overnight for prime places at tomorrow's mass. And they aren't deterred by predicted temperatures of nine degrees.
Louise Keegan, 28, from Manchester will sleep at Randwick Racecourse tonight before tomorrow's final mass, which 300,000 people are expected to attend.
"The cold doesn't bother me, this is warm here" Ms Keegan said.
"We're up the front of the pilgrimage so we can get a good place to see the Pope."
The pilgrims cheerfully carried heavy loads on their backs.
"We've got sleeping bags, pillows, mattresses, food for the next day and a wheelie case for when we get tired," Sue Batten, 40, from the NSW Central Coast said as she led her family of four through the city.
"We stayed last night at a Pymble school classroom and we froze, and I think it will be the same again tonight.
"But if Jesus carried the cross we can carry our luggage."
AAPPRINESHA NAIDOO: The traditional manufacturing industry is said to be in the throes of a digital transformation, spurred by exponentially growing technology that is set to change the face of manufacturing as we know it. That’s according to consulting firm Deloitte. Dr Martyn Davies, MD for emerging markets and Africa at Deloitte, joins us with more on Industry 4.0 and its implications for manufacturers. Martyn, thank you for your time.
MARTYN DAVIES: Thank you very much, good to be here.
PRINESHA NAIDOO: Martyn, commentators refer to the changes afoot as Industry 4.0 or the Fourth Industrial Revolution. What exactly is meant by this?
MARTYN DAVIES: I think Industry 4.0 is not so much a dedicated moment in time as a continuous shift, now there has been this convergence of ideas and technology and innovation – and the velocity of life and the velocity of change has clearly increased for all of us, as individuals or companies and, of course, also the country. I think going forward the question about Industry 4.0 is how it will become more robotic, if you will, and ultimately displace the human factor, ie. labour, out of the production process. So this will have severe implications for all economies but some more than others and particularly those that are unable to prepare their workforces for the dramatic change that is coming.
PRINESHA NAIDOO: Now that’s obviously a concern – what technology does to labour, especially in a country with as high an unemployment rate as our own. Is it necessarily true [that] technology may leave many people without jobs?
MARTYN DAVIES: Technology is, again, commerce, economics – technology is never static, and with the ongoing trend, the Industrial Revolution dating back 200 years now, but what we are seeing, as I say, the velocity of this change is increasing dramatically. Technology will always displace jobs but it will also create jobs somewhere else, the question is where will these other jobs be created. In South Africa’s case we have a bit of a double whammy, firstly we have a flailing basic education system, where people are unable to acquire the necessary skills in order to make them more productive in the economy. Secondly, people are not so much unemployed as they are unemployable, and that talks to the technological shift that is taking place in, not all, but in many industries, including here in South Africa.
Technological shift in SA
PRINESHA NAIDOO: So what do you mean when you say a technological shift taking place in South Africa?
MARTYN DAVIES: Industry 4.0, as we call it – which is more about cyber-physical production; ie. the merging of the real and virtual world, if that makes sense. I don’t want to make it sound too Star-Trek, but it applies to certain sectors more than others. The sector that I think it applies most pertinently to is the automotive sector. This is a sector that arguably – and I would argue – is the most successful industrial sector in our country in the last two or three decades. It’s the only success case.
The only outcome is a very proactive industrial policy, practically all other industries in our economy in the last two to two-and-half decades have been hollowed out. But the automotive sector counts for roughly 7.5%, maybe slightly more, of GDP. It’s a major employer and a very scalable employer and because of the nature of the automotive OEM [original equipment manufacturer] manufacturing process, it’s extremely high-tech. Imagine the technology and the know-how, the intellectual property, that goes into the manufacture of, for example, a BMW X3 that’s manufactured in Rosslyn or a Mercedes Benz C-Class; we can imagine, this is world-leading technology.
But, of course, Industry 4.0 is going to dramatically affect that and this is our most important industrial sector, arguably, in the country. So I think it really is at a high-level view. Industry 4.0, as we are calling it, the convergence of fibre-physical production will certainly have a significant impact on South Africa, not all sectors, not all regions, but certainly key companies going forward.
PRINESHA NAIDOO: It’s interesting that you mention that, though, because in a survey carried out by Deloitte across 19 countries, there were answers by some 100 South African executives which really stood out when compared to their global peers because South African executives don’t actually see technology as a competitive advantage. Why is this, and why is there such a stark difference between the perceptions of South African executives and global executives?
MARTYN DAVIES: We don’t see what … it’s an ability to see the future and see what is possible, and I think it also depends on the survey of course. But, again, technology, innovation, intellectual property, these are very big words and it means different things to different people. What is technology? Is it accumulated stored intellectual property? Okay, let’s take that definition and as you start to accumulate this IP, let’s call it know-how, that is mission critical to the success of any company, and the success ultimately of the country. And without intellectual property, stored, embedded – that’s a good word – embedded intellectual property, ie. technology, in one’s organisation, small or large, I’m afraid you have no other competitive advantage.
So if we start to think about these things in a deeper fashion, I think in the current highly, and into the future, competitive global economy, it’s about how countries are able to acquire and attract, and in our case, retain technology. [In other words], stored intellectual property – which is not stored so much on servers or in books or in journals; that’s very old school, but it’s accumulated and stored in people’s brains – and how do you put people together to create these ecosystems that are going to increase competitiveness?
I think that is really the secret sauce of organisational success.
PRINESHA NAIDOO: So, as you say, it’s embedded intellectual property that’s key, and alongside this an enabling environment or regulatory environment, as with the automotive sector.
MARTYN DAVIES: Yes, undoubtedly. We are getting towards policy certainty in terms of our APDP [Automotive Production and Development Programme] and the reiteration of automotive policy giving long-term certainty … and business needs that. Think mining sector, think auto – these are not short [term investments]; these are massive capex investments and they require long-term certainty, and it’s only policy that can provide that. So we need to see similar proactive policy that provides certainty to business – not interventionist policy at all, but enabling policy that I think the mining sector needs, a bit of both, [the] industrial sector needs hopefully more enabling [policy].
So we need to see far more enabling policy in our country, in all countries, to provide that long-term certainty for business to make those necessary decisions.
PRINESHA NAIDOO: But until that regulatory certainty comes into effect, how would you advise businesses – manufacturers in South Africa – to prepare for the future?
MARTYN DAVIES: Again, the term I use is velocity – velocity of life – there’s too much data, there’s too much information, too much complexity and, unfortunately, risk. And risk is often exposed by external forces, and that is often political risk. We need to fix that. I have just seen the ranking of South Africa has declined significantly in terms of market openness and the like, and that’s deeply problematic. We need an open economy, one that’s open to not just the obvious like capital, goods and labour but open to ideas. I’m afraid we are falling short in terms of that.
When looking at advising our clients from the leading multinationals globally, and obviously here in South Africa, and – well, it’s around getting through that complexity, cutting straight through it, we have to be efficient, business must always be efficient, it must always be productive – and productivity and competitiveness is [necessary for a] company. So that’s what Deloitte does in terms of speaking to the productive, competitive and that is a very, very complex process as to how one helps to shape strategy and implement strategy in times of uncertainty, which we have had in South Africa. Hopefully we’ll start to come out of that going forward.
PRINESHA NAIDOO: Martyn, that’s where we are going to leave things for today. Thank you very much for your time. Dr Martyn Davies is MD for emerging markets and Africa at Deloitte.

While promoting his new memoir "You Can't Be Serious", Kal sat down with CBS News to share details of his early acting career and reveals how he met longtime partner, and now fiancé, Josh while working in the White House under the Obama administration.
In 2009, Kal took a brief pause from acting to work on the campaign for President Barack Obama. After the election, Penn worked as an advisor to the President in the Office of Public Engagement.
In the memoir, Penn shares details of how he met his partner, telling People that on the first date Josh showed up to his apartment with an 18-pack of beer, wanting to watch Nascar races.
"I have one day off from The White House and this dude is unironically watching cars go around and make left turns? Next thing you know, it's been a couple months and we're watching NASCAR every Sunday", Kal recalled.
The House star also shared his family and friends were very supportive when he finally disclosed his sexuality.
"I discovered my own sexuality relatively late in life compared to many other people. There's no timeline on this stuff", said Penn.
Kal did reveal that a wedding is in the works, stating that he would like a "big ass Indian wedding", but his partner Josh is a bit more reserved so they may have to meet in the middle.
Penn's book will be available to purchase on Nov. 2.Interview Questions for Philosophy Teachers:

If you’ve visited and seen any of our displays or talked to anyone on our team you’d probably agree that if there’s one thing we love to do it’s talk about them until the cows (or Bald Eagles) come home. That’s why we’ve sharing this with you in our wildlife podcast, ‘Nature’s A Hoot’. New episode are released on the first of each month, packed with loads of interesting information and discussions about birds of prey and the wild world around them.
Tom Morath, a member of our Bird Team, is one of the show’s creators and presenters. He wanted to develop the podcast to offer as many people as possible the chance to connect with the vital work we do and said “I know how passionate we all are at the Trust about the birds we work with. Talking about them and encouraging others to be just as inspired becomes second nature. The idea of ‘Nature’s a Hoot’ is to scratch the surface and go beyond what we’d normally talk about in our flying displays to give a fuller picture of the environments they live in and the challenges they face to simply survive. The podcast will be a new way to connect with us. You can have us on in the car on the way to work, in your headphones whilst you exercise or when settling down with a nice cup of tea.”
Conservation is at the heart of all that we do and we know that the best way to achieve our mission is to reach as many people as we can with our message. With this in mind, Tom’s teamed up with Hannah Shaw, our Conservation and Research Liaison to produce the podcast.
“We’ve been working to develop some really interesting episodes which I’m really excited for everyone to hear. Hannah’s passion for and knowledge of current projects conserving raptors, both directly and indirectly, really comes through in each episode and hopefully the podcast will offer something for everyone with an interest in the natural world.”
Fundraising Events Manager and Bird Team
Tom’s interest in birds of prey is inspired by his grandparents love of the great outdoors, and many family days outside together. However, it was a bird of prey experience at the age of 12 that really started the ball rolling for Tom. He has worked with birds of prey at a number of different centres, before coming to the Trust in early 2019.
Outside work, Tom can usually be found exploring the countryside with his chocolate Labrador, Delilah.
Conservation and Research Liaison
Hannah made more life changes than most when she took up her position. She moved back from Tanzania, where she had been working with rural village communities to help them deal with the human-elephant conflict whilst also trying to improve attitudes towards elephants. This background gave Hannah a particular interest in our poison response work with vultures in southern Africa, and how this is linked with elephant poaching.
Hannah is a keen environmentalist, and in her spare time can usually be found walking her dog, Jack, in the Hampshire countryside.

When I first started, all I was told was the best SEO is done code base. You need to make sure your code is validated by W3C, use you H1 tags and get as many anchors in there as you can. You had to make sure the code was as SEO friendly as possible because that was what search engines looked at for great sites.
Even before that the biggest thing was Keywords Meta tag, which now you do not use at all because search engines said people just flood that tag with words for better ranking. Everyone over used this tag so the search engines said they would stop using them to help rankings. I even tell others not to put it in there code as you could get down ranked because other search engines use it to determine you as spam, plus it get them in routine. This is what I am seeing with code base SEO now though.
//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
As times have change I have seen mainly google as always, becoming smarter with it’s crawling system to determine if you are a relevant site. Google has got better at reading your content and then marking you as a valid site more then looking at you code. It seems the code side is now more to show the skill level of the site and tell the search engines where to look.
I can understand that anyone can become a good coder and push a website, which you don’t want. You want to have the most relevant website come to you in your search results. This is why they got rid of the meta tag keywords, because it was to easy for people to fudge their website to rank better. Now you have to have good quality content, that make senses as well, plus trying to get as many as your keywords in the text in context as well.
I don’t think the coding side will be pushed out like the meta tag was, simply because search engines need it as much as we need them. When they crawl the website, it needs to know where to look. I recently saw a SEO error, which said there was too many H1 tags so search engines may be confused as to what is the important title. Though I do believe the coding side will not weight much in your websites ranking, as the search engines want to deliver good content and the user wants good content. No one cares about the good coding as long as it functions, except a well functioning website will have good code.
I would think that the coding element of SEO will always be there, but I think the amount it counts to your websites rankings will slowly decrease, as the search engines look more at you content and presence across the web instead. The code can’t tell them if you are relevant to the users search but content can, though search engines can’t know what is the most important content without the code.

Their Chinese parent company Shandong Ruyi Technology Group. has failed to pay its debts, and unless a buyer swoops in for the storied tailor, they could shut permanently alongside their sibling brand Kent & Curwen. The order to liquidate some of their brands comes after Shandong Ruyi failed to appeal against creditors. On November 4, a vote will take place to determine the future of the brands.
Gieves & Hawkes currently has one store at Savile Row and 58 shops in 25 cities globally. They aren’t the only brands in Shandong Ruyi’s portfolio in danger. The company also owns Aquascutum, Cerruti, and SMCP.
Earlier this month, European TopSoho, a subsidiary of Shandong Ruyi, failed to redeem bonds worth 250 million euros, which left SCMP vulnerable to being owned by creditors. Shandong Ruyi was also in plans to acquire Bally, but that was never finalized.
At one point, Shandong Ruyi was on an acquisition spree hoping to become a global luxury conglomerate the likes of LVMH or Kering, but their debt has been crippling. They plan on restructuring their portfolio to focus on more high-tech fabrics and fashion brand management.Tailored Medication Safety Consulting

Chapter 1. God, the Universe and Humankind
Core of theology: God’s absolute love
Every act of God is love
“Among all his actions there is none which is not entirely a matter of mercy, love, and compassion: this constitutes the beginning and the end of his dealings with us” (36).
Aim of creation is incarnation
“In love did he bring the world into” (37).
God has equal love for all creation, righteous and unrighteous
“He has a single ranking of complete and impassible love towards everyone, and he has a single concern for those who have fallen, just as much as for those who have not fallen” (39).

“What is a merciful heart? It is the heart burning for the sake of all creation, for men, for birds, for animals, for demons, and for every created thing…for this reason he offers up tearful prayer continually even for irrational beasts” (43).
Our Goal: to acquire a merciful heart that mirror’s God’s heart
The Created World

Angels: “Invisible beings, whose task it is to be stirred by praises of God …so that, by these praises, they may be raised up in contemplation to the glorious Nature of the Trinity, and remain in wonder at the vision” (46).
Demons: “The demons will to ruin and destroy a human being; yet they cannot do any harm to him unless they have permission from God” (46).
Demons’ only have power over those given to sin.

In this instance, we talk about urticaria vasculitis (angina): it endures over 24 hours, and fundamental guns of illness – sores – is very unpleasant towards the contact and could depart a little scar. Urticaria vasculitis therapy demands not just physician and an allergist.
Reasons for urticaria
Huge nearby (subcutaneous) launch of histamine along with other mediators of irritation, catalyzing suitable skin responses, trigger urticaria.
Reasons for urticaria that is severe
Facets that trigger string responses, creating roughly 1/2 of the instances, an intense urticaria remain exceptional. Generally, these are:
- Food sensitivity, such as for instance shrimp eggs, nuts or cheese;
- allergies to ecological elements (pollen, dust mites, or substance);
- An allergy
- Disease: in the SARS to HIV;
- Bug attacks;
- Psychological stress;
- Unwanted effects including antibiotics and antihistamines, of particular medicines;
- Actual elements such as for instance thermal or physical results about the skin, water.
Chronic urticaria’s causes
Persistent urticaria, several specialists related to autoimmune problems where the immune protection system starts to strike its cells, resulting in considerable amounts of histamine’s launch triggering skin responses.
Nevertheless, persistent urticaria’s actual cause is not proven nonetheless. It has recognized that it might create in conjunction with additional autoimmune pathologies such as for instance rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and systemic lupus erythematosus («lupus”).
Persistent urticaria, as, certainly, and serious, frequently starts underneath the impact of any trigger elements, like the same tension, booze, coffee, temperature, skin retention (e.g. – in limited garments), some food chemicals (salicylates, yet others).
Urticarial Therapy
Treatment of urticaria that is severe
Because its signs are moderate, generally not need any unique therapy and vanish inside a couple of days.
Outward indications of severe urticaria are far more severe and when the scenario is not therefore positive, nor wish to move, it is time reduce irritation for you to demand aid antihistamines that blocking the results of histamine and remove rashes. Here are a few people of the number of medicines: cetirizine (allertek, zirtek, tsetrin), fexofenadine (Telfast, Quick, feksofast, dinoks), loratadine (klarisens, lomilan, allergoferon, erius).
Contemporary antihistamines – this isn’t the diphenhydramine, creating problem and sleepiness, despite the fact that, in gently reckless “drink” with booze actually extremely-antihistamines might induce a lowering of awareness until his reduction. In this instance, you are able to destroy two parrots with one rock by recruiting an antihistamine that encourages dropping asleep: ataraxia or tavegil if, however can be found difficulty falling asleep.
Nonetheless, antihistamines In case there is serious span of the condition signs could be cut short with a short term (3-5 times) getting glucocorticoids, for instance, this part may do period prednisone’s same check. Formulations of the team therefore relieve outward indications of urticaria, and control the immune protection system. Long-term utilization of glucocorticoids may cause unwanted effects like plume of large blood pressure, glaucoma, cataracts and diabetes (or aggravate over the last).
Treatment of urticaria
As the therapy of persistent urticaria, the problem is notably more difficult for. You should use antihistamines or exactly the same steroids, escalating dosages under medical guidance before second once the signs start to diminish and steadily getting them frequently. This type of fresh antihistamine, like Spanish rupatadin (rupafin), well proven within the therapy of challenging moving urticaria.
Within persistent urticaria’s therapy, which technique can be used, referred to as phototherapy? It is based on the effect on the in-patientis skin High Intensity UV irradiation. To get this done, many (2 to 5) occasions each week research visit for specific conclusion of this process. Complete for the medical picture’s enhancement may require about 20 of those periods.
Leukotriene receptor antagonists (montelar, single, ektalust, akolat) might help reduce inflammation and swelling of your skin. Within the long haul, they are able to function to glucocorticoids, as therefore don’t trigger uncomfortable unwanted effects like a great option.
Effective medication cyclosporine (panimun Bioran, ekoral) has confirmed efficient within the therapy of urticaria in 2/3 instances. Its running theory is comparable to that of glucocorticoids: cyclosporin removes the adverse effects of the system that is immune. It ought to be mentioned that, as verified from medical trials’ results applied, the low the effectiveness. Therefore, don’t make use of this medication.
Obviously, additionally, knowing the sparks that trigger stress of urticaria in an individual that is specific, it would be great to obtain out of their impact that is harmful. Facets provocateurs, like coffee and booze could be quickly taken off the life span. Nevertheless, it is essential to attempt to spy herself from his handbags, producing another action on the road to obtain gone hives because tension is more difficult. In some instances, poor trigger pleasure methods such as for instance trance or yoga, which could reduce tension and relieve the outward symptoms of the condition.Meet Shai Bibas, CJF’s first Community Shaliach (emissary)!

APEJES Football Academy of Mfou embarrassed vice champions of Cameroon, Coton Sport of Garoua beating the Graoua team 1-0 in the one of the day 10 matches that took place at the Yaounde Omnisporst Stadium yesterday July 7, 2021. The match was match day one of the second round of the championship. Many supporters thronged the Omnisports Stadium were happy as they had not been able to cheer their players for the past three months.
It was a tough encounter as both teams gave their best in order to grab the three points of the day. Coton Sport started off well with a good play style dominating the first part of the game. However they failed to concretise their scoring chances. Their domination was however faced with a strong resistance from the APEJES boys who fought hard with a strong defence wall. APEJES equally had some good scoring chances but were squandered. Both teams separated at half time on a 0-0 score margin.On resumption Coton continued mounting pressure on APEJES but were unable to score. Coach Aboubakar Souleymanou brought in fresh blood but it did not help much. APEJES held on and at the 77th minute replacement player, Christopher Toube score the loan goal of the game. Efforts by Coton Sport to level scores were futile. At full time the score board read 1-0 in favour of APEJES.
For many supporters of Coton Sports defeat was a bitter pill to swallow given that Coton Sport are just from the CAF Confederations Cup competition and were expected to produce a good result. The coach of APEJES, Ndongo Francis said the victory was a sigh of relief for the team because it has improved their position. Aboubakar Souleymanou of Coton sport said most of the players are nursing injuries and so they had the players who were available. He said the team will continue to work hard for the next match. Etame Ngombe defender of Coton Sport said even though Coton Sport lost the game they will not give up but prepare well for the other remaining matches. Earlier in the same venue Tonnere Kalara Club of Yaounde beat Yong Sports Academy of Bamenda 2-0.Television-maker Skyworth Group plans to raise $1 billion through a stock exchange listing next year to develop its digital home-electronics business. Finance director Jones Tao said the company was in talks with investment houses and expected to announce a listing mandate and timetable in a month. He said the listing had been delayed because it had taken more time to market the company to institutional investors than was originally expected. The company said in mid-April it would make an official listing application in June or July. 'Attractiveness of traditional television-makers to institutional investors is not that great,' he said. The company plans to introduce in November television set-top boxes under the Venus brand, through which consumers can surf the Internet and view VCDs through normal televisions.This picture is labeled "Wyoming and South Dakota Sky" - we're not sure where it's from, but we're guessing it's one of the two.

We’ll borrow here from some of Nach’s notes on the great Laurie Colwin:
Perhaps best known to most of the world as a highly accomplished writer of fiction, Laurie Colwin (1944-1992) was the author of five novels and three volumes of short stories. Recognized with a Guggenheim Fellowship and other awards, she was a vital presence in the New York literary scene until her death at the age of 48.
She did, however, leave behind two glowing non-fiction books about herself and her lifelong relationship with food and cooking. The first, Home Cooking, published by Knopf in 1988, consisted of 33 short pieces, many of them built around recipes. Ranging from “The Low-Tech Person’s Batterie de Cuisine,” “Bread Baking without Agony,” and “Alone in the Kitchen with an Eggplant,” to “Repulsive Dinners: a Memoir,” these irresistible essays are accounts of Colwin’s cooking experiences—both triumphs and ordeals. The recipes, sometimes more descriptive than set out as prescriptions, are embedded gently into the narratives.
Totally satisfying, often quite amusing, and crafted without a hint of self-conscious effort.

The picture styles that come built-in are visually appealing and can add depth to your documents, but you may be thinking like I was and have a craving for something more original.
To the right of the preset looks are a few different options. You can add Borders, Shadows, Glow Effects, Bevels, Reflection, even 3-D rotation.

13,715 SF, it was an extremely interesting and useful trip, and I met a huge variety of fascinating coffee people. One of the highlights was a visit to Blackburn Estate before the conference, where I spent a fantastic few days with Michael and Tina Gehrken.
About Tanzania
Tanzania is the largest country in East Africa, though much of its vast interior plateau is dry and infertile. It is Africa’s fourth-largest coffee producer (behind Ethiopia, Uganda and Ivory Coast) and coffee is grown in practically all of its highland regions – mostly concentrated in the far south, west and north of the country. It was first introduced as a commercial crop in around 1900 on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro – which towers 5,895 metres above sea level east of Arusha and above the town of Moshi (where Blackburn’s coffee is dry-milled).
Coffee is now one of Tanzania’s main cash crops (in 2009, it accounted for 24% of total cash crop exports), along with tobacco (29%), cotton (27%), cashew nuts (10%) and tea (7%). Average production is around 50,000 metric tones, though in the 2009/10 season a prolonged drought cut output to 35,000. It is expected to recover to around 52,000 in the 2010/11 season. Of this around 70% is Arabica and only 30% Robusta. (Nb Tanzania’s marketing season runs from July through to June, while harvesting begins in April).
Estates such as Blackburn are rare – 90% of production comes from smallholder farmers, with an estimated 400,000 households directly dependent on coffee. The Tanzania Coffee Board operates an auction system, but it is not compulsory to sell through it – in the 2010/11 season 47% of Tanzania’s coffee sales were direct exports, versus 53% through the auction system.
The EAFCA conference
The three day EAFCA conference attracts a huge variety of delegates and speakers – from commodities analysts to smallholder farmers, industrial roasters to specialty coffee buyers, and everybody in between. The association represents coffee sectors in 11 member countries – Burundi, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
A highlight of the speakers programme was a discussion of the world market outlook – focusing on whether the steep upward price trend will continue. The panel contrasted current conditions with similar ‘bull markets’ since 1973 – the difference this time is that, rather than being caused by a single event such as a frost in Brazil, the price increases are underpinned by a general tightness of global stocks. Opening stocks in exporting countries are at their lowest in history, meanwhile consumption in several of these countries is climbing – most notably Brazil, where domestic consumption is increasing at around 5% a year. Put simply, production simply has not been able to keep up with the pace of consumption – now prices must go up to ration demand, and go high enough to encourage increased production. Judith Ganes-Chase, an NY-based analyst who spoke on day one, reckoned that there will be no real relief to the current supply tightness until the next ‘on year’ Brazil crop in 2012/13. She predicted that commodity Arabica could possibly reach US$4/lb – 12 months ago the Cup of Excellence entry price was $2.50!
Of course the specialty market is by no means wedded to the commodity index, but the current situation will certainly have repercussions for specialty coffee. I found when talking to people – such as a manager from Buf Café in Rwanda – that a common theme was their fears about the quantity and availability of good quality coffee this year, as at the moment farmers can get a (comparatively) good price for coffee of pretty much any quality. The general conclusion: expect there to be less top quality coffee in the market, and expect it to be a lot more expensive.
Another highlight of the conference was a Women in Coffee panel discussion. I was very impressed by a women’s health programme called Grounds for Health, which works with women in coffee growing communities to address the unacceptably high rate of cervical cancer among women in developing countries. I had no idea that cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women in developing countries – and almost all of these deaths are preventable. Grounds for Health trains local doctors and nurse to screen and treat cervical cancer in coffee growing communities – amazingly, the treatment costs only US 25 cents a woman and is 90% effective in curing the disease! I met the organisation’s Director, August Burns, and was hugely impressed by her passion and knowledge. Mercanta hopes to become a sponsor of the programme very soon.
What I most enjoyed at EAFCA was having the chance to meet many of Mercanta’s partners in East Africa with whom I have been exchanging emails in the past months. It was also a great opportunity to make new links. I picked up several samples from producers in Malawi and Burundi (new origins for us) – some of which we were impressed by when we cupped them back in our lab in London. Some more samples are on their way to us from Mount Elgon in Uganda.
On the side of the conference I also managed to fit in a trip to Moshi, at the foot of Kilimanjaro, where Blackburn’s coffee is milled and prepared for export. I met the manager of the mill and had a look round this busy, modern facility, which is a major source of employment locally.
All in all it was a hugely interesting and valuable trip. Tanzania is a beautiful country with huge potential – as well as challenges – for the specialty market. There are murmourings of launching a Tanzania Cup of Excellence in the next few years. I very much hope that this is able to go ahead as I don’t doubt that there are many, many incredible coffees as yet to be discovered.MBS office is now open and staff are back in the office.

Production of its hatchbacks dropped 7.5 per cent to 81,163 units while that of utility vehicles like SUVs and MPVs dropped 26.4 per cent to 17,719 units. Only vans saw a six per cent increase to 15,710 units.
This is the second consecutive month that the company has cut production. It cut this figure by over eight per cent to 1,48,959 units in February. In January though, the company had increased production by 15.6 per cent.
While the company has given no reason to this development, we think this might be due to the new BSVI and safety norms that are kicking in April 2019 onwards. Up to nine Maruti models, including the popular Alto hatchback will have to be phased out because of this. The company is possibly cutting production of these cars while it prepares their replacements and updates the cars in its lineWith his latest TV series, Neven Maguire brings it all back home with a show that champions local produce and producers. Donal O’Donoghue talks to the Cavan chef about Irish Food Trails, his work ethic and the impact of Brexit.
On staying humble and keeping a strong work ethic he says "My first ever stand-alone TV show was Moveable Feast but I never ever take it for granted”.
“If I could encourage anyone into this job it would be great because it’s a fabulous career and we have a huge shortage of chefs in Ireland,” he says. “There is never a day that I go into my kitchen that I regret.”
On the effects of Brexit, Neven says: “It’s not impacting on my business at the moment and I’m not sure if the experts even know what will happen”.
“We can’t go back to border checkpoints and I believe it will be all OK. We have 70 staff employed in Blacklion now, but no one really knows and nobody has a crystal ball. We can only hope they make the right decision.
We have come a long way since the Troubles. The restaurant was closed from 1976 to 1989 and we don’t want to go back there.”

, Arroyo cited Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, one of the most far-right members of Congress. Gosar had paid a visit to the local Oath Keepers chapter a few years earlier, Trump’s baseless claims that the election had been stolen from him. But Gosar and a handful of other Republican members of the House had deeper ties to extremist groups who pushed violent ideas and conspiracy theories and whose members were prominent among those who stormed the halls of Congress in an effort to stop certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.
Their ranks include Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, who like Gosar was linked to the “Stop the Steal” campaign backing Trump’s effort to overturn the election’s outcome.
Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado has close connections to militia groups, including the so-called Three Percenters, an extremist offshoot of the gun rights movement that had at least one member who entered the Capitol on Jan. 6.
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgiaorida, was a staged “false flag” attack. Liberal group Media Matters for America reported Thursday that Greene also speculated on Facebook in 2018 that California wildfires might have been started by lasers from space, promoting a theory pushed by followers of QAnon.
Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida appeared last year at an event also attended by members of the Proud Boys, another extremist organization whose role in the Jan. 6 assault, like those of the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters, is being investigated by the FBI.
It is not clear whether any elected officials played a role in directly facilitating the attack on the Capitol, other than helping to incite violence through false statements about the election being stolen from Trump. Officials have said they are investigating reports from Democrats that a number of House Republicans provided tours of the Capitol and other information to people who might have gone on to be part of the mob Jan. 6. So far, no evidence has surfaced publicly to back up those claims..”
Biggs has denied associating with Stop the Steal organizers and condemned violence “of any kind.”
“Were you aware of any planned demonstration or riot at the U.S. Capitol to take place after the rally on Jan. 6, 2021? No,” Biggs said in a statement.
A spokesman for.”
Gosar did not respond to requests for comment. Trump’s efforts to subvert the outcome of the 2020 election and the attack on Congress.
Aitan D. Goelman, a former federal prosecutor who helped convict.
● In July, cattle rancher Cliven Bundy, who had refused to stop trespassing on federal lands.
● Biggs, the chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, was seen by leaders of the Stop the Steal movement as an inspiration and has spoken at events hosted by extremists, including one at which a founder of the Oath Keepers called for hanging Sen. John McCain.
● Boebert, elected to the House in November, said on Twitter that “Today is 1776” on the morning of Jan. 6, and she has connections to the Three Percenters, which shares her view that gun rights are under assault. At least one member of the group has been arrested in the breach of the Capitol.
● Greene has for years trafficked in conspiracy theories, expressed support for QAnon and made offensive remarks about Black people, Jews and Muslims. She also appeared at a campaign event alongside members of the Three Percenters.
To some degree, the members of Congress have been reflecting signals sent by Trump.
During a presidential debate in October, he made a nod toward the Proud Boys, telling them to “stand back and stand by.” Two months earlier, Trump described followers of QAnon — several of whom have been charged with murder, domestic terrorism, planned kidnapping and, most recently, storming the Capitol — as “people that love our country,” adding that “they do supposedly like me.”
‘Stop the steal’
Few Republicans have been more linked to extremist groups than Gosar.
“He’s been involved with anti-Muslim groups and hate groups,” said Gosar’s brother Dave Gosar, a lawyer in Wyoming. “He’s made anti-Semitic diatribes. He’s twisted up so tight with the Oath Keepers it’s not even funny.”, Paul Gosar and 1 million times and spread disinformation about widespread voter fraud.
Alexander has said he “schemed up” the Jan. 6 rally with Gosar, Biggs and another vocal proponent of Stop the Steal, Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama. Alexander’s characterization of the role of the members of Congress is exaggerated, Biggs said, but the lawmakers were part of a larger network of people who helped plan and promote the rally as part of Trump’s efforts to overturn the will of the voters.
After the election, Alexander emerged as a vocal proponent of the president’s stolen election claims, setting up a Stop the Steal website Nov. 4 and making incendiary statements. On Dec. 8, he tweeted that he was willing to give up his life to keep Trump in office.
The Arizona Republican Party followed up, retweeting Alexander’s post and adding: “He is. Are you?” Alexander has since been barred from Twitter.
Ten days later, Gosar was one of the headliners at a rally in Phoenix that Alexander helped organize. Gosar used the rally to deliver a call to action, telling the crowd that they planned to “conquer the Hill” to return Trump to the presidency.
During his time on stage, Alexander called Gosar “my captain” and added, “One of the other heroes has been Congressman Andy Biggs.”
Although Biggs has played down his involvement with the Stop the Steal campaign, on Dec. 19, Alexander played a video message from Biggs to an angry crowd at an event where attendees shouted violent slogans against lawmakers. At the event, Biggs’ wife, Cindy Biggs, was seen hugging Alexander twice and speaking in his ear.
In 2019, Sen. John McCain, calling him a traitor to the Constitution. Biggs told The Republic at the time that he did not feel it was his place to speak up and denounce the comments.
Arroyo, of the Oath Keepers in Arizona, said Gosar had attended two of their meetings, about a year apart. Arroyo said that his organization “does not advocate for breaking the law” and that he was “saddened to see the display of trespassing on the Capitol building by a few out-of-control individuals.”
Just like Gosar’s family, Biggs’ two brothers have publicly denounced him, saying he was at least partly responsible for the violence Jan. 6. In addition, a Democratic state representative in Arizona, Athena Salman, has called on the Justice Department to investigate the actions of Gosar and Boebert’s crucial political allies. As her campaign got underway last year, she wrote on Twitter, “I am the militia.”
Militia members provided security for her campaign events and frequented the restaurant she owns, Shooters Grill in Rifle, Colorado. In a recently posted video, a member of the Three Percenters was filmed giving Boebert a Glock 22 handgun.
Another member of the group, Robert Gieswein, who posed for a photograph in front of Boebert’s restaurant last year, is facing federal charges in the storming of the Capitol and attacking police.
Photographs from the attack show him clad in tactical gear, goggles and a helmet, wrestling with Capitol Police officers to remove metal barricades and brandishing a baseball bat. Prosecutors have also cited a video of Gieswein encouraging other rioters as they smashed a window at the Capitol.
Once inside, Gieswein was photographed with another suspect, Dominic Pezzola, a former Marine and a member of the Proud Boys, who has also been charged in the Capitol attack. Greene.
QAnon is a movement centered on the fantastical claim that Trump, secretly aided by the military, was elected to smash a cabal of Democrats, international financiers and “Deep State” bureaucrats who worship Satan and abuse children. It prophesied an apocalyptic showdown, known as “the Storm,” between Trump and his enemies. During the Storm, their enemies, including.
Greene was an early adherent, calling QAnon “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles out.” Many of her Facebook posts in recent years reflected language used by the movement, talking about hanging prominent Democrats or executing FBI agents..”MON-FRI: 7 am – 5 pm

Fortunately, that's what Lenovo has for us with the powerful and versatile ThinkPad X12 Detachable.
While it certainly has taken some cues from other detachables on the market, the X12 Detachable brings the well-loved and rugged ThinkPad design to the equation and an impressive array of specs, including up to an Intel 11th Gen Core i7 vPro processor and Intel Iris Xe graphics.
- Best Lenovo Laptops
- Best cheap laptop deals of January 2021
Lenovo was kind enough to send us a pre-production unit of the ThinkPad X12 Detachable. Our brief hands-on time with the detachable left us eager for more. The tablet has a gorgeous display, fast performance and that ThinkPad design and durability we all know and love.
Lenovo ThinkPad X12 Detachable price and release date
The ThinkPad X12 Detachable will be available later this month starting at $1,149. And, don't worry, the detachable keyboard is included.
Lenovo ThinkPad X12 Detachable specs
The Intel 11th Gen Tiger Lake CPUs have been impressing us since their release last fall, particularly when paired with the new Intel Iris Xe graphics, so it's great to see these options on the ThinkPad X12 Detachable. Given the performance we've seen from other thin and light options, this tablet should be capable of handling pretty significant workloads.
The rest of the internals are similarly impressive with up to 16GB of LPDDR4x RAM and NVMe SSD storage up to 1TB. The 42Whr battery will deliver up to 9.98 hours of battery life according to Lenovo, and can recharge to 80% in one hour. Those are solid specs considering the tablet itself is just 1.67 pounds (2.42 pounds with the keyboard).
Speaking of mobility, the ThinkPad X12 Detachable also features a NanoSIM slot and an LTE Cat9 modem for connectivity on the road and WiFi 6 to deliver the fastest connection possible when at your home or office. Combined with the "always-on" ability to wake in less than a second it should be an outstanding option for travelers.
Lenovo ThinkPad X12 Detachable design
The detachable 12.3-inch FHD+ touchscreen is the primary focus of the ThinkPad X12 Detachable. It uses a productivity-focused 3:2 aspect ratio and looked great in my dimly-lit room thanks to its 400 nits of brightness.
The tablet features a built-in kickstand and despite its slim 9mm thickness, it offers MIL-SPEC 810G certification, meaning it will hold up to rugged work environments without a problem. Security features include a built-in IR camera for Windows Hello facial recognition support along with a fingerprint scanner and ThinkShield Security.
The 5MP front-facing camera is joined by an 8MP rear-facing camera for greater flexibility with video conferencing or capturing images or video. Given its size, the ThinkPad X12 Detachable offers a reasonable array of ports with a Thunderbolt 4, a USB 3.2 Type-C port and a combo headphone/mic jack. If you need more ports the ThinkPad X1 USB-C Port Replicator adds two additional USB-A ports, a USB-C port, an HDMI port and both micro and standard SD card readers.
For those that need more precision than your finger can provide on the touchscreen, the Lenovo Precision Pen is compatible with the X12 Detachable. It attaches magnetically, but there is also a loop available for a more secure attachment. The pen offers 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity and two function buttons.
Bottom line
While it isn't exactly breaking new ground, the Lenovo ThinkPad X12 Detachable is a welcome addition to that market with the inclusion of the Intel 11th Gen CPU and superior durability. The familiar ThinkPad keyboard layout may also be enticing to longtime fans that were without a direct Surface Pro 7 competitor from Lenovo previously.
For road warriors and those that enjoy more versatile form factors, the Lenovo ThinkPad X12 Detachable could be a compelling new option when it launches later this month.Callaway Epic Flash Driver
The Callaway Epic Flash driver represents a first for Callaway – and golf club manufacturing. But what makes the Epic Flash driver so special?
Flash Face Technology
A $5million supercomputer was used to create what is said to be the best driver-face design on the market. Callaway simply put in the legal parameters and various other rules into the computer and let it work out the optimum design. 15,000 iterations later and the Epic Flash Face was created.
The Callaway Epic Flash driver is constructed from 595C super-aged forged titanium – tempered for extra strength – and laser welded on the head. The Flash Face is forged on the inside and milled on the front. This brings the thickness down from 5/1000 to 2/1000 of an inch – making it closer to the legal limit. There is a series of thick and thin swirls on the reverse side of the Callaway Epic Flash – different to any human-designed X face that’s renowned for its uniform shape and thicker section in the centre to keep it legal.
Jailbreak Technology
The Callaway Epic Flash driver features Jailbreak bars that stiffen and stabilise the crown and sole of the club – placing more impact load on the face and promoting fast, face-wide ball speeds.
Combined with the Flash Face technology, the Jailbreak technology makes the Epic Flash driver one of the most innovative and technologically advanced drivers in Callaway history. No surprise it’s a favourite of amateurs and professionals alike.
Triaxial Carbon Crown
Callaway Epic Flash incorporates a new triaxial carbon fabric, T2C, which has a tighter weave. It weighs just 9.7g and allows weight to be redistributed from the crown and repositioned strategically in the clubhead to increase MOI (forgiveness), which in turn promotes better distance and accuracy on off-centre hits.
Adjustable Perimeter Weighting
The Epic Flash driver benefits from adjustable perimeter weighting. There is a 16-gram sliding weight that can be positioned anywhere on the built-in track at the back of the clubhead – allowing for draws, fades and straighter flight.
Price Match Guarantee
All our Callaway Epic Flash drivers come with the price match guarantee, so if you purchase the Epic Flash or Epic Flash Sub Zero driver from us and find it cheaper elsewhere, get in touch. We will credit the difference, ensuring you receive maximum value for money.
Contact Clarkes Golf Centre
Need to know more about the Epic Flash driver? Feel free to call us on 01744 885 294. We are on hand from 9.00am, every day and will do everything we can to help. Alternatively, if you have any questions about the driver, send an email to [email protected].

Businessmen John Singleton and Geoff Dixon have called last drinks at Balmain’s iconic Unity Hall Hotel, following a decision to sell the pub.
Known as the birthplace of the Australian Labor Party, the pub is expected to sell for around $25 million.
A sale at this price point would see The Unity Hall Hotel smash its own 2011 suburb record of $10 million, for the highest price paid for any property in the harbourside enclave.

The listing comes as Mr Singleton, part owner of Macquarie Media, Mr Dixon, former Qantas boss, and investor Mark Carnegie wind up the Riversdale Pub Fund’s interests in Sydney.
Geoff Dixon (left) and John Singleton (right) are the owners of the Unity Hall Hotel in Balmain that is for sale.
Founded in 2010, the Riversdale Pub Fund has spent the past two years selling the likes of Newtown’s Marlborough Hotel, Glebe’s Toxteth and Marrickville’s Vic on the Park. While the Balmain site is Riversdale Pub Fund’s last asset in Sydney, the company will continue to operate in Newcastle and Queensland.
HTL Property’s Dan Dragicevich who is selling the property with Andrew Jolliffe, said it is a great opportunity to buy a pub with the only licence in Balmain that can trade until 3am.
“The revenue potency created by its late trading license, clear scale and proximity to the Woolworths shopping centre and adjacent car park, is inimitable elsewhere in the area,” he said.
The pub has street frontage on Darling St and Beattie St.
The pub was renovated in 2012.
The Unity Hall Hotel is located on Darling St and also has street frontage on Beattie St. It reopened in 2012 after major renovations by the Riversdale Pub Fund, including the iconic “Workers” bar on the first floor. The launch even had the late former prime minister Bob Hawke in attendance, as a testimony to Labor’s history at the site.
For buyers looking to add value to the property, the owners are selling the site with an approved DA to significantly increase patron capacity.
Other features include a profitable bottle shop that services many local Balmain restaurants, and 22 poker machines.
The listing of the Balmain pub comes at a time when the inner west is experiencing a sales boom with many local pubs changing hands.
The Workers bar has memorabilia including old signs of The Australian and The Daily Telegraph.

Publican Arthur Laundy made headlines in July when he snapped up The Oxford Hotel in Drummoyne for $42 million, while Annandale’s Empire Hotel and the Friend in Hand in Glebe have also traded.
Mr Jolliffe said the industry is seeing increased activity as many in the pub game look to upsize or expand their portfolio.
“Not one single recognised seller is taking its money out of the asset class; with all reinvesting back into it, often via larger property acquisitions,” he said.
The pub is for sale via an international expressions of interest campaign until November 7.Property Attributes

For this match against Ermis, who also play in Larnaca, MAXHTEC had 2 tifos and 2 pyro shows as celebration of the 100th anniversary.
Video of the match:
The banner says "100 years", with images of some of their legends and their city under the phoenix, their emblem. Then there was a pyro show with 100 flares, symbolizing the 100 years of their club.
2nd half
Unfortunately the match was interrupted. Supporters and police forces clashed inside and outside the football field. Ten police cars were broken and one police bus was burned which use to carry swat to the football match. After the riots, police announced that 14 cops were injured. "This is the first time that fans of a football team humiliated the police" that was the word of the official spokesman.

 collaborative studies were conducted involving scientists from the Livestock Issues Research Unit, the Texas AgriLife Research and Extension Center-Overton, Texas AgriLife Research-College Station, and Mississippi State University in order to elucidate the differences in metabolism due to temperament in Brahman calves. The data collected from these studies demonstrates that there are clear metabolic differences between cattle that exhibit calm versus more excitable temperaments. Specifically, the data suggest that greater cortisol concentrations observed in the temperamental bulls may make them more resistant to the effects of cortisol, which may have reduced their subsequent responsiveness to glucose and insulin. Decreased glucose concentrations in Brahman calves and the decreased ability to utilize glucose both support the potential for temperamental cattle to utilize an alternate source of energy when glucose concentrations are low. Therefore, data from these studies suggest that it is likely that temperamental cattle utilize free fatty acids, resulting from the continuous break down of adipose tissue, to fuel tissues and organs that can utilize other energy sources rather than glucose. These data imply that the common practice of treating 'all cattle the same' is not the best management system,:.4 Sets

"I Lost Everything"
I lost everything
When I lost you
Now my heart is breaking in two
I found memories
What am I to do
Those memories keep on making me blue
The moon and the stars
They don't seem the same
Love has lost its glory
To me it's just a game
No, I lost everything
My dreams are all through
My life is only make-believe without you
Oh, my life is only make-believe without youRug Friday Sale | 3 Day Only | Extra 15% Off

Education & Skills
Across the Midlands, there are 16 higher education institutions which release approximately 13,400 engineering and technology graduates alone into the workforce each year. Within the Black Country itself, there are six Further Education colleges and one University (Wolverhampton), which is closely aligned to the University Technical Colleges in the area. 42,000 people are employed in public sector education.
There has been a real upward momentum in education and skills in the region. More residents than ever before are educated to degree level or above (163,000 people). The region has seen an upsurge in the number of people employed in skilled trades and this is mirrored in the increase in the uptake of apprenticeships, last year which topped 13,000 apprenticeships starts.
Initiatives by the Black Country Local Enterprise Partnership focuses on the development of strategic centres, including further education, the Black Country Skills Factory, an elite Centre for Manufacturing Skills, Dudley Advanced Construction, FAB kits at Sandwell College and the PTP IT Academy. The ability to train and attract talent remains a crucial part of the LEP's economic growth plans.

"Watch Dogs 2" started off on the right foot. It got good reviews and players were really pleased with the game. However, just like any other video games, it has flaws and these issues needed to be addressed so the game will run smoothly.
Ubisoft responded swiftly and most of the issues were resolved. Now that things have been fixed, the game's creator is now focusing on further developing "Watch Dogs 2" to make the game more exciting to play.
Likewise, since the company can now shift their attention to the fun side of things, it announced its plans to roll out "Watch Dogs 2" patch 1.08 for consoles and 1.07 for PC. It should be noted that the content for all platforms will be the same and only the number versions is different.
On Dec. 14, via "Watch Dogs 2" official Twitter page, Ubisoft announced the arrival of the patch. "Patch Notes 1.08 (1.07 on PC). New features, MP balancing, bug fixes," the tweet reads.
Moreover, based on the post on "Watch Dogs 2" website, patch 1.08 is not just to fix the bugs, add more features or introduce balancing to multi-player modes. It was stated that the update will also serve as the groundwork for the coming of the T-Bone Content Bundle DLC.
"As we move forward, we'll continue to introduce free content updates for everyone outside of DLC offerings and will continue to make tweaks to the online experience based on our data analysis and your feedback," the "Watch Dogs 2" team stated in the post.
For "Watch Dogs 2" gamers who use PC, they can expect improvements on the Crossfire systems and HUD on multiple monitor setups. Although the patch content is the same for PC and consoles, the ‘San Francisco Fog' fix is for PC only.
Lastly, "Watch Dogs 2" patch 1.08 will bring four new difficulty level modes and these are Hacker level, Replay Missions, Enemy Weapons and Select Difficulty Level. The best thing about the game level selections is that is that players can change their difficulty level any time, while in the play. "Watch Dogs 2" patch 1.08 is arriving later this week as stated by Ubisoft.Jungle Obstacle Course With Slide

Rob is here today to share with us how Cropswap is addressing that demand while connecting consumers directly to farmers in their communities. Welcome, Rob.
Rob Reiner [00:02:18] Thank you. Thank you so much, Chris.
Chris Snyder [00:02:20] Absolutely. Absolutely. Well I'm pumped to talk to you about this today. Tell us a little bit about your upbringing, where you grew up and how you got to where you are today.
Rob Reiner [00:02:31] Yeah. So I grew up in Houston, Texas. So it was a small town in Cyprus. It's actually a pretty big town now. It's grown tremendously. But I went to a high school of like ten thousand kids, very sort of a factory, public school type education.
Chris Snyder [00:02:44] Wow. That is a big school, 10000 kids. So you had probably at least thirty-five hundred in your graduating class.
Rob Reiner [00:02:51] Yeah. Yeah. It took forever. So the graduation was like six hours. Just an assembly line. Right. Just getting people through. Got it. Got it. Got it out. So essentially I grew up in Houston. I went I was always interested in technology or in some kind of creation side of things. So architecture, anything like that. My dad at the time, he wanted to be an architect when he was in college. So he told me, hey, look, the one thing is the market. If it changes, your career changes. So if you don't want to be reliant on the market, do computer science. So that's essentially the career path that I took in that I began as a computer science major at the University of Houston.
Chris Snyder [00:03:29] Got it. So you started as a computer science major. Did you always. Was there a lot of math, science, physics? Weren't like it's you always good at that problem-solving aspect of it?
Rob Reiner [00:03:41] You know, the problem solving, the debate structure. I love debating people. I love researching my hobbies are just crazy. It's just so many new things that I like to learn. So the engineering side, I can build engines, I can take apart a car. I love any engineering aspect to it. But computer science, what was interesting to me because it was so new. Right. The iPhone had just come out, for example. So people were just trying to see what was going to happen with these apps. And that was interesting to me. What I did realize very quickly, though, is it's the same as like when you play a sport, you realize who's gonna go to the NFL. Right. Right off the bat. And computer science is very much like that for me. I was okay at it, but I wasn't one of the top people. I very quickly saw what I could do with my skills. And I realized that, you know, these guys who are coders who these guys go home and they code, they're on video games, you know, for fun. So they're coding nonstop. Those are the pros. So I realize, you know, I'm very good at speaking and organizing teams. So let me figure out if I can get into computer science. But in a way that's you know, I'm managing a team because these guys are also very, you know, almost like worker rants. You tell them what to do and then do it exactly like that because they want to get back to their own projects. Right.
Chris Snyder [00:04:50] And I got to tell you, you know, based on my experience, if you don't know how if you're not a coder, you don't know how to manage coders. No, exactly. Tell me a couple. Tell me a couple of horror stories about that. Or maybe I can just let you know a little bit about what shoes you should be in if you're gonna hire a dev team. Yeah.
Rob Reiner [00:05:10] You have to because I mean, one, you got to know how long things are gonna take to you need to know all the technologies that exist. Right. Because that's the preparation of, you know, how you're gonna scale three years in advance. Five years in advance. And the technology is always changing. So you have to know why is it changing? Right now, I know with the dev teams that I have, I'm lucky enough to have people who are specialists at all these things and they'll tell me. But I still know what a server is. I still understand how you speak to different systems and you ask the right questions, so you make sure you're on top of your team. Ask the right questions. They won't respect you either, and they're going to just say, OK, well, let's just say it's going to take 10 hours. So we have enough time versus having somebody that says, hey, you know, I don't think that's going to take you that long. You should be able to do this, too. So I'll wait and see what you can do. Right. And you start challenging them based on the fact that you know what they're doing.
Chris Snyder [00:05:58] Got it. Got it. So let me since you are a computer guy, let's ask what are the top three or four technologies or you guys mobile app only web app. What are the top technologies that you see both now and in the future? You can, you know, magic ball see around the corner because this stuff changes all the time.
Rob Reiner [00:06:18] I completely agree. So something that I would definitely, if you're looking at getting into the space, React Native or Flutter, which are your brand new platforms where you can launch on everything right off the bat. So before we would talk about, you know, is this app written natively? Right. Which means that you're writing every app in particular to the code that it deserves. Right now, there's layers on top of that where you can write in one version and deploy on Android, Web and iPhone. So that way you get launched immediately and you can start testing your market. So that's something that I always tell people is, you know, anything that's cross-platform right now. It used to not be the case, by the way. It used to be very much where if you wrote cross-platform, you were going to have it a glitchy buggy app. It was something that was viewed as like a cheap way of developing that has changed dramatically. Now it's almost a standard to be on React native or on Flutter. Most of your apps like UberEats, Lyft. They all run on those systems.
Chris Snyder [00:07:12] So it's good to be on that in the end, if you have if and if you have a vision. Right. And we can talk about the process a little bit. If you have an idea or a vision in mind. Talk to us a little bit about the process. Just the big milestones. How long should this take? Because you hear people are like, oh, I could do that for ten thousand dollars and it should be done in two weeks. And I just kind of shake my head a little bit. Oh, yes. Tell us you show up with the napkin. Right. You're like, I've got this brilliant idea. I'm passionate about it. I want to go hard. I'm a computer science guy, so I know I can get this done. Give us a little bit at that.
Rob Reiner [00:07:51] So the first part that I always tell people, if you're interested in designing apps, you have to learn user experience and user interface. So you have to literally sketch everything yourself because these countries aren't going to know what's in your brain. So you have to learn the design skill. So that's definitely. Anybody can tell you if you're in computer science, you know how to make your own presentations. You know how to make your own animations, your own sketches for what you want the app to look like because you're giving it to a team you don't have to be perfect at. You don't have to be a branding person per se. It takes years to get to that level. And there are artists that are very, very good at what they do. But you have to get close. Right. So that people can start seeing your vision and can get behind you. So step one is definitely do your user experience and your and what you sort of envision the app looking like.
Chris Snyder [00:08:36] And you can use like Invision app or you can use Sketch.
Rob Reiner [00:08:40] Sketch is amazing. Yeah. I mean, that's just probably the easiest one because you're using like PowerPoint type skills. Right. So if you know how to use PowerPoint, you can sketch and they make you auto templates. Put a button. Here, here, here. Label it. Give it to your dev guy and don't give you a version one of some concept. Right. But that way you get moving quickly. That's why having a desk background is very interesting, because remember, in computer science, it's not important that you learn how to code per se. It's important that you learn how things get coded. So, for example, when a button gets pushed, you have to know, OK, what is that action when it's push and what's that action when it's not pushed? Right. So there's so many different actions that are involved in one iPhone screen and you have to be able to tear it all apart and describe - this does this, this does that. This does that. So the design aspect is probably the most important side, because if I give my designs to somebody and I tell them, hey, does this app make sense to you? And they can go through and look at it and exactly what you said, the tech that's available nowadays, I can create even a demo app. Right. I can have it where I push this button. It'll change screens forming. I can almost create a mock app even before I get started. So that's something we do no matter what. So just so you I give a little bit of background as well. I have a development company, a software company that I started. And with that software company, before we start a project, before we even get coders involved, we first create an entire prototype. Well. I mean, you have to it's the best way to get burned.
Chris Snyder [00:10:03] If we're not creating at least low fidelity prototypes, death in Sketch, or in Invision App, you're just a fool. It doesn't in. By the way, I know you're trying to cut corners and I know you're trying to. If you're the audience and you're doing this, obviously Rob's doing it the right way. But if you're trying to say, well, we're agile, we need to move fast. Fuck you. That is not tech. You're gonna go slower, actually. Yeah. Mess stuff up.
Rob Reiner [00:10:29] You know, agile is interesting because I appreciate agile in the way that it was in development, agile development. The scrum method is beautiful. It's very straightforward. But I can't stand when people are about these books they read - Zero to One Hundred, The Four Hour Work Week. All these books just show almost like no care to your product. It's almost like a rush, rush, rush. When the details are everything, that has to look perfect. If not, when you launch, you're going to be so stressed out with all the changes that you're gonna have to make. I mean, that's even with Cropswap. It was like throwing a dart, right? You don't know how right you're going to get. You have to just keep guessing, keep showing people, keep showing people. And when you launch, you're completely wrong. You know, I always - I have never, ever been 100 percent right because people always have a better way of doing things. You know, you're testing it with way more users. So you're always going to have changes. So that's another thing, too, is you can't focus too much on the details where you don't get launched either. Right. So it's an interesting tradeoff of both.
Chris Snyder [00:11:24] Yeah, no, I love what you're saying right now in Agile is I think my point to agile is the word is misinterpreted and misused mostly by non-devs. Right. And it's like agile to, you know, maybe some dipshit branding person might mean we're just going to go not document anything and run around like chickens with their heads cut off and then show you that we're doing a bunch of stuff in. Back to your point. It's kind of like, well, wait a second. Is that thoughtful stuff? Is that meaningful stuff? Did we talk to users about what we said on that page or why we said that? Yeah. So that prototype process to bring it back, is that a month? Is that 30 days? Is that two weeks? How long does that take? You know, it'll take you to Havana crop site.
Rob Reiner [00:12:09] Well, it's ongoing. Right. So you never really finish. But at least our version one with Cropswap...it was interesting with Cropswap. So we had to in the hardest part was inventing how people upload produce. So for example, with kale, you've got different sizes. So how do we compare somebody scale to another kale? Somebody sells in bunches. There's handfuls. There's all these crazy sizes. Right. So we have to make sure we incorporate everything. So it was a lot of back and forth with your clientele, with your market. So with Cropswap, because when we launched it, it was like a community-based concept. We had every gardener. I mean, at our fingertips. So the second I would draw something out, we would send it to like 12 different people and they would come back to us. I don't understand this. Oh, that's amazing. Yeah. And then I click here and then you can go here. So it really is a community feedback. You have to test with your market. But it took, I would say, a good two months before we started coding just because we kept changing the ideas. What was important?
Chris Snyder [00:13:05] Things like that in devs are expensive. You ought to be getting those people involved on ideas that are that they have to now code. You got to use the prototype route.
Rob Reiner [00:13:15] Right. And you gave better quotes because then I show them exactly what needs to be built for a launch. I always hear the term MVP. MVP is a very interesting term because in my opinion, MVP just doesn't exist anymore. And minimum viable product. Right. The most minimum that you can get to launch to market, that was something that was being taught during the Facebook times, right? It was just get launched, get launched. Now it's get launched. But you better have a business plan. You better have a revenue model like within a week, within two weeks. So the MVP is a little bit more than what it used to be. Your version one really has to be something a little bit more concrete. You have to have your users ready to go. You have to have everything already taken care of because that's the market expects that now enough bubbles have them burst, right?
Chris Snyder [00:13:59] Yeah. So you're going to hand this to your dev team, right. Which are React and Flutter. I believe you were mentioning. They probably know java query. They probably everything on the PHP stack. But let me ask you a question completely unplanned. What what is your opinion on no code? There's been a whole movement on no code. It's starting to gain some traction, I feel like. And I haven't talked to any developers about this. I feel like it's probably the wrong subject to have a discussion with my developers about no code. Yeah. What are your thoughts on that?
Rob Reiner [00:14:33] You know, it's interesting. It's new still. So a lot of people aren't you know, I haven't seen any drastic changes. So the most recent one that kind of gave me a shocker was AirBNB shifting from React to Flutter. So they just changed their entire app. And it got me to pivot tremendously to figure out, oh, my God, all my apps on React. Why did they switch to Flutter? Every single concept or a technology that's coming out right now is very distracting. I mean, you saw all the layers right now that are coming up on top of just Java, right? So all the React stuff, all the Flutter stuff, it's a lot of them and different things claimed to do different things better. But to me, it's one of those where if you're really trying to launch something that is, you know, you're going to market, you're going to have investors very, very quickly get them, you know, go with something that's really been tried and proven right. Don't try and invent something, because unless you're in that space of inventing that new technology, I personally wouldn't use them so fast.
Chris Snyder [00:15:29] Follow based on what I've learned over the course of my career. That is, the apps creating markets is really hard. Like, yeah, I mean, being AirBNB is a lot harder than being Lyft. Of course, I mean, right. Being Lime is easier than being, you know, what's the other ride further jump bike or dirt or like you don't you have to convince the market that this is something that they need and they want and that costs sometimes billions of dollars to create that headspace.
Rob Reiner [00:16:02] Yeah. Even now you see Airbnb is in policymaking. Right. So now they're lobbyists for the hotel policies to change and things like that. So, yeah, it's a lot of cash to be used. Another thing I'll touch on and with all these new technologies is also, for example, you can cut corners by using tech that's already been created. A good one is like Map Box, for example, right? Yeah. So you can use things to get you moving quickly that have been tried and proven that are probably a little bit more expensive right off the bat. And you can use Google Maps in the future. But the things that they give you get you deployed so much quicker. So if it's a technology that's going to get you deployed quickly and you have developers that are, you know, that understand the skill set, then go for it. But so far as testing new technologies, right now, we're pretty comfortable where we're at with things. The latest change that we did was we switched from Firebase to Amazon with all our platforms just because they were. It's a lot easier to create, you know, unique user names, things like that that are that live within an individual profile. So we made a few switches on that. And then at the same time, we're always wrong, too. Like we're probably going to have to make the switch from app box because internationally we're getting so much traction now. And internationally, MapBox is just a terrible tool to use because their addresses won't show up as accurately as Google Maps will worldwide. Right. That for the US they smoke Google because it's just such a more beautiful map to use, it's way easier to do. So right now, for example, we still have to pivot based on the reactions that we're getting. So we chose as best as we could, basically.
Chris Snyder [00:17:33] Yeah, well, you also the problem with Google or Bing Maps or MapQuest or any of these guys, they can't make the customized changes that you would like to have them make. Right. So although Google probably has, you know, all the best points of interest, all that sort of stuff, but then you're like, well, wait a second, I just want this little piece of it. It's like, sorry, you can't have that. Map Box is free, right? Quote unquote, free. Got to have the horsepower and the brainpower to make that work. But you're probably the only update their map like a few times a year. Right.
Rob Reiner [00:18:10] Is that, see, it's the addresses and you do eventually get off the freemium model based on how many requests you have. So eventually it does start costing you. Right. But they do things that are pretty interesting. Like so, for example, on our maps, we don't you don't we're not using any of these tools, but you'll see it in other applications. But if you like, zoom out, for example, you will see like 50. And when you zoom in, those Pennzoil disperse automatically, things like that, that will help give a nice user experience of those you have to customize on Google, which takes time versus me just adding that line of animation or code to it and programing that. So it's a lot quicker.
Chris Snyder [00:18:47] Got it. Got it. So let me ask you a question. So the second part is handing the prototype to your devs. But before we get into that second leg, how the heck did you figure out that you wanted to be getting involved in agriculture or Cropswap farmer stuff.
Rob Reiner [00:19:07] Crazy, right? And coming from Texas to where it's just not the case. So it was interesting. So when I went to University of Houston, I realized I didn't want to do computer science. So I pivoted and I shifted to entrepreneurship. I submitted a business plan to Pace University's entrepreneurship platform. I guess platform you could say. I mean, I got a scholarship from that. So I just wanted to be in New York City because I started realizing, OK, you know, if I'm going to build software, I want to do it for FinTech because that's where I'll make the most money. So that was really my drive. It was a very wolf of Wall Street type drive because that's what I thought I wanted. That's what everybody thinks they want whenever they watch the TV. Right, that you want that lifestyle. Getting into that lifestyle, you start realizing it's very different. I took a, I mean, I really thought I was going to build software for stockbrokers, et cetera. But, you know, for example, the first finance class, A Pace University is a very... it's a school you go to if you want to go to Wall Street. So whenever I was there, one of my classes was a finance class. And the first thing that we did was it was basically you compete against a monkey, choosing an orangutan, picking stocks and stocks. And when you do that, it's either 50 percent of the time he's right or 10 percent right. You're right. It's always that. And then I was like, man, it's going to be building software for this. This won't change anything. I'm just building more money for you. It just didn't feel right. So from there, I started realizing that I wanted to build things that were a little more hard, like something more complicated, and that drove me to Los Angeles. I didn't finish at Pace. I had one semester left, but. You know, after enough classes where you can just Google your tests and you see your test format right there. It's a start. You know, I just started realizing, you know, if somebody wouldn't hire me because I didn't have a sheet of paper, then I probably wouldn't work for them anyway. Because, you know, I want to I hire anybody that has the passion that can teach me and show me skills that I don't have. Right.
Chris Snyder [00:20:59] Demonstrable skills. If you can come in here and do this. You're hired. I don't give a shit.
Rob Reiner [00:21:03] Yeah. I always tell people. I always hire. I only hire people for my startups and the companies that I work for when they can do something that I can't. That's most of the time. That's the only time that it'll really impress me or they're teaching me something is really the times that I hire. So I always wanted to do that to do things a little bit differently. But moving to Los Angeles, it always drew me. I think it was enough East Coast winters. You know, it really gets you, you walk into class, you just feel your whole face freeze and you, it's just crazy. I went through Sandy in New York City, so that really, really was was a huge stopper. But coming to the West Side, seeing how people were more, I would say, more interested in new concepts. I started getting really into food and meditation. I did a 10-day meditation called Vipassana, which was really interesting. I started really. We did van life for a whole year. I was lucky enough to have my company working while I was a camped and across State Beach and Ventura. It was amazing. I got to get really in tune with nature. And that's when I really started just figuring out, you know, the question that, you know, questions that we always ask ourselves. Like, why are we here? What do we know? What am I working on? What do I want to focus on? And that's when I started realizing that, hey, you know, I started reading a lot of books that start talking about food. One that always gets me is this one about compost that I ended up reading, which is really random. But I read a book about composting and talked about a guy who did an experiment with chickens. And what he did was he put chickens in to put some chickens and two coops and one could be fed them white rice, which is modified wheat starch, right? In the other coop. He fed them brown rice the coop with the white rice. They all ended up killing themselves. They all tore each other apart. And they all kind of they all perished. All the birds, the ones that were being fed, the Fed, the brown, whole grain, you know, organic rice, they were orderly, producing eggs, everything. And his point was that our food is a very big importance to what is also reflected upon humans. Right. If we React in a certain way, it's pride because we're also malnutrition. We're not eating the right things. We're not in harmony with the things that we eat. So local food was really interesting because I started realizing that, you know, when you see tomatoes at Whole Foods, you see them red, but you don't know that those are picked when they're green and your brain just doesn't put that together. Of course they're picked when they're green because, you know, if you pick them when they're ripe and they're red from Peru or from, you know, Mexico, they'll be bad by the time they come. So the nutrition content of food was something that was really starting to bug me because I started feeling like and we're not getting what's good enough out that we're not getting the best of the best. Right. And that just started bugging me because it just, the more I got involved with that scene, the more you start realizing all these new things exist, these different produce that exist that you've never, ever been exposed to. So it almost felt like, why are we so focused on all these, you know, on money and things when we could be also focused on our five senses, on taste, on nutrition, on different things that also empower our lives. So that was a huge drive-in food. And then, of course, meeting Daniel McCollister, which is the co-founder of Cropswap, was a huge hit for me. He was the one who taught me for the first time ever that you can grow a ton of food in a small space. And I've never seen that visually before. So that was a huge eye-opener.
Chris Snyder [00:24:18] Yeah, no, that's interesting. We actually at my house, we grow basil. We put Basil on just about everything. We have chives and we just started a tomato plant. I have kids 10 and eight. And so to have them watch how this works and then go out with the scissors and put the chives or put the basil on the pizza, put the basil on your on your bread and have some fresh vegetables on your bread, like we could do a much better job because we live in Southern California and which is another point. What what I just started thinking about right now and maybe you could talk about this a little bit. You have people that you basically give the instruction book to and you say, look, if you have a couple hundred square feet of deck space that, you know, gets, you know, 10 hours of sunshine a day, go get milk cartons, put black trash bags in there. Get this kind of soil. And you guys could literally probably supplement and have better food for yourselves. And then also Cropswap. I'll stop by and pick those up and share with your neighbors or whatever. Could you tell me about that a little bit?
Rob Reiner [00:25:26] Yeah. So it's kind of an interesting thing. So ever since launching the new version of Cropswap, which we launched on March 20th, I've been getting a ton of emails and requests for people who are interested in using their land for crops for purposes. Right. So.
Chris Snyder [00:25:40] It's crazy because I never thought that was going to happen, for some things can happen like Hipcamp, right? The Hipcamp lady. She basically went around to all these private landowners and said, hey, if we put an RV here, that we could make this useful and created a great experience. It's exactly the same thing with you. Right.
Rob Reiner [00:25:59] So it's one of those things where we've always been talking about figuring out a way of growers and farmers to actually become, like, really sustainable. So, for example, just like you can make money on your car now, you can make money on your house now, right. With AirBNB, Uber, or whatever, we wanted this ability where I if I have a garden or if I have room or space, I can basically go on the app and say, hey, I have this land. And we could essentially either figure out to send a crew to your house to construct these gardens at our cost, which would be supplied on Cropswap. And then you essentially get free harvest, you know, because we're coming and we're doing everything, or we were gonna have the ability of you being able to create your own. So here in Los Angeles, we're working on funding a few low-income family homes because the idea is essentially this. It's you have one neighbor that grows kale and they're kick-ass at growing kale. You have another neighbor that then maybe focuses on tomatoes, then the one next to them maybe focuses on collard greens. And combined, that's one product that could be one box. Right. So if we can enable all those growers and farmers to create one product, even together, they can sustain an entire community around that. So we're working as quickly as possible to give people the tools to also be able to learn about this space. Right now, the focus is really on the people who already know how to grow food. So your growers and farmers that have some kind of operation, the first two years that we launch Cropswap is really interesting. It's a huge learning curve because when we launched it, it was just a very straightforward let go five miles, offer up a local produce. You post your produce and it sells. Right. As we kept growing, we started realizing, whoa, there's way more users to us. We have our growers, we have farmers, we have businesses, nurseries, charities. There's so many hats that you have to wear. And with that, we started realizing that, you know, there's also these people who wanted to learn how to grow, want to learn how to figure out how to create their own operation, because that's a big learning curve. I mean, it's already hard enough to convince people to eat organic versus conventional. Right. So we're talking about a huge learning curve that people need to hit here. But with that, we had we couldn't just become this InstaCart of local produce. We have classes because we have to teach people exactly how they can create their own because essentially it's exactly what you said. You could have kale nonstop all year here in California where you would never even have to buy it, pick some off yourself and you could probably sustain up to three neighbors. And they should all pay you right through an app. And you could make, you know, even if it just is enough to cover the cost of your garden. You're making something, right?
Chris Snyder [00:28:35] Yeah, and it's not. And it kind of feels like. So I used to brew beer a very long time ago. It sort of feels akin to that, right. You don't brew your own beer so you can go out in and drink for less money because it actually, in some cases cost you more money, takes more time. You have to really be passionate about brewing or growing this stuff. So this doesn't feel like this feels like it's something to do that's good for yourself and potentially brings you a little bit closer to your community. And, hey, maybe you're giving nutrition and some guidance and some connection in so what? So maybe you make a couple hundred extra bucks a month. Who cares?
Rob Reiner [00:29:16] Yep. And you're helping people, right? Because you're you're actually giving people better produce or you're not giving them things that, you know, if you go to Whole Foods. What is it? Caleigh Organics is every company. Right. You're supporting one company with this. You're actually supporting a community. So it's interesting because it's also cheaper, right? Because we have our we have in San Diego, we have a farm that grows avocados and they've just never been able to - they have an avocado farm, but they just sell directly to a farmer's market, you know, almost as a hobby. But they can sell way more. There's just never been that chain of communication. I hear from investors even where they say, hey, Rob, you know, do people really want these products when they already have them? And I'm just kind of like, well, how would they buy them? Like right now if something exists, how do I find my local farmer? All this work that's needed for me to go and farm that find that one person. And what if that one person that I just took all this time to find only sells avocados? How do I find the other? You know, it's all this work that's been needed. That's why it's not a big thing yet. That's not what we have to make it a lot more simple for you to be able to support local. And there's farms that are on one and a half acres that can provide for a whole zip code. For example, to give you an idea, we're working with one farm that we're going to find here in Los Angeles in West Adams, and they have about one point two acres and they're estimated. Estimating about twenty thousand pounds of food per year. So that's a lot. I can't. I know I can't even fathom it, but it's crazy how much food these things can produce. And the costs are atrociously low. You know that. That's something else that we made a mistake on. So one of the biggest mistakes we made on Cropswap was branding ourselves as this ancient, you know, eat like your grandmother did, eat local eat. It's better for you. Things like that. Because it was just not right. It made us look like we were going back in time. It made it look like this old company and it's not. We had a shift that and I took over as a CEO in November. And when I took over, one of the biggest things that I decided to do was to really say what it is. Right now, we've got vertical farms, we've got hydroponic farms. We've got people who grow kale just for vegan bodybuilders. Bodybuilder's, right. That can grow kale with a certain PH where it's just perfect for your body. That's superfood to me. All these. Right. So really what we're doing is we're actually evolving the food system where we're getting even better food than we should have. This is like a future. That's an advanced thing. That's an actual, like, advanced thing. Exactly. It's not. I mean, it's sure we're going back in time in the ways that we're eating pure, but we're using the science to make to grow in small areas. Right. We're using science to grow in India's unique ways that are way more sustainable, that require like so much less water. So not only do you get better produce on Cropswap, but you're also supporting these methods that consume atrociously less. I always get asked by investors "Hey, Rob, is this stuff organic?" And I'm like, dude, this is better than organic. Organic you can still use chemical fertilizers that are natural, right? These guys use worms, you know. These guys are using their own. They breed their own worms. And then they'll manually put their worms in their bed because that's what they want. They want to create the best food for you. So personally, I would rather buy from a neighbor who is obsessed with growing food than buy from just a corporate farmer who just got paid to, you know, hey, go pull these weeds. OK? I don't know what I'm doing, but I'll go pull them. Right. These are people who are obsessed with growing your food. They're very passionate about it. And they can tell you everything about this stuff. That's why crop. So I had to also encompass not just like the InstaCart of local produce, but the entire economy around it. You know, and I'll keep repeating that because it really is. It's a whole community around this stuff where people want to teach. They want to feel like they're close to them. I can give another example. Also, teams for food justice is in New York City. They go around schools and they install vertical gardens. So that way the cafeteria is purchasing locally grown at that school and they're still making money for the school because the cafeteria siphons purchase the products. One of the things that they contacted us about is, hey, Rob, we grow so much because this is such an efficient way of growing that we're trying to figure out how to get students to farmer's markets. We're trying to figure out how to sell the access. And I'm like, dude, growing crops or create crop boxes and sell directly to students and teachers. That's so much better even than Girl Scout cookies, you know? I mean, if students are actually growing the products, seeing how things are grown, the nutrition behind them know they have some sort of respect for the product, too. It's like having a pet, right? You never know what it's like until you actually get.
Chris Snyder [00:33:59] Well, let's talk about that a little. Some packed out a little bit, because I think at my kid's school here in Hermosa, I think they do have these big planter boxes where they grow some things. So are you saying or are you suggesting that these schools have these growing programs already and that they could actually do a better job of that? I mean, of today conditions are in the United States, right? That would actually I mean, there's got to be hundreds of thousands of schools in the United States, of course.
Rob Reiner [00:34:29] And imagine you're showing them something new. So these vertical farms are New York City. So you're talking about these smallest, you know, use of space and you're growing vertically with these indoor farms. So it's a lot of technology and science that gets involved. So the students are learning to grow food in a very scientific and a very innovative way. On top of that, you know, you're making your school revenue because you're you know, you can make more money for these programs, go against sign the boxes or you're also supplying amazing food to your community or your actual cafeteria. So there's a lot to be said about teaching kids, especially like that's something that I always notice is the children really are everything. Right. They're going to dictate the futures that we have. For example, kids of the future. I won't drive cars. They won't be into buying cars because it's a completely different generation that's coming out. They're gonna be driven by cars and canoes or in Ubers. Right.
Chris Snyder [00:35:23] So, such a waste. The time to get in a car and drive it right.
Rob Reiner [00:35:29] Well, I'm hoping. Right.
Chris Snyder [00:35:44] Got it. So let's take a. So let's take a step back and go back to how long it takes to actually. You've got a couple months down on the prototype and all that stuff that we just talked about. By the way, you had to learn over the past two years. Of course, hooked that into your initial Invision app or sketch app or product design. Like these are things that have to evolve and learn, which is why you said at the beginning, this is an evolution and it never ends. Yeah, put MVP, which I know we don't. I don't love that word either, by the way. But let's call it something. So let's call it MVP. You spent a couple months on MVP in prototype. Now you're going out to Dev. So how long does it take? How much is something like this cost and how long should it take?
Rob Reiner [00:36:32] OK, so Dev is very interesting. Dev, you really want to find a team that can structure and understand your goals because the way you build is very important. What features are you going to roll out first? And keep in mind that the role of a CEO or the role of an if you're leading the company, you're going to be meeting with investors. So the quicker that you have things to show, the better. So you've got to prioritize features, right. So that's definitely something that you give them, even if you have your whole prototype. They launch in stages. And if you're doing the agile method, then it's every two weeks, right? You're launching sprints or every week you might have an update. But essentially, you have to really prioritize what's the most important function of this app. So that way, when you because you're gonna get coated, but that way you can also be an investor means and you can have even if it's, you know, the test fibers and the prototype version where the coders are still working on it. You can show them progress. And that looks really cool to a lot of people. They need to be able to see this thing versus the prototypes. So that is definitely something. The costs involved in the timing of this is very something that I like to say is usually we go to market and four months, that's usually a goal of four to six months. This is typically a goal. But I mean, that's me putting everything that I've learned behind the app. So for most people, I would usually expect, you know, 10 to 12 months. And also, if it is going to take that long, you have time to plan. So, I mean, I can't tell you how many apps that I get pitched where they started, they launched, and then they're completely destroying everything they built to start over and do something brand new, but they already raise funds. So now they're trying to restart with a brand new evaluation with nothing. And it's just easier to start a brand new company like that. So the the prioritization of of features is very important. The race to get launched really isn't that big of a thing. So long as that you get launched with the features that you need for the market. Right.
Chris Snyder [00:38:28] So you think it's closer, probably closer to a year to get something in market between your prototype phase. You personally, because you have a computer science background, you already have a team. Sounds like you've got some business. You already have a little bit of, you know, foundation underneath you. But if someone were to start from scratch, they would probably take the first six months to even figure out where you've already got it. So, yeah, minimum, your MVP is probably about a year. Is that fair?
Rob Reiner [00:39:00] I would say yes. Yes. But hopefully you can launch sooner with better features. MVP meaning. So the day you get started coding, I would say you make sure whatever you're building, you scale it back to where. When you talk to your development team, they tell you four months, anything longer and the market's going to shift. Things are gonna change. So obviously, there's the planning stage that comes before that. It could be three months, 10 months, whatever, how long it takes you to plan the app. But once you get to that building phase, make sure that your sprint is four months. And I'd love for those to start taking features out because you're just going to waste your money.
Chris Snyder [00:39:37] That's great advice. That's absolutely great advice. And you know what? No excuses from anyone out there. Learn how to use a vision app or learn how to use scarce. If you do not need a developer to build low fidelity prototype and then you do need a developer to then scope that. And if they scope it beyond four months, you've got the wrong team. Right. Or you need to start. You need to start peeling stuff back and you need to get to market in four months. That's what I'm hearing.
Rob Reiner [00:40:07] Yes. Biggest red flag is when you're talking to a developer. And I know this because it kills My Space. 100 percent of My Space is basically people who get screwed over the first time is that most people work with development. Do you get screwed? Yeah.
Chris Snyder [00:40:22] Oh my god - we could make a show on that. We could make a whole show on how we all got screwed over by a dev. Right.
Rob Reiner [00:40:29] Every time. So the biggest red flag is, are they trying to take away features or are they trying to add features? If they're trying to add features, more than likely they're just trying. They're in it for the money. If they're. Take away features, they know that their success revolves around your success. Remember, that's something that I really stuck to and that's why I only right now I focus on my own apps, apps that are my own ideas, because I don't want to get stuck doing a project that doesn't launch in. If you're starting a dev company, that is essentially your first learning curve is if you work for projects for people you've been and you build products for people where they're products that just never see the market or never see the light of day. And I'm just accepting revenue and revenue. When I go to my second client and they ask me, hey, what have you built? And I don't have anything to show for it, that looks really bad. So essentially, you want to have a developer that understands that aspect of it and that knows that they have to grow with you. If not, they lose the contract or they're not going to scale. So be thinking of that, too. And that they have plans to scale with you. Hey, what happens after I launch? Who would you add? How many people on the team, etc.. Just to give you an idea of the Cropsweam that started over from scratch in November. In six months, they were able to launch the version that you see today. With that came an entire team. It's not just your developers, right? So that's why outsourcing sometimes it's a little bit better than in house unless you have the funds to do in-house. But remember, you have your developers, you have your testers, you have your designers, your actual brand design. When I say designers, design is an important thing. Don't waste your money on graphic designers. Waste your money on people who have actually designed an app and built an app because graphic designers are going to create something beautiful and cool. But they don't have the user experience of knowing, hey, this button won't be good there. Because if you click that button there. Android won't let you do it because it violates this law because they have a back button, et cetera. No. You also have to design for Android design for iPhone. There's a lot of different things that you have to design for. So finding a designer that is 100 percent specific to app development is going to be your, I mean, another lifesaver.
Chris Snyder [00:42:34] So, I've talked with a number of firms in some of these firms, depending on where they're based and some of their clients were, they can be super expensive. I'm talking between one hundred thousand seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars for a nine-month project. That's everything. That's like the whole God damn thing. Right. Tell me, you know, what kinds of pricing for a startup. And I think we all understand seed round startups get between like five hundred thousand and two million. Like in that round. In that range. And they usually last for about 18 months. That's usually the runway. And if they can't get this shit done, improve their hypothesis or their thesis, then they're out. Then if you make it, you go to series A. But in my mind, I'm thinking to myself, OK, we just got five hundred thousand dollars, right. For NewCo, right. This is not your company, but NewCo. In that basically bought us a year, which isn't even fifty thousand dollars, but it's not even fifty thousand dollars a month. Yeah. We live in Los Angeles or New York or Chicago. I got to tell you man, like how do you get this stuff done? How can you possibly get this stuff done.
Rob Reiner [00:43:53] Yeah. No, I will say this. It's been crazy. I mean, to be honest, I give a lot of things to van life because you learn to live with nothing. Right. You learn what's important. So I think everybody needs to take a trip, leave what they're used to doing for a whole year and get really into living with nothing. Right. But to be honest with you, it's really about the importance of your idea, right? Of my startups. We have a company called Thirty Three Group where we will angel invest or we will accelerate startups. If I like the concept and the idea. And it's something that's forward-thinking. It's a shareable economy. It's something that has to do with our vision. We will basically build the entire turnkey app for under a hundred thousand dollars, but we obviously invest in it. Right. So we're investing in things like that. But I've got to be honest. Usually if you're going to spend over one hundred thousand dollars on a version one, you probably went with the wrong dev team personally seeing how things are done now. I would always go outsourcing. If you're going to do an MVP, I would always outsource it just because you don't need to spend the extra cash. Having somebody here in staff in the US building it out, unless you aren't a development person, then you obviously would want to CTO that's in-house, but the rest of the team can be outsourced. Think of coding like a language if you learn English. English in Australia is the same as learning English in the US. Coding is a language. So learning it anywhere also OBE is the same, but it won't get you to market quickly in terms of costs. When it comes to building them for different companies, if we're doing it for revenue and things like that, it's usually upwards of 120 for the whole thing. That's I mean, that's branding around it. That's your testers. That's literally everything we test. We have a company of about 300 employees. So every single app will test among our internal team also. So the testing we take care of, we take care of everything, basically to get you to market immediately. I mean, that's honestly it. And then sometimes you push back on the price. Sometimes I'll invest in these startups myself, because that's all I do with my capital. Honestly, I just like to invest it because it's exciting to me to see how close you can get at actually changing the world that actually, you know, creating an innovative idea. The material aspect of life to me is very shortcoming. So it's more fun to do things that are a little bit more challenging. So that's why I kind of just turned into an investor. I use my extra capital to start investing in all these startups. So I'm consistently I always have my capital tied in startups just because of it.
Chris Snyder [00:46:19] Well, it sounds like in staff as well. You know, I've thought about this the way I grew up was - you get a real job. You climb the corporate ladder. You invest in your four one K. So some jerk on Wall Street can compete with a chimpanzee to win or lose the hey guy. And you wake up one day when you're 65 and hopefully you have, you know, a few shekels left in the bank to sit in your rocking chair, get a Winnebago and start to enjoy your life. I mean, that's pretty much it, right?
Rob Reiner [00:46:53] Is the truth? Even when we were composing everybody, we met. Oh, my God. You guys are so young. What are you guys doing here? Things like that. But it was so cool to hear the stories, right. I mean, in a lot of ways, the story is sort of kind of deter you from a certain lifestyle. The way I was, I grew up my dad. He followed the entire corporate ladder up to becoming the CTO of a publicly-traded company. So he is now in that position, which is he's very lucky to be in. And he worked super hard at his job at me. Seeing that was it was very interesting growing up, seeing that because you're watching a structure where, you know, it's it's just weird to me. I always question everything. That's my mentality is always questioning things because, you know, you're born here in this world. OK? And we don't ask some questions that I think just need to be asked. For example, why do we get sick, right. If we're such perfect beings or regenerative? Why do we get sick? Just simple questions like that. One of the questions that I always asked myself was, and so we're here in life. And my dad is leaving 9:00 to 5:00 every single day instead of spending time with me here and seeing that so much. You know, obviously, I'm not saying my dad didn't spend time with me at all. He did. I would see it through my friends. I just saw the whole culture of that. That was something that I always never wanted to be a part of. Is this whole nine-to-five mentality, because it's just doesn't make sense.
Chris Snyder [00:48:08] Some of my friends. They never see their kids. They leave on Sunday night or Monday morning. They come home on Thursday. And even when they're home, they're working. So. And I've got you know, how much is enough. How much do you really need? I'm not suggesting that you don't need much and you need to live in squalor or. You know, I'm not saying that at my age I ain't living in a van, bro. All right. That's not it. But at the same time, I think that there definitely needs to be. I don't like the word work life balance. I like the word integration because if you're passionate about something in your discipline and you understand how to ask the right questions like you are, what am I eating? How much am I sleeping? How much time am I spending with my family? That was my son. Need help with his football practice or his baseball practices as my daughter needs help with her softball practice like in when you're there for those things. Those are the things that are more important to me than making a couple hundred extra thousand dollars a year.
Rob Reiner [00:49:19] Exactly. And I will say this. The life of an entrepreneur is definitely way worse in the sense that I mean, I work Saturdays and Sundays. Right. I Cropswap isn't the only app that I'm doing. I help with other apps that I invested in that I have to be the tech guy for them. I have to design them, use my experience from launching the apps towards them. So it's a nonstop working lifestyle, really. But the one thing I do appreciate is when I'm working on something that I'm in control of. Right. My own engine, my own passions. I don't have anybody that's essentially a boss of mine or anything like that. But it's one of those things that I will always be passionate about what I'm doing because I'm creating it. It's something that that I believe in. Right. So I did make the mistakes at the beginning to get into those corporate jobs. And very quickly, I just it's almost like you can tell what your future is going to be like. And when you can tell what your future is going to be like, it becomes unexciting anymore. Right. You know, you can predict it. And I see it over my friends. Right.
Chris Snyder [00:50:15] Well, thinking back on it, my career, I should have never been to any of those companies. I'm thankful that I had the opportunity to learn. I think all of us need to go on a bit of a learning journey and figure out how this whole game works. Yeah, but I think I've been asked to leave more often than not. And then obviously what I found myself in the entrepreneur chair, that has been the best time of my life. And that's where I've been most productive and most valued.
Rob Reiner [00:50:43] Right. And it's kind of crazy because nothing in my life really changed because you still have it's always ups and downs. Right. No matter what, you're always going to go through ups and downs. It's just one of those things where I want to control what my ups and downs are. I want to be in control of it rather than it being a bonus. Right. Or an extra Christmas paycheck or something like that. I want to be in control of my own bonuses. So that was a - I completely agree with you. That was a big, big thing of mine as well. But I will say it has been an interesting ride, but it's one of those things where the higher you climb, the more interesting the people you meet, you're meeting people that really do change, can change and impact things, you know, not to veer off in a little ways of a conversation. But, you know, you have this whole mentality, right? These people I mean, you see it in your movies now where people are sort of riding against the wealthy. Right. You have Elon Musk that is now selling all his homes because he's trying to give a new look to the billionaires so that people have money. Something that I'm starting to realize, the higher up I'm trying to climb is these people who are in control of so much capital. They don't know how to spend it. So they have these advisors who tell them how to spend it. But if you get close to them and you tell them your ideas and your concepts, they'll throw it out there. There's enough money to be made to be done. It's just not enough people creating innovative ideas out there to really make it happen. So when we talk about these evil, powerful families, it's not like you can go to them, especially the kids of these people. Right, who are so eco friendly, who are surfers, who don't want to live life. Right. You go to these people with a decent idea. They will invest in it.
Chris Snyder [00:52:16] Oh, yeah. So. So I think what I hear you saying is like, OK, great, let's not rail on these guys. If if you really want to do something that changes the world, give them a different place to invest their money, hopefully they're going to invest it. Right. So they're going to give it to Wall Street or they're going to give it to you. I mean, they'll have balanced portfolios. You know, they're going to give it a little private equity. They've got family offices. They're going to give it to, you know, the, you know, rights and commercial real estate. They're invested in everything. So I think. Yeah. Stop bitchen. Figure out something that you're passionate about that actually makes a dent in this world. And go tell them about it. Tell us more about it and you'll get money.
Rob Reiner [00:52:57] I mean, just to give all your viewers a concept or an idea of how to come up with one of these ideas that really impacts the world. I mean, just because I want to see it happen so badly and I can't do enough of these concepts but be thinking about corporations. They taught us one thing. They taught us with all these monopolies to give me an example. Like Whole Foods. I'll use Cropswap as an example. In Australia, there's two grocery store chains, right? They control all the produce in Australia. With Cropswap what we're doing when you talk about a shared economy, a lot of people think, you know, sharing your car, sharing your home. But what you're really sharing is the economy of that group. So Airbnb now shares the economy with all the hotel chains. Uber now shares the economy with all the taxi car companies, rental car companies and now with Swamp. We're gonna be able to share the economy with the big players because we're giving people the tools to compete. That's gonna happen everywhere because corporations just taught us that these whole whale monopoly things don't work. Cryptos coming out, that's gonna decentralize a lot of things. So be looking at that space. We're talking about applications now, like Netflix, for example. Netflix isn't going to exist much longer, in my opinion. I think apps like that are going to are gonna go because there's gonna be new platforms where when I watch Netflix and I spend 12 dollars a month on Netflix, it goes to the views that I watch. So if I spend the entire time watching one series, all that capital goes to that one serious. And it's distributed in that sense. So imagine having a platform where everybody can create videos. If I all of a sudden create something great and it goes viral, I made I just created a studio. Right. Based on everybody's views. And now I can keep creating content. That's the future. We're going to his everything is going to be super decentralized, not one. You know, you don't have to be a Paramount Pictures anymore to make a movie. You don't have to be this huge company to make these things. And the people who released the tools that are going to, you know, empower other users to create their own businesses. That's the future. Because, you know, as it replaces standard human, you know, tours, I guess people are going to get more creative. And I think humans are gonna start shifting into a super creative role where they're gonna be starting their own things, their own. If they're into food, they're going to use crops to sell their own food, if they're into chains, et cetera. So that's what I would recommend, is really focusing on those kinds of ideas, too.
Chris Snyder [00:55:17] Yeah, no, I love it. Let's talk about product-market fit, because where we left off was the idea, the prototype, the development. Now, you made a point earlier, and I know this all too well because our business has helped people with this in the past. Unfortunately, most startups burn through all their money before they get to the product-market fit in selling phase where I save selling. I mean, now you've got this beautiful app that a bunch of people spend a bunch of time on to get all passionate about, but they don't know how to actually create a business out of it or to validate the start pivoting around and doing all the hard work. So, yeah, let's talk about when you realize product-market fit for Cropswap. No, it might have been there prior to your coming on a Cropswap, so maybe it was. That was part of your decision criteria. But November, you started it now. Now you built the app, an amazing job and now there's work to do. And I call that the product-market fit work. Where are you on that work? And describe that a little bit.
Rob Reiner [00:56:24] Yeah. So it's been really hectic. So we launched Cropswap, the first version that we just launched right now in March. It encompassed everything that you could do on the previous app. So we still wanted people to be able to trade. We still wanted people to be able to list their produce, to have the classes, the events. Now we're coming into our revenue generation side. So this is one of the most important things is figuring out the revenue model. Yeah. For the first two years, we thought we could just figure it out and we could just guessing. We burned a quarter-million dollars in two years doing that. Right. So you think that you can just guess and it'll come right? It'll figure it out. The crowds. Crossharbour is an extreme example of that not working. Why didn't it work? Because you can't make money off transactions when it's five oranges, you know, 10 apples. You know, there's just no money to be made. So I can't create a revenue model out of it. And so we had to shift and pivot tremendously. So that was one of the things where your firm would have been amazing to figure out. Right off the bat, as, hey, guys, where are you guys going to provide value for users to be able to pay you? We weren't providing enough value. Think about it. The first version of Cropswap allowed you to list your extra produce or your produce and sell it to users. If I'm an orange, if I have five oranges in front of my front yard and I know I can, I have extra oranges. If I went on the old version of Cropswap and I sold those 100 oranges, they would all be sold and gone. And then the user basically feels okay. I got lucky. I sold my hundred oranges and the users that bought those hundred oranges feel like they got lucky to find them on Cropswap. It's over. And then people got off the app or they would just stop using yapped. Just so you know, before we built rebuilt crops. We had twenty-five thousand users and twenty-nine different countries. Wow. But it was all growers, farmers. It was just the community. And that also was a failure to me because it wasn't my parents.
Chris Snyder [00:58:11] So you had the supply side. Right. But you didn't have the demand side on the consumer and you weren't doing a great job of that supply and demand match. Yes. And then figuring out, OK, if this and then that, if you size the marketplace and you just said, well, it's food. So it's a quadrillion dollar marketplace without its founders do. Right. Like, of course, the biggest fucking marketplace on the planet. It's three trillion dollars, right. Yeah. But. But what. What. Really need to do is figure out, OK. We've got two thousand growers and that's the supply side. And you didn't even need that many to start figuring out unit economics. Then you could have gone to the demand side. The consumer side figured out your ideal customer consumer profile on the demand side, people that want these and then figure out a prototype way to match in the middle and maintain engagement so you can figure out lifetime value and figure out how much you need to acquire these customers for. So that wasn't done in V1, right? It is being done now. Or tell me about how.
Rob Reiner [00:59:18] So in November. So I founded Cropswap with a guy named Daniel McCollister in November. I told Dan that I wanted to rebuild Cropswap, that I had this new concept of how we could launch this app. And it actually worked for consumers. He went off to do he wanted to do political activism, which, you know, as you know, for startups, which I told him did no problem. Let me take over Croswell. Let me make this what I want to make it into. I think it's going to work. The shift that we had to make was first, we deleted the entire previous version. So we didn't use anything from the previous version. We killed all the users. We require people to make completely new accounts on this brand new version. So I was willing to risk that. And I put it front of the capital to do recreate it from scratch whenever that happened. I only felt confident doing that because I felt like I figured out a lot in the market. What I figured out was that a consumer did not know that local growers exist. And at the same time, local growers don't know that consumers even want their products. Another big thing is this. Local growers and farmers are there. They're not very business minded. They don't want to dabble into business. So they would never just promote themselves. They would never pay for an app to help grow their business, because how would I show them that they run their business? So that came with this interesting concept that we're launching in two weeks called crop boxes. So crop boxes give consumers the ability to subscribe to a local operation. The word subscribe take it very lightly, but it's basically it allows you to subscribe to get weekly or monthly boxes of anything. It could be kale. It could be a random plant every month. But essentially, we're creating a trust between a consumer and a local grower. We're creating a chain where the local grower now has to be dependent upon, you know, this growing. And then now we have the consumer that also knows that they're going to receive a product. Right. The word subscriber is very interesting because although you can just buy one box and then unsubscribe, write the word subscribe in itself is almost like brainwashing users into feeling that sustainability like, oh, cool, this is something that's going to, you know, and then that's teaching local growers that it's something that's going to stay there. So something that I always tell people is - imagine if I'm on Cropswap right now and I have all my kale beds and I know I can support 10 neighbors every single month with my kale. That's right. I can go on Cropswap and I can save from this month or this month or from these days to these days, I can support X amount of users. So let's say it's 20 people that they can support. What's interesting is the value that we'll be able to give people is not only will people subscribe now and we'll be able to make revenue for that local grower, but now imagine if those 20 subscriptions get blocked up. Now, for the first time, we're able to tell a local grower, hey, you can scale because you've got 10 people waiting in or wait until you get twelve, twenty, etc.. So now we're giving people value. Another value that we're giving on Cropswap is this. If I open up the app in Beverly Hills on West Hollywood, I'm not going to see anything because there's no growers there. There's not enough space for farmers there. I'll probably see very unique products, but I won't see anything really that I want to buy. So how do we account for that? And interesting out to look at. And I do recommend that your users look at other apps and see how their revenue models function is Weed Maps. Weed Maps shows you all the dispensary locations, much like Cropswap shows you all the gardener and farmer locations. But what else do they show you? Delivery pens. And that's very important on Cropswap. So imagine we have farms in Pomona that are now going to be able to put pens in Beverly Hills and Malibu and West Hollywood all over the place where they service. So now I'm giving you value because now I'm giving you exposure on our virtual maps. We're creating almost like a virtual real estate. Right. So now when users open an app in Beverly Hills or West Hollywood, boom, they see exactly what's deliverable, who services their area. And now we're able to show that. So that was a mistake that we made at the beginning, was thinking that you could just ads, right? That's everybody's pitches. Oh, we're just going to charge ads or the transaction because it's just not enough money to be made on the transaction. If I hold the grower accountable to a certain price and they know that they're gonna be paying a service fee, that's a little bit easier because they already know how much they're gonna be making. Right. So it was a lot of pivoting and shifting. But we feel like with this model, this creates sustainability. This will create that growth in local growers and. It's exciting, too, because we have farms, for example, that I've approached, that I've told me, look, Rob, you know, during I just really don't think we really want to scale. You know, there's people who just like we were speaking, they're comfortable with us with what they have. But something that happen is that during COVID-19, all their farmers' markets closed, all their restaurants closed, and there goes the revenue to zero. Right. So now we have all these farms shifting to this box model selling to consumers. And one of the things I'm talking to a lot of these farmers like, hey, why don't you keep doing what you're doing? Because Soko and by the way, they're all Muslims are booked out. Most of these boxes, I mean, they can't they're oversubscribed, essentially. But I'm telling them is like a lot of them say, like, well, when things were back to normal and we signed to restaurants again on any sign of farmers markets there, there's it's really interesting because I can tell them, you know, do you really want to be so dependent on the market? The farmer's market, for example, no farmer likes to sit at a farmers market tent selling produce. They want to go out there and grow right there to the restaurant side of it. That's great revenue. But when things like this happen, it shuts you down. If they had consumers on crop side and they were subscribed to their crop access, it would have been business as usual. Even if a situation like Koven 19 would have happened, they would have known how much they had to grow for their subscribers, even through a situation right now, they could be upping their subscriptions. So I also am telling farmers that they need to start this program on crop source with their local market just so they create their own sustainable channel with the local community that they're in control of. That's something that other companies have tried to do. You have imperfect produce and you have good eggs, right? You may unfortunately use your own transit vans or, um, delivery system. They don't give the trust to the local grower. And we're over here saying, look, I'm going to give you all the tools when you have your deliveries, you're gonna see a list of all your deliveries. You start it will go to the map. You make your own deliveries. You're in control of everything. Give you all the tools that you can compete. So we're hoping that with all these tools at the beginning, I think it's going to be oversubscribed. We have Farm One in New York City who is about to do a box where you get random chefs, produce items that you've never tasted, edible flowers, mulberries that make your mouth numb. You'll be able to subscribe to them on a monthly basis. And they're only going to have a limited amount of subscriptions because they still have to do business as usual with restaurants. So we also expect some exclusivity to happen for being subscribed to these places. So what's another value we can give people, maybe recipes with the products? Yeah, I was thinking about the classes, things like that. So there's other value things that we can add in now that we created the first value proposition. Right. The first thing that we can actually give users.
Chris Snyder [01:06:26] Yeah. I mean, you're building a marketplace. You're aggregating all the supply from all these growers. So I have a couple of questions. How do you guys start about some of these Hyorin restaurants, these farm to table? You know, their value prop is farm to table. That's taken off a lot over the last maybe five years. I would say that they've got an I cook a lot myself at home, but so you've got farm to table, which I think would be an excellent target audience for you guys, because you can charge what you need to charge and you can normalize that predictable demand from a set of folks that met their menus change all the time. They would love this. You don't have to train them or give them sophisticated, you know, nutritional items, recipes. So that's one thing I wanted to ask you about that group. And then the second question would be, what do you do about food quality? Because it's, look, we're not talking about GMO in products that have been treated to maintain their physical appearance. They're flip like, yeah, that's what you get at the store. And I get that. But so food quality is the second question. Yeah.
Rob Reiner [01:07:40] So the first question, the restaurants we have seen, the demand is crazy for that. And they've even told us like if you know that we can have kale on these weeks, we'll buy it all and then we'll take it off our menu.
Chris Snyder [01:07:52] Now, I feel like that's almost your primary customer. I feel like those guys would literally eat it up, no pun intended.
Rob Reiner [01:07:58] Yeah, no, it is. So we're going to create a reverse version of a crop box where restaurants or business locations can put what they're looking for. Yes. That way, local growers around there can figure out to conserve as can basically block out all of that. It's interesting, too, because we also have our bigger farms, like, for example, those blueberries that you get at Whole Foods. That company is a great company. It's I forgot what it's called. Off the top of my head. But anyways, we've spoken to them. When they have extra blueberries, they don't have enough to sell to a big corporate supply chain. So now one to sell those to their local market, because it's not it's you know, it's 50 pounds, 50 pounds. Is it enough to move on a truck? It's enough to sell to your local market. So they want to try doing that. But in terms of the restaurants, it's been really interesting. To see how excited they are about incorporating these things, the food quality thing is very much like review system. So we really, really are harsh about that. Whenever you make a delivery or whenever your delivery has been delivered, you have to take a photo of it or you have to judge the product just like Amazon. Right. With the customer verified. Got it. Yeah. We're gonna have that.
Chris Snyder [01:09:03] So it's the farmer has to do that. Right. Like if I may drop this off at this time.
Rob Reiner [01:09:09] And then if you pick up something and you have an issue with what was picked up, for example, they left it out in the sun and it got ruined. You take a photo of it and then, yeah, we handle that process. But it's very much like Uber eats in the same thing. Most of this protest, to be honest, comes a little bit dirtier than your regular stuff at Whole Foods but, you know, it's kind of nice to see it. It's I call this actually just got picked. I can tell it's like a caterpillar on it, right?
Chris Snyder [01:09:35] Yeah. No, you know what I mean. Look. Not this isn't gonna be for everybody. I think we know that. But at the end of the day, I think now is the time, you know, with this shutdown. I was reading a Web site. It actually might have been someone from Sequoia, might have been Andrew Chan. I don't know if you know him, but he writes a lot of stuff on growth. But he said the number one item, the cell and e-commerce like over the last 60 days. Guess what it was? It was fucking bread makers, bread makers. That's not even creating. So you now have folks that are so busy and caught up with their lives that they're constantly running around all. We'll just at McDonald's or we'll just. Yep. Why did the whole country run out of flour? Why did the whole country run out of pasta? Why did the whole country run out of things that probably haven't been used in household since the 50s? Right now, a majority of households, certainly not my house, but now all of a sudden we've got, you know, the children starting to bake. Like, I might jump in a little bit. Right. There's people now realizing there's another part to life that isn't just about fast food, convenience, and commodity pricing.
Rob Reiner [01:10:48] Yeah. And I mean, you're - I'll be honest with you, the first time you taste like celery, for example. Have you ever tried celery grown? Right. It tastes completely different. I mean, night and day to what you get into the grocery store - it has a very peppery tasted. It's a very strong flavor. So you buy it out of Whole Foods. You've never even experienced it. I mean, there's a difference in between the Ralf's and the Whole Foods kind, but the one that you're gonna get from your local growers, completely different experience. So I actually think, like what my main goal is, is to give people this InstaCart experience so you would have your older community, especially. Right. Who's super into health, who's very into hey, my doctor told me to cut down and they've been paying us like crazy. I want to deliver. I wanted delivery. That's something that I think moving forward past COVID-19. I don't think grocery stores are going to be the same. I think people are going to like the convenience of things getting delivered. And I almost look at it like a slot machine. Like you're almost excited about seeing what comes in that box because every week is different. So to give you an example in Los Angeles, and I'm for sure, since you're in L.A., I'll get you this one bit and we'll get one delivered to you. But Fricker Farms and Cottonwood Farms are going to partner up and they do boxes together. So if you're in East L.A., it'll be Conway. If you're in West Side, it'll be Factory Farms. But every single month, you get, you know, your regular lettuces, your celery, your potatoes, your carrots, the regular, the usual. Right. But you also get something new that's in harvest. So, for example, lavender, mulberries that are in season right now. Next week, it'll be peaches. So you're always getting also something new, something that's in season that's local that was picked could be citrus oranges. So if you're also eating with the seasons, so it's going to be really interesting to see how people's boxes change as the season changes as well.
Chris Snyder [01:12:30] Yeah, I love it. This is so this is really exciting. And I'm just glad, you know, yesterday I had not yesterday. That was Sunday on Friday. I had someone on who does branding and stuff like that, but only for sustainable companies. Amazing. Her thing was just I only want to work with companies that are sustainable. And this is one of those things. So one thing I usually like to let the listeners what I like to give the listeners at the end is you've you're in a position where you're you're in the founder, CEO, executive chair. You obviously see a lot. You've probably been through a lot given COVID. And then plus you've got a whole bunch of other clients from different companies that you've run and stuff like that. You know, one of the guys asked this question. He said, well, one thing that I want everybody to do is just embrace mistakes, because the more mistakes he makes, according to him and I agree with us, the more mistakes he makes, the more he learns and the better, you know, the more he grows. What what is it that you can leave us with that might inspire or give someone something about how you operate? That moves you forward.
Rob Reiner [01:13:43] Yes. So one is don't put an age to your goals because I made that mistake consistently. So definitely don't put an age on your goals because you're not going to be right no matter what. You're gonna be wrong on that one. The second most important one for me, honestly, is the fact that the ride never ends, that you're gonna go. The higher the highs get, the worse, the worse it gets. It's always that balance. It's always the balancing of equations. Right. So that's something that entrepreneurs don't get used to. The literally. You're going to have your best day and in one week, expect your worst day. That's probably the best advice that I've actually used on a daily basis, is I'm always expecting something bad to happen. I'm always expecting something amazing happen and always try and stay Zen through all of it because it's going to happen. And that's just how the way life works. And I wish I didn't get so caught up in, you know, it's going to get better. It's going to get to the point where I can just hang out and just relax, because that never comes. It's always going to be a race. So get used to it essentially.
Chris Snyder [01:14:42] Yeah, I've been my business partner and I've been running companies since 2008, probably 2005 until now. And I can tell you, you always expect it's supposed to get easier. It's supposed to get easier. But every night I go to bed, I'm just expecting for something tomorrow to get it's going to get harder. It's gonna get harder. I'm waiting for it not to be so hard. Someday, maybe. But I call it that. That hit across the head by the two by four. Just you're hanging out, you're walking and then all of a sudden whack. And you're just like, where the fuck did that come from all the time?
Rob Reiner [01:15:20] But it's interesting. But yeah, that's something that I always kind of just figured is you're gonna go through the bars and they do get worse and it's insulting. You get stronger, too. So they're not as bad. Right. They would be bad to an entrepreneur that just started out. But you're like, oh, no, I've gone through that so many times. I know exactly how to pivot and deal with it. So it does get worse and it does get better. But that's the understanding to me that I always see from these books as they always feel like it's like a dream. And you get to this place of just Zen. And at least with my personality type, I'm always somebody that even after Cropswap, I'm going to go on and do the next thing. What's harder? What can we impact? That's crazier. So it's also always gonna be a challenge of always staying entertained with life. Right. Picking the hardest thing to do in and hopefully, you know, not getting bored of doing it because that to me is the worst. If you get bored of doing anything, you're not going to put passion behind it. You're gonna just, you know, leave it to the side. So for me, that that was one of the biggest is definitely being passionate about it. And always I mean, it's gonna get worse and it's gonna get better.
Chris Snyder [01:16:19] Yeah, it might sound a little cliche, but it's definitely the journey. It is not the destination. You have to want to run. Keep putting one foot in front of the other, even though it hurts. It's you have to be the kind of person that understands that this is not a pain for you. This is what you chose to do. No one's forcing you to do this right now.
Rob Reiner [01:16:39] And you're always growing right. If you're knocking at the door, eventually someone's going to open. If you have that mindset, it's going to happen. Right. That's at least how I believe the human experience works, whatever we think we create. So if we're always obsessed with this idea and we're thinking about it on a nonstop level, it happens. I mean, even with the COVID-19 stuff, sometimes it blows my mind because if COVID-19 hadn't happened, people wouldn't be this aware about the local products. People wouldn't even know these local products exist. So thank you to COVID-19 in some ways because now people are aware that local produce exists, that they can actually depend on their local growers. So it took something as negative as this to happen, to also have a proactive thing that came from it. So it really is a very strategic thing being an entrepreneur and kind of, you know, seeing what's the pro what's a nonprofit and kind of moving and adapting. But it's fun. I love it.
Chris Snyder [01:17:26] Yeah, well, I'm glad you're here in L.A. because when this whole thing lifts, we're going to have to get together. I feel like you and I could probably do this all day and all night long. Seriously, we definitely will. It's going to be fun. And this is gonna be great, believe me. So, everyone, Rob Reiner is the CEO and founder of Cropswap, a game-changing format phone app that connects consumers, farmers, and growers in their communities to purchase fresh produce. So thank you, Rob. I'm going to collect a bunch of your URLs and stuff from you over the coming days. We can get this all posted in the show notes for our guests so they can go to your Web site, learn more. You mentioned books. There's a whole bunch of stuff. A lot of great nuggets that you dropped. So I really appreciate your time today.
Rob Reiner [01:18:08] Beautiful. Thank you so much, seriously, for being so articulate and the questions - It was an awesome experience.
Chris Snyder [01:18:14] All right, Rob. Take care. We'll see you around.One cat rescue that is located in Mission, British Columbia, has recently had to reportedly close the doors because of the high demand they are seeing right now of cats in need.
They are overwhelmed with the amount of cats that are coming into the rescue in Mission, they have urged anyone who has considered in making the move to foster a cat to possibly think about making now the time to look around at doing it.
There are many cats in need of a good home whether that means fostering one or adopting one to offer it a forever home, cats all around BC have been dropped at rescues as people head back to work after the pandemic. There are multiple ways to help cats in B.C. and adoption is one of those ways that makes a big impact.
Some people are going back to work now and will no longer be at home to care for their pets they might have adopted last year. Or, they could be travelling for an extended period of time etc, whatever the reason, there are many cats who need help and who have been dropped off or found their way to rescues.
Cat Therapy and Rescue Society in Mission, B.C
Hundreds of those cats in B.C. that need homes are being cared for at the Cat Therapy and Rescue Society in Mission, B.C. The Cat Therapy and Rescue Society in Mission is a rescue venue that has a capacity for 300 cats and they have had to shuffle even more cats to foster homes because there are many that are coming in who need a home and need the proper care and help given to them.
If you cannot take on in yourself there are also options of adopting kennel spaces with the SPCA and giving to those rescue missions that are helping cats, like the Cat Therapy and Rescue Society in Mission, B.C. Now is the time to help cats in B.C. who need adoption, and other animals affected by wildfires etc, through the BC SPCA and other animal-centered organizations that are doing the hard work to help.
Multiple Ways to Help
There is more than one way to get involved and try to help one or more cats and other animals that might need help or a home at this time. With wildfires burning around the province this has also caused some animals to be rescued by the SPCA too and it might be giving money or giving a home space to a cat, you can find more than one way to help.
Where To Adopt Cats in BC
For anyone around B.C. that might be looking for a cat right now and have room for a new pet, this rescue in Mission is just one place to look that has cats available. The BC SPCA is another area to look for cats that are up for adoption.
You can find ways to financially offer support as well, for medical care or kennel and play space for cats and dogs that are with the BC SPCA also. This is a great way to support many more animals in the community without having to take them in because a number of people are restricted currently from having pets where they live.
For those cats who do not end up finding help or a home they could end up becoming injured, abused, or killed, and there is a great demand right now in B.C. with cats that are looking for their forever home.
Since things have been reopening not just in Canada but other areas too this has been an ongoing trend it seems of people who have been returning their cats and pets to shelters, or abandoning them in other places. This is increasing the need for cat foster volunteers and forever home adoptions who are willing to help.
Why are people abandoning their pets?
It’s likely that some didn’t put enough thought into the long-term commitment that it would take to look after those pets that they adopted at the beginning of the pandemic. Maybe they thought they would be working from home for good but now that things have changed they need to make other arrangements? There are a variety of reasons why one animal might end up being unwanted and returned.
For animal lovers around the U.S. and Canada it has been hard to see the multiple stories coming out lately of those animals being abandoned in a variety of places.
In B.C. there are a number of animals that need help too because of the wildfires right now and some of them have even been returned to their owners after they had evacuated. The BC SPCA is a great organization that works to give that help to those animals who are in need around the province. This is an organization that has been working for years to offer that emergency hand to help and care for the different animals who are in trouble or being abused in the province.
There are other shelters around B.C. as well who have also been doing meaningful work to help rescue cats and other pets that need it and to offer them a safe and peaceful place. Right now there are multiple ways to help cats in BC that need adoption. One of those ways to help is to sign up to foster pets, or you could adopt one or more of those pets in need. Another way to help would be to also choose to give financial donations to help animals who need care or shelter as well around the province.
For anyone that wants to help cats that need adoption in BC these are just some of the ways to do it.
Foster A Cat
Looking to foster a cat right now? That rescue above in Mission has a Foster Parent Application that you can fill out if you are interested in offering a forever home to one of the animals there.
BC SPCA Cat Adoption and Foster Opportunities
Through the BC SPCA website you can also find tools that allow you to search for cats that are up for adoption right now too. On their website there are a variety of cats that are currently listed who are looking for homes. They are also recruiting foster volunteers around the province. For that mission to recruit new foster volunteers they mention on their site that they are looking at finding pet foster volunteers around areas like Vancouver Island, Okanagan/Kootenay Region, as well as in the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley, and the Northern B.C. region.
How do you foster a cat?
Fostering a cat is a great way to offer help to those cats in B.C. that need help right now and are in transition to finding their forever home. You might not be able to make a full-time permanent commitment but there are also other ways to help by offering a temporary shelter to those cats who are in need. Fostering a cat is as easy as contacting the BC SPCA or another organization that is looking for foster volunteers, filling out any required paperwork or answering any required questions and going through any vetting process before being paired with the animal in need.
What does a foster volunteer do for the cat? The foster volunteer home is going to be an environment that helps to prepare the animals for their forever home adoption. The foster home for the cat is going to give that cat a chance to live in a safe environment where they feel they can fully express themselves and work to overcome any difficulties or fears from trauma. The foster volunteers help to strengthen the services that the BC SPCA is able to provide for animals around the province.
Foster volunteers are needed for those cats who still need a home in B.C. today. But there is more than fostering as a way to help, you could also adopt a cat, financially support a cat or dog etc, or give a donation to an organization that is helping to rescue and offer those emergency services to cats in need around the province. No donation made to help a cat, dog, or animal in need in the province is going to be a donation that is too small to help. Every donation matters and goes toward helping those animals in B.C. who need it.
Offering to adopt, foster volunteer, or make a money donation, are moves that can go on to protect and enhance the quality of life animals in BC.
Adopt a cat in BC if you can but don’t forget to consider there are other ways to help too aside from the adopt a cat option, because not everyone can adopt a cat in BC at this time. If you are also looking for other ways to help cats in BC then consider those mentioned above.

Today, there shall be a Champions League draw. It involves eight teams, and one of those just so happens to be Juventus. Some people might not want it that way, but Juve find themselves in this spot because their wild and heart attack-inducing two-legged win over Tottenham. Now, we get to see who will cause us to have more heart palpitations.
There are decent outcomes to be had out there. There are not-so-decent outcomes to be had out there. Seven possibilities are out there and nobody will know until we see a bunch of video montages and then, after too much waiting, hear Juventus’ name called.
For a quick refresher course, these are the eight teams that will be taking part in the Champions League quarterfinals come the first two weeks of next month.
- Juventus
- Barcelona
- Real Madrid
- Sevilla
- Bayern Munich
- Manchester City
- Liverpool
- AS Roma

So, who will it be in the @ChampionsLeague quarter-finals? #TOGETHER pic.twitter.com/4eDQTD3MYx
There are no country-on-country restrictions being put into place in the knockout rounds. None of that. Real Madrid could play Barcelona. Manchester City could play Liverpool. And, if there’s some kind of Italy-on-Italy schenanigans going on today, there could very well be a Juventus against Roma card being drawn.
There are seven possibilities, but only one final outcome for Juventus. We shall watch and, at some point, actually find out of will be the next European opponent for the current Serie A leaders. Sounds fun, doesn’t it? (Maybe.)

A rudimentary glance at the season stats of Lucas Sims in 2019 won’t exactly wow you. A 4.04 ERA is nice enough in a ‘2015-2018 Cincinnati Reds pitcher’ sort of way, but is hardly inspiring, as is his 1.33 WHIP.
That said, a dive a tad deeper shows that Sims has, in fact, been largely impressive for AAA Louisville this year in a way you’d hope to see from a former 1st round draftee. If you pinpoint his April 26th start against the Norfolk Tides, for instance, you’ll see a thorough shellacking, one where he allowed 6 ER in just 1.1 IP. It was bad, it was gross, it was the kind of blow-up that most every pitcher will slog through at least once a season. It’s the work that Sims has done both before and after that start that has earned him a promotion to the Reds, as the club announced late last night.
RHP Lucas Sims is expected to be promoted from Triple-A Louisville to start tomorrow night’s game vs. Pittsburgh. #Reds pic.twitter.com/nnCgZJ8ZuZ— Cincinnati Reds (@Reds) May 28, 2019
In his 4 starts prior to that Norfolk debacle, he sported a 3.15 ERA with a dominant 34/6 K/BB in his 20 IP. In the 4 games post-Norfolk, it’s been much of the same - a 2.74 ERA across 23 IP, with a rock solid 28/7 K/BB in that span. All told, it appears the shoulder issues that ended his 2018 campaign prematurely haven’t derailed what he’s been able to accomplish, in large part, at the AAA level, and there absolutely was no more deserving member of the 40-man roster to get the call for tonight’s start, as the doubleheader yesterday has thrown a minor wrench into the overall Cincinnati rotational plans.
Frankly, I’m still irrationally high on Sims’ potential, especially given that he just turned 25 years old earlier this month. Getting to see him work his groovy breaking ball with Derek Johnson’s magic is something that I don’t anticipate we’ll see for long beyond tonight’s start, but I do still hold out hope it’ll be simply the start of something.
Also down in Louisville, prospect Brian O’Grady has been on some kind of power run of late, and the slugger credits a swing tweak courtesy of Hall of Famer Barry Larkin for his surge, as MiLB.com’s Brian Stultz reported. As the lead picture in that story also reveals, O’Grady’s mustache game is growing, too.
While Sims will join the Cincinnati rotation today (for a time), the hope is still that lefty Alex Wood will at some point in the future, too. As MLB.com’s Mark Sheldon reported, Wood is going to rejoin the Reds for the time being to begin ramping up his rehab work, with the idea that he’ll be able to go out on a rehab assignment in the minors in the near future beginning to finally be a real one. Obviously, Wood’s a great talent, but the Cincinnati rotation hasn’t exactly sputtered without him, so it’ll sure be interesting to see how the Reds juggle his eventual return alongside the ever-nearing July trade deadline.
In other news, the MLB Draft is less than a week away, and The Athletic’s fleet of baseball writers served us up a full 1st round Mock Draft. They weren’t serving as their own GMs of the teams they cover, per se, but rather were trying to anticipate what the teams themselves might do with their primary selections next week. C. Trent Rosecrans seems to be hearing what most Reds fans have heard lately, too, that lefty Nick Lodolo from TCU at #7 overall appears to be the most likely prospect to be picked by Cincinnati, even though the Reds would love if one of the projected top 6 picks slips to them somehow.
For a bit more on Lodolo, here’s MLB.com’s draft profile of him in video form. As they note, he was the highest unsigned draftee from the 2016 draft class, as he spurned the Pittsburgh Pirates to head to college instead...just in case you needed any additional reason to like the kid.
Finally, the Reds have alternated wins and losses for 11 consecutive games, as Former Fearless Leader Joel Luckhaupt relayed earlier on Twitter dot com. This team has obviously seemed to start clicking more offensively of late, but that still hasn’t translated into a string of victories that their overall play suggests probably should’ve happened by now, so hopefully that’s something they can change beginning as early as...today, perhaps?Positively

My route to university was through Sixth Form and completing my A-Levels in English, Business and History. I always had a passion for English and knew that I wanted a career that involved Literature and the aspects of English I enjoyed. However, not having a clear sense of what career path I wanted to follow before and during some of
I studied English as an undergraduate degree. My university course consists of a lot of reading and communicating. Although, some people often don’t value the importance of English and how it is fundamental to learning in education and working life. This is one of the reasons that I wanted to study English and now go on to teach the subject. I had heard about the Students in Classrooms scheme in passing throughout my degree and after hearing about this scheme again in my third year, I bit the bullet and applied for it as I wanted to confirm that teaching was truly the career path I wanted to follow.
I had little experience in the classroom. I had previously been a reading mentor in
What have you learned from your role?
It helped me to see first-hand the roles and responsibilities of a teacher without actually having that title. This scheme confirmed for definite that my aspiration of becoming a teacher was exactly what I wanted to do. It allowed me to work and help younger children, and truly see how my actions can help someone improve academically and personally. Also, from this role I realised how much I can learn from children and vice versa, it is amazing how much you can learn. At first, it was daunting being in a classroom and working amongst young people but this scheme helped me build my confidence in a school environment as well as helping me develop many other skills.
So if you are thinking of teaching I would one hundred percent recommend this role, honestly I wish I have had done it sooner.
For the next academic year, I will be doing a School’s Direct programme ran by NTU. It will allow me to spend the majority of the next year observing and teaching lessons within a school environment that will help me develop my skillset even further. Without having done the students in classrooms programme in my final year, I believe that I would not have had the skill set nor the experience to be able to work within a secondary school. It helped build my confidence and communication around young people and it also helped me realise my potential as a teacher and as a role model. It will be a challenge and not everything will always be perfect no matter how much you organise and plan. It can be frustrating at times but the reward and satisfaction you get from knowing that you helped someone is so worth it. So if you are thinking of teaching, I would one hundred

Stuffy industry types call them personalized weapons, but everyone else just calls them smart guns.
Most smart-gun prototypes so far have depended on biometrics (voice, palm, or fingerprint scans) to verify the owner, but none have made it to production. With the possibility of sweat or blood blocking a sensor, dependability remains a concern.
That's why German gun-maker Armatix took a different approach with its iP1 smart gun (above). The first production smart gun to be marketed in the United States, the $1,800 iP1 uses radio-frequency identification to safeguard the weapon: As soon as the gun loses radio contact with its accompanying wristwatch, it automatically deactivates.
The main purpose of smart guns is safety. Records kept by the Centers for Disease Control from 2013 (some of the most recent collated information) show 505 accidental gunshot deaths in the U.S. for that year. And according to Johns Hopkins University, unintentional shootings are among the most preventable forms of gun violence. Presumably, smart guns could also deter gun theft and even protect police officers who lose their gun in a tussle.
But finding support for smart guns in America isn't as easy as it would seem. First, there's the politics. The National Rifle Association is notoriously prickly when it comes to anyone intervening in the gun market, so even safety technology is viewed as a potential threat. In fact, the only store to carry the iP1 stopped selling it last year after receiving hate mail and an arson threat from gun-rights activists.
Part of the reason for these fears is one tactless law. In 2002 New Jersey passed the Childproof Handgun Law, mandating that gun sellers sell only personalized weapons in the state once there are smart-gun products for sale. This all-or-nothing approach has been polarizing, so now the same politicians who passed the law are discussing how to repeal it in favor of tax incentives that promote smart guns.
Aside from politics, there's also the much larger issue: Smart guns just might not make sense. The iP1, for example, accepts only .22 LR ammunition, which is fine for target shooting but is too low a caliber for most who prize self-defense. It's also $1,800—you could buy a trio of new .40-caliber Glocks for that.
Armatix says it's working on larger caliber versions of its pistols, and as with any new technology, prices tend to come down. But street credentials still matter, and that might come only from professionals. "The holy grail of smart guns is a large purchase order from a law-enforcement agency," says Stephen Teret, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Law and the Public's Health.
If lawmen adopt a firearm, it means they feel it's reliable enough for real-world use. Then the industry will follow. This is how the Colt .45 Peacemaker dominated the market in 1830—by first selling to the Texas Rangers and then marketing to stagecoach riders. Until this happens, though, don't expect to see a smart gun at your local gun shop anytime soon.
HOW IT WORKS: ARMATIX IP1
Firing .22 LR bullets from a ten-round chamber, the iP1 relies on a linked rechargeable wrist-worn watch for activation. Communication between the watch and weapon are at radio frequencies that are resistant to interference.
The pistol has a blocking pin that will only move when it receives an authorization signal from the watch. At more than fifteen inches of separation between the two, the pin moves back into place and the gun won't fire.
The watch requires a personal identification number before the authorization signal is sent. If the PIN is correct, "good" appears on the display, which also shows charge levels for the gun and watch.Artículos de revistas

Abstract
cesar.carrera@bcrp.gob.peThe exchange rate is one of the most important prices in any open economy. Tracking deviations from its long-run value may provide important information for policymakers. One way to track such deviations is to examine numerical patterns in exchange rates to see if the patterns appear to have been subject to some degree of policy management. Following this approach, we use Benford’s Law as our base case for free-floating exchange rates. Benford’s Law argues that the frequence of the appearance of numerals finds 1’s more frequent, than 2’s, than 3’s, etc., and this established statistical patterns has been verified and used in research tests in many scientific fields. We apply our forensic approach to exchange rates, computing the distribution of exchange-rate observed values and comparing them with those of Benford’s Law. We document such cases for 15 Latin American countries. Latin American countries are small open economies that are characterized for having different degrees of dollarization and intervention in the forex market, primary based on US dollar transactions. This is an alternative view of how these characteristics play a role with respect to an implied equilibrium exchange rate.Nirbhaya's 3rd Death Anniversary, Juvenile Culprit Being Set Free

"On her third anniversary, the culprit is being set free. Where is the justice in that? Does her sacrifice deserve this, justice has been denied "said the unfortunate mother Asha Devi with raw pain, of the 23 year old medical student gang-raped and tortured on a moving bus in Delhi.
The visibly heartbroken mother addressing public gathering remembering her daughter as ‘Nirbhaya Chetna Divas' at Jantar Mantar said "I don't know whether he is 16 or 18. I only know that when the crime is so brutal, there should be no age limit for punishment. The case is stuck in the Supreme Court for the last one year the system has failed on us"
Further urging the bereaved father Badrinath said “For us he is the killer of our daughter who is being set free despite his heinous crime. We demand that he should not be released, show us his face. We have failed in getting her justice, we have tried but to no avail, maybe they will listen to you (the crowd)".
The two hour long remembrance Day was attended by many social activist and political dignitaries along with the parents. Which includes Delhi Congress member Sharmistha Mukhurjee, Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) Swati Maliwal, former top cop turned politico Kiran Bedi, Former DCW chief Barkha Singh among others.
One more victim mother whose daughter was also gang raped in Delhi but none of the accused have been arrested said breaking down “My daughter would have been here if there was justice to Nirbhaya. I want my daughter back, hang the rapists which is their right place. People need to fear the law which they do not right now.”
Kiran Bedi on the occasion said “Charity begins at home, there are many cases of sexual harassment and misconduct in the families these days, which has to be stopped.”
DCW Chief Swati Maliwal said “I appeal to the Central government to utilize Rs 3,000 crore of Nirbhaya fund for making high quality “Nirbhaya” forensic labs across country. The fast track courts are not working they need to deliver justice. The real remembrance to Nirbhaya will only be when 1,500 rape cases pending in the courts are solved. This injustice is a national shame.”
The controversial movie “India’s daughter” was also shown to the present gathering at the spot and in tribute to their daughter, who died 13 days after the incident on December 16, 2012 two minute silence was observed to remember the victim.
The Centre on Monday asked the High Court to extend the observation home stay of the convict, saying it needs clarity on his rehabilitation plan.. Four other convicts have been sentenced to death and a fifth was found dead in prison.
Meanwhile, Maliwal with the aim of working closely to make Delhi more women friendly has written a letter to the Minister of Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi saying that “rapes are continuing unabated in Delhi every day, the Commission is receiving cases of brutal rapes even of minors some aged as low as 2 years old. A 4-year old child in Delhi was recently in a critical condition after being raped brutally. I strongly propose the use of the Nirbhaya Fund for installation of CCTV cameras in all police stations of the country starting from Delhi. I strongly urge you to kindly ensure the release of the Nirbhaya Fund from the bureaucratic procedures it is presently embroiled in” Maliwal said in a statement”ALL OUR GAMES

Scouting & Community Center Inc.
Honoring the Past-Nurturing the future
In 2003 a Number of Ashburnham citizens formed a group to address two problems. The first was the condition of the memorial for William J. Bresnahan, a Marine, and an Eagle Scout, from Ashburnham that was killed May 26, 1967 fighting for his country in the Vietnam War. The second problem was the deteriorating condition of the scout house building on River Street, near the center of town.
SINCE THIS TIME THE William J. Bresnahan Scouting and Community Center Building Committee, appointed by the Selectmen, have been involved in numerous fundraising efforts, including raffles, memorial brick sales, dinners and yard sales, Hamburg and hot dog concessions, to raise the monies to erect a new building and establish a more fitting memorial for PFC Wm. Bresnahan. We have not taken any funds from the Town of Ashburnham.
Our small town has always had a large Scouting community, and a wonderful group of leaders, but the scout house use for meeting was deteriorated by powder post beetles that ate away the main supports of the building. The building was inadequate without bathroom or heat, but it was their very own. And they were happy there, until it was unsafe for them to be there. We hoped to have a center built for this year, but the economy bottoming out has made this an uphill battle.
We are a committee of thirteen people known as The Wm. J. Bresnahan Scouting and Community Center Inc., bonded together for the sole purpose of preserving the scouting way of training our young Americans.
We have established a trust, a 501-C Non-profit Corporation, in order to continue with our plans to raise the new building and maintain it for years to come. To date we have raised just over half of the project cost of the materials for the center, and all of our efforts are volunteered, so all our funds are only for the building project.
Some of our funds have come from private donations and from generous groups. We have also received many offers from companies, clubs and private individuals that want to contribute their time, services and materials to our cause. Can you donate to our cause?
We are always looking for more volunteers. Please feel free to contact us if you have an interest in being part of this project.Login and Registration

Jim Grey is interviewing the likes of Fuzzy and Jack but the audio quality is terrible! I’m an old audio pro and I know what a bad microphone cable sounds like. Someone fix that cable!
I think the audio that is being picked up is just from the camera. The handheld mic is not making a difference and there is a lot of ambient noise.
UPDATE: I figured it out. Jim Grey had a lapel mic on his collar. That was the one that was picking up the audio, not the handheld. And it sounded like there was a short in the cable too.
That was going on with another tournament I was watching last week too. It sounded the same as the one you posted about.V.

Updated: Nov 10, 2020
Happy Thursday!! I am so grateful it's a sunny day today, the cloud and rain made for an unmotivated day yesterday!! Last week on Instagram, I shared an easy wine slush as a way of maybe changing up your weekend drink. I've had some people message me this week about the recipe, so I thought I would share it on a post! It's so easy and so refreshing!
Here lately we have been just buying the Black Box Wine, we have found that if we don't want to finish a bottle it won't go to waste. And it's pretty cost-efficient too! We have tried most of the black boxes and have really liked the sauvignon blanc and the chardonnay isn't bad either! It's been nice to have one in the fridge during this time to just have one glass on a random Thursday night. Usually, we don't drink unless it's Friday or Saturday during normal times, but since it's been different times during this stay at home order, the black box has come in handy!
So for my wine slush, I did a two to one ratio. One cup of the wine of your choice, you could do champagne, prosecco, or even flavored sparkling water for a non-alcoholic version! And then add in two cups of your favorite frozen fruit. I used strawberries! It could be pineapple, mango, blueberries, peaches! Anything! I put all of the ingredients into my Vitamix blender and blend until smooth. You could add in a touch of sugar for a little bit more sweetness. I got these stemless wine glasses from Target, I usually let the kids use them for fun drinks or to make yogurt parfaits!
Wine Slush
1 c. wine of your choice, I used Sauvignon Blanc
2 c. of frozen fruit of your choice, I used strawberries. Or use fresh fruit and add ice
Blend in blender until smooth, pour in a pretty glass, and garnish with your favorite fruit!
hat | top | patio chair, on sale and I love how my kids can sit on them and I don't worry about them messing them up!
Go out to your porch or deck and Enjoy!! Have a great day!

Good news for gaming loverIt’s time to saddle up for a Hollywood-style dine and dance event benefiting an area animal sanctuary and a haven for some of the most desperate children in need of a safe place to heal.
The 4th Annual Saddle Up – Hollywood Style is happening next month as a charity event for Ranch Hand Rescue in Argyle.
The event is happening November 14 at the Austin Ranch in Grapevine. It will be hosted by Doris Roberts of “Everybody Loves Raymond” fame, with FOX 4’s Mike Doocy and honorary chairs Sheriff Will and Shelley Travis.
Ranch Hand Rescue’s mission is to save abused and neglected farm animals with a special focus on animals requiring critical care, to adopt out rehabilitated animals, and to provide a caring sanctuary for animals that have ongoing needs.
The other arm of RHR is a counseling center that helps people with personal, mental and psychological challenges through equine/animal-assisted counseling.
RHR founder Bob Williams said this is the biggest fundraiser of the year for the organization, which is funded through grants and donations. Services are offered free to children and battered women. Some clients can afford therapy and those funds help offset the nonpaid clients.
Dinner, dancing and a live show will also feature two time Grammy nominee Karina Nuvo, “Jilly,” Joey Santos, Angel Bonilla, Jack Betts and Carly & Katie Haynes.
The event was such a success last year that they needed a larger venue this year, Williams said. The group hopes to sell 450 tickets. Last year 380 flew off the shelves.
Williams said RHR is hoping to raise $150,000 to go toward a new facility in Denton.
“It’s going to be a great dinner and a great show,” he said. “We ever want to turn away a child or a woman who has been through what they’ve been through.”
Tickets are only available online, but checks for payment can be mailed in if needed.
Diamond table packages are available for a $10,000 donation. Platinum table seats are $7,500; gold table seats are $5,000; silver table seats are $2,500; and bronze table seats are $1,500.
RHR has a clinical director and five counselors, each with their own specialty. The group has recently begun offering counseling to veterans and their families.2

The website holds profiles of community members whose lives are impacted by the 34th Avenue Open Street: people who lost work and creatively pivoted to sustain their livelihoods; people who are forming new friendships and connecting to their neighborhood more deeply than ever; people who are reimagining the city's streetscape and rethinking post-pandemic New York City.
The project is spearheaded by Bridget Bartolini, an incoming Public Humanities Fellow at SOF/Heyman. This project is supported by a Public Humanities Grant from Humanities New York, the Humanities in Practice Initiative of the Society of Fellows/Heyman Center for the Humanities at Columbia University, and The Laundromat Project's Creative Action Fund.Not only are Toolroom known for supporting the hottest artists at the moment, they’re also doing their bit to build future generations of incredible producers. Their educational arm, Toolroom Academy, offers industry-standard courses for new artists, taught by some of Toolroom’s most respected artists.
With the release of the Toolroom Tech House sample pack on Loopcloud, we asked the team at Toolroom a few questions to learn more about the Toolroom Academy, what it takes to make it as a producer, and ‘that Toolroom sound’. James Hurr is a key part of the story of Toolroom - check out our interview with him on the Loopcloud blog.
The initial idea behind the pack was to create a pack that entirely represented the ‘Toolroom sound’, a phrase that’s been passed around for years within the Toolroom producer community. With this concept in mind, we approached the current roster at the time and spoke to an artist from each corner of the label. Siege provided the Techno sound, James Hurr provided viding Tech House, and Mark brought both genres together.
To put it into words, it essentially means;
Great production, chunky drums, high energy, and a classic tech house sensibility… Not too leftfield, not too commercial, but somewhere in-between.
In this instance where each artist brought a slightly different sound to the pack, we wanted them to work on their own loops independently. We believe that variety is key to a successful pack.
Siege: I used my Mac Mini with Ableton and some of Ableton’s stock plugins like Operator for bass. My favourite synth is Sylenth1 and I used it for some of the synth sounds along with the Behringer Neutron.
James Hurr: I use Cubase as my main DAW, and my only outboard gear (if you can call it that) is the UAD Apollo Twin. My favourite plugins are Soundtoys Crystalizer, Sonnox Inflator, Sonnox Transmod, Soundtoys Echoboy, Waves 2-Tap Delay, Quadrafuzz (Cubase), Multiband Envelope Shaper (Cubase). Most drum sounds have a funk sample or drum machine tucked in there somewhere. The 909 and 808 drums are the backbone of most samples to give them a real punch.
We spoke to James Hurr at length about his studio set up in our interview with him, learn more here.
It comes down to a number of things. Creativity is a large component of what we look for within demos, so definitely focus your efforts on creating something different or ‘out of the box’. Also, at the Toolroom Academy we often talk about how sample selection is one of the most important elements of production, so surprise us! Of course, strong production is definitely super important too, but ultimately, it’s the idea that we’re interested in.
The Toolroom Academy is the boutique educational arm of Toolroom Records. We’re unique as a production school, in that you’re learning from people inside the music industry. Our programmes have been designed by our A&R team, meaning they are cutting-edge, relevant to today’s music scene, and based around the idea of getting label-ready.
You’re taught by real artists – people who have seen real success as producers, and who are now passing it on to the next generation. We only teach house, tech house and techno, meaning the learning experience is genre-specific and hyper-focused. We push our students hard in our programmes, but we believe the results speak for themselves.
Ben Remember is a key part of the Toolroom Academy. Ben has released some amazing music on Toolroom, alongside being a studio engineer and soundtrack composer. But he also has real empathy and understanding of our students, as he himself took several years of blood, sweat and tears to break through into the scene as an artist in his own right. He’s a naturally gifted communicator, able to distil complicated production techniques into jargon-free language.
D.Ramirez is another amazing tutor we are proud to work with. A Grammy-nominated, genre-defining artist, he’s revered in the production world for his deep musical knowledge.
There are lots of other artists who’ve also shot amazing one-off production tutorials for us, from the likes of Shadowchild, Josh Butler and Harry Romero, and of course the boss Mark Knight!
It’s hard to give a single answer here, as ultimately success comes from doing a lot of different things right! But if we were to drill down to one thing, we’d say to really focus on understanding where you want to position yourself. Oftentimes, new producers have too much of a scattergun approach. If you compare breaking through into the scene as punching through a wall, you wouldn’t punch in different places – you’d hit the same spot, over again. With breaking through into the scene, you need to arrive as an artist with a defined sound, a clear idea of your target labels and your target DJs who’ll play your music - and a consistency and relentlessness in achieving this. This gives you a solid platform from which you can succeed and grow your career in electronic music.
We are online-based, so students log-in to live webinars each week to join an interactive production session. For those who can’t make it, they can watch it back at any time. Assignments are set immediately after the lesson, and generally due the following week.
The programmes follow the pattern of Lesson-Assignment-Feedback, during which we build a track together, leading towards formal A&R submission to Toolroom. You’re part of a small class, and one of the great things about the Toolroom Academy is the connections made by like-minded students. The fact we’re online means we’re truly international – we’re proud to say we’ve had students from all over the world, all sharing a love of wanting to write amazing house music, and to maximise their creative potential.
Our taught programmes involve A&R feedback at their core. Specifically, the Production Certificate, Creativity Unlocked, Club Ready and the Masterclass. In each, the assignments are set after an interactive production lesson, and the assignment will be based on the topic covered that week. The student then receives very granular A&R feedback on that assignment.
Over the course of each programme, we’re building a track with you, giving you constructive advice each step of the way. After 15 years at Toolroom, it’s safe to say our A&R team know how to analyse music, so the feedback is always constructive and based on the real-life experience of running a renowned record label.
There are so many fantastic former students in our Alumni community. We actually have an official Alumni Group, for whom we run regular exclusive production lessons and A&R feedback sessions. It’s a close-knit group of ambitious and talented people, all looking to support one another. Some recent success stories include:
Redux Saints – who have created a very successful brand in his own right with DTLA, and has just achieved a signing to Toolroom.

RejuvaSeal’s emulsion-like form makes it easy to apply.
Application rate
RejuvaSeal’s optimal application rate is dependent on pavement design, age and existing pavement condition. A test patch should be completed 24 hours prior to application to determine the optimal rate. In general:
In the eastern hemisphere, where application is figured by weight;
- Average rate for roadways: approximately 4-5m²/kg
- Average rate for aircraft runways: approximately 3m²/kg
In the western hemisphere, where application is figured by volume;
- Average rate for all applications: 3.4 sq meters per liter (15 sq yds per gallon)
Machine application
For applications covering a large surface area, RejuvaSeal can be applied with a precision spraying machine such as a DESCO D200. This compact machine contains a computer-controlled flow rate to ensure uniform application of the material. As a point of reference, a DESCO D200 can treat an area of approximately 5,000 – 8,000 m² per hour.
Manual application
For smaller areas, RejuvaSeal can also be applied manually using simple roller-brushes. A site area of approximately 50 – 75 m² per hour (per person) can be treated using this method.
Conditions for application
RejuvaSeal should be applied to pavements before they begin to show the deleterious signs of age. The surface must be clean and dry with a surface temperature of 10°C(50°F) or above. Depending on weather condition and porosity of the asphalt surface, RefuvaSeal usually takes about 4 to 8 hours to dry.Our services teams combine unparalleled industry expertise, market-leading AI technology and data to help solve your biggest social advertising and creative production challenges.

From this letter, Keith learns that her purchase was assembled and packaged by a man named Sun Yi, imprisoned for campaigning for freedom to join a forbidden meditation movement, Falun Gong. In the note, Sun details how political prisoners work 15-hour days without a Saturday or Sunday break and make only 10 yuan each month, or about $1.55. Sun writes that if the prisoners do not comply with working in these conditions, they will be verbally and physically assaulted.
In telling Sun Yi’s story, Pang, an investigative journalist, steps back and analyzes problems in the global consumer supply chain, which is a conversation she believes is neglected.
“There hasn’t been much exploration into why it’s so easy for something that’s manufactured in a labor camp from China to end up selling in American stores,” Pang said in a recent phone interview. “I really wanted to look at some of the core issues and some of the factors that were driving Chinese factories to outsource work to forced labor.”
Pang wrote it with the intention of making consumers aware of what goes on in the supply chain so more people can hold corporations accountable in the sustainability and transparency sector.
“Most companies have a sustainability page these days, or a corporate responsibility page, and a lot of them look like they’re good sustainability pages,” she said.
“(They) may list factories, but what is the actual relationship with those factories? How are (they) sourcing from them? Are (they) actually giving them enough time to make those products and are (they) actually paying them enough? It’s up to consumers to push to create that next level of transparency.”
For “Made in China,” Pang spent three years immersed in stories from labor-camp survivors, she writes.
Pang is an award-winning investigative journalist who has been published in the New York Times Sunday Review, Mother Jones and the New Republic. She once went undercover to work at a Chinese buffet while posing as an undocumented immigrant. She wrote about her experience and her findings, which she says gave her insight into more recent projects.
For truthdig.com, she said of a restaurant in Georgia:
“The bussers have no base salary. We only take home tips. Because it is a buffet, my interactions with customers are limited to refilling drinks and removing plates. We usually get $1 or $2 per table, or sometimes no tips at all.”
Latest Books & Literature
An immigrant tells her, “I regret coming to the U.S.” Within three days, Pang had enough and left Georgia.
“Most of the workers there were undocumented Chinese,” Pang says. “They were paid very poorly, and living conditions were pretty awful. The working conditions were kind of grueling, too. It just comes to show, whenever anything is really really cheap, whether it’s unlimited all-you-can-eat seafood buffet, or just the extremely cheap products we’re getting from places like Kmart, there’s a human cost behind it.”

Burris Optics has a reputation of making good quality scopes right here in the USA. I decided to perform a review on one of their newer scopes that they have been pushing hard. I was originally looking for a 6x40mm scope suitable for tactical use. I ended up getting a Fullfield II 3-9x40mm with the ballistic plex reticule.
The Fullfield II line of scopes is Burris’ mainstream line of scopes. The Signature series is their flagship/high end line of scopes. If you go straight off the spec sheet, the Fullfield II line of scopes appears to be a bargain. They claim 95% light transmission, Nitrogen filled (purged and filled 24 times), lifetime (forever) warranty, and “quad seals” vs. O-rings. I’m not sure if quad rings is better then O-rings, or if purging and filling the tube 24 times makes a difference, but what I do know is that the quality of glass that I look through with this scope is excellent!
First, the optics. The actual clarity of the scope and light transmission is on par with scopes of much higher price. Comparing directly with a Leupold Mk4 M3 10x, the clarity is not quite as good across the whole spectrum, but it is not far behind either. It is much better than other $200-$300 scopes. The light gathering is excellent, the specs say it has 95% light transmission with these lenses, and to get to that level with other manufacturers, you have to bump up to their top of the line scopes. During an early morning evaluation (hour before sun up) I compared it again side by side with the Leupold Mk4. The light gathering was nearly on par with the top of the line Leupold. Both were excellent and the slightly better clarity of the Leupold seemed to help the perception of light gathering to put it ahead of the Burris. In terms of optics quality, the Burris performed very well.
The Fullfield II comes with lens caps, but its a single unit that covers both lenses (see picture above). Its adequate for storage, but I would rather have Butler Creek flip ups, and I will be getting some soon.
The windage and elevation adjustments are hand tunable, but are not target knobs. They are designed so they can be read while behind the scope, which is nice, but I have yet to find a way to “slip” the turrets once zeroed, which is preferred for tactical use. The adjustments are crisp with both feel and audio clicks. I have yet to have any problems with the adjustments, I just wish they were more of a target turret style, even a low profile design would work. Combined with the ballistic plex, the adjustments work well enough. These adjustments are steel on steel, which is by far the preferred way. Some manufactures use brass or nylon, and these softer materials wear out and the adjustments lose their precision over time. Steel lasts much better.
I specifically chose the ballistic plex reticule in order to test the feasibility of using this reticule in a tactical environment. The idea of the reticule is simple. Simply create marks that represent bullet path at 100,200,300,400 and 500 yards. The hard part is picking WHICH bullet path to match! Burris has selected a path that gets close to as many loads as possible. For serious long range shooting, one would have to then record the exact differences your particular load would have vs. the reticule. i.e. At 200 yards you may have to go up 1 click, at 300 up 4 clicks at 400 only up 2 clicks. Etc. Is it ideal? No, it is not, but it drastically reduces your comeup adjustments, and in a pinch, just shooting at the proper tick mark will get you pretty dang close on the target for your chosen load. I mounted the scope on a .223, and I chose the standard 55gr FMJ-BT bullet (M193) and the reticule matches the flight very well, and this held up in long-range trials. Of course, the reticule only adjusts you out to 500 yards. Beyond that, no joy. This fits the .223 very well, as it is no good beyond 500 anyway. My overall impression is that this reticule is ideally suited to law enforcement use, where typical shots are sub 100 yards where you could zero the scope as you would normally, but yet the reticule would be useful in those rare occasions where you would need to engage further out, beyond where you normally practice.
To conclude, I am impressed with the Fullfield II 3-9 scope, and I plan to further try out some other models in the future. I have no reservations recommending this scope for use. I’d prefer target knobs, and one nice thing about Burris, is you can send in your scope and $80 and they will put target knobs on it. This is possible with any of the Burris scopes. I may yet end up doing this with this scope. The optical quality was a pleasant surprise and the scopes are well made.On a large platter clean cutting board or table covered with butcher paper arrange fruits and vegetables in the shape of the iconic treat.

Source: Sky News
According to this report in today’s media, Vitamin C might be a viable defence against the dreaded Covid-19 virus. And what better way to load up on the bug-buster than with chilli.
Science reckons that 100g of fresh chilli (red or green) will give us around a whopping 230% of our vitamin C RDA.
With regard to Covid-19 directly, well research is still underway, trials are ongoing (and likely to be for some while), and there is no hard evidence to support the efforts being made by the New York Doctors who are prescribing large doses of Vit C.
That said, any excuse to load up on our beloved chillies is welcome, and it can only benefit our industry if the tests prove positive.Action planet Mars is currently moving through its natural home of confident, impulsive Aries, and this week you might notice it pushing you to move fast, to treat every moment with urgency, to jump to conclusions and jump into action. But this week, remember to listen to the quieter, steadier parts of yourself, too. Now is not the time to be rushed, by other people or your own anxieties, into thinking that everything must happen immediately. It’s important to remember the long game, too.
Aries Weekly Horoscope
This is a week for learning, or remembering, how to really love yourself. It’s a week for believing, or trying to believe, that you matter and that you’re enough. In the face of the chaos happening all around you, it can seem silly, even wasteful, to talk like this, but that doesn’t mean it’s not true. No amount of personal shame will mend the world. Telling yourself you’re inadequate won’t make you stronger or braver or more ready to show up and fight. So this week, try loving yourself instead, and seeing what magic blossoms from there.
Taurus Weekly Horoscope
When the world is frightening and the future unclear, it’s natural to find yourself wanting to store away as many good things as you can. It’s logical that you’d want to hold on tight — not just to your things, but also your energy, your ideas, your love, in case you need them more later on than you need it right now. But this week is not a week for hoarding; instead, try using what you have. Don’t let your energy go stagnant, don’t let your ideas grow old and stale, locked up in your head. The more you use your powers, the more they’ll grow.
Gemini Weekly Horoscope
This week, give yourself permission to do fewer things — to take on fewer tasks, commit to fewer projects, to reduce the workload you give to yourself. This can feel unnatural at first; it can feel like you’re shirking your duties, or like you’re letting your talents go to waste. But when you narrow your focus, when you’re a little more selective about what you agree to right now, you’ll find that you can do things with care, with style, with a sense of completion. This week, you can be wonderful and you can work real magic, but you can’t be everything, and there’s nothing wrong with that.
Cancer Weekly Horoscope
It can feel as though you’ve been waiting forever for a sign, for some clear and undeniable indication that your choices are right, that your ideas are good, that this is the time to act on them. But it’s crucial that you remember you don’t actually need to wait for the perfect opportunity, and you don’t need to wait for anybody’s permission. Now is the time for making your own choices, for calling your own shots, for living like you’re not a bystander or a trespasser to your own life, but the leader, the center, the sun itself.
Leo Weekly Horoscope
It’s an unbearable truth — but true nonetheless — that there really are people who would have you hide the best parts of yourself, who would have you blunt your power and dull your shine. And even when you know that they’re wrong, their voices can nag at the back of your thoughts, haunting you. This week, remember what a beautiful thing it is to be as powerful and bright as you are. Remember that when you shine, you’re not only doing it for yourself, but you’re lighting other people’s way, too.
Virgo Weekly Horoscope
The world can trick you into thinking that safety lies in striving towards total invulnerability — in refusing to let yourself ever get anything wrong, or show any signs of weakness, or stumble even once. This week, though, consider that you might find safety not in perfection, but in community — in building a world where people look out for each other, where you can make mistakes without being abandoned. Instead of working to bolster all your personal defenses this week, focus instead on connecting with other people, on doing what you can to build a world worth living in.
Libra Weekly Horoscope
This is a week for giving your anger its due — a week to really hold it, to live with it, to feel its sharp heat. This is a week for letting yourself acknowledge, even when it hurts, how much you really do have to be angry about, how much has been taken from you, how much more you’ve always deserved. You’re right to sometimes be wary of your rage — it can run away from you, it can crash around hitting all the wrong targets — but sometimes you just have to feel it, and let it remind you why you’re fighting, let it fuel you.
Scorpio Weekly Horoscope
You’re so sharp and observant that it can sometimes feel like you can see right into other people’s hearts. Because you’re so skilled at finding hidden truths, it’s easy to imagine that you know everything, that the world can keep no secrets from you. But this is a week to remember that other people still hold mysteries — that they have motivations and dreams and secrets that remain invisible to you. It’s a week to remember that the world can, in fact, still surprise you — sometimes with its darkness, but more often with moments of unexpected, unbelievable sweetness.
Sagittarius Weekly Horoscope
You’re accustomed to finding purpose in movement. It can be so much harder, so much less immediately rewarding, to instead find the meaning that hides in stillness, in repetition, in routine. But this week, this is likely where the greatest rewards will be found. Try not to rush through every moment that’s offered to you; try not to sleepwalk through days that feel the same, assuming that real life is happening somewhere far away. There’s enough purpose and beauty to sustain you, right here, if you’re willing to look for it.
Capricorn Weekly Horoscope
This is a week to look for chances to be creative. It’s a week to pay attention to the fire that’s burning hot inside you, to the song that wants to be sung, to the dream that wants to be made real. It’s so easy to tell yourself that this is a time for survival, not inspiration, or that you should be planning right now, not dreaming. But this week, it’s important that you not shut down your own avenues for creativity, for beauty, for feeling. All these things are necessary for survival, for security, for world-building, too.
Aquarius Weekly Horoscope
No matter how much you value generosity, it can sometimes feel difficult to put others first, to act with open unselfishness. Sometimes the world’s problems just feel too urgent; sometimes your own thoughts just weigh too heavily. It’s a constant effort, a constant practice, to remain open and loving in spite of everything. This week, if remaining generous in your thoughts and feelings feels like too much, remember that you can still be generous in your small and everyday actions. You can still offer care, even if you can’t control all your unruly thoughts. .
Pisces Weekly Horoscope
This week, the best thing you can do is to find a way to be less reliant on other people’s opinions of you. Other people’s feelings matter, but they aren’t the final gauge of your own worthiness. Other people’s respect and approval matters, too, but that doesn’t mean they can determine for you what kind of person you should be. No matter how much you want to be seen, to be known, to be loved, this isn’t a week to let those desires determine your course of action. This is a week to rely less on other people’s opinions, and more on your own.

Once conmen have bought these details they pretend to offer compensation for the data breach before asking for victims’ bank account details.
Some send emails with a message including a link that claims to direct victims to an official website.
But clicking on the link merely enables conmen to take over the victim’s computer and gain access to their bank account.
A cyber-crime officer said: “The fraudsters look for victims o their 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s.
“Some of the conmen have call centre training which means they sound genuine when they call up pretending to be from a telecoms company.”
A Met Police spokesman said: “We are aware data stolen from TalkTalk had surfaced on the internet or criminal forums and have already taken proactive steps to remove any data where possible.” scam gift voucher & product offers on social networking sites SCAMwatch is warning social networking users to beware of scam posts which offer fake gift vouchers or products for free. 4 Nov 2011 Pagination Current page 1 Page 2 Next page ›› › Last page Last » Scam category Attempts to gain your personal information 25 Buying or selling 18 Dating & romance 5 Fake charities 6 Investments 7 Betting & sports investment scams 2 Investment scams 7 Other business, employment & investment scams 2 Jobs & employment 3 Jobs & employment scams 3 Pyramid schemes 2 Threats & extortion 6 Unexpected money 7 Travel, prizes and lottery scams 7 Unexpected prize & lottery scams 5 Travel, prizes and lottery scams 6 Travel prize scams 2 Scratchie scams 3 Other scams 3 Date 2021 3 2020 7 2018 2 2017 2 2016 4 2015 3 2014 6 2013 5 2012 7 2011 5 2010 11 2009 12 2008 5 2007 5 2006 3 News type Media releases 12 Radar alerts 11 Features 4 SubscribeEstee Lauder Pure Color Matte Sculpting Lipstick & Liquid Lip Potion for Fall 2015

Cool! Can’t wait to see lip swatches!
awesome! Estee Lauder has really solid products and I’m glad to see they’re doing some more unusual colors.
The description of the formula of the Liquid-Lip-Potion remind me of Too Faced Melted and Joe Fresh long wear liquid lipstick. Both dry down to a satin-matte finish..
It feels like a lip stain once it’s dried down so it’s lighter in texture (at least when I tried it) than the too faced melted lacquer.
Beautiful. If I could get the top row of four colors in an eyeshadow palette, I’d be a happy camper!
Eyeing the purples!
Same. I’m looking so forward to the reviews for these!
Wohoooooooo
The liquid ones I’m really waiting on… but those mattes. Yea. I MAY have just ordered all of them. MAYBE. Sort of…
Yea I did. LOL
I grabbed three to see how they are, then I’ll consider the rest (I don’t have time to test all the shades right this second anyway, so they’d probably sit!), and hoping for the liquid ones to show up at Sephora… EL shipping is too slow!
Agreed! About a week I’ve noticed, even on priority orders. I’m waiting until I see more reviews of before I take the plunge on the liquid ones… plus the colors that I want the MOST are ones that aren’t available yet.
Ok first thought? Purple lipstick has OFFICIALLY gone Mainstream!
YESSS !!! I love purple lipstick and with more brands doing them, hoping for better formulas and more colors
I need them all *.*
Love from Germany
Mimi
I hope some of these do better than “Reckless”. Pretty colors and I love the other Pure Color envy lipsticks by lauder.
I have a feeling that the Matte Sculpting Lipsticks are going to be really nice! And also very curious to see how the liquid lipsticks do, too, as “satin matte” sounds more comfortable than all the other liquid mattes on the market of late.
Branching out into purples! Brilliant *g*
These are looking promising.
Oh, my, aren’t these pretty. I wonder how well they pull off those deep purples.
Some glorious colours here – love the chestnut brown and would love to see the rest of the colours. Looks good.
NOT fond of blue ands purple lipsticks,having been an RN go over 40 years. The color of death. Not pleasant but it’s the way I see it. Sorry.
I’m definitely interested in these. EL has kind of been on top of things lately. I keep meaning to place an order for their eyeshadows. 🙂
I’ve never tried any Estee Lauder lipsticks but I’m excited for these! I already gave a few of the lipsticks on my list and I can’t wait to see some pics and swatches of the liquid lipsticksParamount Bay 808 Amapas (Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, MX - 48333) Built

- I am busy with online consultation as clients are preparing for new year planning.
- I learn a lot from my clients thru their questions. This allows me to see what is going during MCO in terms of their career and family.
- Today I would like to zoom down on 1 single topic & share my thoughts.
- Undoubtedly, females in Malaysian Chinese(MC) society are treated equally & fairly by their men or husbands; as MC practices monogamy.
- However, this is not the case for Muslims, where males could marry more than 1 wife.
- Relatively speaking, Malaysian Chinese women enjoy gender equality in the true sense practically; and Malaysian Chinese men acknowledge this.
- However, strangely but truly, be Chinese speaking or English speaking, be highly educated or medium educated, be urban or rural; there is an unspoken traditional value in Malaysian Chinese mindset as below:
- Comparatively speaking, Malaysian Chinese is NOT open and liberal like Muslims; in marrying a divorcee.
- Muslims are more liberal and open-minded in marrying a divorcee.
- A divorcee is not the 1st, 2nd or 3rd priority for a Malaysian Chinese be male or female to be considered as a legal life partner.
- At least, this is a mutual consensus among Malaysian Chinese from highly educated to medium educated; from upper class to medium class.
- Malaysian Chinese(MC) society looks open-minded and westernized apparently or externally ONLY.
- However, MC is much more conservative than Chinese in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan & even Singapore.
- Men in China taking divorcee as a wife are very common due to China’s destructive gender ratio imbalance. Yet,
- 2nd marriage by abandoning children is NOT blessed in Malaysian Chinese(MC) society.
- MC is very traditional when they come to family matters; regardless of Mandarin-speaking or English speaking.
- No MC man is proud of marrying somebody’s ex-wife.
- This explains why a lot of Malaysian Chinese women find it much harder to get married again after divorcing ex-husbands; compared to Malay female counterparts.
- In this matter, the rights of Muslim women are truly honored because they have ALL the rights to get married again and be encouraged by their society.
- While for Malaysian Chinese female divorcees, they have to face certain unseen social punishment(including rumors) if they wanted to get married.
- Malaysian Chinese divorcees are possibly preyed/victimized by boyfriends or married men for intimate relationships.
- Fortunately, most MC female divorcees pay full attention to their children from the 1st marriage and remain single mothers.
- Therefore, my advice to Malaysian Chinese wives, think twice before divorcing.
- However, you can go ahead with the 2nd marriage if you have 2 superpowers as below:
- Personal Financial Superpower
- Sexual Superpower
- Perhaps you can find an MC man who is willing to trade his marriage/ social respect with your 2 superpowers.
- Nevertheless, make sure the 2 superpowers must be sustained for the next 30 years to come.

(Sarah Fritz/for NewsWorks)
Today was a day of giving back and sprucing up.
The Delaware Center for Horticulture 2017 Regional Intern Outreach Day brought together more than 130 horticulturists, interns, and staffers from fifteen organizations throughout Wilmington and beyond to give some tender loving care to public landscapes.
Wheelbarrows, clippers, and gloves peppered the grounds outside DCH and nearby parks as workers joined forces, in the sweltering heat, to plant, remove weeds, and uncover blooming flowers beneath debris.
The day is designed “to bring interns together, not only as a learning experience, but as an opportunity to give back through service learning,” said Vikram Krishnamurthy, DCH’s Executive Director.
By connecting with experts in the field, as well as each other, the interns also had the opportunity to grow their professional networks, while serving the community in a meaningful way.
Several parks including Wilmington’s Conaty Park, Rattlesnake Run in Brandywine State Park, E.D. Robinson Urban Farm, and the Delaware Center as well as the 9/11 memorial garden benefited from today’s events.Quail Electronics introduced the IEC Auto-Lock, a solution to power source electrical connection.

Big Boss Man dies at Age 41 of a heart attack. photo: wwe.com
1963-2004 (age 41)
Big Boss Man was born in Marietta, Georgia, on May 2, 1963. The wrestler’s real name was Raymond “Ray” W. Traylor, Jr., and he died young at the age of 41.
First WWF tenure
In the mid 80s, Traylor began his wrestling career as the bodyguard to Jim Cornette and was known as “Big Bubba Rogers”. He carried his nightstick and wore his signature blue police shirt. He went on to wrestling fame when he joined the World Wrestling Federation in 1988; remaining with the company (for his first run) until 1993.
Big Boss Man makes his WWF debut on Superstars. He makes short work of a jobber and proceeds to handcuff him to the ropes while beating him mercilessly… not a bad way to start your heel gimmick (June 18, 1988)
Traylor was first introduced as “Big Boss Man” from the WWF. His police gimmick was actually fairly true to life – The Boss Man was a real life former prison guard in Cobb County, Georgia. Managed by Slick, the Boss Man entered the WWF as a heel, feuding and helping get over fan favorites like Hogan and Savage. By 1990, the Boss Man dropped his heel gimmick and began feuding with former Twin Tower partner Akeem, Bobby “The Brain” Heenan, and Nailz.
Boss Man joins WCW, returns to WWF for Attitude era

In 1993, Traylor briefly left WWF for All Japan Pro Westling, and then returned to America for the start of World Championship Wrestling (WCW).
He was in the WCW from 1993 to 1998, first joining as “The Boss” – apparently the WWF didn’t take too kindly to WCW using his familiar moniker and threatened with a lawsuit. Traylor’s character was then changed to The Guardian Angel (yeah, unfortunately it wasn’t very memorable). He did not see much success with his WCW tenure, but his career would eventually turn around.
Following his WCW run, Traylor rejoined the WWF. He once again took on his role as Big Boss Man, but his blue police shirt was swapped out for a SWAT-inspired uniform, all in black, complete with gloves and a bulletproof vest. He sometimes wore a mask to the ring. The updated character was a great fit for the WWF’s edgy Attitude Era.
In his final run with the company, Boss Man was part of Vince McMahon’s original Corporation stable alongside The Rock, Shane McMahon, Pat Patterson, and Gerald Brisco. Mostly involved in the Hardcore division, Boss Man also had an epic feud with Big Show which will probably always be remembered for how far it pushed the limits of the Attitude era – funeral crashing ring a bell??
Big Boss Man returns to the WWF in the late 90s. One of his most memorable feuds was with the Big Show – if any angle took it to the limits of the Attitude era, this one was it (Smackdown – November 11, 1999)
Details about Big Boss Man Death
As with many wrestlers, Traylor passed away at a young age. The cause of the Big Boss Man death was a heart attack, which occurred on September 22, 2004. He died in his sister’s home in Dallas, Georgia. The Big Boss Man was only 41 years old at the time of his death.
The incident happened quickly and was shocking to all who knew Traylor. He was found by his wife, where she had only shortly before left him on the couch at about 10pm. His two children had been upstairs playing, while she had briefly left the room. She returned to find he had passed away. The later investigation into the Big Boss Man death determined he had suffered a massive heart attack.
Jim Cornette and Stone Cold Steve Austin shoot on the Bossman (‘Steve Austin Show Unleashed’ Podcast, 2015)
Traylor left behind two daughters and his wife Angela. He and Angela were childhood sweethearts. At the time of his passing, his daughters were eight and 11.

Death and Young Wrestlers
The sad truth is that many pro wrestlers have died young. The list is long, with Big Boss Man being a notable one. The pro wrestlers around Traylor’s age have passed at a rate that is about ten times that of football players of the same age.
Specifically, professional wrestlers are a shocking 12 times more likely to die from heart disease than other adults in the US between the ages of 25-44. They played larger-than-life characters to the public and died young, before their time.
Sadly, many other professional wrestlers have died young from drug related causes, including accidental overdoses. The WWE has seen the tragic losses of Miss Elizabeth, Road Warrior Hawk, Rick Rude, Test, Mr. Perfect, Umaga, and many more.
Unfortunately the tragedy of wrestling dying young did not stop for the Big Boss Man.
Remembering the Big Boss Man
Ray Traylor has been missed by fans and friends alike. Friends who knew his character’s accent was true to life with “gal dang it” being a part of Traylor’s regular vocabulary.
Boss Man will be most recognized as being part of Hulk Hogan’s era. The 80s was a time when wrestling was gaining mainstream attention and becoming massively popular.
Largely an upper-mid-carder, Big Boss Man had epic battles with Hogan, Andre the Giant, and Macho Man Randy Savage. The guy was incredibly agile in the ring for a big man. In real life, Traylor was a family man with a Southern drawl who died young and suddenly, before he was even 45 years of age. The Big Boss man will be missed.

Big Boss Man Grave
Ray Traylor’s grave is located at Dallas Memory Gardens in Dallas, GA.
In Chris Benoit’s journal, he noted: “As Nancy and I left the church and watched them put Ray’s coffin into the hearse. We both waved goodbye one last time and I thanked him in my heart, and thanked God for putting him in my life and said I love you Ray.”

But what the Knights received was a rude awakening in a 62-47 loss to Bishop Amat.
The Knights (2-1), having to put in a long day leading up to the game as tournament hosts, were outworked on the boards and turned in a cold shooting effort in the loss.
“There was some early-season (mistakes) and we are still a young team,” said Rialto coach Mike Anderson, who has three new starters in his lineup.
Bishop Amat (5-0) finished with 40 rebounds, dominating the offense boards with its share of easy put-backs. Rialto finished with 15 rebounds.
“Defense, we have to work on that,” Rialto’s Janae Sharpe said. “Defense and rebounding. We have to let the game come to us.”
The game got away from Rialto in the second quarter. The Knights led 12-11 after the first but shot 1 for 11 from the floor in the second, turning the ball over eight times and going 0 for 4 from 3-point range.
Bishop Amat found its rhythm during Rialto’s troubles, going on a 15-0 run in the second quarter to build a lead that was never threatened. The Lancers’ Leticia Galarza led the rally by scoring 10 of her team’s 17 second-quarter points.
Galarza finished with a game-high 28 points.
“She was phenomenal,” Bishop Amat coach Richard Wiard said. “She worked well on the inside and the outside.”
Bishop Amat’s tournament MVP Arielle Wideman hit some key shots from the outside, finishing with 20 points.
Rialto continued to struggle in the third quarter when it was outscored 9-1, falling behind 39-19 with four minutes left to play in the third.

Self-Doubt. A too-familiar word that has, at times, held me back from living my dream. It can cripple you, leave you feeling helpless; we have all experienced it from time to time. I know from personal experience, that once the seed of self-doubt starts to grow, it will take over you. Am I good enough? Will you like my songs? Will I sound amazing on stage tonight? Does my hair look weird today? What if I'm terrible? I try my best to fight the negative talk - I have good days and bad. On the good ones I keep my head up, and work towards what my heart is screaming for. And a funny thing happens - I succeed! On the bad days, I let the doubts invade my mind and it gets to me. Then, without surprise, I stall. I don't beat myself up on those days though. Instead, I take the opportunity to learn from them, and move forward - stronger. I keep learning every day, and what I find most valuable is to persistently push for the good ones, fight vigorously for them one day at a time, and never stop short of believing that I can do anything I put my mind and heart to. And you can too!
Don't give in.

In the production process of solar polycrystalline silicon ingots, monocrystalline silicon rods, silicon wafers, solar cells, and hydrogen fuel cells, a large amount of waste mortar is generated from the cutting of silicon wafers, and a large amount of silicon mud waste will be generated during the on-line recycling and processing of waste mortar. The large amount of silicon carbide and polyethylene glycol contained in the silicon sludge waste still has recycling value; in addition, if the silicon sludge waste is not treated centrally, it will cause serious pollution to the environment.
2. Application of solar energy polysilicon waste mortar treatment filter press
Common processing methods in the industry:
After washing with water, a part of the polyethylene glycol is extracted and then treated by simple and crude methods such as burying and discarding. This not only causes a great waste of resources, but also causes serious pollution to the environment.
Sudong filter press recommendations:
Recycling the silicon sludge after the membrane filter press is fed and squeezed has greater economic benefits and can reduce environmental pollution.
The main difference between the diaphragm filter press and the current ordinary chamber filter press is the use of elastic diaphragms on both sides of the filter plate to form a whole. During operation, when the feeding is finished, the high-pressure fluid medium can be injected between the filter plate and the diaphragm. At this time, the entire diaphragm will swell and squeeze the filter cake to achieve further dehydration and reduce the water content of the filter cake.

When children become bored, they can get easily frustrated and also not enhance their behaviour skills.
When you keep your children entertained with the right activities, it can improve their learning skills and help them excel.
On that note, here are 15 ways to keep your children entertained during the holidays.
Get them a new toy
Every child loves a toy. No matter if they love dolls or water fights, you can visit Kidslovewhat.com to find out the best gifts and toys to entertain your children at home throughout the holidays.
Getting them a new toy to play with will give them new excitement and act as a reward for getting through the school year.
Extra-learning
There is no harm in getting your children involved with extra learning when they are off on their holidays.
So long as you make it fun, they will still get plenty of relaxation time and not feel like they have spent their entire holiday at school.
For instance, you could allow them to choose a language and teach them at home.
There are many benefits of early language learning from improving conversation skills to it being a prime time for children to start learning in order to master the skill for the future.
You can make these extra learning sessions fun, no matter the subject, by involving friends and family.
The more people that join in, the more fun and normal it will feel for your children.
It will feel like less of a lesson and encourage them to join in.
Dance with them
Children love to dance and move. It is a great way to expend their energy.
Thus, if they wake up one morning with way more energy than you, getting them to dance around will mean that you can have fun together and keep them calm down.
You could dance to their favourite tunes or make routines to enhance their dancing skills and confidence.
Back garden games
When the weather is nice, ensure to make the most of the back garden and play games outside.
You could play anything from Jenga to the twister mat game.
You could even play sports if you have enough room.
It will help you both get fresh air while keeping them entertained without technology.
Cooking
You should never rule the kitchen and not let your children get involved.
It is so beneficial to teach your children to cook from a young age.
They will be able to attain the skills and work on them to master them at a young age.
Plus, they wil likely become a more confident cook and get to experiment with flavours.
If they are a fussy eater, it is a great activity to help them overcome food fears.
Arts and crafts
Every child loves getting their hands dirty, and what better way than with arts and crafts.
You could spend the morning painting outside or the evenings drawing your favourite fruits.
There are so many ways to get your child involved in arts and crafts.
If they rebel against it, then you will want to consider trying out various activities to discover which they like best.
Here are some ideas:
- Painting
- Drawing
- Pottery making
- Making objects (with paper mache, glue and materials)
- Sewing
Garden exercise
Get the children outside for exercise in the garden on the days when the weather is shining or there is nice warm air.
Even if it’s a bit chilly, as soon as you finish the warm-up your children won’t even realize that it’s cold.
You could enjoy yoga, HIIT, or running around the garden to ensure that they get plenty of physical exercises and fresh air.
It is also a great way to fit your exercise in while entertaining them.
Sports day
Speaking of garden exercise, you could make your children feel like they are at a competition by introducing a school holiday sports day.
To make it more exciting, engaging, and competitive, you could invite family and friends over to participate.
You could set up race tracks, an obstacle course, or a shot put. It will all depend on how much garden space you have.
You could then offer rewards for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places to ensure that your children stay active and competitive, as they will likely hope to reap an award.
It is a great way to make use of a warm day and get your children active and excited during the holidays.
Make a den
Every child loves to get adventurous, and what better way than by making a den at home?
This could be either inside or outside.
Inside dens are most possible so that they can stay up for a few days and be enjoyed by the children.
You could use blankets as the roof and chairs to hold them up. Inside, add lights and soft furnishings to make it cosy and engaging.
Movie nights
After your children have expended all of their energy, they will want to wind down for the night.
Instead of allowing them to play video games for ease, you should set up a movie night so that the whole family can spend quality time together.
Add soft blankets and cushions around the room and on the floor to make it comfortable for everyone.
Having snacks laid out will also ensure to entertain your children and prevent them from demanding to play their games.
Drama school day
You could spice up some holiday days with the drama school day.
This is a great way to get your children planning and organizing while you do errands or plan more activities.
You could ask them to set up a show for you, which they will likely love to do.
Giving them a task will mean that they have something to focus on and stay engaged with.
Giving them a deadline will ensure that they stay on track.
Then, you can sit back and relax at the end of the day and watch their performance.
The reason for encouraging drama school is to boost your children’s decision-making skills as well as their confidence.
Getting them to perform in front of you will normalize presenting and being in front of an audience, which is great for their confidence.
Treasure hunt
No matter how old your children are, they will love a treasure hunt.
You could set this up in the garden, like an Easter egg hunt, or inside.
Set up clues so that your children have an indication of where to look for the treasure.
The reason they will stay so engaged is due to the adventure of the activity and also to reap a reward.
Build a garden patch
You could teach your children how to garden and grow their own produce by building a garden patch together.
You could allow them to choose their own seeds so that they have something to look after all summer.
By the end of the holidays, they will have something to be proud of.
A garden patch is something that will need attention every few days.
Thus, it is a great activity to keep your children engaged all summer.
It will encourage them to cook with you and also be better gardeners.
Teach them to clean
The cleaning chores might be piling up quicker than ever in the holidays due to so much focus on fun activities, which is fine.
However, the cleaning will eventually need to be done. Instead of cleaning up yourself, you could get your children involved.
Make it fun by playing music and offering a treat if they help you.
Teaching them how to clean and getting them involved will likely instil good traits into them and help them to become cleaner and more organized later on in life.
Competitions
We’ve mentioned a few times that children love rewards.
Thus, why not set up mini competitions throughout the holidays so that they can stay engaged and reap regular rewards?
You could set up competitions for your own benefit, and to help them improve their skills.
For instance, you could ask them to see who can clean their bedroom first.
Or, you could set up competitions for who can be the best behaved during arts and crafts hour.
There are so many competitions that you could set up to keep them engaged, well-behaved, and also help to improve their behavioural skills.
With these activity ideas at hand, your children will no longer need to be bored throughout the school holidays.
Teaching them to cook, playing with them, dancing with them, and growing produce with them are all fun ways to keep your child engaged while enhancing their life skills.
Combining education with fun will help them learn while also relax and have fun during their time off of school.
They can go back to school engaged, excited, and relaxed after a summer full of fun.<<To edit this panel, open the 'header' template and customize it to your forum information.
