UW’s Fisher Innovation Launchpad Announces 10 Finalists
Ten innovative businesses formed by University of Wyoming graduate students are finalists that will compete for $125,000 in seed funding to grow their businesses.
They range from a company that reduces dependence on beehive yields by modifying an oil-seed plant to another business creating diagnostic software to treat a common autoimmune disease.
Teams will make their presentations during the Fisher Innovation Launchpad Tuesday, Oct. 23, from 8:15 a.m.-4:30 p.m. in the Wyoming Union Ballroom.
“We’ve slightly rebranded the program this year, from Challenge to Launchpad,” says Fred Schmechel, assistant director of UW’s Wyoming Technology Business Center. “We did this because inclusion is important to us and, while the Challenge has always referred to a deeply personal and internal process that our entrepreneurs go through, we learned that there were some students who were turned away by this language.
“Reframing the program to the Launchpad helps these UW students understand that this isn’t a competition against others, but rather an ongoing program to help them find the support and resources they need to build innovative companies here in Laramie.”
The Fisher Innovation Launchpad, which began in 2016 as the Fisher Innovation Challenge, is for new, independent businesses -- in the seed, startup or early-growth stages -- focused on technology and Fisher Innovation Launchpad is a natural applied outcome of a student’s education at UW,” says Dave Bohling, the WTBC interim director. “It’s an opportunity to take what they have learned here in classes and build something tangible with it.”
The qualifying businesses named finalists are as follows:
-- PenBox, founded by Jacob Wild, a master’s degree student from Laramie majoring in computer science, and Mike Borowczak, a UW assistant professor of computer science. Cybersecurity solutions generally target large entities and can be very expensive to implement. This leaves small to midsize companies vulnerable. PenBox proposes a hardware/service business model where a physical box probes likely security access points (“Penetration Box”), and the principals then make integrated solutions available to mitigate those access points.
-- Brass Genes, founded by Marcus Brock, a postdoctoral research associate in botany. This company has a concept for modifying a trait of a commercially important oil-seed plant to potentially dramatically enhance natural pollination. This would reduce the dependence on commercial beehives for increasing seed yield.
-- ASIMICA, founded by Nikolai Mushnikov, a graduate student in molecular biology from
St. Petersburg, Russia, and Grant Bowman, a UW associate professor of molecular biology. Industrial production of biomolecules in the pharmaceutical industry is commonly performed using stirred tank reactors in batch processing. This uses bacteria or algae as the “factory” units for producing the final protein or chemical product.
Unfortunately, the produced material is often toxic to the factory biology in high concentrations, so that biology is susceptible to mutations and complete loss of production. ASIMICA has a concept for altering the factory bacteria/algae to enable continuous cyclic production of target products.
-- CS3, founded by Behzad Reza Ahrabi, a staff scientist in mechanical engineering, and Dimitri Mavriplis, a professor in mechanical engineering. The product is a software package that is used for physical simulations. It has been designed primarily for compressible flow simulations over complex geometries. However, various components of this package can be used for many other applications.
-- Deep Winter Games, of which Spencer Ollila, a senior from Laramie majoring in computer science, is one of the collaborators. The main vector for customers will be a tool set enabling multiplatform compatibility for small and independent game companies. This will allow them to offer similar functionality that larger game development companies have, without the significant overhead costs involved in developing a game for multiple platforms at once. Marketing of this tool set will be complemented by the further development of a cart-racing game, which will help fund the company in its early stages.
-- TABI, of which Ph.D. ecology students Mallory Lai, of Denver; and Maya Gans, of Hollywood, Fla., are collaborators. The TABI product is probabilistic diagnostic software aimed at assisting general physicians in diagnosing and treating the most common autoimmune disease, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. The product will be a user-friendly app that uses statistical inference given patient data. Doctors will be able to input symptoms, laboratory tests and patient demographics into the software as a service platform to receive real-time probabilities regarding a Hashimoto’s diagnosis and patient response to treatment.
-- VisibleFlow, whose collaborators include Ben Noren, a UW chemical engineering graduate student from Ironwood, Mich., and Leann Bentley, a recent UW graduate in marketing from Laramie. VisibleFlow aims to rapidly prototype complex microfluidic chips. A microfluidic chip is a stamp-size system that is used in many different industries, including biomedical, pharmaceutical, engineering and diagnostics. These microfluidic chips are popular because they enable better data quality, with less material and maximal ease of use. One of the drawbacks to microfluidic chips is that they are extremely difficult to make due to time-consuming manufacturing and the danger of harsh chemicals. VisibleFlow aims to change the paradigm of the microfluidic chip landscape by significantly simplifying the process while providing greater design complexity. VisibleFlow’s process is faster, safer and more environmentally sustainable.
-- Agate, founded by Feng Guo, a UW graduate student from Nei Mongol, China, majoring in chemical engineering, and Saman Aryana, a UW assistant professor of engineering, focuses on indoor air pollution. Agate plans to build both a filter and filter-housing module that incorporates active photocatalytic breakdown of volatile organic compounds in household, factory or automobile cabin air.
-- Deep Belief, founded by Spencer Sharpe, a lead data scientist from UL LLC and a graduate student from Cheyenne majoring in electrical engineering. The Deep Belief service intends to visualize data through semantic clustering, enabling customers to quickly and deeply navigate and understand the datasets analyzed.
-- SciTech Energy, of which Morteza Akbarabadi, a postdoctoral research associate in petroleum engineering from Chaloos, Iran, is a collaborator. Enhanced oil recovery techniques (EOR) boost the hydrocarbon production by increasing the oil’s mobility. To find the best choice of EOR techniques for each field, specific experiments need to be performed. SciTech Energy designed a benchtop unit that will be able to measure and calculate the essential pore-scale parameters that lead to the best choice of EOR techniques for each oil field.
The panel of judges includes business leaders Teresa Nealon, Christine Langley, Mike Kmetz, Sarah Reese and Jerad Stack.
“We’re very excited about our judging panel this year,” Bohling says.
Six teams will receive business counseling, one year of free rental space in the incubator and the opportunity to approach the Fisher Innovation Fund for startup capital. The four to six teams not funded by the fund will still receive space, rent-free, in the incubator for a year, and business counseling.
“In the past two years, the Fisher Innovation Launchpad has launched more than a dozen startup companies here in Wyoming,” Bohling says. “A quick survey of our winners shows that they have created about a dozen jobs so far, and they are continuing to get grant funding and develop new technologies and intellectual property as they do it. This year, we have 10 viable companies that could launch, whether they receive a portion of the $125,000 or not.”

Visitors want your latest content and they want it now! – That’s a fact.
Within a few hours a tweet and Facebook post can be banished into the dark pits of the web and never seen again. As humans we crave the latest information and being conditioned with “on-demand” services and live feeds, this need for the latest information is only conditioning us to what newer, to the minute information and discard the information of a few hours ago.
Recent studies show that Tweets last a reportedly 24-60 minutes. Twitter moves fast and reportedly publishes half a billion tweets per day – Pretty easy to see how your tweets get swallowed up! Facebook posts last a little longer and are reportedly said to reach 75% of your audience/friends within 3 hours. Our own research has shown that on Linkedin the average post does better and has a lifespan of upto 24-36 hours.
It’s pretty interesting information, that shows the lifespan of Twitter which is commonly used for gossip/news is of a very short life time where as more professional networks such as Linkedin have a much longer lifespan.
What content works best?
Valuable content will always work best, especially when embedded into a blog post. For example my post around Web Trends and the Ecommerce Crash Course, still brings us traffic today. The key lesson is to always create valuable content that people will always want to search for, popular topics such as “Who invented the internet”, will always serve you well, rank well in Google and bring you in traffic – How relevant and how you you monitize that traffic is a different story that we shall cover later.
Compared to content that you write and publish in your blog, social media content has a much shorter lifespan.
Social media content, whilst it can be viewed on your timeline if searched for its not visible on your friends/followers timeline for very long.
It’s thought that most content is as good as invisible after 48 hours although there are some things you can do to keep it alive.
Have people engage with your content, it appears that the more people that engage the higher up on feeds it goes and when users engage with your content they tend to also see it higher up on their feed.
Leverage hashtags, shares and retweets etc – As these reach a wider audience and could be then retweeted by your followers at a later date/time giving a slight boost.
Hashtags can also help, as if they are niche they will be visible a lot longer when searched for and if it’s a popular hashtag then it could snowball and become listed in the popular trends section.
You can also schedule your content via a social media tool such as hootsuite. This will allow you time your content for maximum impact and engagement.
Remember to always share great content – it’s that content that will get the most engagement and get you the most visibility.
If you are stuck for content ideas why not re-purpose old content, find some of your old best performing posts, freshen them up and reshare it with a new message.Welcome to our Webpage!

Radio Shack, for young people today those words have little meaning. To many older people Radio Shack was a fixture in our entertainment, hobbies, electronic related work and for some of us employment. What was and what is, isn’t the same and it’s never coming back. Society has changed way too much from those who mused to those who want to be amused.
We all have a personal story of our love of Radio Shack. Mine started out with my first set of walkie-talkies when I was a kid to a full line of communication equipment all purchased at Radio Shack. While we can’t go back to those days, we can relive some of our memories while we look through the catalogs as we did so many years back.
This site will concentrate on the years between the 60s to the 90s in what I believe was Radio Shack's heyday. I hope you will enjoy seeing some of the old goodies from Reel to Reel to CB radio to Scanners and Shortwave radios. Radio Shack had some real neat stuff way back when.

Connell Rawlinson and Ricky Miller also hit the woodwork on an afternoon where the Valiants dominated, but they had to settle for just the two goals.
Vale started on the front foot as they pressed for an opener and Mitchell Clark got a shot away after just two minutes, but his powerful strike was well blocked by the outstretched leg of Ashton Taylor.
The next chance of the afternoon did fall to the visitors after Scott Brown could only direct a punch into the path of Sam Hoskins, but his volley sailed beyond the crowd of bodies in the box and over the bar with six minutes on the clock.
Five minutes later, it was the Valiants who were back on the attack. Tom Conlon created the opportunity as he clipped a free-kick into a dangerous area, with Manny Oyeleke profiting to curl an effort towards the far corner, only to be denied by Dave Cornell.
Rawlinson then went inches away from giving Vale an early lead as he connected with a perfectly placed Conlon delivery, but the centre-back could only send a header just over the bar from close range.
Northampton then missed a clear-cut chance midway through the first half as Andy Williams failed to hit the target from close range, and they were punished four minutes later as Vale took the lead. Whitfield cut inside and drilled an effort into the bottom corner from range before wheeling away in celebration.
Williams did protest for a penalty on 42 minutes as the ball inadvertently struck Leon Legge’s hand inside the area, but the referee was unmoved. Whitfield then went close on the stroke of half-time, but his acrobatic effort deflected just off target and that proved to be the final action of the opening half.
Following the restart, it was the home side who continued to look the more threatening in possession. With 51 minutes played, Luke Hannant did well to deliver a looping cross from the left flank that was heading on target, but Cornell backpedalled to claw the ball away from goal.
Northampton were then reduced to 10 men just before the hour mark as Aaron Pierre got involved in a tangle with Miller on the edge of the area, giving Thomas Bramall no choice but to brandish a second yellow. Hannant then stood over the free-kick, but his shot didn’t test the ‘keeper as it flew over.
With a one-man advantage over their opponents, Vale looked to make it count and they almost did that on 65 minutes. Miller opened up some space to get a shot away from distance, but after taking a hefty deflection, it could only rattle the crossbar as Cornell stood stranded.
However, four minutes later, Vale doubled their lead in superb fashion. Tom Pope and Oyeleke linked up brilliantly in a central area and the latter made the rest happen, curling a finish into the top corner beyond the desperate reach of the goalkeeper – an early contender for Goal of the Season.
With just under a quarter of an hour left to play, Neil Aspin’s men went incredibly close to finding the net again as Hannant’s corner caused mayhem inside the Northampton box. Rawlinson’s initial effort cannoned back off of the woodwork before dropping to Pope, but he couldn’t quite scramble the ball home as Cornell smothered.

It frequently turns up in sources dealing with the fish trade. Of course, the maritime smock, worn by sailors and fishermen, which was plainer and shorter than the traditional smock frock, may have influenced this. [see illustration below, James Clarke Hook, Crabbers, 1876] However, those involved in the fish trade seemed to favour a hybrid garment, somewhere in between the two versions.
Joshua Cristall depicted the Fish Market on Hastings Beach in 1808, with long white plain smocks visible on several men at a time when smocks in general were not so embellished. [see illustration below, V&A collection] Indeed, when Joseph Foster died in 1909 in Hastings, it was noted that he had worn a white smock frock at his stall in the Fish Market in the Old Town,[1] so this was seemingly a tradition for some fish sellers there during the nineteenth century.
They also seem to have been worn by those in the London fish trade. In a description of Billingsgate Fish Market in 1872, those who carried the fish from the transport to the auctioneers were described as clad in corduroy and smock frocks with sou’westers and wooden clogs, finishing off their practical outfits.[2] A fish salesman, Edward Soloman, wore a dirty smock frock when he entered the breakfast room of the Three Tuns Hotel in Billingsgate, contrary to hotel regulations, and was turned out by the landlord.[3] In 1881, a man put a white one on to sell fish in Billingsgate Market,[4] so white smocks seem to have been not uncommon.
Butchers too had a long association with the smock, the blue one in particular linked to the trade. As smock manufactures diversified and specialised, particular smocks were made for the butchery trade which would have been less embellished than a traditional smock frock. Edwin Butler sold ready-made clothes in Birmingham High Street, his stock in the mid-nineteenth century including butchers blue smocks. In a dispute and alleged assault between a butcher and a Jewish salesman in Gloucester, the butcher was described as wearing ‘a dirty smock frock’.[5] Even today, traditional butchers wear a white or blue and white striped coat as an overall, which seemingly has a lineage back to the smock. Butcher’s blue has also become a particular type of colour still used for aprons and textiles associated with kitchen usage. The smock continues to influence workwear even today.

This tomatillo red chili salsa is a staple in the Mexican cuisine. Roasted tomatillos, chile de árbol, and guajillo peppers are blended with garlic and salt to yield one of the most delicious salsas to drizzle over your tacos, tostadas, or sopes.
How to use tomatillo red chili salsa
This salsa can be used in so many ways. Let me show you just a few:
- APPETIZER: Serve it in a bowl with homemade corn chips. Perfect for game days!
- DRIZZLED: From steak tacos, to chicken tostadas, to a cheesy and gooey steak quesadilla, this tomatillo red chili salsa is the perfect addition to any Mexican street food.
- BASE: You can use this salsa to make nopales with pork, queso con chile, and even beef chile rojo.
What are tomatillos?
Tomatillos, sometimes called husk tomatoes are the produce of a plant from the same name which is native to Mexico, they look like a small green tomato wrapped in a papery husk, like some sort of alkekengi. In Mexico, tomatillos are used to make all types of salsas, especially salsa verde. But also to create many base sauces for more elaborated dishes, such as pozole verde or chicharrón en salsa verde.
SUBSTITUTES: If you can’t find fresh tomatillos where you live, you can add a can of tomatillos, they usually are just boiled and preserved in water and salt. Another solution would be to add a 14-oz bottle of green salsa.
The Chilies
I am using in this recipe for tomatillo red chili salsa two types of chilies. My mother usually added only one, and that’s it chile de árbol, but the result was a VERY spicy salsa since she need to add a good amount of those to achieve the brilliant and nice red color. So, a popular trick is to add also some mild red chile pepper, in this case, Guajillo. Guajillo not only adds color but also a mild delicious flavor.
SUBSTITUTES: If you can’t find guajillo where you live, you can also use 1 tablespoon of paprika (any type you prefer). New Mexico dried chilies are also a nice substitute, so are Anaheim.
The Recipe Steps
Useful Recipe Notes
- Pay attention when roasting chilies, as chile de árbol burns easily, so make sure you flip them almost immediately, they can be done in just a few seconds, the same as guajillo.
- I suggest roasting garlic with the skin on, I find that garlic tends to get a burnt flavor when roasted without.
- Always blend first chilies as those are harder to blend.
- If you add a bottle of tomatillo salsa instead of fresh tomatillos, make sure you reduce the number of chilies, as the store-bought salsa is already spicy.
- You can also use a molcajete or mortar to make this delicious tomatillo red chili salsa. Just grind first the chilies to pulverize them, then proceed with garlic, onions, and grind at last the tomatillos. This is the most traditional way of making tomatillo red chili salsa in Mexico.
How To Store
- Tomatillo red chili salsa can be stored in the fridge for up to 5 days!. Place it in a jar or a glass air-tight container before storing, as glass containers preserve best the flavors and are easier to clean.
- If you want to store it in the freezer, transfer the salsa to a plastic container or zip bags, label them, and store for up to 4 months. I love making a double bunch of this recipe, divide in bags and store for when I needed it.

This salsa looks delicious, and I’d like to make it for my son who is allergic to tomatoes, but is able to eat tomatillos with no problem. However, the recipe seems to be missing the amount of onion, even though I see it in the instructions. Can you let me know how much onion to put in this recipe? Thanks!
Hi Esther, thank you for letting me know, I fixed the recipe card now. You can use one small onion or a good chunk of a medium onion.
Thank you so much! I made the salsa for my son, and he absolutely loved it! He has been missing salsa for a long time, and this really made his day. He said he hasn’t enjoyed Mexican food so much in years. The rest of the family loved it too, so much that I already need to buy some more tomatillos so I can make another batch. Thanks again for a great recipe!
Glad you enjoyed it! :)

This was spicier than I initially expected, need to tone it down a bit next time, my fiance could barely eat it haha, I had no problem though #spicelover here. At first this was thought of as a netflix snack but we had a lot left so we used it for taco as well. Great one, Maricruz!‘Overwhelmed’: Aussie neighbour deemed Covid success sets grim record
Once deemed a Covid-19 success story and the perfect example of how to live with it, Singapore’s grip on coronavirus has seemingly gotten out of hand.
Singapore recorded 3,637 new cases of Covid-19 on Friday with 14 more deaths. More than 80 per cent of its population are fully vaccinated against coronavirus. Daily case numbers have reached almost 4000.
Wednesday saw Singapore record 18 deaths – its worst day of the pandemic so far.
Lawrence Wong, co-chair of a government task force fighting Covid-19, said on Thursday Singapore faces "considerable risk of the healthcare system being overwhelmed".
Mr Wong, who is also the finance minister, said nearly 90 percent of isolation beds in hospitals have been filled and more than two-thirds of intensive care unit beds are occupied. per cent of Singapore's population has been vaccinated against the virus – a milestone it hit in August. It has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world.
Alex Cook, a disease modelling expert at the National University of Singapore, said Singapore “may potentially experience two to three epidemic waves as measures are increasingly relaxed”.
"Until then, deaths will probably continue to rise, unless many of the residual unvaccinated elders can be vaccinated or more get their booster shot,” he said.
Fully vaccinated people made up about 30 per cent US figure of 4.96, and Britain's 1.92.
Singapore began vaccinating people in February and its government was lauded for strict contact tracing and a balance with allowing people to enjoy bars and restaurants while managing to slow infection rates.
Mr Cook said policymakers in Australia, New Zealand and China should study what is occurring in Singapore.
NSW has already surpassed 80 per cent of its population over 16 receiving two doses of vaccine while Victoria has reached 70. Both states were in lengthy lockdowns due to outbreaks.
Experts are divided as to whether Australia will face the same fate as Singapore.
Professor Jaya Dantas from the Curtin School of Population Health said she does not believe NSW will see the same increase for a number of reasons.
“Singapore is densely populated with people using the MRT (mass rail transport) and buses,” she told Yahoo News Australia earlier this month.
Dr Dantas added “thousands” of migrant workers also live in dormitories and many people go to malls and eat at hawkers markets until late.
“Our cities are not so densely populated,” she said.
However, Dr Zoë Hyde from the University of Western Australia told Yahoo News Australia Singapore “is a warning for Australia”.
“Modelling clearly shows that we're going to need to vaccinate over 90 per cent of our entire population before we can return to something resembling normal life,” Dr Hyde said.
“This is a high target, but I think Australians will rise to the challenge. We already achieve over 95 per cent vaccination in our regular childhood vaccination programs.”
“If we don't learn from the mistakes of other countries and try to rush things, we'll only have to introduce restrictions again in the future. Slow and steady wins this race.”
Dale Fisher, an expert on infectious diseases at the National University Hospital, said most deaths are from those who are unvaccinated.
"The reality is that as Covid becomes endemic more and more people will get Covid,” he said.

QUICK RECAP
There was an odd feel to the days and moments leading up to the week 17 battle with the Dallas Cowboys. After all, it was the first time in years that Big Blue was playing a meaningful game in January. However, it was largely a result of how bad the NFC East was as a whole, more than the Giants earning the right. If NYG could win this 1 PM game against DAL, all they would need would be an 8:20 PM Eagles win over the Washington Football Team. If those two things happened, they would be hosting a playoff game in under a week. NYG would be the first double-digit loss team in the postseason in league history. DAL was playing for the same exact thing in this do-or-die match-up. As they always say, all bets are off when you’re in the tournament, though.
NYG has been horrid in the first half since the start of December. In their previous 4 games combined, they scored a total of 6 points and did not get into the end zone once in the first 2 quarters. They began this week 17 match-up against league’s 26th-ranked (and last-ranked run) defense. Questions were looming over their second-year quarterback. Offensive Coordinator Jason Garrett has already been rumored by the media to be gone after this season. The opening drive on this game meant something and they responded. It took just 6 plays to drive 78 yards, ending with a Sterling Shepard reverse that saw him carry it 23 yards into the end zone.
Backup quarterback Andy Dalton, who took over the job the last time these two teams met on October 11 when Dak Prescott suffered a severe leg/ankle injury, had a really rough first half. He threw an interception on the opening DAL drive to rookie Xavier McKinney but it was cancelled due to a holding penalty on fellow rookie defensive back Darnay Holmes. DAL did end up punting a few plays later, however.
NYG was playing a really physical brand early on. There was a lot of emotion and some extra contact post-whistle on most plays. They were trying hard to establish the run with Wayne Gallman (who gained 18 yards on 2 carries on the opening drive) in contrast to them ignoring him in their previous 3 games, all losses. On the third play of the NYG second drive, there was a fumble on the Jones-Gallman exchange, which DAL recovered. Thus, the Cowboys began their own second drive on the NYG 27-yard line. They did breach the red zone but the NYG defense held them to 3 points.
The two offenses then traded 6 scoreless possessions. Both quarterbacks were struggling to make the needed throws that would extend drives and the game became more and more physical. The Jones-to-Shepard connection continued to blossom with New York’s sixth drive ending with a 10-yard touchdown in which Shepard trucked over DAL rookie corner Trevon Diggs into the end zone. Graham Gano made the PAT after missing the first one following the opening drive to make it 13-6.
Dalton then started to click and the NYG defense started missing tackles left and right. Their drive was thwarted by a Dalvin Tomlinson sack, however. DAL settled on a field goal, this one from 46 yards. The NYG two-minute offense clicked on the next drive. This time, they needed just 4 plays to gain 75 yards, ending with a 33-yard touchdown to Dante Pettis. NYG had 20 points on the board for the first time since November 15. Those 20 points came in the first half. They scored 16 points in the first halves of the previous 5 games combined.
The NYG defense was not able to keep DAL from driving down the field again enough, however. They got past midfield with chunk gains in the passing game. Zuerlein then hit a 57-yard field goal to make it 20-9 going into the half.
After going 1-for-7 on 3rd down in the first half, DAL then went 3-and-out on the opening drive of the second half. The oh-so-important first drive of that second half for NYG then resulted in a turnover thanks to another drop by Evan Engram. The ball went right through his hands and into the arms of DAL safety Damien Wilson. DAL turned that into 7 points on a 1-yard touchdown by Ezekiel Elliott. All of the sudden, they were within 4 points with an offense that was starting to click.
The NYG offense continued to shoot themselves in the foot with an illegal crackback block by Shepard and another drop by Engram killing the drive. DAL had the ball back. Their 13-play drive ended with a 36-yard field goal to cut the lead down to 1 point as the 4th quarter began. The stalling NYG offense then went 3-and-out following a sack. Now DAL, who had at this point scored 13 unanswered points, had the ball back. Fortunately, the NYG defense forced a 3-and-out.
At this time, it is important for an offense to have an identity. They had stalled, the opponent was coming back and within 1, and the end of the game was near. In these moments, they need to have something or someone to lean on and that has been where this offense has been putrid in 2020. Nobody could be consistently relied on. However, Jones stepped up and it was interesting to see who he went after the most. On three of the next four plays, Jones threw to Shepard. All three connected and it gained a total of 43 yards. They were approaching field goal range, which was important because it would force DAL to have to pursue a touchdown rather than a field goal. Damien Wilson came up with another big play by sacking Jones for a 10-yard loss. On 3rd-and-16, Jones threw a pass slightly behind Pettis, who was forced to dive backward. He made the catch but the replay showed the ball bounced off of the ground before he demonstrated full control. DAL Head Coach Mike McCarthy did not challenge, Gano then hit a 50-yard field goal, and NYG had a 4-point lead with under 7 minutes left. A huge gaffe by the DAL Head Coach who had more than his fair share of big mistakes in 2020.
DAL kept their offense rolling, putting together a marathon 17-play drive. They did indeed reach field goal range but the 4-point lead now loomed large. What an awful mistake by McCarthy! DAL converted three 3rd downs and a 4th down on this drive. They made it all the way to the NYG 7-yard line. After a crucial sack by Leonard Williams, Dalton desperately heaved a pass into the end zone which was intercepted by McKinney. This time the interception stood. NYG just had to get a first down on offense and it would all be over.
Wayne Gallman, on 2nd-and-5, broke through the line and crossed the first down marker. Without a DAL defender within 5 yards of him any direction, all he had to do was fall onto the ground. Instead, he dropped the ball. An enormous pile of blue and white jerseys then trounced on top of one another. The refs initially signaled DAL football in one of the most 2020-moments of the year. It was almost unbelievable. After conferring with each other, the refs changed it to NYG possession because Gallman clearly had the ball at the bottom of the pile. After a lengthy booth review, NYG still had the ball and game number 16 ended in the victory formation.
NYG wins, 23-19.
QUARTERBACK
-Daniel Jones: 17-25 / 229 yards / 2 TD – 1 INT / 106.9 RAT
Jones did seem a little hesitant with his legs, but he did run the ball 9 times for 17 yards, including a couple of designed runs. The interception was a complete gaffe by Engram. Jones played a solid game and threw a few really nice intermediate balls. He did show a lack of arm talent on two throws that NFL quarterbacks need to make. One was on a deep pass to Slayton where he had a few steps on corner Trevon Diggs. The other was on an out throw to Shepard on 3rd down from the opposite hash. His poor accuracy was bailed out on a few throws by his receivers. Overall, it was a solid game, he simply just missed on a few throws. By the way, the interception that was on Engram marked the first time Jones had thrown one in a current league-high 178 straight attempts. He was charged with the lost fumble on the exchange with Gallman, but I think it was more on the running back.
RUNNING BACK
-Wayne Gallman: 11 att / 65 yards
Gallman had a bunch of quality inside runs. After all, they were up against the last-ranked rushing defense in the league and the NYG offensive line was getting a great push early. When you have a back averaging 6 yards per carry and a passing game that struggles across the board, I just don’t see why you steer away from that running game. Gallman should have gotten the ball more, once again.
-Alfred Morris added 12 yards on 5 carries and Dion Lewis had 1 carry for 7 yards. All three of these backs are unrestricted free agents this offseason. This could be a very different looking running back room with Barkley coming back in 2021.
WIDE RECEIVER
-Sterling Shepard: 8 rec / 112 yards / 1 TD and 2 att / 24 yards / 1 TD
Shepard put out his best performance we have seen in a long time, possibly the best game of his career. It was a strong finish to the year for a guy who just hasn’t made a ton of big plays for this offense that has been starving for a pass catcher to step up. Shepard played a really physical game, trucking over DAL defenders and making an impact as a blocker. He was flagged for a crackback block, however. One thing I love about this kid, he rarely drops the ball. Really sure-handed receiver.
-Dante Pettis definitely earned the right to be a part of the wide receiver mix next year. He had 2 catches for 43 yards and a touchdown. Both grabs were high-skill (even if the second one did indeed hit the ground). They were both big plays and on a team that is absolutely starving for WR talent, he needs to be at least considered.
-Austin Mack had a catch for 9 yards and allowed a TFL while Darius Slayton added 2 catches for 22 yards. Slayton made a really nice grab on a poorly thrown pass and was also mistargeted by Jones on a deep route. It wasn’t a great year for Slayton but there is no denying the upside if the offense around him improves.
TIGHT END
-Evan Engram dropped two more passes. Both went right through his hands and one of them resulted in an interception that DAL turned into a touchdown. The debate really doesn’t exist anymore. Engram is super-talented and blessed with rare movement tools for the position, but he can’t be a focal point here. NYG has him here for one more year on a fair price, but I think his days here should be over. More on that below.
-Kaden Smith and Levine Toilolo each had a catch on their lone respective targets. Smith allowed a sack but also threw a key block on the Shepard rushing touchdown.
OFFENSIVE LINE
-The top two grades went to the top 2 offensive linemen on the year, Nick Gates and Andrew Thomas. They were both flawless in pass protection and both got tremendous push in the running game. Thomas had a roller coaster season but his second half was better than his first half. He has some positive momentum going into his first offseason. Gates started off poorly but evolved into the top OL on this team. He really did play at a top-10 level in the league at the center position. The physical brand of football is coming back and I think this kid is at the forefront.
-Kevin Zeitler allowed a sack, TFL, and a pressure. He did throw some weight around in the running game but he and Cameron Fleming, who also allowed a pressure, may be the focal point of this offense that needs to be fixed first. That right side has been poor all year and even though Matt Peart did show some signs of potential, NYG can’t go into 2021 with these holes. If it means big money to someone, so be it. If it means another high draft pick, so be it. They need to get dominant up front or else this offense will continue to stink.
-Shane Lemieux played every snap at left guard and allowed 1 pressure. He, too, was solid in the running game. I think he showed enough to deserve a starting spot in 2021 or at the very least be in competition for a starting spot. He simply needs strength and power development. There was a lot he did right this year and NYG should be pleased with him considering where they got him in the draft.
EDGE
-Kyler Fackrell was back after missing 4 games with a calf injury. It was interesting to see NYG try and fill his hybrid ILB/OLB “BUCK” role in this scheme. Nobody realty could. It is a really unique position. He had 3 tackles and a sack. Fackrell is a free agent this year and I think NYG should prioritize bringing him back. He isn’t special, but he is unique.
-Jabaal Sheard had 1 tackle and a 1 pressure. He was a solid player for a one-year rental, but I doubt he is in the picture next year.
DEFENSIVE TACKLE
-The career-year by Leonard Williams ended with a bang. He finished with 7 tackles, 3 sacks, a pass break-up, and 2 pressures. No need to bring up whether or not the trade was worth it anymore, as previously stated. The question is now is what should NYG offer him to stick around for the long term? The 26-year old is one of the more unique defensive linemen in the game and you could make the argument he is the most versatile defensive lineman in the game. He is not as good as J.J. Watt, but they are the two guys who can credibly play both the inside and outside gaps in whatever scheme a coach draws up. For a defense that truly wants to change their face weekly, that is invaluable. But hey, everyone has a limit.
-Dalvin Tomlinson had 2 tackles and a sack while Dexter Lawrence added 2 tackles, 1 TFL, and 1 pressure. Even though NYG still has a ways to go, these three guys up front along with quality backups B.J. Hill and Austin Johnson were a consistent bright spot all year. This group made this defense more consistent than it has been in a very long time. They made this defense have a standout trait and even though there are other pieces needed, I do hope they find a way to keep these guys together another few years. That could be something special.
LINEBACKER
-Tae Crowder and Blake Martinez both had 11 tackles. Crowder added 2 TFL and Martinez added a sack. This was fun to watch. We have gotten used to how reliable Martinez has been, notably against the run between the tackles. We also saw flashes of Crowder and his play-making ability that stems from plus twitch and speed. They were both on their game in this one and matched with a very solid defensive line, they could be major forces combined as a pair in 2021. Crowder did miss 2 tackles and that is a red flag we have seen a few times.
-David Mayo had 4 tackles, 2 of which were on special teams, and Devante Downs added 1 tackle. These are two guys I wouldn’t mind seeing replaced in 2021. They just don’t seem to have enough speed to be relied on. It has shown up several times this year, as it did in this match-up.
CORNERBACK
-Pro Bowler James Bradberry had 4 tackles and a pass break up. He dropped an interception that he should have brought in. Opposing defenses really didn’t throw at him that much this season. NYG got a good one. Now they need to find another.
-Logan Ryan played more corner in this one than the previous few weeks. He nearly had an interception as well while adding 3 tackles. He had another missed tackle. He led the team in that department this season.
-Darnay Holmes was back after missing time with an injury. He was on the field for under a third of the snaps. On multiple occasions, he has shown the knack for being flagged at very inopportune times. This game was no different. He was flagged for a hold on Xavier McKinney’s interception in the first half. He was beat on a couple 3rd-down conversions as well.
SAFETY
-Speaking of McKinney, we saw a real glimpse of just how good this kid can be down the road. He was all over the field and this scheme has him wearing a lot of hats. He finished with 8 tackles, 1 TFL, and an interception. He also has a second interception that was cancelled by a penalty on Darnay Holmes. McKinney quickly sniffed out a screen pass on two occasions and also sniffed out a reverse that led to a no gain. He really seemed to get more and more comfortable these past 3 weeks. I think NYG should be excited about what he brings to the table. They have been starving for talent at safety for a long time and they now have 2-3 guys who can really get it done.
-Jabrill Peppers was roasted by the DAL passing game in this one. They attacked him over and over and he just always seemed to be a step slow. He did a nice job of making tackles in space and minimizing damage, but he did miss a tackle and was flagged for a holding penalty.
SPECIAL TEAMS
-K Graham Gano: 1/1 (Made 50). Gano hit his 29 consecutive field goal, a franchise record. He missed an extra point.
-P Riley Dixon 5 Punts / 45.2 avg / 37.6 net

-OG Kevin Zeitler, TE Evan Engram, S Jabrill Peppers
3 THOUGHTS ON DAL
6-10 in a season where they lost their starting quarterback in Week 5. DAL had games started by quarterbacks Ben DiNucci and Garrett Gilbert. They lost both of their starting defensive tackles. They lost both starting offensive tackles and had health issues at center and one of the guard spots. I actually give this team credit for finishing where they did.
What does DAL need the most? Their defense is atrocious on multiple levels. They lack discipline, they lack consistency, and they couldn’t stop the run all year. DAL is going to need to invest money and early picks on their defense, the DTs and safeties in particular. This is where the issues arise when you opt to put so much money into the Prescott/Elliott/Cooper trio and then spend a 1st rounder on a WR. I’ve been vocal about DAL not spreading their funds and picks out well enough and now they are in a very tricky spot with a QB who is going to fight an uphill battle to return from a serious injury. This offseason is going to be huge for them, huge.
DAL got by with a dominant offensive line for a few years. It was one of a few examples in the league that showed just how good a team can be overall when the OL is dominant. However, left tackler Tyron Smith hasn’t played a full year since 2015 and missed 14 games this season. Right Tackle La’el Collins missed the entire year and there are some whispers from people I trust that some in the organization want him at guard. Yes, DAL missing Prescott was the catalyst in their offense going backwards but that OL taking a few steps back was a close second.
3 CLOSING THOUGHTS
NYG finishes 6-10. It was the most wins they’ve had since 2016. While nobody is actually giving them credit for playing “meaningful games in December,” it was refreshing to walk away from week 17 thinking the arrow was finally pointing up. This was the first time since 2016 that NYG finished with a defense ranked top-half in the NFL and just the 3rd time since 2010. They finished even in the turnover battle a year after they tied for a league-worst -17. They were flagged the 6th-least amount of times just 2 years after getting flagged the 9th-most. They are clearly playing with more grit, hustle, and intelligence. Their coaching decisions are showing more innovation and creativity. There are still things to be done here, but this is the first time in a long time where I feel this team is on the right track.
The most polarizing personnel decision this offseason, in my opinion, is not at quarterback or wide receiver or outside linebacker or defensive tackle. It revolves around Evan Engram. He is locked into another year before his free agency hits in 2022. I’ll go on record now; I think they need to try and trade him if they can get a day 2 pick from someone. I do think he can thrive in a certain role in a certain offense and there is no denying his talent. However, this passing game just doesn’t have the margin of error to deal with his drop issues. We may be singing a different tune about this season if he didn’t drop the ball so much. I think NYG needs to get the “old school” tight end whether it be in the draft or in free agency. This offense will be built on the running game and short/intermediate passes. Engram doesn’t fit and his drops just kill the flow and upside. He isn’t worth the risk.
Where does NYG go this offseason? I will put together a more detailed approach in the coming weeks. But to be short and to the point, they need players on offense who scare the defense. With Barkley out, nobody scares the defense. Look at the top offenses, they all have multiple guys who scare you. You can use the #11 pick on getting the #1- or #2-graded receiver or you can go after one of the top free agents at the position. I lean toward the former. I also think the building of this offensive line isn’t close to being over. They need a new right side and they need to build more depth at tackle. They likely need another starter at outside corner or at least a guy who can rotate in. Lastly, they need a pure pass rusher on the edge who can help them break through the line while rushing just 4 guys while keeping 7 in coverage. Considering they need to figure out allocation of funds to Leonard Williams and Dalvin Tomlinson, all of this is a really tall order. If I had to, right now in this moment, rank where I think they need to apply resources, I am saying: OL, WR, EDGE, TE, CB. Those are the top 5 needs.
Thanks for discussing NYG football with me this year, everybody. Just think… about 5 months ago, we didn’t know if football would happen. And within the past 5 months, we had several chirping about the idea that the league should be put on hold. Football is more important to the well being of this country than most want to admit. We were fortunate that the league pulled off a full 256-game schedule. God Bless everyone. I will be around here and there, but during the next 3-4 months, I will be hunkered down writing my reports for the draft. Position previews will be out in April.John Of Gaunt Day Preview.

and choose Workflow – New Project
There are a few steps in the photo to 3d model operation; you can choose to carry out all of these in sequence for you by ticking the “Compute 3D Model
after project creation” and “Compute Texture after Surface extraction” options.
(Note, although it is more convenient to do these all in one go, working through stage by stage does give you more control and it will let you spot and fix problems earlier on)
Hit Next to show Photo Selection – just drag your photos into this panel (50 photos maximum with this version of Zephyr).
– Zephyr also has a neat tool here that lets you bring in a video you might have made of your subject (or rather it will let you bring in a video file, extract still photos from it and then use those photos). Be careful with video imports as they tend to be more blurry.
Hit NEXT to proceed until you get to the orientation presets panels. This is where you describe the project and how detailed you want it.
The categories of
• General
• Close Range
• Aerial
• Urban
• Human Body
do work well as described but if one set gives bad results try experimenting; CLOSE RANGE / DEEP is the most successful – but longest and most complex combination
The different levels of preset will obviously affect time taken and complexity achieved – but be aware pushing up the detail levels is not the answer to a bad set of photos.
Click RUN at the top of the final panel to start the process. This can take a while but you can launch multiple Zephyr instances again and again to have it working on more than one model.
All being well you will eventually see a 3d model generated from your set of photographs. You can pan and zoom around the model (or right click – camera – view from – front / left / top etc.). There’s an EXPORT – SCREENSHOT if you want to grab a snap of your model at this stage.
In the example here the software has only detected common points with 8 out of the 31 photographs taken – it has not reconstructed the back of the statue, there area some holes in the model and some of the background has
bled into the hat. It may still be usable but you can see that if the photographs were better lit, better focused and more composed (with less noisy backgrounds) the results would be much better.
There are a lot of tools within Zephyr to let you do some repairs on your model; use Tools – Selection – Manual Selection to pick and cut parts you do not want; this is very useful. Also (clumsy) hole filling tools for patching gaps.
The Mesh Decimation filter is an essential one for simplifying meshes – so they are handled better by Rhino, etc. You can lower complexity and keep perfectly fine models.
On the right hand side of the Zephyr screen there is also a basic keyframe animator, so you could make a quick fly-around of your model. Click Add all camera positions, then the play button. You can export this by pressing the Record button.
To export your model for use in Rhino, 3Ds, Sketchup, etc. – or to send it
for 3D printing choose Export – Export Textured Mesh, or – Choose Obj/MTL for the output format (this will work fine with 3D applications)
– Click the Local Rendering Reference System box
then select the folder you want to output to – it will create a mesh, and
the files needed to wrap the textures around your object. Leave these all
in the same folder.
This OBJ file is now ready to open / drag into, for example, Rhino – though it will most likely be requiring rescaling to ensure it is proper size.
This full export will actually consist of 3 files – the model and also the files that describe the texture wrapped around it. These files should all be kept together otherwise the model will just render with no textureFew personal style are key here.
Most people choose to engage you, or choose not to engage you, as a person, almost regardless of your firm’s branding.
This is why I think it is so important to show who you are on your website and on your social media profiles.
Does your website include:
- your name,
- an appropriate, up to date and recognisable photo of you, and
- talk a little about you?
Does it help visitors to think – yes, I’d like to talk with this person? Or do you make that most common of mistakes among small accountancy firms: Having an ‘About us’ page that tells people nothing about YOU at all?
A related point is to then make it easy for prospects to get in touch with you. Do you do this or do you just have a generic info@ or admin@ email address on your website?
Why hide who you are? Are your ideal prospects more likely to get in touch and call a generic office number or to try to make contact with a specific person (you)?
Some accountants, typically sole practitioners, start out using their website to imply that their business is more than just them. If you don’t work alone you can include reference to the team on your website. But if it is just you, then referencing a non-existent ‘team’ and pretending to be bigger than you are could damage your credibility. This happens when people find out there’s no substance to your implied assertions that your business is bigger than is actually the case. If you’ve lied about that, can your advice be trusted?
Big brands secure business through the reputation and longevity implied by their well known logos. This isn’t the case for small firms of accountants. And there isn’t enough real upside of building up name awareness of your brand and logo. Much better to show who you are and to ensure you are recognisable when you attend a meeting or event.
Similar points apply to your Linkedin and twitter profiles. Make sure again that there is a recognisable and appropriate photo of you on your profile page rather than just your business logo. On Linkedin and Facebook you can set up separate business pages. Your personal profiles can link to them.
Also, as I always say, Linkedin is an online business network. It’s all about connecting business people, so your logo is not a good substitute for a headshot.
You could have a separate twitter account for your practice – but that would be a waste of time and energy. Instead I strongly urge you to again use your photo and your name rather than your firm’s name or brand. If you already tweet using your business name do at least include your name on your twitter account. This makes it much easier for users to engage with you and more likely that you will attract relevant followers and ‘conversations’. It’s much harder to do this with a ‘corporate’ account than with a personal one. And you can’t expect everyone to check out your ‘business’ twitter profile so they may never notice your name is there.

Starting the weekend with practice and qualifying on Friday, Bent’s hopes of points in Monza were already reduced as he was one of nineteen drivers to be penalised for driving unnecessarily slowly in qualifying - despite, arguably, having no choice being at the back of the train of cars. This meant Bent started the first race of the weekend from 28th place.
Looking to bounce back from the frustrating qualifying result, Bent wasted little time in making up ground as he made his way from the back of the field. Progressing from 28th on the grid to 24th place on the opening two laps, Bent continued to deliver a focussed and flawless drive and by the halfway point of the race, he was already as high as 21st.
Keeping his head down and staying out of any unnecessary drama, Bent was running 10-places better off in 18th position when the race was concluded behind the safety car after a huge crash for Alex Peroni. Bent was later promoted to 17th after Marcus Armstrong was given a post-race time penalty.
Prior to Sunday’s race, heavy rain fell, making for a wet race despite the sun appearing just before the race start. As the race got underway, Bent was forced to leave the track at turn one to avoid a collision but race control viewed this as an unfair advantage and punished him with a 5-second penalty.
Determined to fight back, Bent made strong progress and looked extremely quick in the difficult conditions as he passed several cars to work his way through from 17th to 13th place.
However, on lap 14, the Dutchman was hit from behind by a rival and spun out. From this point, the race was as good as over for Bent, who was again hit on the final lap and dropped back through the field and eventually finished 27th.
"All in all, it was a disappointing weekend for me. On Saturday, the penalty from qualifying meant I had to start from well down the grid but I made up a lot of places over the course of the race which is always a nice feeling. On Sunday, I was hit and fell well back. After that, the race was over for me. A frustrating weekend and I’ll be looking to bounce back in Sochi."".
Bent now heads for Russia as the final round of the 2019 FIA Formula 3 Championship takes place in Sochi (27th - 29th September).As seen in

Why is this important?
Large institutions in our societies, most notably governments, have vast resources and power to change the world, for the better or for the worse. Yet decision processes used in these institutions are often not optimal or rational. If we could improve these processes even by a little, the expected positive value created would be very large. However, we often lack knowledge of how to go about improving these processes. Read more here or watch the talk below for an introduction.
How to tackle this
Generally, looking into decision making in the group settings would be one option. Specifically, looking into how various methods (like calibration training or structured analytic techniques) improve decisions in real-life scenarios and settings could be valuable. Also, developing better methods for evaluating the quality of arguments when there is no "correct" answer (example 1, example 2, example 3) would be potentially impactful. Another option could be looking into how policy-makers individually work with evidence and update their beliefs (see this paper and this blog post).
Here is a possible framework for thinking about questions related to improving institutional decision making.
Alternatively, looking into case studies on how better practices have been implemented in organisations historically might also bring more understanding of how to contribute to improving institutional decision making.

Why is this important?
Each year, over 70 billion animals (9 times more than the population of humans) are raised and slaughtered in factory farms globally. Most animals experience serious levels of suffering evaluated as "better dead than alive". These conditions may also pose a threat to human health because overusing antibiotics leads to a faster spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and red meat consumption is also shown to correlate with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, and higher cancer mortality rates. In addition, the animal agricultural sector has detrimental environmental consequences. For example, it is responsible for 15 % of global greenhouse gas emissions and 75 % of recent Amazon deforestation. Decreasing the number of animals raised in factory farms by changing people’s diets seems like a promising way how to improve the world. Read more here or listen to this podcast.
For an introduction to this area from the perspective of moral circle expansion, see the talk below.
How to tackle this
From a more theoretical perspective, one can work on the psychology of speciesism, moral circle expansion, carnism or compassion for non-human animals (e.g. creating and validating measurement instruments in different countries and populations). Another way to approach this could be to look more generally into how large scale social change happens and use change in attitudes towards animals or animal product consumption as specific instances of social change.
From a more applied perspective, using well-validated measures to assess the effectiveness of various interventions aimed at changing attitudes and/or behaviour towards animals might also be helpful. Another way could be to look into consumer perception of clean meat & animal products alternatives (see e.g. sources in this topic). Some examples of such applied topics could be found in this, this and this research agenda.

Why is this important?
Large pandemic outbreaks (like recent COVID-19) has historically caused enormous losses in lives (Spanish flu is estimated to had wiped out almost 1 % of the global population). If we were to tackle more severe natural pandemics or even anthropogenic pandemic caused by engineered pathogens, we might risk significant disruption to global civilisation and the future of humanity’s progress. Improving the culture of safety among scientists who work with dangerous pathogens might help us prevent the scenarios when such pandemic happens by accident. Learn more about the general case for working on biosecurity here and in this podcast, or watch the talk below in which Megan Palmer discusses the need for improved biosafety and biosecurity.
.
How to tackle this
Researching what types of requirements we want to have on labs or on individuals who are working with dangerous pathogens so it’s as easy as possible for scientists to comply but at the same is effective in eliminating the chance of any accidents. Further, figuring out how to increase the chance people report laboratory accidents when they happen.
Another angle could be exploring how to encourage a culture of security among people who might be able to create pathogens on their own due to steep technological progress in this domain (e.g. with something like a desktop synthesiser). It would be valuable to look into how to make people less likely to misuse this technology and use it safely.

Why is this important?
Philanthropy could be an effective way to improve the world. The amount of money donated to charitable causes in the US alone was over $427 billion and still increasing, with the largest proportion of that amount donated by individuals. There is a reason to believe that differences in the effectiveness of various charitable interventions are vast. However, donors rarely compare or decide where to donate based on how much impact they produce by giving to a specific cause/organisation or how much this will improve the world. If a larger proportion of donors decided based on the impact produced it could improve the world dramatically.
How to tackle this
Focusing specifically on where individuals decide to give (in contrast to how much or how often they give) and which factors influence their decisions could be fruitful. That is because there are huge differences in impact across charities, and therefore it seems plausible that improving where people give could generate more good than increasing the amount donated. Also, prescriptive giving research (i.e. how to create desirable behavioural change) would probably be more valuable than descriptive research (i.e. how donors behave). For example, see this research, also see this series of blog posts describing more in-depth what kind of research would be best.
Another way to look at this is by asking "Why don't people donate effectively?" and "How to make them give more effectively?" We can, for example, try to assess and decrease certain biases and false beliefs that might lead people to ineffective giving (e.g. scope neglect; charity effectiveness can't be measured) and look whether they change their donation behaviour. See more discussion and data in this paper and the talk below.
This thread also suggests some important considerations for such research and some potentially useful research questions.

Why is this important?
The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and the disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) are widely used to evaluate healthcare interventions and quantify the burden of disease. Some people also use these metrics informally as a general indicator of value. However, they have a number of major shortcomings in their current form. For example:
For a discussion of some of these issues, see Peasgood, Dolan, & Foster (2019), Brazier & Tsuchiya (2015), Dolan (2008) and Dolan & Kahneman (2008).
These problems lead to serious misallocation of resources in public institutions, such as national governments, and in some non-profit entities as well.
In the conference talk below, Michael Plant and Clare Donaldson of the Happier Lives Institute cover some of the issues with these measures of impact and propose an alternative.
How to tackle this
An alternative metric is the wellbeing-adjusted life-year (WELBY/WALY). This is structurally identical to the QALY but quantifies value in terms of subjective wellbeing (SWB), typically measured using self-reported happiness or life satisfaction. (See Diener et al. (2018) for a review of the SWB literature, and Clarke et al. (2018) on the use of life satisfaction to inform public policy.)
Existing preliminary research arguably permits the construction and application of a rough WELBY. But further work is required to ensure it fully captures what matters. This includes:
Once this is achieved to some level of satisfaction, the new metric can be used to improve priority-setting. Projects include:

Why is this important?
“Various apparently altruistic and reasonable behaviours seem puzzling on closer inspection if we assume that the agent is attempting to maximise the expected impact of their actions. These behaviours include (a) donating to more than one charity and (b) avoiding supporting work on mitigating existential risks on the grounds of ‘risk aversion’. The same behaviours might make more sense assuming a less pure form of altruism (the most obvious alternative being a ‘warm glow’ theory of motivation), or assuming deviations from expected utility theory that are arguably irrational (such as ambiguity aversion and certain forms of risk aversion).
A better understanding of the variety of psychological mechanisms underlying altruistic behaviour might aid efforts to work around behavioural limitations and maximise the good done by imperfectly altruistic agents” (cited from Global Priorities Institute’s research agenda, page 60)
In the lecture below, the psychologist Paul Bloom discusses his research on the limitations of empathy as a guide to doing good.

For example, one might attempt at Mapping forms of altruism; Rationality and deviations from pure altruism, looking into where are the roots of human compassion, Formation of moral concerns or Value drift

Every episode of Blue Bloods shows Danny Reagan (Donnie Wahlberg) solving a case as a detective. But the next episode shows him putting his partner, Maria Baez (Marisa Ramirez) in the hot seat and asking about her personal life.
Danny and Baez found a serial killer on ‘Blue Bloods’
Season 11 started with the episode “Triumph Over Trauma.” Baez and Danny were at a crime scene where a woman was murdered. The murderer then placed a bag over her head.
Danny later followed a lead by going to a house with Baez without warning anyone. Baez was pushed down a flight of stairs and they got trapped. They were rescued, but Danny discovered this is the work of a serial killer who still needs to be caught.
This story didn’t continue until “More Than Meets the Eye.” Baez and Danny continue their search for the murderer. This time Baez is more of the hot head and takes the lead on the case. It all ended with Baez taking the murderer down leading to his arrest.
However, she struggles with not wanting to kill him herself. Danny talks her out of it and asks her to not go off on her own again. She asks why given he does it all the time. “I don’t want you to be like Danny Reagan,” he tells her before saying, “Because I like Maria Baez.”
Danny asks Baez if she was intimate with a murder victim
A trailer for the upcoming episode has been released. Baez is seen leaving her home at night then sees a body of a dead man on her lawn.
It looks like the partners won’t be working together the same way because of this. Danny is seen asking her questions like if she was intimate with the murder victim. “Seriously, Danny?” she asks him. She’s also seen in her home on the couch looking at pictures of herself with this man on her phone.
Danny is then heard saying, “You and I both know she has nothing to do with this.” Frank (Tom Selleck) is shown in his office so he might be getting involved. Baez is seen again in her kitchen. She turns around shocked and she drops a wine glass.
It looks like it’ll be another dramatic episode for Danny and Baez. Baez is going from a hero to a possible murder suspect.
Some ‘Blue Bloods’ fans are starting to ship Danny and Baez
Danny and Baez have been working together since season 3. But some fans are starting to ship the partners.
They have grown closer with Baez going to Frank’s home for dinner in this season’s premiere. This new episode could show Danny getting jealous while learning about Baez’s personal life. Or it could ruin their chances for a possible romance. The new episode will air on March 19 on CBS.

The Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London is an internationally renowned department within one of the world's most prestigious universities. With its own excellent library facilities, substantial computing power, central IT advisory service and outstanding level of teaching and research, our principal aim is to train professional mathematicians and statisticians to pursue the study of scientific and technological problems busing mathematical methods, and to undertake research in various branches of the subject.
There is great demand, both in research and in industry, for well-trained, highly qualified mathematicians and statisticians. Our teaching and research programmes adapt and develop to meet this, aiming to give our students the skills they need to pursue the career of their choice.
The undergraduate teaching programme incorporates a number of three and four year degrees, as well as the Mathematics part of three joint degrees in Mathematics and Computing. A further important function is to provide instruction in Mathematics for students who require it as ancillary to courses of study in other departments of the college.
The MSc courses, in Applied Mathematics, Pure Mathematics, Mathematical Finance, and Statistics, and the MRes in Stochastic Analysis and Mathematical Finance allow students to continue and develop their studies. We also host an extensive PhD programme for those wishing to further their careers in both industry and academic research. Full details can be found on the postgraduate prospectus.
The Department acts as a unified whole in most respects, but for administrative convenience is organised into Sections with distinctive research directions: Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Mathematical Physics, Statistics, and Mathematical Finance.

The Concerto is back for FM 2022, and it is as effective as ever. We’ve played through a season as Arsenal in the Premier League, plus put it through our unique testing system to make sure it works for the 22.2 patch of Football Manager 22.
Changes to the Match Engine in FM22 has meant this is no longer as dominant at keeping possession, but this is down to the game and the issues which were flagged in the Beta, rather than the 4-2-4 tactic. Arsenal still finished sixth with 51% of the ball, but in the bottom three for passes completed.
In FM 2022, to make much more passes than the opposition, you need to play on Cautious or Balanced and play a much lower tempo – as seen in RDF’s Manchester City recreation.
Best FM22 Tactics: Concerto Formation
Key to this system if the two distinct combination triangles down each wing. On the right, the width from the attacking wing-back and winger causes an overload. The Advanced Playmaker is there to pick a pass to either wide man and the runs from the Advanced Forward.
On the left, you have runs inside from the Inverted winger being picked out from the AP, the movement from the Complete Forward creates space in behind and the IW can pick out the AF over the top. It is beautiful to watch.
Movement from the CF can create a 4-2-3-1 shape in essence, with the defenders following him into the midfield and the IW and AF can run into the space created.
With the Full Back on support down the left, the Box-to-Box midfielder and the AP being on support, combined with the Tight Marking instructions, Concerto is defensively solid too. Winning possession back 40 times more than any other team in the Premier League.22 tactic, it will not work.
Best Football Manager 2022 Tactics – Instructions
With play focussed through the middle, a narrow width and shorter passing Concerto should feel secure and compact, winning back possession with ease while creating space in wide areas.
Running at the defence causes havoc in the opposition back line, especially combined with moving the ball quickly and passing into space.
The pressing, counter and counter-press have not changed.
Out of possession we use a much higher line of engagement and extremely urgent press. Depsite SI claiming this would have a huge impact on your test, our testing on the ‘gengenpress’ has proved otherwise..
Best FM 2022 Tactics: Concerto – Player Roles
GK – Sweeper Keeper (d) – Just your standard keeper, but make sure he has a high value for One on Ones.
CD – Central Defenders (d) – Passing is preferred as you play out from the back, but aerial presence is far more important. Also look for Defenders with speed to cope with balls over the top. Ben White and Gabriel played in our Arsenal save and they have over 13 for Acceleration and Pace.
DR – Wing Back (a) – He should be well rounded and athletic. He will overlap the winger often reaching the by-line so great crossing and dribbling ability will be rewarded. Tomiyasu finished with nine assists in our season.
DL – Full Back (s) – The more defensive of the two full-backs, but he will still get forward, look to cross the ball and shoot from range. You should look for speed, work rate and general technical ability. Kieran Tierney was perfect and would be ideal if you wanted to switch the focus to the left with the IW moving to the right and the left-back becoming the WBa.
CM – Advanced Playmaker (s) – The AP can transform Concerto from a central position. Look for a passing maestro with good long shot ability and dribbling. Martin Odegaard finished with 100 key passes, which is great considering how playing through the middle has been impacted.
CM – Box-to-Box midfielder (s) – The more defensive minded midfielder is instructed to take fewer risks and generally play it safe but you should look for an all-rounder.
AMR – Winger (s) – (a) – The IW is instructed to take more risks and sit narrow. With an attack duty he will dribble past opponents and look to be the creative force out wide. You need speed and dribbling ability above all else, but finishing is a big bonus. Gabriel Martinelli lead the team in 17 assists from this position.
As above AML is instructed to man mark DR which needs changing to WBR when appropriate. The Inverted Winger must be right footed but if used from AML must be left footed.
ST – Advanced Forward (a) – The main goal threat, speed and dribbling ability are a must. A clinical finisher with composure is crucial. Off the Ball and Anticipation will help the forward react to the balls in behind from the AP/IW.
ST – Complete Forward (s) – Here we are looking for Off The Ball movement. Decisions, Passing and Vision are key. Lautaro Martinez was our big January signing and finished with 10 goals in 14 games. With 12 for passing and vision, he could be better here, but still proved a goal threat.
Every year we test countless tactics and review the very best. For FM22 these systems will be ranked and listed within our tactics index linked below. You can see how the Concerto compares to our other tests by clicking the image below.
IMPORTANT – When to tweak Best FM22 tactics: Concerto
In Football Manager 2022, tweaking your tactic in-game has become more important than ever. We have added formations.
As a general rule of thumb use B-flat away from home when you fear an upset or being overpowered by better opposition.
We have also included a system for wasting time in the last 10-15 minutes when you are ahead. As fatigue drops in FM22, the need to shut the game down is as important as ever.
If chasing a goal late in the game you can pump balls into the box, shoot on site, change the Winger to attack duty and CF to an AF. I also set the advanced playmaker to attack. Making substitutions in attack and midfield can also help also.
Training
Training is vital to success in Football Manager 2022. Do not leave this to your Assistant Manager because he fails to schedule match preparation. Match prep is the best way to improve the way your team performs within a system.
We have written a guide and included our FM22 training schedules here.
Best FM22 Tactics Results
In any other season this system and team had a chance to win the Premier League in year one. Huge results against Manchester City and United put Arsenal in contention.
Mistakes were made. You can see in January, using the Concerto Flat-B 4-4-2 it achieved great results against Leeds and Burnley, which could be tough away games. Attacking away at Southampton proved costly. As did the return game at Old Trafford. That gave United the gap they needed and too much to overcome at the end of the season.
You can see above when I switched to Concerto B-flat, its listed in the ‘formation’ column as 4-4-2 while Concerto default is listed as 4-2-4.
Best FM22 Tactics: Concerto – Table
Injuries played their part in the run in, with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang suffering a hip injury which saw him miss three months. He had provided 13 goals and six assists in the league and his loss made us dip into the transfer market.
102 goals saw us top the goalscoring charts, with the second most shots on goal. Arsenal also finished with the highest xG – 15 more than any other team. Second in tackles won behind Southampton helped us finish fourth for clean sheets with 18.
All in all, a very good season. Perhaps some better decisions with the tough away games could have bridged the six-point gap. We’ll never know.

...Don’t get me wrong, I love my mom madly, but some mornings she can be a real drag. It’s always: Lily, Lily, Lily…wake up, you need to get in your crate, I need to go to work…
Yeah right, Mom. I’ve seen you sleep in on a Saturday like no one’s business.
So, this is what happened THIS morning.
Before I tell you about how mom ripped me from my slumber, let me tell you about the sweet, sweet dream I was having.
In my dream, I had crash-landed in doggo heaven. There were piles of socks and shoes everywhere for me to rip up, treats on demand, baths were banned, and there wasn’t a mean cat in sight. Just as I was about to sink my teeth into a brand-new sneaker, I heard mom calling my name.
Mom, please, can’t be disturbed right now.
For all my efforts to ignore her, mom was relentless. It didn’t matter how hard I tried to pretend to be asleep she just wasn’t giving up. Ugh, and she’s SO noisy in the mornings.
What time is it, even?
The sun was barely up and there she was, absolutely insisting I get up. I wanted to suggest that she get a nice warm cup of coffee and go back to bed.
Unfortunately…she’s one of those…morning people.
I finally gave in and arose. Against my will, mind you.
And then she started on about going to work, and getting ready for the day, and so on and so forth. Really, can I just have a minute to wake up please? I was so warm and comfortable where I was.
I tried to give her my best puppy dog eyes.
It almost worked.
Wow, okay, Mom just wouldn’t stop. Even after I said that I just wanted to stay in bed. I tried to say it firmly. I tried to say it nicely. She just kept saying that she needed to go to work. Always with the WORK!
Anyway. I have, for this reason, decided that Mom needs to quit her job so that we can both sleep in.
Come on, Mom, think of all the walks we can go for and all the treats you can make for me!
She’s not completely convinced yet, but I’m working on her.We use cookies to make your experience better. To comply with the new e-Privacy directive, we need to ask for your consent to set the cookies. Learn more.

Charlotte North made history this season, breaking the NCAA single-season record for goals scored. Her record breaking goal is BC Interruption’s play of the year. The play beat out Brandon Sebastian’s 99 yard scoop and score against Clemson, Drew Helleson’s OT winner against BU and any of the 11 saves Rachel Hall made against North Carolina (and there were some good ones in there).
Record Breaker.— BC Women's Lacrosse (@BCwlax) May 30, 2021
101. pic.twitter.com/i3KaAvjlGj
The play itself is remarkable for two reasons. First of all, the absolute power behind Charlotte North’s shot is quite impressive. She fooled the goalie and overpowered her, beating her on a tough angle. Even if the goalie had a beat on the shot, the shear power of it may have rendered it a moot point.
But it was impressive for another reason. For the last few years, starting with the 2017 women’s championship, BC has rapidly tried to justify a place among the sport’s blue bloods. It means something that the record holder for goals scored in a season is a BC player. It’s unclear if the record will be broken, it’ll be something we will have to wait and see on, but whoever will be chasing it will be chasing a BC player, not North Carolina, not Maryland, not any other of the traditional blue bloods. That’s ours.Eurofighter Typhoon F.2 1/100 Diecast Aircraft Model

Ctrl → Alt →In his latest column, EN guest editor Phil Soar takes aim at the company mottos and wonders whether exhibition companies do enough to make themselves stand apart?
“Our goal is to make the world a better place for everyone, especially our customers and our staff.” Mission statements and company mottos – don’t you love them? The above is one I came across just last week. Tells you so much about the business, doesn’t it?
But surely, we clever, witty West London, cosmopolitan trade show companies can do so much better when it comes to missions and mottos. We surely must make it really clear just “how different our company is from all the others!”
OK, so let’s give it a try:
Here are 11 company mottos, mission statements or ‘corporate objectives’ taken from the very first page of the web sites of some of our major exhibition companies.
- “In the Business of Building Businesses”
- “We are on a mission to create unmissable events where people from all corners of the globe can meet, learn and inspire.”
- “We pride ourselves on a deep understanding of our customers and their needs, creating platforms that deliver growth and value.”
- “Accelerating business through face-to-face events.”
- “Our long-term strategy is market specialisation.”
- “Founded on bringing together people together, building relationships and supporting communities.”
- “Our events are dedicated to protecting people, assets and organisations and our corporate vision is to be the most successful events business in the UK.”
- “Delivering market-leading customer outcomes and experiences.”
- “Welcome to the future of Events.”
- “Join us on a journey into the future of events.”
- “We are an indulgence enjoyed across cultures, races and income levels and (which) has the potential to deliver joyful experiences across the world.”
As I don’t entertain you much in my weekly fun pieces by offering quizzes, this is a rare chance to shine. In a technique I have learned from Woman’s Own magazine, try and match the 11 mission statements and corporate objectives above to the following exhibition companies:
- Clarion
- CloserStill
- Diversified
- DMG Exhibitions (Daily Mail Group)
- Easy Fairs
- Informa
- Hyve
- Nineteen Events
- RX (Reed)
- Tarsus
- And for (K) – Guess the Company
Well, I will try not to labour the blindingly obvious point too much. How many hours must have been spent creating, arguing about, sub-editing, fretting and generally despairing about these mission statements?
And how much money must have been spent with PR consultants and advertising agencies to come up with something which differentiates Company A from all the rest, and which says something which will inspire its customers?
So, assume that you could hack into the front page of the web sites of all these companies and simply change their mission statement, picking at random any of the other 10. How many of those new ‘interloper’ statements would make much, if any, difference to the way each company was trying to sell itself? And how long would it take for anyone to notice?
A famous author in the 1970s and 1980s – Len Deighton – published a dozen successful novels. As is normal, a short personal biography was printed on the inside back of the dust cover. But he changed his biography every time he wrote a new book – the year of his birth, where he was born, his father’s occupation, his career history etc. No one, including his publisher, noticed until Deighton pointed it out himself.
I often idly think to myself:
- Who writes these company mission statements or corporate objectives?
- Why?
- Who reads them?
- What difference do they make?
- What is their purpose?
I won’t labour the point, but we, as an industry, are clearly finding it rather difficult to say anything which differentiates our companies much. And perhaps that says something about what an exhibition group is.
Is there really nothing else we could offer? Something honest, pithy and to the point?
Such as: “Our Mission is to make as much money as possible for our shareholders.”
I doubt you will ever see that on the wall behind the reception desk.

Kathmandu (Nepal), 14.07.2013
After several days of early bird mornings, today we took it easy. Reading and blogging at breakfast, we planned what to see in Kathmandu. There are plenty of sights in and around the city, and many Unesco listed places. What we had seen the night before didn’t impress us, but we were tired and the air was filled with smog. So we wanted to find out the real face of the city.

Ecological medicine has always been concerned about the environment and its impact on our health.
So I was curious to hear about a recent report by 37 international experts from the Wellcome Trust. These included Dr Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard. This was a culmination of three years work and it recommended changes that they considered not only beneficial for our health but essential to help save the planet.
This report received plenty of publicity in the media and it may be the first time that any major study has made the link has between our health and the health of the planet. They recommended we should cut back on sugar, meat and dairy and increase fruit and vegetables.
Of course, few would disagree with their suggestions to reduce sugar and few would disagree with their suggestion to increase fruit and vegetables. But I suspect many would throw up their hands in horror at the thought of reducing meat and dairy. Do we really need to cut down on these? Are meat and dairy production really threatening the planet? Is this another example of the nanny state? What can we make of it?
We know that meat is not bad in itself. Some Native Americans, with minimal access to fruit and vegetables, lived on meat alone, largely moose. Their health was excellent. True, unlike most of us, they ate organ meat which has a high nutrient concentration. And we can be sure they had no harmful effect on the planet.
But meat production has changed massively and I believe it is not so much meat that is the problem as the way it is being produced. For there is little doubt that meat and dairy production is causing health problems and that it is causing widespread environmental destruction.
The Nurse’s Health study and the Health Professional’s Follow-up study first noted an association between meat consumption and increased mortality from cancer and heart disease and also lower life expectancy. The much bigger NIH-AARP study which followed 545,000 people for 10 years confirmed meat consumption was associated with a lowered life expectancy and with increased mortality from cancer and heart disease.
But we need to look at the bigger picture. There are 70 billion farm animals kept worldwide and two-thirds are factory-farmed (80% in Europe).
These changes started several decades ago when we had what seemed like a good idea. The idea was to breed animals selectively to produce more meat or milk. Perhaps we should have realised the inherent stupidity of this idea but we went ahead anyway and the inevitable happened: the quality of the meat and milk took a nosedive.
We now have to eat 4 factory farmed chickens to obtain the same nutrients that a 1970s chicken would give. The mineral content of meat, milk and eggs has been steadily declining. The amount of essential fats in pasture-fed cattle can be 300 times greater that of factory-fed animals and the beta-carotene levels 700 times greater. Of equal relevance factory-farmed cattle have been found to have 143 residues of drugs and pesticides, 40 of these being carcinogenic. Milk is now largely produced by pregnant cows, greatly increasing concentrations of IgF1, a growth promoter and carcinogen.
For the animals themselves, the change has been a disaster. Factory-farmed animals live in horrendous condition, confined to darkened sheds, hardly able to move. The cruelty is so appalling that these sheds are kept in isolation, well away from prying eyes. Pigs, thought to be as intelligent as dogs, perhaps suffer the most from this forced confinement.
Animals are pushed to their absolute limits, with the aim of producing the maximum quantity of meat and milk. In the past a dairy cow might be expected to produce 1000 litres a year but now a high-yielding cow can produce nearly 10,000 litres a year (ten times what their calves would need) greatly reducing the quality of the milk, but also the lifespan of the cow (from 20 years to 2-3 years). Hens that would normally produce 5-6 eggs a year can now produce 300 a year, reducing their lifespan from 5-8 years to 1- 2 years. Broiler chickens grow to a grotesque size by 7 weeks at which time they are ready for slaughter and over half cannot support their own weight.
But what effect does this have on the environment? By far the most worrying issue is the staggering amount of land needed to produce food for these animals. A third of all agricultural land, an area the size of the EU is now used for animal feed, an amount of land that could feed 4 billion people.
This is now the major reason for deforestation and the major driver for extinction of every other species on the planet which are now disappearing at 1000 time the background rate. All animal species (mammals, birds, reptiles, fish) have halved in number in 40 years. An area of forest the size of New Zealand disappears each year, primarily for land to feed factory-farmed animals.
This land is used to grow wheat, corn and soya. One third of wheat, 50% of corn and 80-90% of soya is being used to feed factory-farmed animals. One third of pelagic fish (such as anchovies and sardines), some 90 billion fish, are sucked out of the oceans each year, ground into fishmeal, and fed to pigs, chicken and farmed fish, destroying whole ecosystems and throwing most seabird populations into sharp decline.
In both in the EU and the USA, sugar, wheat, corn and soy are heavily subsidised by the taxpayer, promoting a system that is damaging to animals, ourselves and the environment and on a scale never seen before.
And there is another major concern. About 80% of the soya is genetically-modified (GM) as is the majority of corn. Great swathes of land in the USA and South America are used for monocultures, with increasingly intense pesticide use (ten-fold increase in ten years), where nothing else can survive, producing a wildlife desert.
And yet we have evidence that rodents fed GM food were unable to reproduce within three generations and had increased rates of breast tumours, kidney and liver disease. Interestingly, in view of the obesity epidemic, rats grew fatter on GM food than those fed non-GM food. We are being fed unlabelled and potentially hazardous GM food, by the back door, through meat and dairy.
It is not just the sheer scale of land being used to feed factory-farmed animals that threatens the planet. Factory farming is also a major contributor to the increasing global water shortage (using one quarter of all fresh water), produces more greenhouse gases than cars, planes and trains put together and squanders 50% of the world’s antibiotics.
And yet chicken and hog farms have been a major source of new infections, including swine flu and bird flu, bringing us perilously close to an age where antibiotic resistant infections become the norm. A large hog farm or poultry plant can produce as much manure as a major city and hog manure is ten times more polluting. The slurry from feeds produce high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, polluting waterways, leading to algal overgrowth, and dead zones downstream where nothing can survive.
And yet it doesn’t need to be like this. It is not meat itself that it is the problem but the insane way it is being produced. Factory-farming is damaging to our health, heartbreakingly cruel for billions of animals and is taking us to the brink of environmental catastrophe. There has to be a better way.
A fascinating study in 2008 showed that animals allowed to freely forage have the highest levels of nutrients, followed by animals on grass, whereas animals fed on grain had the lowest levels of nutrients.
This is telling us something of immense importance. There is also an irony here. Animals know not only what is good for them, but indirectly, what is good for us, if we only let them choose.
Feeding cattle on grass not only benefits the animals and ourselves, but also turns something we cannot use into food.
Cattle fed on grass need forty times less water and produce none of the environmental degradation from large concentrations of manure, the inevitable result of factory-farms. If cows could be fed on grass, and chicken and pigs could forage and use some of the staggering amount of food waste (30-50% of all food), it would be a win-win situation, for us, the animals and the environment.
Where does this leave us all? I believe that for our own health we need to think carefully about both the quantity and more particularly the quality of the meat we eat. Wherever possible, we should look for labels like grass-fed, pasture fed, outdoor-reared (not outdoor-bred) and organic. Every time we make this choice we not only boost our own health, we vote against animal cruelty and we help protect our fragile environment for future generations.Search Form for vehicle model, tire size or rims Choose a tab below to get fitment data for your vehicle or to find vehicles matching your criteria.

What is the benefits of pomelo fruit?
Pomelo fruit is rich in powerful antioxidants like vitamin C. It also contains protein and fiber, which can aid digestion and help you feel full for a longer period of time after eating.
Is a pomelo the same as a grapefruit?.
Is pomelo high in sugar?
The sugar content of the pomelo was 5.86% of full weight, and we use 922g Majia pomelos which contained about 50g sugar equal to 50g glucose for GI measurement. Other Names: Majia pomelos. Citrus grandis cv..
Which is healthier pomelo or grapefruit?
Nutrients: One cup of grapefruit provides about 74 calories, 1.5 grams of protein and 2.5 grams of fiber. That makes it a good source of dietary fiber, as well as an excellent source of immune-enhancing vitamins A and C. Pomelos have more potassium, but have much less vitamin A.’s the English of Suha?
In Tagalog, Suha is called a “ Pomelo. Its scientific name is Citrus maxima or Citrus grandis which means large citrus fruit. However, if you’re in the Visayas, Suha is what the locals use to describe the Philippine Lemon or “Kalamansi”. Meanwhile, Davao is known for its pomelos as well as fruits such as durian.
How do you prepare a pomelo to eat?
Remove the thick rind and peel the membrane from around each segment. You can score the rind as it is then easier to peel. You don’t eat the membrane-like you would an orange or grapefruit but just the flesh inside. Pomelos are great in salsas, salads, marinades, juiced, made into jam or just right out of your hand.
How do you know if a pomelo is ripe?.
Are pomelos natural?
It is a natural, i.e., non-hybrid, citrus fruit, native to Southeast Asia. Similar in taste to a sweet grapefruit, the pomelo is commonly consumed and used for festive occasions throughout Southeast Asia.
Is Pomelo bad for diabetic person?
It was concluded that high GI pomelo can serve as a low GL fruit if it is consumed with a limited daily amount and thus can be supplied to diabetic patients.
What fruits can you eat for diabetes?
List of fruits for diabetes
- apples.
- avocados.
- bananas.
- berries.
- cherries.
- grapefruit.
- grapes.
- kiwi fruit.
Is Pomelo good for liver?
Pomelo is not advised for people with kidney or liver problems, as it contains a high amount of Vitamin C. As pomelo lowers blood pressure, persons having hypotension must not consume it. Pomelo rind is inedible, and only the flesh is eatable in nature.The Billboard Music Awards went down on Sunday night (May 20) at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.

This angle was returned and a brand new rear tee created thirty yards behind the prevailing back tee. Vegetation, significantly down the left fringe of the opening, was thinned to permit the renewed tee angle and enhance the final feel and appear of the outlet. Turf edges along the landing area were expanded barely to enhance playability and invite extra aggressive play from the tee.
Pin-ready house alongside the greenside bunkers was increased and the again left part of the green was supported to soften the slope falling away and return the flexibility to use these provocative pin places. Ground behind this green was a specific playability concern. The area was recontoured and turf extended to increase the chance of balls staying on turf, as opposed to rolling right into a desert wash past. A proper approach bunker was added to increase curiosity alongside the strategy, in addition to the view down the opening. The proper greenside bunker was shrunk to permit extra creative entry to back right pins and enhance playability by reducing the severity of trying to succeed in these pins. The right greenside bunker was expanded to 2 to protect the best facet of this method and supply a prominent point of interest displaying visual feedback on the tee as to the angle of this hole.

While he worked on over thirty programs including the famend University of New Mexico Golf Course, Desert Forest defined Lawrence’s profession and earned him the moniker of the ‘desert fox’. Those of us who tracked Golf Digest’s US high a hundred programs grew accustomed to seeing his name and Desert Forest highlighted when the journal’s U.S. The charms of enjoying golf at Desert Forest under the clear blue skies towards the backdrop of Black Mountain are as enchanting today as over four decades ago when Red Lawrence built the world’s first desert course. We serve lunch every single day during the golf season and host a member’s cocktail get together & dinner each Friday night.
When these drainage enhancements had been carried out, there was additionally a light renovation, primarily based partially on suggestions from famed designer Tom Weiskopf, an honorary club member who has at all times liked the course. In truth, in a foreword to Bill Huffman’s book, “Arizona’s Greatest Golf Courses” (Northland Publishing; 2000) Weiskopf credits Desert Forest with serving to to spark his lifelong ardour for Arizona. It occurred in 1965 when he was 22, he says, and he had simply arrived from Ohio.

Scott Cromer, the supervisor of Desert Forest since 1983, took us out on the fairways of Desert Fores, a course that has been very powerful on players through the years. From the ideas it’s 7,035 yards long with a score/slope of 73.9/149. From the forward tees it is 5,350 yards with a score/slope of 71.7/128. “We have a pure-type environment, and it is all the time a tough course to play,” Cromer says. The method was recontoured to reduce balls operating via the green into desert beyond, which varieties a gorgeous backdrop from the clubhouse. The front of the green was also expanded significantly into the method.
This allowed improved technique, turf situations and vistas. The restricted budget for Desert Forest’s unique development meant a great many areas along the perimeters of holes had been cut to allow contouring nearby. We utilized good spoils from different renovation tasks to recontour these areas, tying them naturally back into the encircling desert, enhancing the appear and feel of the holes. A less fascinating variety of Bermuda grass was simultaneously faraway from the tough to enhance playability, broaden and refine fairway mow strains, in addition to produce better grow-in throughout overseed. After I completed playing Desert Forest I thought of Pete Dye and how he had a preference for ending his programs with a end.
The only cause I suppose this course has dropped within the rankings of desert courses is that different programs have more dramatic land and vistas out there to them. It lacks the “drama” of programs that have extra variety within the land such as at Estancia or Desert Highlands. I do not assume lots of the other courses are better when it comes to enjoying the precise golf course. While not an extended par three, the twelfth has all the time supplied a tough goal with demanding cup locations. Pin-in a position house was dramatically increased, together with on the front along the bunkers and each strategic sections again left and proper.
Which, there in the Arizona desert, is precisely as Darlington and Palmer envisioned it. But one other of their creations, Desert Forest Golf Club, roundly thought of America’s first desert course, is anything however carefree. The commission to design Desert Forest went to Robert “Red” Lawrence, a founding member of the American Society of Golf Course Architects and protege of William S. Flynn. Any conversation about golf’s great visionaries ought to include the names Tom Darlington and K.T.

I wasn’t even going to go to the awards ceremony, and then I ended up going and I’m glad that I did.”
Swart’s documentary followed a group of men that Swart often saw collecting cans around Tuscaloosa. After consistently pursuing and failing to locate Vance, the main subject of the documentary, Swart caught up with him in just enough time to complete his film project, he said.
“When I finally found him, it was great,” Swart said. “It was by far the most stressful project I’ve ever worked on.”
Danny Ryan, a senior majoring in telecommunication and film, occasionally collaborates with Swart. Ryan said he can attest to Swart’s enthusiasm and drive when making a film.
“[Swart] is ambitious, especially in his documentary filmmaking,” Ryan said. “I think that he’s not afraid to push his limits and do things differently to tell a visual story.”
Swart’s influences and inspirations range from the fluid-camera style of Peter Berg in his work on “Friday Night Lights” to the narrative storytelling powers of Martin Scorsese. Whether the story is a fictional narrative or a documentary, Swart said he focuses on the visuals of the film.
Rachel Raimist, an assistant professor in telecommunication and film, taught Swart in advanced videography and said she appreciated the visual impact of his first project in her class.
“I remember thinking, ‘Wow, okay, this student who is really quiet in the corner, you shot that? That was really, really strong,’” she said. “[Swart] definitely has a strong aesthetic sense.”
Swart said he plans to direct his first music video this spring break in Nashville and will be working on a documentary project about a guitar maker in Leiper’s Fork, Tennessee, this summer. Swart said he hopes this documentary reemphasizes his fondness for telling small yet profound stories.
“I love finding the small stories because I feel like there are so many things that we just walk past in life and just don’t really take a second glance,” he said. “I guess I’ve just found that everybody has a story.”
Swart said he dreams of making a living by creating independent narrative films.
“I think there are so many things you can do with independent films that you can’t do with a lot of the oversight that you get with a bigger production and a bigger budget,” he said. “Some movies kind of stick with you forever, and I want to make one of those.”1969 FORD MUSTANG FASTBACK for sale <<

Looking for the Mustang you can get in guilt free & drive? Maybe you are looking for a builder but don't want to be best friends with your welder for 3 months? Then take a good look at this one, as the bones are very good.
The Marti Report shows this one was optioned well when ordered from the Big Blue Oval. While not a Mach 1 or a Boss, it still carries a torque rich 351 Windsor, 4-Speed Toploader and the optional 3.25 ratio 9" Differential. Luckily it has survived with its panels in place with no major rust issues or obvious accident history. When it comes to a 52 year old car, you will be hard pressed to find a better example for your next adventure.
Obviously the paint & interior are tired and ready for some proper attention at some point in the near future. Keep in mind that the original 351 Windsor is still under the hood and appears to have been rebuilt but no receipts are available. Mechanically the car sounds great with a nice rumble to the idle from an aftermarket cam, headers & dual exhaust. This one is making somewhere in the 325hp, well above the stock 250hp. The 4-speed shifter is tired but the gears change fine and the clutch works properly.
The interior is showing its age. It's had some attention here and there but it's time. The factory fold down seat is still in place which is one of the coolest options of the Muscle Car era. Lots of directions to go here with all the aftermarket companies offering custom upholstery for stock seat frames, upgraded door panels, integrated speaker set ups, full custom consoles, air conditioning, aftermarket gauges, etcbasically your imagination and bank account are your only limitations these days.
So many ways to go with this one you can really get lost in the possibilities. With the market so hot its very hard to find a solid entry level fastback in this condition.

For someone to be successful with a firearm when aiming a shot then two things are very important, they are the size and weight of the firearm. This is so because the success of your shot will most definitely be dependent on the overall weight of your firearm. When aiming a firearm your strength and your grip of the riffle is what will guide your successful shot. When the firearm is too heavy then your grip and strength will most certainly be compromised meaning that your aim may not be precise to your target. The night vision Aimpoint micro T-1 4 MOA compatible sight is designed to be light and also to be easily carried. This is a light weight compact firearm aiming device that is designed in such a way that it doesn’t compromise its functionality.
When in a combat area it is important that you have a good and reliable aiming device on you to help you minimize the risks that not having one poses to you. The Aimpoint Micro T-1 4 MOA Night vision Compatible sight features a broad field of view and with a strong structure that s designed to withstand even very extreme conditions. It also features a mechanical switch that allows speed, dependability and also compatibility with most models of night vision gadgets.
This model of night vision device also features a mount on it that is made to absorb the recoil effects of a firearm thereby limiting the chances of it getting damaged easily. The device is also designed in such a way that it can be easily adjusted to ensure its smooth elevation and windage something that makes it an ideal device for use in even rough terrain. Installing it is also easy because of the protective caps that it has that easily fit the holes found on the adjustment screws. This night vision device has the advantage being able to be used alone but it can also be used together with other devices.
The benefit that comes with using this firearm night vision device is its compact exterior that makes it ideal for use in even extreme conditions. Its lightweight nature also makes the overall weight of the firearm to be significantly light. When you have a firearm that is light in weight your aiming precision is improved compared to when you have a rather heavier firearm.

This is major defect that can be clearly pointed out about the The Aimpoint Micro T-1 4 MOA Night vision Compatible sight. The good news also about this device is that the problem about its battery cover loosening up can be solved quite easily without much effort.

The movie, though, offers a major attraction in the form of Sigourney Weaver, who steals the show as a brusque literary agent.
In 1995, 20-something Joanna (Margaret Qualley) has recently had poetry published in Paris, and she has come to New York to become a writer. Everything seems to come easily for her: She is able to move in with a writer friend, while seemingly adapting to the city within seconds. She finds a new lover at the flick of a wrist and snags a job at a literary agency that happens to represent J.D. Salinger, a recluse with legions of fans.
As Qualley portrays her, we don’t believe for a nanosecond that Joanna is a writer. It’s not that Qualley is unappealing; it’s just that she doesn’t carry off the writer thing. She doesn’t talk like one, act like one or obsess like one. Fortunately, she has a formidable foil in Weaver, who plays Margaret, a dinosaur of an agent whose computer-phobic antics offer some of the best moments in the film.
When Joanna and Margaret meet, we naturally expect a collision of wills, but that fun prospect doesn’t materialize. Joanna doesn’t seem to care all that much about writing and acquiesces to Margaret’s anachronistic clerical demands. Joanna’s one act of rebellion leads her to respond to some of Salinger’s fan mail, a verboten act that shows dramatic promise but ultimately has little payoff.
This pattern persists throughout the film. When Salinger calls into the office and gets Joanna on the phone, she barely reacts. This relationship could have been fodder for some juicy scenes, but director-writer Philippe Falardeau doesn’t seem interested in that. Another tantalizing scenario comes along when the hermetic Salinger goes to Washington for a possible book deal, and Joanna volunteers to supervise. Upon getting there, she sits in the hallway, reading her boyfriend’s novel, and then watches blithely as Salinger walks away.
Falardeau makes the decision to never show Salinger’s full face, or develop him much as a character, another lost opportunity. This strategy might have worked if the screenplay had fully realized Joanna’s character, but she’s kind of a blank slate.
Fortunately, Weaver breathes life into the proceedings, showing us the foibles and humanity of this literary agent without ever resorting to histrionics or sentiment. And the film’s set design, score and cinematography are all solid.
Falardeau’s point here may have been that the directionless Joanna was a person who needed to figure out where she wanted to go. But it seems like the film didn’t figure out where it wanted to go, either.
L“My Salinger Year”: Dramedy. Starring Margaret Qualley and Sigourney Weaver. Directed by Philippe Falardeau. (R. 101 minutes.) Opens in select theaters, including at the West Wind Capitol Drive-In, 3630 Hillcap Ave., San Jose, and the Smith Rafael Film Center, 1118 Fourth St., San Rafael.

Now, it’s unfair to boil down Christopher McDonald’s entire, varied career to one guy from the 90s. Most recently, he played a casino magnate in Hacks. But you go to Christopher McDonald because you want to see a blood vessel threaten to burst from a dude’s face. And that seems to be what Marvel wants. The Leave it to Beaver star has signed on to the Secret Invasion series, according to Deadline. The Skrull-centric Disney+ series already has Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke, and Kingsley Ben-Adir attached. The Crown’s Olivia Colman is allegedly also in talks for a role.
Per Deadline, McDonald’s role is “a newly created character that could cross over to the larger MCU.” Of course, every character in the MCU has the potential to cross over into the larger MCU; that’s kind of the point. But if that means McDonald can eat pieces of shit like the head of S.W.O.R.D. for breakfast, we’re all in.Achievements

“Very Pleased!”.Azure Cosmos DB for the SQL Professional – Referencing Tables
James
I had a previous blog comparing Azure Cosmos DB to a relational database and one topic that it did not address that I want to now is how to handle reference tables that are common in the relational database world.
A big difference with Azure Cosmos DB, a NoSQL database,.
(Side note: “container” is the generic term. Depending on the API, a specific term is used such as “collection” for the Core (SQL) API). Think of a container as one or more tables in the relational world. Going a little deeper, think of a container as a group of one or more “entities” which share the same partition key. A relational table shares a schema, but containers are not bound in that way.)
Embedding data works nicely for many cases but there are scenarios when denormalizing your data will cause more problems than it is worth. In a document database, you can have information in one document that relates to data in other documents. While there may be some use cases that are better suited for a relational database than in Azure Cosmos DB (see below), in most cases you can handle relationships in Azure Cosmos DB by creating a normalized data model for them, with the trade-off that it can require more round trips to the server to read data (but improve the efficiency of write operations since less data is written). In general, use normalized data models to represent one-to-many relationships or many-to-many relationships when related data changes frequently. The key is knowing whether the cost of the updates is greater than the cost of the queries.
When using a normalized data model, your application will need to handle creating the reference document. One way would be to use a change feed that triggers on the creation of a new document – the change feed essentially triggers an Azure function that creates the relationship record.
When using a normalized data model, your application will need to query the multiple documents that need to be joined (costing more money because it will use more request units), and do the joining within the application (i.e. join a main document with documents that contain the reference data) as you cannot do a “join” between documents within different containers in Azure Cosmos DB (joins between documents within the same container can be done via self-joins). Since every time you display a document it needs to search the entire container for the name, it would be best to put the other document type (the reference data) in a different container so you can have different partition keys for each document type (read up on how partitioning can make a big impact on performance and cost).
Note that “partitioning” in a relational database management system (RDBMS) compared to Azure Cosmos DB are different things: partitioning in Azure Cosmos DB refers to “sharding” or “horizontal partitioning“, where replica sets which contain both the data and copies of compute (database) resources operating in a “shared nothing” architecture (i.e. scaled “horizontally” where each compute resource (server node) operates independently of every other node, but with a programming model transparent to developers). Conversely, what is often referred to as “partitioning” in a RDBMS is purely a separation of data into separate file groups within a shared compute (database) environment. This is also often called “vertical partitioning”.
Another option that is common pattern for NoSQL databases is to create a separate container to satisfy specific queries. For example, having a container for products based on category and another container for products based on geography. Both of those containers for my query/app are being sourced from one that is my “main” or “source” container that is being updated (front end, or another app) and the change feed attached to that pushes out to my other containers that I use for my queries. This means duplicating data, but storage is cheap and you save costs to retrieve data (think of those extra containers as covering indexes in the relational database world).
Since joining data can involve multiple ways of reading the data, it’s important to understand the two ways to read data using the Azure Cosmos DB Core (SQL) API:
-ms. Point reads return a single item
- SQL queries – You can query data by writing queries using the Structured Query Language (SQL) as a JSON query language. Queries always cost at least 2.3 request units and, in general, will have a higher and more variable latency than point reads. Queries can return many items. See Getting started with SQL queries
The key in deciding when to use a normalized data model is how frequently the data will change. If the data only changes once a year it may not be worthwhile to create a reference document and instead just do an update to all the documents. But be aware that the update has to be done from the client side spread over the affected documents, doing it in batches as one big UPDATE statement does not exist in Cosmos DB. You will need to retrieve the entire document from Azure Cosmos DB, update the property/properties in your application and then call the ‘Replace’ method in the zure Cosmos DB SDK to replace the document in question (see Cosmos DB – Updating a Document (Partially)). If you are using Core (SQL) API and .NET or Java, you can consider using bulk support (.NET) or bulk executor (Java). Other ideas would involve using change feed, or if you really need a level of ACID consistency, you can achieve this using stored procedures, with snapshot isolation scoped to a single partition (this is not the same as stored procedures in SQL – rather these are designed specifically to support multi-doc transactions).
Also be aware that.
What are OLTP scenarios where a relational database is essential?
Avoiding the broader topic of when to use a relational database over a non-relational database, there are a few use cases where a relational database is essential:
- The customer experience and comfort zone is with relational databases. It is a reality that relational databases are ahead in the maturity curve with respect to tooling (an example would be foreign-key constraint behavior). However, it should be noted that this is not the same as saying that “more use cases are technically better suited to the relational model”. Rather, the barrier to entry in new customer projects tends to be lower because mindshare is greater in the relational space. In these cases, it often isn’t worth the effort for companies to upskill
- The system really needs strict ACID semantics across the entire dataset. Sharded/partitioned databases like Azure Cosmos DB will not provide ACID guarantees across the entire set of physical partitions (and likely never will). In reality, however, the use cases where this is necessary is quite small. Things like transaction management and other SDK-level things that go along with these aspects come easier in the RDBMS space, but this is really the same as above point – RDBMS is ahead on maturity curve for user-level tooling to help abstract paradigm specific concepts – but this does not make the paradigm better suited to a greater number of use cases
- Having a single data store that services both operational and analytical needs with equal utility, including tabular models – this is probably the most powerful argument, and NoSQL engines are likely never going to serve a data structure that coalesces as well into tabular models that produce reports, charts, graphs, etc. But again, history has proven that, at scale, the “one fits all” approach can have some non-trivial drawbacks. And the new Analytical Store in Azure Cosmos DB is addressing the need to service both operational and analytical needs
You can create complex hierarchical “relationships” in Azure Cosmos DB, which would have to be modelled in separate tables in an RDBMS. Azure Cosmos DB can’t handle them using joins – but again, this is a paradigmatic/semantic difference, not a fundamental flaw in the database model itself. In order to do the equivalent of what one may be trying to achieve in a relational database, you may have to “unlearn what you have learned”, but this comes back to your comfort level with a RDBMS, which is not a trivial thing and can be the main and very valid reason for staying with a RDBMS.
In summary, in a NoSQL database like Azure Cosmos DB, most use cases are covered. Some things are a little harder (due to lack of maturity in tooling), but most things are easier, many things can only be done in NoSQL (i.e. handling millions of transactions per second), and very few things cannot be done in a NoSQL database. Most NoSQL engines are characterized by having a lot more configurability, tunability, and flexibility than a RDBMS. And in many ways, that is the hardest challenge for newcomers.

Apgujeong-dong: the distinctions and class inequality of consumption spaces
Apgujeong-dong and Cheongdam-dong, as leading areas of fashion design in the Gangnam district, are places of diverse cultural infrastructure. ‘Rodeo Street’ in Apgujeong-dong is particularly central to fashion, life, shopping and culture, which should date back to the time when several famous fashion designers moved from Myeong-dong in the middle 1980s. The gathering of fashion designers triggered the formation of a luxury goods consumer zone with the emergence of luxury cafes and boutiques. [1] And this cultural and commercial emergence further influence the type of consumerism within this area. It is the result of the policies that divided Seoul diversely in terms of function since rapid development boom in the 1970s. [2] And as spaces are functionally divided, the distinct “cities within a city” came into existence unavoidably.
As Lee stated in his article Consuming Spaces in the Global Era:
“Apgujeong-dong as an upscale consumer space is distinguished from other downscale residential ones, and the Guro industrial estate area, recently transformed into a new digital industrial estate of the Internet and IT, is distinguished from Seongsu-dong and its vicinity, which remain a traditional manufacturing production area. Large-scale middle-class residential areas like Sanggye-dong are distinguished from Jamsil and Dogok-dong and their vicinities, which are upscale housing areas now riding atop a redevelopment boom.” [3]
And under that planning method, distinctions between spaces strengthened their respective independence, which further leads to the distinction of class within those spaces. Seoul is turning into a dual space containing both distinctions and contradictions. “Seoul can be divided into consumer spaces like Apgujeong-dong, production spaces like Guro-dong, and housing spaces like Sanggye-dong.” In other words, spaces in Seoul are classified and identified by class-based differences while being divided by functional differences. And among these spatial aspects, the spatial distinction with the emergence of the post-modern consumer culture can reflect the dual nature of Seoul. [4]
The concept of “distinction”, borrowed by French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, means that the distinction of lifestyles or cultural tastes that contain class distinctions. [5] The distinction of consumer space, such as ‘Rodeo Street’ as a consumerism space for upper class and Dongdaemun Shopping mall for the middle class, always exists. Although large-scale shopping malls, discount stores and entertainment spaces are built in suburbs in Seoul, this trend of decentralization of consumer spaces in downtown cannot dissolve the distinction of consumer subjects, their class inequalities or the living areas they live.
The decentralization of consumer spaces and distinctions in consumer spaces in Seoul reflects the spatial logic that indicates a dual urbanization of Seoul “as a third world metropolis”. And Apgujeong-dong, as the symbolic consumer space of Gangnam, was the product of an urban development policy undertaken by dictatorial regimes since the 1970s and was an icon of surplus consumer culture starting to emerge during the 1990s. The two issues of “developmental dictatorship” and consumer culture are related. And as a result, Apgujeong-dong, this upper-class consumer space, is “closely tied to the reproduction process of vested interests derived from Korea’s developmental dictatorship power”. [6] And whether those developmental dictatorships focused on expanding the reproduction of consumer capital rather than solving class equalities and distinction in living area should be critically evaluated.

This article provides a very interesting perspective to read into Seoul through its distinctive urban ‘consumer-scapes’.It is a very interesting idea that behind the distinctive nature of different consumer space lies a whole set of questions about class, social inequality and so on.It is also worth noticing that how today architecture is devised for consumerism, and just by mapping out the spaces that are being air-conditioned and those are not, we will be able to come up with a map to understand class inequalities – as the higher class is always privileged with ‘conditioned’ space while the lower class are more often confined to the ‘conditional’ space.Services

How to prepare yourself and have a safe retreat. I am sharing with you my personal experience I had during my first Ayahuasca ceremony.
Posted on Tue 16 Nov 2021 · by Laura Stasius
How to Prepare Yourself and Have a Safe Retreat Experience
It is definitely true that a unique travel experience can change your life forever. Either because being in a different country and learning from other cultures opens your mind to new dimensions, or because you decide to travel in order to learn more about yourself and your environment on a deeper level. Peru offers great opportunities to embrace your spiritual connection, exploring the Andean Cosmovision, its vibrant culture and incredible landscape. In this story, I am sharing with you my personal experience I had during my first Ayahuasca ceremony and tell you everything you need to know about it.
Rule #1: Don't have expectations and don't be afraid
I have always heard about the great benefits of the ayahuasca plant and life-changing experiences people had after their ayahuasca retreat. Before taking ayahuasca, I did some research to learn more about the actual effects and benefits, but there are so many different stories on the internet, good and bad ones, that I just got more confused afterwards. Then I decided to just focus on myself and my personal journey with the plant medicine. The first thing I learned was not to be afraid and not to have expectations - every individual has a different experience with ayahuasca and before taking it you cannot know what the plant is about to teach and show you. You can think about your personal intention you want to set, but you cannot expect that you will heal specific traumas during your ayahuasca ceremony; or that you see precise things about your future.
Besides, it is important to acknowledge that ayahuasca is not going to solve all your personal problems and traumas - you yourself already have to feel complete before; ayahuasca only opens a new door that you can go through if you feel ready. The ayahuasca ceremony will always be different as you have imagined or expected. I assumed I would heal specific traumas I had experienced in my life, but during my ceremony I had completely different visions. So, try to just accept whatever Mother Ayahuasca wants to show you and don't be afraid of what you might see.
Rule #2: Intention and diet: prepare yourself mentally, spiritually and physically
Since the ayahuasca ceremony is an unforgettable and overwhelming experience, it is recommended to prepare yourself well. Setting an intention can be powerfully grounding and helps to become clear about what you seek to learn or resolve through the experience. However, do not overthink it and do not have expectations about what you want to heal or see. Instead of focusing too much on formulating your personal intention, think about questions, such as:
What do I seek to learn? What do I seek to understand? How do I feel at the moment? What is difficult for me at the moment? How do I feel about my life? Why did I decide to work with ayahuasca?
Try to consider these questions more as a tool that opens your mind and gets you into the right mindset. Instead of setting a fixed intention, just think about these questions, take a moment to reflect and always keep in mind that you cannot control what the ayahuasca medicine is about to teach you.For your spirit and mind it helps to do spiritual practices that embrace your connection with your inner world. It is good to be in a peaceful environment, take walks in nature, meditate, practice yoga or breathwork, and more. Do mindful activities that help you be more aware and present before the retreat starts.It is very important to follow a diet before your medicine retreat. By reducing your sugar, fat, caffeine, alcohol and drug consumption, you become increasingly aware of your actual feelings. Even though the word sacrifice has a bad reputation, it has the word “sacred” in it. By abstaining from your pleasures, you automatically create a sacred intention. So, it is not about suffering, but more about remaining humble and aware of your inner self.This also refers to abstaining from any sexual activity. Sexual energy is one of the most powerful manifestations of life-force. When we reach the point of orgasm, this vital force is sent either into our partner, or into ourselves (depending on whether you are intimate with your partner or alone). No matter how good it feels, it can be a way of depleting ourselves. The shamanic healers recommend abstaining from sex to be able to build up this power and stay focused on our intentions before our ayahuasca ceremony.
Rule #3: Find a safe retreat center that you feel comfortable with: the Etnikas Center
During your ayahuasca ceremony you are just focusing on your inner journey and disconnect from the outer world. This is why it is incredibly significant to find a very safe place with a professional team, where you feel in good hands. Travel and Healing only works with the Etnikas Ayahuasca Retreat Center because they are the only ones that combine the Andean cosmovision with the Amazonian healing medicine, and provide one of the safest ceremonies worldwide. The Etnikas Center is an integrative medicine center that works with indegenous healers from the Andes Mountains and the Amazon rainforest, and the health ministry of Peru has recognised their authenticity and responsibility for their services.
Etnikas Ayahuasca Retreat Center located in San Salvador.
The retreat center consists of beautiful rustic houses, each of them surrounded by nature and the high mountains of the Sacred Valley in San Salvador. When I arrived there, I immediately felt the peaceful atmosphere and vibrant energy. It is the perfect place to just focus on your inner healing process and spiritual growth, without having those distractions that usually keep you busy.
Before the actual ceremony starts, the medical team asks you to fill out a medical report with a doctor. You can either choose to go to a doctor by yourself and let them fill it out for you, or you can do the medical examination at the Etnikas Center. Upon arrival at the center in San Salvador, the staff welcomes you warmly and you participate in several group sessions and individual consultations. They are making sure that you feel ready for this transformational experience and explain every little detail. During our group session, we talked about any questions and doubts, and I remember that afterwards I didn't feel nervous anymore because I knew that Mother Ayahuasca would teach me what I needed to understand, no matter what exactly I would be seeing.
Then, we walked down to the river and performed a Cleansing Ceremony with Andean Maestros. The shamanic healers sprinkled water all over my body with some Andean plants, removing the negative energy and blockages I was carrying with me. When I closed my eyes, I thought about everything I did and focused on forgiving myself. Suddenly, I felt at peace with myself and very calm. We walked back to the main building of the center, and had another medical examination. There was a team of nurses and doctors that checked our overall health condition. For example, they were doing an ECG to evaluate the heart condition of each participant. Afterwards, I had a private consultation with a psychologist, who asked me about my previous experiences with hallucinogenic substances and personal experiences that affected me in a way, to make sure that I felt mentally ready and to be able to support me in case I would experience difficult moments during my ceremony. Then I walked to the main room, where the Shipido Shamans and staff were waiting for me, and made myself comfortable with my water, sleeping bag, pillows and mattress.
Ayahuasca retreat experience with Shipibo shamans from the Amazon and Maestros from the Qeros Nation of the Andes.
What Ayahuasca taught and showed me
I started to practice a meditation technique that the Etnikas team were showing to us, a meditation based on the principle of unconditional love (in Quechua: MUNAY). Having a positive mindset and nurturing yourself with love and gratitude helps you connect with Mother Ayahuasca and Mother Earth. Then the ceremony started and I drank the medicine; it is just one single shot of dark-brown liquid. I closed my eyes and continued with the meditation to embrace my inner connection. The ceremony was guided by the Shipibo Maestros, they started to play their instruments and sang beautifully in their own language to guide our trip. Approximately after 40 minutes, my visions started little by little. At first I only saw colours and different shapes, later the visions became clearer and I saw specific situations and moments. Of course, it is almost impossible to describe what I saw during my ayahuasca ceremony, but I will try to share my main visions with you.
At the beginning, I connected my whole being and essence with Mother Ayahuasca and the jungle by becoming a plant. When I looked down at my body, there was a moment in which I noticed that I was a beautiful, powerful plant. The more I looked at my green body, the more I understood how nature was, and felt the sadness and happiness of Mother Earth, the plants, and the jungle. I felt the pain that we as human beings were causing to Mother Nature; all the damage we do to her. I started to realize the beauty and wonders of the whole existence of everything; the circle of life, and how everything is deeply interconnected and working as one complex organism, consisting of many individual organisms. It is an incredible experience not to only understand this deep interconnection, but to actually really FEEL this pure essence of life and nature.
Then, I started to clean my body by vomiting. This was the moment when all my visions changed to my personal life, and I could feel the presence of God. God started to talk to me and told me many important things about myself, my family, and my personal decisions in life. Also, he started to show me all my illnesses and negative things about myself and my body, pointing out to me what I needed to heal. I started to receive spiritual messages about myself and about the loved ones that are surrounding me, especially about my family and partner. At the end of my ceremony, I just received all the good energies and positive sensations of the plant, filling my spirit up with love and positivity. It was such an unforgettable and beautiful experience!
When the ceremony was over and the effects faded, I just felt pure, universal love towards myself, everybody and everything. This feeling did not stop afterwards, I kept on feeling like this for at least one more month after the ceremony. I strongly felt this positive energy of pure love that was nurturing me. Something changed after my experience with Ayahuasca. I feel like I am now perceiving and feeling each moment with my heart, just taking it in and feeling it with a lot of gratitude towards myself, Mother Earth and the whole cosmos. I learned that I should think less with my head, think less about my problems and focus less on being stuck in my life. Instead I should feel more with my heart, feel each emotion with its pureness and focus on the solutions and the things that I am capable of doing! I am so grateful for this unique opportunity that I had thanks to ayahuasca.
I hope I could help you understand a bit more the essence of ayahuasca and how an actual ceremony works. Just remember not to be afraid and accept to receive everything that the plant medicine wants you to learn. I recommend you to do an ayahuasca retreat with Travel and Healing, they supported and guided me through my transformational process from the beginning till the end. They were taking care of me like a family! If you would like to know more about spiritual experiences with the Inca plant medicine Ayahuasca, just click HERE for more inspirations and information. You can either choose to participate in an ayahuasca retreat only, or combine it with other mindful activities in Peru.CSO TO PERFORM Symphony 5 in 2022
The CSO has scheduled a concert performance of Symphony No. 5 Childhood on June 11 in a concert called Fantasia
REMEMBER PARIHAKA is RNZ's free classical podcast for November.
SYMPHONY No. 5 Childhood recording and review
A new review by Nick Barnard is posted at MusicWeb International
"His handling of a full symphony orchestra is exceptionally assured and effective. The opening of the symphony features an instantly memorable yet naive tune using tuned percussion and harp to suggest a musicbox in a disarmingly charming way. But this is not ‘just’ an attractive melody - in true symphonic form, Ritchie crafts much of the material for the entire work technically and indeed emotionally from this germinal musical cell. A recurring feature across Ritchie's scores is that he manages to write complex yet accessible music - within two or three listenings the ear is able to identify thematic associations. This ensures that these scores engage the listener quickly and compellingly."
Symphony No.5 has been released as a movie by SOUNZ, and on CD and for digital download by Rattle Records.
The symphony is an optimistic work, using childhood as a metaphor for renewed hope for the future. With the current Covid pandemic engulfing the world, more than ever we need some sense of hope.
It was written for The Christchurch Symphony Orchestra, to celebrate the re-opening of the earthquake-stricken Christchurch Town Hall. It was recorded by The Christchurch Symphony Orchestra under conductor Kenneth Young in June 2020. The first public performance was by the Dunedin Symphony Orchestra under Marc Taddei in September 2020.
The symphony is divided into five movements with the subtitles: Beginnings, Play, Hopes and Dreams, Life-force, and A future.
Each of Ritchie’s symphonies have proved to be an impressive fusion of public utterance and personal journey. The current group of five will be joined by a sixth, also written due/in response to the COVID pandemic but it is clear from the five already performed that this is developing into a powerful cycle of post-modern symphonies the equal of any.

With only one day left before the release of Lotto, EXO’s repackage album, it has been revealed on the 17th that member Kai will unfortunately be sitting out during the upcoming promotions in order to let his ankle heal completely without putting any strains to the injury.
Last month in July during EXO’s third concert EXO Planet #3 – EXO’rDIUM, Kai sustained a second injury to the ankle following the first in June, urging him to become almost “bedridden” with no additional activities that would involve harsh or excess movement.
A media spokesperson also reported that Kai will not be able to participate in the recording of KBS Music Bank, which is scheduled for the 19th, and that it will most likely be difficult to see the injured artist at all during the next few weeks of promotion.

The teenager’s current deal was due to expire at the end of the season and although Barca held an option to extend it, doubts had surfaced over the validity of the extension clause due to Spanish laws prohibiting longer contracts for young players.
Any fears of the new No10 departing have now been allayed though, with the Catalan outfit stating Fati will sign his new deal on Thursday, keeping him at the Camp Nou until 2027.
His buyout clause has been set to one billion euro, mirroring that of fellow teen starlet Pedri, who signed a new deal recently and is similarly seen as a pillar of the team for the future as they look to rebuild after the departure of Lionel Messi and the revelations of the extent of the financial pit the club is in.

University of Nebraska-Lincoln • 106 ADMN • Lincoln NE, 68588-0423 • 402-472-3755 • lbellows1@unl.edu
Laurie Bellows was named vice chancellor for student affairs in August 2020 after serving as interim vice chancellor since 2017.
As interim vice chancellor, Bellows restructured Student Affairs from a flat organization to one with meaningful and effective units and has provided a clear vision that has energized the office. She led the creation of the Big Red Resilience and Well-being Program and has supported the expansion of Counseling and Psychological Services for students.
Prior to her appointment as interim vice chancellor, Bellows spent 15 years in the Office of Graduate Studies as acting dean, associate dean and assistant dean, where she provided administrative oversight of the office, including graduate recruitment, admissions and retention, and provided leadership for graduate policies and initiatives. She also served eight years as a faculty instructional consultant for the university's Teaching and Learning Center and was interim director of international affairs for two years. She has been the director of the McNair Scholars Program since 2005.
Bellows is a professor of practice in educational psychology and member of the graduate faculty in the Department of Educational Psychology. She serves as the university’s Higher Learning Commission accreditation liaison, having led the university’s 2016 successful re-accreditation process. She holds a bachelor’s degree in education, a master’s degree in human development and a doctoral degree in psychological and cultural studies.
« Office of the Chancellor PageI wrote 2 years ago about how I was suicidal and depressed. I guess this is like a follow-up to that.
I write about it because conversation about mental health (even if you don’t have a diagnosis to ‘qualify’ you as being in need) is incredibly important. We need to talk about it constructively as opposed to capitalising on it, and when you’re in a dark place- what else is there to do but talk.
I fell into a small pit of depression again recently as life began to get too much, so I’m writing about it again 2 years on in an attempt to help anyone who needs this. I’m not an expert, I just want to do what I can.
Before getting into the actual point of this article; I want to say a sincere thank you to my old school friend in Tesco who randomly bumped into me (while I was quite wrecked) and told me how much she appreciated my blog, how she read it all the time, and how she used some of my ‘deeper’ posts to help her understand some issues that family members are having. Thank you to the random girl on twitter who told me that she could relate to the things I say and that she found comfort in it. Also the biggest to thank my friends who when finally told about what was going on in my life showed up to my house and put me in their car and did all the right things, flooded me with messages, and offered me their time and energy. Random acts of kindness go the furthest way, because they’re so unexpected. I have nothing to say but thank you, and I love you, and I am glad you exist.
So anyway. The type of depression I felt two years ago was more childlike. I didn’t know what to do, I wasn’t sure who I was, I didn’t know what I wanted. So many questions, not enough answers, and that made me want to give up.
The depression I felt this time around was a weight on my back. It wasn’t complete loss but it was burnout, which so many adults both young and old suffer from because it’s not talked about enough.
It’s the feeling of having so much to live for but no motivation to live it. Knowing that leaving would break your sisters heart, knowing that if you could just find some will to live you will eventually get a job which pays you enough to get a flat, knowing that something has got to give. But the longer you spend with time ticking over, the sand timer slowly draining all your energy and strength, the more you become a shell of a person. The more you think, “what good has it done to have come this far?”. The more you lose hope.
You can have all the strength in the world, but for me at least, I think the tipping point of it all is self-concept.
Back in April I went through some things but I was fighting. I felt like I was winning because life hit me with something and I could handle it. I was exercising and socialising and working; I was improving my mental state and health to a huge extent. What kept me going was my self-concept. Knowing that I was doing a good job- an okay job at best. Knowing that I could be proud of myself for not sinking and brushing off what had happened like it was a minor blow.
As time went on, I resumed
back to trying to ‘sort my life out’ long term. With sorting my life out came
pressure. I have a lot of improvements to make on my life, and I feel like I’m
running out of time. I’m doing my best but my best never feels good enough
because my situation doesn’t seem to change. I still go home to the same place,
I still face criticism every day, I work harder and harder and eventually that
critical narrative drowns out any good thoughts you have about yourself and it becomes
a voice inside my head. You begin to see yourself like a self-indulgent,
isolated, terrible person with nothing to offer anyone.
Then, there’s the whole ‘fading into the background’ thing. I go out with my friends but I am sad when I go home. I don’t talk about how I am sad when I go home because I don’t want them to bare the burden of my sad thoughts. I don’t want to be that tragic little figure that people hang out with out of pity; I’m the funny one. I make the jokes and do stupid stuff and share my clumsy stories and I laugh a lot. If I’m not that people will get tired of me. I can’t be like that for more than 5 minutes and I have to end every semi-negative sentence with “It’s fine though, all fun and games”, or else I am an awkward and negative burden.
Alternatively, you speak to people about your problems and you know full well that they can’t do anything about it. They can’t move you into a flat or get you a new job, and despite being offered a place in their house you don’t want to take it, because they will get sick of you being in their space. You will become a burden and then you have lost a friend. And then you are not only poor and homeless but also you are alone.
So you eventually just stop talking about it, and you feel like you’re slowly dying a bit. You’re on autopilot. Keep busy, go out, deprive yourself of things you feel won’t fit in your life right now. What good will talking do? But also how can I keep going when I feel like my legs are falling off and my stomach is in my throat at all times, and I’ve started bursting into tears at work while doing the washing up.
So that meant I, like many, felt like I was suspended in thin air.
If I have anything to write about from this experience which I can offer someone else; it is this.
Take a day.
Not a planned day where you put pressure on yourself to have a nice time, but a spontaneous, surrendering day.
I know you won’t ‘take a day’ because I told you to, if anything you’re probably gonna sit there rolling your eyes and be like ‘fucking not this again, you don’t UNDErStAND, I CAN’T take A DaY, It won’t fix my problems! It wont cure my depression! It won’t put me in a flat by tomorrow and get rid of all of my traumas!’
And yea, you right. They were my excuses too.
For me, I seem to have to reach the point where I either mentally or physically cannot seem to go on before I “take a day”.
Last time I did this I quit my job and ran away with a friend for 3 days before befriending a group of people who weren’t the best for me, started living out of cars and squatting in flats, and generally went on a mad one. Needless to say, that contributed to my reluctance of ‘taking a day’.
This time around, I had a doctors appointment before work, came out crying because the doctor had basically told me there was nothing he could do and asked me if I had considered ‘joining the army’ (?), and booked in to see a different doctor which resulted in me calling in sick. Seeing as I had several free hours to fill and I could not stand the thought of being alone crying in tescos car park in my work uniform, I reached out to all my friends. I told them what the deal was so that they were on the same page, I asked for help, and that was my day. It wasn’t a special day, I was just running errands with people I love, but it was what I needed. A day out of the ordinary where I didn’t feel alone. That was all I needed to see that 1) people actually want to be in my company, 2) There is a life outside of my job and desperate attempts to escape my life, and 3) there is kindness in this world worth staying alive for
Side note- Something I will stubbornly stand by for the rest of my days is that there is NO shame in talking about being at breaking point. If I hadn’t had been so public about how I felt, I might have still been feeling the same for weeks. I personally refuse to be ashamed, and anyone who winces at the thought of being so open is not to be listened to, because they are suffering in silence and could do with some help themselves. They just aren’t ready for it yet.
There’s always someone who will show you a random act of kindness. Often in this scary adult world it feels like everyone’s forgotten, everyone’s too busy, nobody cares enough. But there’s always people who care. Not about what you wear or how you look or whatever, when it comes to that stuff I guarantee you that no one cares. But they care about you not feeling good. Even if they’re in the background of your life. Someone you don’t know very well might show you a random act of kindness that ends up inspiring you to go on. A friend may pick you up in her car at 1am because she couldn’t sleep, you texted her saying you were sad, and you chat yourself out of misery knowing that you’re not all alone. (Thanks mollie b). And in turn, your little acts of kindness mean the world to others. Surprise, you’re not useless! Your offering to dye your friends hair or post something for them is a small act of kindness that makes their life easier, and their gratitude for your favour might be as irrationally huge as the gratitude you have for a stranger on the street giving you a tiny compliment on a bad day.
These people can’t fix your problems, but people are all we’ve got. Sometimes being shown that there is something to be grateful for is what you need. Being shown. Not told that there is something you “should” feel grateful for. Actually seeing it and feeling it. Feeling that sense of knowing you can give back. Not being too busy feeling guilty for not having the capacity to see it. It’s not your fault that you haven’t been able to see kindness.
The day isn’t gonna put you in a flat before you can afford it and it can’t get you out of your physical situation- but it can show you a side to the world that drives you to carry on. It’s just a relief. That’s all you need sometimes. Just remember who you are, who surrounds you, how your place in this world is valued. It’s okay to ask for help. People don’t all understand things from your point of view but the more you talk the more people who understand you will come forward.
Learning to accept kindness is a process, but if there is one thing I urge you to do, it’s to take a day.'Files' File Manager App For Windows Phone Comes To The Windows Store

Amgen’s BiTE technology generates bi-specific antibodies designed to bring T-cells in proximity with cancer cells. In the case of blinatumumab, one variable region of the MAb targets CD3, a T-cell antigen required for T-cell activation, and the other targets CD19, which is expressed on the malignant B-cells – see diagram. The antibody brings the T cells and B cells in close proximity so that the T cells can engage and destroy the cancer, without the need for tumor associated antigen (TAA) processing and MHC Class I TAA recognition.
Fifty percent of patients with ALL are cured, by chemotherapy. The remainder will die within 2 years unless bone marrow transplant is performed. In the Phase 2 trial, 43% of patients that failed front-line chemotherapy had complete remission within 2 cycles. This therapy can extend the time required for BMT, without the need for additional toxic chemotherapy. Finding appropriate BMT donors is not easy, so, blinatumumab can serve as a less toxic “bridge” to BMT. Self-limited neurologic toxicity has been observed with blinatumumab, in a addition to cytokine release syndrome.

New Delhi:
In an important development, Cyrus Mistry on Monday announced his resignation from all listed Tata Group companies.
In a statement, Mistry has said that he will take legal route against the Tatas.
He also stated that his efforts were aimed at reforming the system, which may well be the reason for my removal.
‘Unknown to the world, I had confronted serious governance problems and ethical issues for a considerable period’, said Cyrus Mistry.
Earlier on Sunday, the ongoing boardroom war between Tata Sons and its ousted Chairman Cyrus Mistry heads to a major turning point with four listed firms of the group set to vote on resolutions to remove him as director from their boards.

First and foremost – I HAVE BOUGHT ZERO BOOKS IN JANUARY. I didn’t think I could do it but I did. I’ve been on an Urban Fantasy kick as of late and I own quite a few of those. I’m also working on a controversial non-fiction read. I take my time with non-fiction though or I don’t enjoy it as much. I have to finish it by March 3rd as that is when my Kindle Unlimited ends and I do not plan to renew it. I find I can read most of what I want that’s available on Unlimited within a month or two.
I’ve decided to not stress myself about posting on the blog so there may some weeks where I post frequently enough and others where I only post once. That does not mean however that I’m not going to keep up on YOUR blog posts. It’s a part of my morning coffee-before-work routine to see what everyone else is up to.
It hasn’t been a REAL winter here in my part of Michigan. All rain and ice and very little snow. Why am I complaining about this? Because it means I have little excuse not to go out when people ask us to and I was really looking forward to using that excuse to stay home more.
Mr. C&M and I have a lot of metal concerts planned this year. With no vacation to save up for, we’ll be doing more fun little things.
Tomorrow is the Super Bowl, which in general, I don’t care about BUT my boss has a crazy party every year so either I need to run out to buy a snack to bring or find an easy baked good to make, so ta-ta for now!
How has 2020 treated you thus far and what are you looking forward to the most???Oldest pages

Betting on groups that are not bad at scoring goals in matches

Sure, goals are hard to return by in any match, but some teams are just plain bad at it. By going for groups who are good at scoring you increase your possibilities of a win or a draw.
In the event you guess to win make positive the group can score much better than their opponent
If you will be risking your hard earned money on a wager, you want to make sure you’re backing a workforce that you simply know scores more goals on average then it competition that day. One football betting tip at present to comply with would be avoiding encounters between groups which are in the middle of their league table. These are the types of matches which can be unpredictable.
Looking for groups which are virtual lock to attain goals
There are certain groups which might be just so powerful they don’t have any problem scoring a goal or two in any match. These are teams that know the way to discover the back of the net. These would be the elite teams in a given league. The only problem with using this approach is that you usually get bad odds on the elite groups so it is hard to win long run like this.
You possibly can determine to be against groups which are extraordinarily weak
One solid football betting tip at the moment to use would be betting in opposition to groups which might be extremely weak. Just about each league has one or groups that look to be hopeless and appear to lose all the time. These types of teams are sometimes overlooked by oddsmakers. A stable plan to observe would be looking for matches where they are playing on the road in opposition to a mediocre team.
The house workforce goes to have good worth in this case, when the reality is it must be going off at lower odds. So make a plan to identify the worst groups in a given league.

When this technique may not work so well
Lucks performs a strong position in the game of football, and betting in opposition to a really weak team won’t always work in your favor. If the group is enjoying a really highly effective staff that could be away from their home discipline, they could nonetheless discover a way to win. However, the one thing going for the elite workforce is the really bad crew always appears to discover a way to lose.

Azithromycin therapy would be a primary antibiotic choice for Campylobacter infections, when indicated (see Medical Care), [30] with a typical regimen of 500 mg/d for 3 days. If the patient is bacteremic, treatment can be extended to two weeks. [31] However, erythromycin is the classic antibiotic of choice. Its resistance remains low, [32] and it can be used in pregnant women and children.
The use of fluoroquinolones in food animals has resulted in fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter strains worldwide. [33, 34] Quinolone resistance of C jejuni and Campylobacter coli is conferred by the mutation gyrA C-257-T, which can be identified with methods such as multiplex PCR. [35] A 2008 study from the United Kingdom found fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter species in 22% of poultry and 75% of pig farms. [36] High levels of ciprofloxacin resistance have also been reported in developing countries, with resistance ranging from 30% to greater than 70%. [37, 38] Some evidence has shown that multidrug resistance in pediatric patients in developing countries may be related to the food chain. [39] Consequently, their use as empiric therapy should be avoided.
Infections involving macrolide resistance could be treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate. [40]. [41]
CNS infections can be treated with meropenem. [42, 43] Life-threatening infections can be treated with carbapenems and aminoglycosides.
Antibiotics
Class Summary
Therapy must be comprehensive and cover all likely pathogens in the context of the clinical setting..
Erythromycin (E-Mycin, Ery-Tab, E.E.S.)
DOC for Campylobacter infections. Macrolide antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth by blocking dissociation of peptidyl t-RNA from ribosomes, causing RNA-dependent protein synthesis to arrest. For C jejuni (not C fetus) infections.
Doxycycline (Bio-Tab, Doryx, Vibramycin, Doxy, Vibra-Tabs)
Inhibits protein synthesis and thus bacterial growth by binding to 30S and possibly 50S ribosomal subunits of susceptible bacteria. For C jejuni (not C fetus) infections.
Imipenem and cilastatin (Primaxin)
For treatment of multiple organism infections in which other agents do not have wide-spectrum coverage or are contraindicated because of potential for toxicity. For C fetus (not C jejuni) infection.
Gentamicin (Garamycin, Gentacidin)
Aminoglycoside antibiotic. May be needed in severe infections. Dosing regimens are numerous; adjust dose based on CrCl and changes in volume of distribution. Can be used for C fetus infections. May be administered IV/IM.
Meropenem (Merrem IV)
Inhibits cell-wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins; resistant to most beta-lactamases. Can be used for C fetus meningitis.
Ampicillin (Ampi, Omnipen, Penglobe)
Broad-spectrum penicillin; interferes with bacterial cell wall synthesis during active replication, causing bactericidal activity against susceptible organisms; alternative to amoxicillin when unable to take medication orally.
Amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin, Augmentin ES-600, Augmentin XR).
Ciprofloxacin (Cipro)
Synthetic, broad-spectrum antibacterial compounds. Novel mechanism of action, targeting bacterial topoisomerases II and IV, leads to a sudden cessation of DNA replication. Oral bioavailability is nearly 100%. For C jejuni (not C fetus) infections.
Levofloxacin (Levaquin)
For pseudomonal infections and infections due to multidrug resistant gram-negative organisms. For C jejuni (not for C fetus).

Need help?You wrote us off, who gives a ****, we are the Cheltenham and we are going up...
Well, maybe, but you get the idea.
Wembley? Play-off final?
Hang on, that wasn't meant to happen.
According to the so-called pundits (here's one of them...) we were supposed to be licking our wounds, and digging out the directions for Alfreton's Impact Arena or Cressing Road in Braintree - yet here we sit, 90 minutes away from the Ricoh Arena or Fratton Park.
All quite mad really.
Plainmoor on Thursday night was a little 90-minute microcosm of the rollercoaster that our season has been, emotional, tense and ultimately euphoric.
It was also apt that 14 years to the day from the start of our amazing run of success, Jason Eaton's winner in the 1998 FA Trophy final under the old Twin Towers, we should book our return to the new National Stadium.
There was a link with those days, as Bob Bloomer, an unsung hero of that team and a stalwart of Cheltenham Town until his poorly-handled departure, was stood in front of me in the away end.
He was rubbing shoulders with Jack Butland, a star of the future who could have a European Championships or Olympic Games to occupy his mind in the next few weeks and months.
That night will go down in CTFC folklore. It will join Dover, Rushden, Yeovil, Rotherham, Doncaster and that Southport final and the Rushden and Grimsby wins as days to recall, and say 'I was there.'
Even though we had that 2-0 cushion from the first leg, there was no complacency.
It was all about the first goal ... about those first 15-20 minutes ... about quietening down the crowd ... no silly mistakes ...
It was also about our team selection.
4-4-2 to go for it, pace on the counter-attack, try and nick a goal?
Or 4-5-1, solidity, shape, frustrate them, invite them to break us down, while also having that outlet on the break.
Yatesy went for the former - opting not to change a winning team, putting his trust in those who had got to half-time in fine fettle to go out and finish off the job.
The first half was all about one man, someone who has had far more than his fair share of brickbats to deal with in the past, and after this display will fully deserve his place in CTFC folklore.
His performance was all the more amazing having been in, out, in, out and then back in the side this season - and with Butland standing barely 20 yards behind him, watching on.
Scott Brown made three fantastic saves, each one better than the previous one. There was tip over the bar, a fingertip stop from Ryan Jarvis and then the pick of the crop from Mark Ellis' powerful downward header.
It was a stunning stop and I cannot think of many better from a CTFC keeper in my 30 years of watching us. Ellis was stood holding his head for about 30 seconds afterwards. He couldn't believe Scotty had saved it.
In front of him, Alan Bennett and Steve Elliott were magnificent, while Keith Lowe, after a tricky start against Danny Stevens, and Sido Jombati were equally solid.
After the Brown saves and seeing Kevin Nicholson's brilliant free-kick leave the bar shaking, Torquay might as well just have packed up and gone home. It was going to be our night.
That was rubbed in after half-time when Benno deflected a header and, with the ball looping towards the top corner, there was Browny again to claw it away.
They battered us in that first half, let's be honest about it. I wonder now if Martin Ling regrets leaving Taiwo Atieno on the bench and making the curious decision to play Jarvis down the middle.
Lee Mansell and Eunan O'Kane, backed up by Damon Lathrope, were getting the better of our midfield, winning those all-important second balls and driving forward.
So credit to Yatesy for making that half-time change, with Russ Penn coming on for Jimmy Spencer.
The ball had not been sticking up front and Jimmy had almost been playing as the third man in midfield, so Yatesy opted for solidity with Russ, and it worked.
It gave us more of a foothold in the game, and we were able to get Jermaine McGlashan and Kaid Mohamed on the ball more and relieve the pressure on our back four.
We seemed to have drawn the sting out of them and they threw Atieno on and sent Ellis up front, which opened up the space for Kaid to thread Jermaine through, and just like the first leg he did the necessary off the post.
Finally, that was that, and Jermaine has repaid his transfer fee (whatever it was) with two touches of the ball, whatever he does in his CTFC career from now on.
Atieno's goal was annoying as we deserved a clean sheet, it was a consolation for Torquay and they merited it for their efforts over the two games, but with five minutes and two goals needed just for extra time, the jitters were mild as Sergio Aguero was nowhere to be seen.
Marlon Pack was, and he ended any doubt whatsoever about the winner of the CTFC goal of the season award with a sublime free-kick.
Sky's Don Goodman called it 'Premier League quality' and it is hard to argue with that, and it put the cap on what was a memorable night.
All it left me to do was to try to stick my roving mic under the noses of some happy CTFC players and officials without any of them swearing on live radio, and - despite the jobsworth Plainmoor steward who wouldn't let me out of the away end - I managed it.
Mo gave me a few jitters when he ran over to talk to his dad, but a scream of 'Get in there' on being asked how he felt about the prospects of playing at Wembley saw off that little worry!
So here we go again, off we go to the Smoke.
After the old Wembley, two trips to the Millennium Stadium resulting in two promotions and FA Cup games with West Brom, Fulham, Newcastle and Spurs, the CTFC soap opera moves to the new Wembley.
When we walk out there on Sunday, we will have completed the hat-trick of major stadia in 14 years, and not many sides have done that.
Yes, in among these heady days we have had two relegations and spent some time in depression with mad managers and close relegation calls, but that's all part of being a football fan.
You enjoy the highs and ride through the lows as something is always round the corner, and this club seems to have a knack of coming up with the unexpected.
That's what makes this trip to Wembley extra-special in my eyes - the fact that it is so unexpected, and that we have proved so many people (including some of our own fans) so wrong over the past eight months or so.
I have looked at the odds, and once again we are the underdogs - but at Crewe 11-10 and us evens, you could put a cigarette paper between the sides.
Much is being made of their 18-game unbeaten run, but we go in with six wins out of seven, and an unbeaten record in play-off games.
Nick Powell is the name on everyone's lips, but how will the young players like him cope with the big occasion? We have a bit more experience in our ranks, which may work in our favour.
But as the song goes, whatever will be, will be. Win or lose, the rollercoaster has been a fantastic ride.
Player by player
Scott Brown - Impeccable. His best performance in a CTFC shirt, topped off by THAT save from Mark Ellis' header.
Keith Lowe - Struggled early on against Danny Stevens but got to grips with him and nullified the threat. Brilliant goal-line clearance in the first half.
Sido Jombati - Kept Ian Morris more or less out of the game and defended solidly.
Alan Bennett - Led from the front and has re-discovered his form at just the right time.
Steve Elliott - Another braveheart display. Won just about every header and put his body on the line/
Marlon Pack - What a free-kick. Not sure he should have been man of the match but that goal will never be forgotten.
Luke Summerfield - Grew into the game and was magnificent in the second half as we got to grips with their midfield.
Kaid Mohamed - Not much ball in the first half but caused problems in the second, setting up Jermaine's goal.
Jermaine McGlashan - Runs down the wing for me... Our play-off talisman, with another goal. Can he make it three in three at Wembley??
Jimmy Spencer - Little chance to shine in the first half and was sacrificed as we changed shape after the break.
Ben Burgess - Ineffective in the first half as we knocked it too long but better in the second as we played more to his strengths.
Substitutes
Russ Penn (for Jimmy Spencer, 45 mins) - Stiffened us up in the second half and looked fresh after his recent rest.
Jeff Goulding (for Ben Burgess, 82 mins) - Did a good job when he came on, holding the ball up and winning the free-kick for Marlon to score.
Harry Hooman (for Jermaine McGlashan, 90 mins) - Got himself on TV....

He issued a statement Feb. 1, saying: “I want to be crystal clear: I am innocent of these allegations … The purported events simply did not take place. I will fight, with all that I have, these accusations.”
WATCH: Rev. Brent Hawkes addresses congregation for the first time since sex assault-related charges were filed against him
According to the “Support Brent” website, Hawkes attended Mount Allison University in Sackville, N.B., and later moved to Nova Scotia’s Annapolis Valley from 1973 to 1976.
None of the allegations has been proven in court.
Outside the courtroom, Hawkes supporter Kim Vance said the charges were part of the Criminal Code in the 1970s.
“We were quite astonished to see these charges come forward,” said Vance, national co-chairwoman of the Brent Hawkes Support Fund.
“We’re standing by him and we’re advocating strongly that these archaic and outdated laws have no place in the current legal system in Canada … Those provisions of the Criminal Code have been found to be discriminatory.”
Vance said the gross indecency charge, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison, was once used to target gay men in particular. The law, as it was written at the time, refers to “buggery,” a pejorative phrase for anal intercourse.
The two provisions of the code were substantially overhauled by Parliament in 1983 when a new offence, sexual assault, was enacted.
However, under Canadian law, since the alleged offences happened in the mid-1970s, the charges must be based on the earlier version of the code.

His interest for fantasy art grew during the 80s from movies like Indiana Jones, Willow, Ghostbusters and Blade Runner, to name a few. The Dungeons and Dragons related art created during that period also had a huge influence and sparked his interest to create his own worlds. After receiving a degree in architecture he soon found out that his passion laid elsewhere, namely creating fantasy and sci-fi related imagery inspired by his childhood experiences. The boom of the Internet at the end of the millenium and buying his first Wacom tablet were the main ingredients for him to produce his artistic creations. He currently lives in Lisbon/Portugal with his wife and two kids.

Many thousands of men—almost all of them clad in white—joined a handful of women for the annual White Party, at the Palm Springs Convention Center, starting on Saturday, April 25, and going well into Sunday, April 26.
All of the usual White Party traits—great costumes, $12 drinks (only tequila, vodka and rum were available, liquor-wise) and a friendly, buff crowd—were present, as was an early morning (in other words, well after 2 a.m.) performance by American Idol alum Jordin Sparks.

It might be easier than ever to work from home, but your productivity can be dramatically improved by the right home office upgrades. Don’t keep working from the kitchen table or the sofa when it takes very little work to turn your home office into the workspace you’ve always dreamed of, boosting your workflow, your online security, and your inspiration. Here are some changes to make today that might just change the way that you work.
Invest in Comfort
The more ergonomic your chair, the easier it will be to sit and focus on your workload. Never underestimate the importance of a good office chair, because you’ll be spending a lot of hours sitting down! A poorly designed, cheap, uncomfortable chair isn’t just annoying, it’s also sure to guarantee that you’ll spend most of the day hunched over your computer and hurting your back. Look at the best ergonomic office chairs available, and you’ll be able to work in comfort every day.
A good monitor for viewing your work is also important. Here are the 5 best ultra wide monitor reviews you can check to ensure that you get enhanced views for productivity, games, and videos.
Let the Music Play
Having the right soundtrack to your working day might be more of a positive change than you think. Although it’s rare to find an office environment where you’re allowed to blast your motivational soundtracks at full volume, in the home office, you have control over the ambiance. Invest in either a high-quality speaker system for your office space or consider buying an additional smart speaker (if you already have one). There’s nothing quite like the ease of not interrupting your workflow and just telling Alexa to skip to the next track or to pump up the volume without having to stop working.
Getting some Greenery
It might be a workspace, but you shouldn’t overlook the potential benefits of the right plants in your home office. Scientists have carried out thousands of studies about the various benefits of having plants in the office, and you might be surprised by just how beneficial they can be. Not only can the right plants help to keep your air cleaner and healthier, but they can also even help you work more efficiently too. Studies have shown that plants help to reduce stress while refocusing energy and can even positively boost your productivity by an astonishing 15%! Of course, looking after plants can become a bit of a hassle, so make sure that you only buy plants that need little in the way of care and attention.
Staying Safe Online
Home offices are much more vulnerable to cybercrimes than a centralized workspace simply because the home environment doesn’t have access to the in-house security of an office building. However, with the right attention paid to online security, you can keep you, your online accounts, and your employer safe from cyberattacks. Password management is crucial in this day and age, and if you’re still using Password123, then you really need to change it immediately. You will also be able to work confidently if you invest in proactive antivirus security that will protect your home office from viral attacks. As cybercriminals become ever more sophisticated, you need the right software to keep you safe from attacks. Don’t leave yourself or your computer vulnerable.
Get Organised
You might not have the boss leaning over your shoulder and complaining about the state of your desk, but your productivity will take a hit if you let paperwork start to pile up, and it’s scattered all around the floor and on your desk. It’s very easy to let a desk space become untidy, especially in those cases where you’re working through lunch. A tidier workspace is a more productive workspace, so spend a little money on some paperwork storage options. You could even use this opportunity to convince your employer to focus more on going paperless, saving the company money while making it easier to keep your workspace at optimal levels of tidy.
Consider Lighting
Natural light is always going to be an essential part of your home office. If it’s too dim in your office, then your eyes will strain after staring at a bright screen all day. That means checking your windows and your curtains/blinds. Make sure that you have control over the amount of natural light that you can allow into the room. Of course, not every home office will have that option, and that means adding some controllable lighting solutions. Desk lamps can be very useful for adding an extra level of light but avoid using any fluorescent bulbs. You want a light that is kind to your eyes, and don’t forget to adjust the brightness on your monitor.
The right home office setup can very easily become your favorite workplace. With none of the stress of the daily commute combined with the fact that you can decorate and upgrade; however, you like, means that the home office could be the future of employment. Get yours right, and you might never want to go to the head office ever again.Mississippi College Raising Awareness of Sexual Assault
With sexual assault a growing concern on college campuses nationwide, Mississippi College leaders are setting up information tables on the Quad to make students more aware of the serious situation, and taking steps to stop it.
A recent study of over 150,000 students at 27 universities shows 23 percent of the women reported they were victims of sexual assault. The numbers rose as high as 34 percent for female seniors at the University of Michigan and 32 percent at Yale, according to the Association of American Universities report released last fall. Schools like the University of Florida, Iowa State and Cal Tech were part of the study.
“Our focus this year is the prevention of sexual assault on college campuses,” says MC Graduate School Dean Debbie Norris.
“By providing information on what sexual assault is and how it affects everyone, we hope to empower our campus community to help prevent this from happening,” Norris said.
Staffers from the MC Counseling Center are helping spread the word. So are students. Donuts, white ribbons for men, teal ribbons for women and coasters will be distributed from 10 a.m. to noon Thursday to get the message out.
In April 2014, the White House Task to Protect Students from Sexual Assault released its first report. Findings showed that one in every five female college students experienced sexual assault during her college years. The report also noted 62 percent of the campus incidents involved drugs or alcohol.
While some may dispute the numbers, “everyone will agree that sexual assault is a bad thing,” Norris said. “We are focusing on how to prevent this bad thing.”World-renowned Danish pop-soft rock band Michael Learns To Rock (MLTR) performed grand Musical presentation at Tundikhel in Kathmandu on Saturday.
Around 15 thousand audiences were present and Jeevan Bhattarai of the organizer, ODC Network and ENGAGE Entertainment Solutions, said, the concert has been organized to give message that peace process has been already started in Nepal and to make Nepal known in the world through music. Other performers were Mt. 8848, Kutumba, Sabin Rai.

As a creative working in the advertising and branding industries I often get the chance to work on some exciting briefs for charity campaigns and social impact brands. At the ideas generation stage however it is all to easy to miss a vital link that could make the campaign go from good to great! This can often be something like missing a day or event that is associated with the charity or brand’s mission and something you kick yourself about afterwards for not having spotted. And I’m not the only one. Thomas Kolster, author of Goodvertising, has experienced this along with thousands of other creatives around the globe, so he decided to do something about it and make it easy for creatives to plan campaigns for good.
Every day people, brands and organisations fight for causes they are passionate about. To focus on the great efforts they’re making and the needy cause, many have chosen to dedicate a day or month out of the year to increase the awareness surrounding them. Some were started and are supported by bodies such as the UN, and others are days created by brands.
Most days are honoured by special drives, initiatives and functions that culminate on the day of dedication, raising funds, support and, most importantly, awareness for the cause. However, these days can be used for more than just creating awareness around worthy causes. They can also be used by advertising and branding professionals to coincide with, or act as the pinnacle of, campaigns surrounding a similar topic, cause or message. Garnier, for example, launched the world’s first 100% recycled newspaper on World Environment Day in partnership with the Times of India, with the intention of encouraging Indian young people to become actively involved in environmental work.
So what are you waiting for? Use the Calender for Good to plan your campaign to coincide with existing designated days, or claim one of the many days not yet designated and create your own! Buy one for yourself, studio or agency here.

Ed Carpenter's 2013 Season-End Blog
Ed Carpenter
Ed Carpenter Racing
November 6, 2013
It was a thrill for Ed to be greeted by legend Parnelli Jones after winning the Indy 500 Pole.
November 6th 2013 - The 2013 IZOD IndyCar Series has come to a close and now I can reflect on some of the good and the bad for myself and our Ed Carpenter Racing/Fuzzy’s Vodka team.
You know, we were definitely scrambling last year in the "rookie” season of the ECR/Fuzzy’s program. We really didn’t get all of the pieces in place until the Indy 500 as we played catch up with the crew, the parts, the new Dallara chassis and the all-new Chevrolet V-6 Twin Turbo engine.
We were still hiring guys when the 2012 season got underway at St. Petersburg and then we had a very tough month of May that included crashing a car in qualifying. The Fuzzy’s Ultra Premium Vodka Chevy came alive in the race and we moved from 28th to third before we had a wing adjuster problem with 20 laps remaining.
I will admit that it is a tough the 2013 season, help promote IndyCar racing in the past two seasons. It’s fantastic to have a primary sponsor as aggressive as Fuzzy’s on your side.
In the 2013 off-season, we did a lot of testing of parts and various equipment including running in the wind tunnel, the 7-post shaker rig, the gearbox dyno as well as some on-track testing. Our team was much more prepared and organized for 2013. We kept our entire crew and actually added another person. That is rare in motorsports these days.
We had a solid platform set up by our team manager Tim Broyles, lead engineer Matt Barnes (and his staff) and crew chief Bret Schmitt. The off-season was busy for me too. My wife Heather and I had another child in December and, with the three kids (Makenna, Ryder and Cruz), it was a little crazy at times. But we managed to get through it and even move.
We worked hard on the Indy 500 too. That race is the biggest in the world and it is our Super Bowl. We didn’t leave any stone unturned in our strategy for month of May. "Let’s go win the pole and the race” was our motto from the start of the 2013 season. We worked on our road racing setups too and we even had the defending series champion, Ryan Hunter-Reay, jump in the No. 20 Fuzzy’s Chevy at Sonoma in February to see if we were headed in the right direction. Actually, Ryan liked some of our settings and used them later for his DHL car.
The competition level then we worked on the qualifying settings late in the week. When it came time for qualifying, we wanted speed and consistency. Of course, the weather threw a wrench into some of the plans on Pole Day as things were moved back in the day.
We felt good about the car. However, I didn’t know if I had a pole car or a tenth place car. We ran fifth in the first qualifying session, and then took off downforce.
Winning the poley, I would have to say that this year’s race was the most competitive I have faced. There were so many good cars and drivers throughout the whole 200 laps. And you also had to adjust to the conditions. We were so close to being right there too. We finished tenth okay (7th). In the race, our car was good. But, with the temps being 20 degrees less came out late (just eight laps left) and Will Power was able to grab a good start and I didn’t have enough time to track him down. Had we had another 10 to 15 laps and I might have pulled it off again.
Overall, I could really see our team continuing to make excellent progress throughout the year. We have a great group of people in our team and off-season and plan to get back to the top of the podium.

They started after the September 2010 quake and, since February, have had more vacant lots as potential sites. But, a fair number of those sites are now turning into Wilson's-managed parking lots; Gapfiller's having more trouble in finding venues.
A suggestion.
These projects are great and help bring foot traffic to surrounding businesses. Open up a set of GapFiller Kickstarter projects for different sites. Let surrounding businesses know about the project. Set a project goal that provides enough money to cover rent on the site. Kickstarter works via assurance contracts: if they don't raise enough for the project to go ahead, nobody pays; you only pay if enough money is raised in total for the project to be viable. And, there's plenty of opportunity for GapFiller to turn the assurance contract into a dominant assurance contract by providing "GapFiller Supporter" tags to local businesses making the pledge even if the supported project doesn't go through. Then local businesses who'd benefit from the project have some incentive to sign on quickly rather than wait around to see if everybody else donates enough to make the project viable. And the guy with a vacant lot gets at least some revenue stream.
Let me get them started. I'll chip in $25 towards any GapFiller Kickstarter campaign around the New Brighton Mall; $75 if it's a project that my 1 and/or 4 year olds would enjoy (so things that run prior to 7 PM, ideally on weekends). There are a few flattened sites around there from which to choose. It isn't much money, but that's the point of KickStarter - lots of people each putting down a little bit of money gets the project going.
And I'd probably throw a few bucks towards other things around town that I'd expect we'd enjoy.
Eric is optimistic, he tells us to get into town. He does not tell us how to get into town.
Lets get them started with reality Eric.
The people with money have left.
You are alone in your shell of academic.
Please give us a detailed map Eric,
Please tell us about the joys of the desolate crashed spaces.
You are dreaming my academic friend, Christchurch is fucked.
I suspect there are probably more opportunities in Chch now than ever before, for those investors with sufficient nous and resources to risk a punt or two on the redevelopment. The CCC and CERA need to make sure they don't place barriers in the way of potential investors and innovators, but rather that they enact policies to encourage the redevelopment of the inner city. And kick start schemes as described above are one good way of helping heal Chch. Our city is only in dire straights if pessimists rule the day.
Oops, I meant dire straits I think :)
It would be awfully helpful if folks downtown could get a bit more certainty about constraints on rebuilding.
Agreed Eric, certainty and consistency.
Thought you might like to see that GapFiller is using PledgeMe, which uses the same kind of assurance contracts as Kickstarter, to fund keeping the Pallet Pavilion open for another season:
Great to hear! Have made my pledge... we greatly enjoyed the pirate party there this summer.Toggle navigation

Special guest: actor Jonathan Pryce (Sunday screening only)One of my key takeaways from attending ARLIS/NA was that we librarians from either side of the pond are not so different. I attended feeling unsure of how I, as a bantamweight UK art librarian might stack up against our heavyweight US colleagues, and yes there are definitely differences in how organisations are structured and where ‘librarians’ fit within that, but we face the same challenges and share many of the same aims in what we are looking to build on professionally. However. In one key area we remain poles apart. There is no tea provided at ARLIS/NA. There is no coffee or cake. Forget about lunch, there’s a shopping centre next door for that.
Once this had truly sunk in I realised I would need to maximise my networking potential at the evening receptions. Aside from liking the consumption element of our multitudinous ARLIS/UK refreshments breaks, there is one thing you can be sure will happen when librarians mill around with caffeine, cake and lunch; they will talk and connections will be made.
Thankfully, though, the conference organisers put on a series of fantastic evening receptions; beginning with wine and canapes on the Hilton terrace for international guests and first-time attendees, continuing with a gathering at the New Orleans Museum of Art (featuring the amazing Dr. Michael White’s jazz quartet), and concluding with a fantastic reception at the Ogden Museum of Southern Art.
I had also booked a place on the tour of the Backstreet Cultural Museum, delivered by its founder Sylvester Francis. The museum was founded to preserve the heritage of African American culture in New Orleans and encompasses collections on the Mardi Gras Indians, the social aid and pleasure clubs and the quintessential jazz funerals. Sylvester introduced us to all of the above, regaling us with tales of the prettiest Big Chiefs from days gone by.
Having elected to stay on a few extra days in order to more seriously contemplate the rigors of art librarianship I was lucky enough to still be in New Orleans when Mardi Gras officially started, on 11 February. This meant taking in the fabulous Krewe de Vieux parade; with political satire and adult themes at the forefront it was an incredibly entertaining event, and remains the only Mardi Gras parade to march through the French Quarter. It felt wonderfully topical as you can imagine. For those of you interested in any more of the non-conference related happenings in NOLA I’ll post up a photo gallery imminently.
In the mean time, I’d like to again express my thanks to those behind the amazing Kress Awards and their selection panel, and encourage any of you out there reading this to consider applying for the ARLIS/NA 2018 conference.

Alexandra – I’m happy to report that Artifex Press will make up for the lack of coffee and cake in New Orleans and sponsor a coffee break in July at the ARLIS UK conference! We had such a successful response to our launch while at ARLIS/NA we are making the trip to Dublin!
See you in July!
Phew, thanks James! Sighs of relief all round. Roll on July!Search

GW Cataphractii Terminator - February RPC
Guildenstern posted a topic in Show Off: PaintingThis is one of the five in the set, which I've been working on in my WIP thread. he's my test dummy for the theme, which is Luna Wolves. A white/black colour scheme which I converted to be light grey and black instead. I've always liked the Luna Wolves, in the stories from Horus Heresy, before they fractured into Sons of Horus and loyalists, so my take on them is right before the loyal Luna Wolves know that their Primarch, Horus, turned to the dark side as it were (aka Chaos). They were dropped on Isstvan III, where they expected to meet resistance, but it was actually a ploy to get all the loyalist elements in one place. Horus then virus bombed the planet and killing off almost all of the resistance to his take over. Anyway, so, my basing is based on fairly new wreckage of an urban type area.This article is available in:
At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, I had a glimmer of hope that maybe through this crisis, trust in science and the importance of scientific research would become indisputable. It felt like we would finally see an example of what a world without just ONE vaccine for a deadly infectious disease would look like. But the stories that the world chooses to focus on, and those that are shared across non-expert audiences, tell a different story. A story where the experts have absolutely no idea what they are talking about and are continuously contradicting one another. A story where your Facebook acquaintance who went to Google University ‘was right all along’ and continues to share their toxic conspiracy theories to undermine the global effort against this virus.
The sobering fact is that COVID-19 has officially infected over 36 million people and tallied up >1 million casualties in a mere 9 months1. We know both cases and deaths are being severely underreported around the world. The official number of COVID-19 deaths is drastically lower than the total number of excess deaths this year in most countries (excess is determined by comparing the number of deaths this year against the historical 5-year average per country; see Table below) 2,3,4,5.
There are many reasons why excess deaths may not necessarily be due to actual infections, but we cannot deny that the majority of them likely are. The data also shows that a surprising number of unusual symptoms – such as neurological symptoms, blood clots and strokes – seem to be associated with COVID-196,7,8. Furthermore, studies are suggesting that production of neutralizing antibodies is both variable and possibly not even as long-lasting as was hoped9,10,11,12. We do not know enough about the disease to make concrete conclusions just yet, but the evidence over the past few months has been quite alarming and attempts to downplay these facts are incredibly counterproductive.
So, why has it been so hard for people to trust the official narrative? I think the past few years have created the perfect breeding grounds for this virus – with rising distrust towards foreign (and domestic) governments and the attack against expertise in this ‘infodemic’. Unfortunately, in the current crisis, official agencies like the WHO and CDC have only added fuel to the fire with inconsistent and poorly explained information. When WHO’s official narrative that ‘masks aren’t necessary against COVID-19’ was changed by the CDC to recommend ‘wearing a home-made face covering in public or when distancing is not possible’ – the credibility of the WHO was shattered. Still today, most people do not understand the data that informed either of these recommendations. The public didn’t understand that the WHO focused on the fact that social distancing makes masks unnecessary, without realizing that in today’s society, distancing is not possible 100% of the time. Also, historical clinical research in hospital settings shows that even properly trained individuals are at higher risk of infection due to improper PPE use13,14,15,16. Just a quick survey of people on the street nowadays shows you that the vast majority are engaging in some kind of contaminating activity. Based on the obvious risks and considerations of wearing masks without proper training, an unclear idea of the infectivity and spread early on, and the looming mask shortage worldwide, a decision was made to tell the public that masks were not helpful. This was not the right way to convey the message. With my obvious hindsight bias, more effort to reliably and transparently share the data and educate the public should have been paramount to maintain their trust as the virus continued to spread. Overall, the last few months have been a public relations nightmare and the experts have looked like they had no idea what they were talking about.
Of course, I’m being incredibly critical of scientists – experts who have spent their lives furthering their respective fields and are not extensively trained on how to effectively communicate to the general public. There is also substantial blame to be placed on the media and their attempts to communicate science in an attention-grabbing manner, without sufficient training in scientific communication. This is why organizations – such as the WHO and CDC, with the help of many grassroots organizations – should be embedding a stronger science communication and literacy campaign within their operations. We, as publicly funded scientists, must also recognize the important role we have in engaging with the people who actually fund our work. Perhaps you may disagree with me, and that I am holding scientists up to a standard that doesn’t fit our job descriptions. Regardless of your willingness to step up as a science advocate, we must all recognize that we at least have a social obligation to ensure we are responsibly sharing our discoveries in a productive and understandable manner. Scientists frequently over-inflate and speculate about the broader significance of their work in scientific publications and grant applications, but this practice is relatively benign when read by other scientific experts who have been trained to critique the science and know that (A) scientists are extremely passionate about their work and (B) this is how we sell the value of our projects. But when we translate our findings to the non-expert public through the media, we need to recognize the greater societal ramifications. We need to take a step back and humbly discuss our exciting findings since the public is not trained in understanding scientific jargon or the way science is done.
In my opinion, there are four important messages we should relay to the general public:
(1) Science is an ever-evolving process. Specifically, one group of scientists makes a discovery that pushes the field an inch forward in a certain direction. In peer review, at least 2-3 experts within that particular field review the work, anonymously to determine whether the conclusions are supported by the data. They request extra experiments/modifications to substantiate the claims and advise if the work is even worthy of publication in the journal. A particular study may start to change the way we think about a particular idea, and other scientists will use those conclusions to make novel hypotheses that further support or refute this idea. As more evidence comes forward, a clearer picture emerges. COVID-19 is incredibly novel, and the current crisis has allowed for the publication of papers that have barely been properly reviewed – with >59 000 papers either published or in pre-print servers over the last 9 months18. Some published papers show a 24-hour timeframe between paper submission and acceptance – a feat we know is impossible in a proper peer review. SARS-CoV-2 research is most definitely the messiest scientific landscape we’ve ever had, and with this all playing out on a global stage, the pressure is high on scientists to show the public that we should be trusted.
(2) Focusing on a single study is never part of the scientific process. A sea of data from independent groups around the world builds the paradigm within a particular field. And as new studies emerge, we shift ideas and our focus. A paradigm shift is achieved through, what sometimes feels like a painstakingly, slow process. Explaining that it is incredibly rare that some radical ‘mind-blowing’ study will destroy the current paradigm is crucial. Or that some whistleblower in the vast network of publicly funded research is being silenced from releasing their scientific data is absolutely preposterous. Every scientist is skeptical to believe the work of a single study until future studies validate and expand on their studies. This is even more true now in the current COVID-19 crisis. No single study is the be-all end-all of a discussion in any scientific field. So why do we let the media report it as such?
(3) Science is not perfect. Mistakes are made accidentally, and there are bad players just like in any discipline. We know that the scientific process will weed out the overwhelming majority of this. This may happen in peer-review prior to publication. Or it will happen as a retraction, such as the Surgisphere scandal19, another polarizing scandal related to hydroxychloroquine, that may seem like another blow to science. But really, it also serves as proof that the scientific community can self-correct relatively quickly and that those ‘checks and balances’ in scientific discovery really do work. Even examples like the falsified and subsequently retracted work from Dr. Andrew Wakefield, claiming to show that vaccines cause autism, has its value. At least now, after 20 years of countless research groups wasting millions upon millions of funding on this question, we can actually definitively say that we know there’s no link between vaccines and autism. The question still remains: how do we convince the public?
(4) Accountability and transparency are core scientific principles. The scientific community is vast and impossible to silence – across both public and private institutions. The demand for transparent and comprehensive data from the experts for independent review will always exist. Debates about the limitations of emerging COVID-19 data, as well as criticism of the controversial actions of the FDA or CDC are continuously occurring amongst experts. This is taking place through official scientific forums, but also within the media and the very public realms of science Twitter and Reddit. The scientific community has been incredibly vocal against the two emergency use authorizations (EUAs) of both hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma therapy, because in both instances concrete data in support of their use does not yet exist. Now, with overwhelming data showing hydroxychloroquine is both dangerous and ineffective at reducing COVID-19 severity and mortality20, the EUA has been rescinded. These premature authorizations by the FDA are inexcusable, but also serve as evidence that the vast scientific community is holding these agencies accountable to make evidence-based decisions. The same can be said about vaccine approval, with most scientists expecting full access to the clinical trial data before FDA-approval.
Consequently, scientists are dismissing conspiracy theories, not because we are being silenced by our institutions against ‘speaking the truth’, but because what is being proposed by non-experts is completely illogical. Theories involving so-called COVID-19 patents filed years ago, microchipping by Bill Gates or 5G technology continue to emerge and spread like wildfire, making it increasingly difficult to explain why each theory is incorrect. Rather, what needs to be emphasized is that when true scientific concerns or debates about data exist, the scientific community does mobilize and act to address the injustice. This discourse is typically not as accessible to the public, and because of the lack of understanding in the scientific process, the public can be easily swayed by conspiracy theories that seem logical to them as outsiders. If we continue to try to extinguish each new conspiracy theory individually, we will never win the trust of the public during this Infodemic.
A new strategy is necessary – one that is centred upon explaining that millions of scientists around the world make up the many government scientific agencies (NIH, NIAID, Health Canada, European Medicines Agency, WHO, etc), professional associations and societies, university and hospital scientific networks, and privately funded institutions. All of these scientists – and especially the thousands of experts within a particular field – have access to the complete scientific research and clinical data to independently evaluate the work. A consensus across most scientists and medical professionals is achieved through independent thought and the continuous collection of supporting data. Scientific consensus is not static and can change due to new evidence, but such shifts never come from a single so-called ‘whistleblower’ because the idea of silencing so many experts across all these various institutions is just preposterous.
Overall, I believe if we can learn to more effectively explain the nature of the scientific process, we will regain the public’s trust in medicine and science. I am not arguing that the scientific process is infallible, but that the oversight from the scientific community gives incredible trustworthiness to the process. As scientists and medical professionals, we need to do our best to responsibly and frequently engage with the non-experts in our everyday lives. Be a voice of trust and take an open and communicative approach to sharing facts and directing people to trustworthy resources. Importantly, for your own sanity, know when to quit because there will be many people resistant to being wrong, and there’s nothing you can do. This is a tall order for us to fill, but something we should all strive for – because really at its core, public health demands that we first care about others in order to ultimately care about ourselves. And no, I don’t think this will solve all the problems, but it’s a worthy start.

US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron have discussed security co-operation around the world as the two countries work to mend fences after a rift over a US security pact with the UK and Australia.
Biden and Macron plan to continue their discussions when they meet this month in Rome at a summit of leaders from the G favour of a pact with the AUKUS allies.
The visits follow a trip by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Paris earlier this month, where he said he had "very positive, very productive" conversations with French leaders.
US Trade Representative Katherine Tai also met with her French counterpart Franck Riester on Friday on the sidelines of a G7 trade minister conference, where she stressed the US commitment to "strengthening the bilateral relationship with France," her office said in a statement.
In his call with Macron, Biden reviewed ongoing efforts by both countries to support stability and security in the Sahel region and to enhance co-operation in the Pacific as well as efforts to enable a stronger European defence, the White House said.
"President Biden looks forward to the meeting with President Macron in Rome later this month, where they will continue the conversation, take stock of the many areas of US-France co-operation and reinforce our shared interests and common values as we take on challenges and opportunities together," it said.
Harris will meet with Macron while in Paris to deliver a speech at the fourth annual Paris Peace Forum on November 11 and participate in the Paris Conference on Libya on November 12, her spokeswoman Symone Sanders said in a statement.
Australian Associated PressCriticising the recent incident of lynching by self-proclaimed ‘Gau Rakshaks’ (cow vigilantes) in Alwar district of Rajasthan, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday slammed BJP for bringing a bad name to Hinduism and urged senior leaders to control their partymen instead of giving statements in the Parliament against lynching and vigilantism.
Quoting Union home minister Rajnath Singh’s speech on acting against cow vigilantes during the debate on no-confidence motion three days back, Miss Banerjee said condemning lynching in Parliament is not enough.
“Charity begins at home. Why is Mr Singh condemning such act in the Parliament and not doing anything to control his party leaders? They (read BJP) are doing ‘adharma’ in the name of ‘dharma’. I appeal to all political leaders and the common citizens to stop such acts immediately,” said Miss Banerjee while leaving Nabanna this evening.
Miss Banerjee said she considers cow as ‘gau mata’ and respects it. “Some extremist religious groups are engaging in hatred campaigns and taking the law in their own hands. They are lynching people,” she said, adding that if a similar situation happens in her state she would not tolerate it.
Slamming the BJP for defaming Hindus, Miss Banerjee said: “We don’t need to take lessons from them (read BJP) for proving that we are Hindus. Hinduism is a universal religion. Our religion teaches us tolerance. It does not teach us to murder a person from another religion. If we can respect all religious then why can’t they (read BJP)?” she said.How to Follow a Dress Code at a New Zealand Casino
Each establishment in every country has a specific dress code, and so is the case with New Zealand. The dress standards vary, depending on the place that you are visiting, but some of the things that are common for every establishment are: you cannot wear dirty clothes, ripped jeans, flip flops, sleeveless tops, torn t-shirts, etc.
Such is the case with the gambling facilities in New Zealand. The New Zealand casino dress code has quite a few standards that every visitor should adhere to. That means that when you are visiting some of the most popular gambling facilities in this country, such as SkyCity Casino and when looking to play the most popular casino games, there is a dress code standard that you should meet.
That is the topic that we are going to discuss in this article. We’ll be taking a look at some of the do’s and don’ts when it comes to the proper dress code in a comfortable environment such as a gambling facility.
But first, let’s see what is the legal status of casinos in New Zealand.
Overview Of The Casino industry In New Zealand
All gambling activities in New Zealand are controlled by the Department of Internal Affairs. Most of the casino gaming activities in this country are legal and there are a total of six casinos that
operate in New Zealand:
· SkyCity Auckland
· Dunedin Casino
· SkyCity Hamilton
· SkyCity Queenstown
· SkyCity Wharf Casino
· Christchurch Casino
All players who are looking to participate in casino activities need to be at least 21 years of age. This age restriction is a common feature in every country. The law has one exception and it concerns horse racing. Betting on horse races in New Zealand can only be done on on-course.
Dress Code At New Zealand Casinos
As mentioned earlier, each gambling facility in New Zealand has a dress code that casino patrons need to adhere to.
Dirty clothes or footwear and several other inappropriately dressed manners are not acceptable and will result in you being expelled from the casino. Let’s start with the don’ts first.
What Not To Wear At New Zealand Casinos
Every casino in New Zealand is a comfortable environment in which every visitor need to dress accordingly. With that being said, let’s take a look at some of the clothes that you cannot wear at a New Zealand casino.
Flip Flops
Flip flops may be accepted at a bar or a beach, but not when you are visiting a casino such as SkyCity Casino in New Zealand. They are very inappropriate clothing and look extremely unprofessional.
Sleeveless Tops or Torn T-Shirts
When entering a casino, like the aforementioned SkyCity Auckland, being casually dressed is okay, but having sleeveless tops is just too casual. You also cannot just walk into the poker zone with torn t-shirts. That is very inappropriate and you will be most likely expelled from poker tables and the casino facility itself.
Dirty Clothes
Dirty clothes are also unacceptable at every casino in New Zealand. All types of dirty clothes or footwear will result in you making other customers feel uneasy, thus you will be expelled and won’t be able to participate in any type of gaming.
Insignia Hats
Many casinos, including SkyCity Auckland, do not allow visitors to participate in gambling activities while wearing a hat. There are exceptions to this rule, though. If you are wearing a hat for religious or medical reasons, then the casino will not trouble you. Other types of clothing that are not acceptable are men jandals, gang patches, and sunglasses. By wearing these, you will be inappropriately dressed and won’t be able to access the gaming machines or any of the table games. All other forms of torn or damaged clothing, except for fashionably distressed items, are also not accepted.
What To Wear At A New Zealand Casino
Now that we’ve covered what type of damaged clothing and other inappropriate things are not acceptable at facilities such as SkyCity Auckland, let’s move on to the dress standards that will not cause you any trouble at a casino. The dress code that will allow you to stay and game responsibly in a comfortable environment such as this are the following:
Formal dressing
A formal dressing will make you and other customers comfortable and thus, allow you to be in appropriate circumstances. There are two common formal dress codes – it is either a white tie or a black tie.
But, it is not a problem if you cannot wear them out for religious or medical reasons. A tie will definitely earn you a spot in the poker or the Players Club. They are not an unacceptable manner and gents need to be in a dress suit with a dress coat and appropriate trousers.
As for the ladies, they are required to be in elegant floor-length dresses and wear classy jewellery.
Business Formal Dressing
Other dress standards that are known for shedding a light on appropriate circumstances include business formal dressing.
Dark leather shoes and a dark coloured suit with a light coloured shirt is not unacceptable manner, rather proper casino clothing at facilities such as SkyCity Auckland.
As for the ladies, a jacket with a pencil skirt is preferred. Moderate heels will complete the business lady look, but if you cannot wear them for medical reasons, then you can opt-in for some alternatives.
Casual Dressing
Casual dressing at gaming facilities is also accepted, but there are limits. Jeans, khakis, button-down shirt or polo, and bright colours, if properly worn are acceptable. Once you meet these requirements, then you can proceed to the game responsibly.
Take Behavioral Standards Into Consideration
It is the host responsibility to expel you from the casino if you are not acting properly, so you need to consider behavioral standards. Failing to comply will not earn points and will result in a customer being escorted from the premises.
That means that behaving nicely is also patron compliance and one of the appropriate steps to take when visiting a casino such as SkyCity. Patrons detected loan sharking will be expelled from the premises. Shouting, arguing, or being drunk is also an unacceptable manner and will result in a patron being expelled from the premises. After all, SkyCity Auckland and every other casino need to ensure patron compliance and make it comfortable for players to join a poker zone and earn premier rewards.
On the flip hand, some of the appropriate steps that you can take are to act calm and maintain an acceptable tone in your voice. Be kind to other players and the staff. Who knows, you might end up with a free play.
Online New Zealand Casinos
Considering the rise in popularity of online casinos, you might decide to forgo the entire experience of gambling in a real-life casino. After all, the requirements to play online casino games are not so strict as having to follow a dress code.
If you're wondering what those requirements are, there are many resources to guide you, such as the best ruby fortune review. You might just find yourself more inclined to enjoy casino games at home instead.
Final Thoughts
So, to conclude all, torn or damaged clothing, dirty clothes or footwear, and several other clothing examples are considered being inappropriately dressed and in an unacceptable manner. If you do not meet these standards, then you will not be able to enter any poker zone or other gaming areas. Some exceptions, such as fashionable distressed items are made, but there are limits.

Entropic has announced a joint set-top box (STB) reference design with NXP Semiconductors. The joint reference design will feature NXP's newly unveiled PNX847x/8x/9x, the world's first family of fully integrated 45-nm STB system-on-chip (SoC) platform incorporating multi-channel broadcast receivers and Entropic's third-generation Multimedia over Coax Alliance (MoCA) 1.1-compliant EN251x single-chip network controller solution. The products are on view at this year’s International Broadcasters Convention (IBC) 2009 in Amsterdam.
Both companies will be showcasing a MoCA (Multimedia over Coax Alliance) enabled, high-performance, set-top box (STB)-enabled DVR reference design, which enables multi-room DVR functionality, allowing consumers to watch content stored on a single digital video recorder from any room in the house. The reference design will take full advantage of MoCA, the standard for home entertainment networking using existing coaxial cable in the home, to enhance the end user's connected home networking and HD video entertainment experience.
"By working with Entropic and leveraging their experience in delivering MoCA-enabled home network solutions, we have created a robust silicon solution that we believe should transform the economics of developing STBs globally," said Lewis Brewster, senior vice president and general manager, set-top box business line, NXP Semiconductors. "Building on our long-standing collaboration, NXP and Entropic are enabling OEMs and service providers to move to the forefront by rapidly and cost-effectively deploying high-performance, low-power set-top boxes that are fundamentally changing the way end users consume multimedia."
Leveraging the benefits of the MoCA home network, consumers can stream high-definition programming from a DVR STB to multiple client STBs in other rooms. By taking advantage of up to 175 Mbps of application layer throughout, 16 node support, parameterized quality of service (PQoS) and remote networkdiagnostic capability of the MoCA 1.1 standard, the reference design will provide for the bandwidth and processing speeds required to handle multiple streams of high-definition video in addition to other network traffic and personal content sharing, such as gaming, music streaming, photographs and other digital content.
"Consumer demand for multi-room DVR, content sharing and over-the-top services on their home network will continue to drive the need for more bandwidth throughout the home," said Vinay Gokhale, senior vice president, marketing and business development, Entropic. "A significant goal of our technology collaboration with NXP is to capitalize on each other's core capabilities and further leverage our combined experience and international competitiveness in delivering fully optimized home networking solutions to service providers and operators around the world."
The multi-room DVR reference design from NXP and Entropic features:
- Advanced Superscalar CPU to manage high-bandwidth, multi-room DVR streaming: PNX847x/8x/9x provides a powerful applications processor platform to enable multi-client, high bit-rate streaming without degrading performance of DVR STB hosted applications.
- An enhanced viewer experience through web-based content and applications: PNX847x/8x/9x is equipped with an ARM Cortex A9 CPU, a POWERVR 3D GPU and flexible content decoding engines to enrich the TV viewer experience with online VOD programming and internet based applications.
- Field Proven, Robust Performance: Entropic's EN251x provides the ideal connectivity solution to ensure robust, high QoS delivery o internet content across the home network to the STB, enabling future convergence of high-bandwidth, personal content applications without compromising the delivery of premium service offerings.
- Power Efficiency: NXP's innovative power management architecture is specifically designed to maximize STB energy efficiency. Bringing together NXP's advanced power control with Entropic's low-power MoCA interface IC provides unmatched power efficiency and enables system solutions that facilitate compliance with stringent ENERGY STAR requirements.In Today’s Deep Space Extra… President Trump speaks of Mars and a possible U.S. military space corps, while addressing U.S. Marines in California on Tuesday.

Directed by David Sington and Heather Walsh
There are some who think it is America’s most shining hour. Certainly in the annals of human achievement the American space program’s race to put a human on the surface of the moon has to rank right up there near the top and yet even that inspiring story had some less proud moments entwined in it.
Did you know that there were women who underwent the same rigorous testing that the male astronauts undertook and in some cases actually outscored the men? If you didn’t then join the club, one in which I’m a fellow member. It’s all true though; 25 female aviators were invited to take the astronaut tests of which 13 were able to pass. They became known as the Mercury 13 in reference to the original Mercury 7 astronauts who included Alan Shepard, John Glenn, Gus Grissom and Gordo Cooper.
They were invited by Dr. William Randolph Lovelace to take those tests. Lovelace had founded the Lovelace Clinic at the urging of outspoken aviation pioneer Jackie Cochrane who herself was eager to go into space. Lovelace believed that women were just as capable as men to be astronauts and thought that the prevailing attitude that women weren’t mentally or physically strong enough to handle the rigors of space flight was pure hooey.
The testing wasn’t sanctioned by NASA however and when they found out about it the powers-that-be at the space agency blew a figurative gasket. They ordered that the testing be stopped immediately and the women dismissed. The women weren’t about to take this lying down; they took their fight to Congress where they testified – often eloquently – about their right to explore, to do with their lives as they chose. In the end Lyndon Johnson quietly shut their program down without explanation.
The story is enough to hold your interest. Oddly, the filmmakers do some alternate history building by showing footage of the moon landing with a female voice coming from the astronauts, as if Mercury 13 member Janie Cobb had been the first person to set foot on the moon rather than Neil Armstrong; it comes off as a bit self-indulgent. It really doesn’t add anything to the narrative which I thought was better focused on what was rather than what might have been. The aerial sequences early on were well-filmed however.
Although not all of them are still with us, the interviews with the surviving Mercury 13 are a real pleasure. The ladies are still feisty although by now they’re in their 80s. One of their number, Janey Hart, would go on to become one of the co-founders of the National Organization of Women which would go on to lead the fight for women’s rights. As for the space program, it wasn’t until 1985 that Sally Ride would become the first American woman in space (the Russians had sent Valentina Tereshkova into orbit in 1963) and ten years later Eileen Cooper would become the first woman to pilot a space shuttle.
Fittingly, she invited all the surviving Mercury 13 to her launch and the footage of them exulting in the triumph not only of the shuttle but of women’s place in the space program speaks volumes about how necessary this documentary is in the age of #MeToo.
REASONS TO GO: The story is a fascinating one. There’s some nice aerial photography.
REASONS TO STAY: It’s depressing to think that things haven’t changed as much as they should have.
FAMILY VALUES: There is some mild profanity and depictions of sexism.
TRIVIAL PURSUIT: Sington and Walsh cut their Space Race teeth by making the acclaimed documentary In the Shadow of the Moon.

Being technically non-compulsory for private sales, bills of sale function as additional insurance that you’re acquiring what you’ve paid for, and that there won’t be any legal risks from the sale.
You should be aware of the number of specific kinds of bills of sale in Hawaii so that you could utilize the proper one for a certain transaction.
Of course, in case you require a bill of sale legitimate in the state of Hawaii, you can always download our cost-free printable Hawaii bill of sale form as a simple layout for your transactions.
You might not be familiar with the way a bill of sale works and protects you. Don’t get worried, herein you can find all the essential information. and conditions of the sale. Regarding the type of sale being concluded, you will certainly wish to use the correct kind of bill of sale example for it to be applied and recorded properly with the state.
Normally, in the state of Hawaii, you are not required to notarize the bill of sale. But sometimes, the purchaser or the vendor does want to notarize the bill of sale. There’s no need to notarize the titles given that Hawaii is a non-notary state.
This will not keep you from having the bill of sale notarized – that only complicates the procedure.
You’ll also give the identifying data for both the seller and the buyer on every bill of sale. This involves your driver’s license number, official name, and address. Transactions also need to be registered with the relevant department within thirty days from the moment of the trade.
In case a more special bill of sale template isn’t demanded in Hawaii, you may well use a general bill of sale form for any kind of bill of sale. However, you’re better off choosing a specialized bill of sale form if Hawaii does require it.
On the other hand, when there’s no specialized bill of sale, you can want to try and choose a general bill of sale in any event to get an additional level of secureness for you and the buyer.
You may also protect big-sized transfers of property by using these bills of sale, without needing that for smaller-sized properties.
Use these bills of sale for:
Considering the fact that general bills of sale are less specialized in comparison to other types of bills of sale, make sure you are particularly precise in the details of the property getting offered for sale and the conditions of the transaction.
Pertaining to motor vehicle bills of sale, you’ll need to make sure that you have all the information of the vehicle right for the bill of sale to be legal. Those bills of sale are considered some of the most generally used because they save both the buyer and the seller: the former from getting a vehicle with an unrevealed defect and the latter from partial liability in case of any possible incidents.
You will need to present the details like the make model of your vehicle, its most recent registration number, and additional details like the vehicle’s latest mileage to complete a motor vehicle bill of sale. To make sure that both parties of the sale are aware of the condition of the vehicle, you might want to have your vehicle inspected prior to the conclusion of the transaction.
Even though a Hawaii bill of sale settles the transfer of property, the purchaser may well also be liable for county tax, registration fees, and also other types of charges that follow taking ownership of that vehicle. Hawaii bills of sale need to comprise all the information outlined on the motor vehicle titles.
The procedure for a Hawaii bill of sale for a boat is very similar. You’ll require identification numbers and registration plates, as well as any other special attributes of the boat. A verification form for the serial number will also be required in order that the match of the boat’s identification number and the serial number on the record could be ensured.
By way of firearm bills of sale, it is possible to monitor when a firearm changes ownership in Hawaii, and for that reason, these bills of sale are especially crucial. Hawaii regulations demand obtaining a permit for purchase that requires a criminal history check.
Yet there are some points that are still required to be mentioned on the bill of sale: the model, caliber, and make of your firearm. Further data to be listed will be the individual information of both sides of the sale (together with their DLNs) and the identification number and the price of each gun.
The purchase price of the firearm will be taken into account for property tax rates and all additional costs that might be pertinent in your area.
You’ll have a thirty day period from the moment of the transaction or the moment you moved to Hawaii to document your vehicle.
You’re required to prove that you have motor insurance of at least $20,000 in coverage for every individual injured and at least $40,000 totally for everybody got injured in an accident.
The basic cost of vehicle registration in Hawaii is $45, yet your region might also impose some other taxes or fees on the registration of a vehicle.
All motorized vessels and sailboats larger than eight feet in length will need to be recorded. Even if boat registration is not officially necessary for the type of your boat, you may get much better waterways accessibility getting the boat recorded.
Fees for registration depend on the length of the boat. Autographed bills of sale will be required to change possession of the boat.
According to Hawaii law, handguns are required to be reqistered. You also have to document the propriety rights change or those firearms you’re taking with you to the state.
People are nowadays permitted to open-carry handguns in the state in Hawaii. Nevertheless, you do need to have a license to move that gun with you and are required to wear it in either a hip or shoulder holster.
The directions below are based on our custom-made bill of sale template. Yet, should there be a document provided by your local authorities, it is always advised to choose it during the transaction.
Step 1: Indicate the document’s creation date.
Step 2: Type in the seller’s and buyer’s specifics:
Step 3: Identify the motor vehicle being sold:
Step 4: Now, you need to choose how you’ll receive money for the vehicle.
Type in the sale date and write the overall sum that has to be paid for the vehicle. After that, choose one selling method:
The next step is deciding on the type of payment:
The very last thing to complete in this part is to choose whether or not all applicable taxes are included in the price.
Step 5: Read through the miscellaneous provisions.
The “as-is” paragraph points out that the seller provides no warranty and will not be responsible for repairs after the transaction.
Step 6: Sign the form.
The buyer is usually not requested to sign the bill of sale. Nonetheless, it is advised to have the document signed by each party. To play it safe, the parties may find somebody who’ll witness the deal and sign the form as well.
Step 7: Use the services of a notary public
Even though notarization is almost never mandatory, it may serve as one more way to shield against legal troubles.
The original document copy has to be presented to the purchaser since they’ll need it to acquire a title to their newly bought vehicle. There are two ways here: you should either prepare and sign a pair of identical documents or get a duplicate for the seller to store.October 19, 2016

Schreiben Sie mir in PM, wir werden reden.That's good to know....I just thought I'd gotten really rusty and I'd lost my ability to use a joystick.That's good to know....I just thought I'd gotten really rusty and I'd lost my ability to use a joystick.Yes, ESP is not working properly in 2.5.0.
Been flying around a lot of stuff with everything being unlocked for the moment.
Not a big fan of the Reliant. I had a feeling I wouldn't like that huge wingspan and I don't......really had to watch myself buzzing around asteroids in Yela.
Still not very excited about the Freelancer. I was hoping this would be my take a friend and have some fun ship, but I really don't like the view. It's functional enough....I assume we'll see more interesting goodies when they get the DUR variant out and maybe I'll be stoked again.
The Khartu-Al - wtf were they thinking with those struts? No way I'm ever going to get this ship.
I really like the Cutlass, as I mentioned before....and now I'm really thinking about picking one up. Especially with the rework that's going to modularize the interior and let you pick some different options. I'm really looking for a ship that I can either fly solo or find a friend to do a variety of stuff with, without being a big multi-crew ship like a Connie.
It's also more "fun" to fly than the Freelancer. Doesn't feel nearly as big and "space truck-ish." Has a loadout that can do some damage, and hopefully will handle better post-rework (they said it most certainly will - - and likely be faster).
I really like what I see on the rework info, with the new crew amenities (including 2 escape pods / lockers / gun racks / beds, etc), nice drop-down cargo hold, and docking station / tractor beam, it seems like you could really do a variety of different jobs with it.
We a temptation.
Just recently, over at Yona, a couple of cars (hell-drivers we call them) were confirmed to have been racing and in the process, one had side swiped a school bus. Luckily, there were no injuries to passengers or to the irresponsible drivers.
Problem is, luck is not always on our side as we have seen with the fatal accidents that have been taking place on quite a frequent basis these past months. These simply are meaningless -senseless deaths. As to who is to blame, who is at fault is after the fact and no longer matters.
Given the seriousness of the problem which is over speeding, the concerned authorities should no longer take this sitting down. A serious no nonsense enforcement of speed limits should be in place. This can only be done with the use of widely available technology as in radar monitors and other more high-tech monitoring systems.
The motorists should realize, that a 30% increase in a speed of 50 MPH from the normal 25-35 MPH speed limits poses a tremendous increase on bodily injury should a mishap occur vis-à-vis a 30 % speed limit increase would not translate to getting to your destination at 30% sooner. Therefore, when you increase your speed by 30% assuming your regular travel time (within speed limits) of a 20 minutes drive would not make you reach your destination at 14 minutes or a savings of 6 minutes, but instead all one can expect to gain is a 10% reduction in travel time (stats show this), meaning if you drive beyond the speed limits you will most likely be ahead of a law abiding within speed limits driver by a just a minute or two, which of course the question now to all of us would be, is it worth it? Is it worth saving 2 minutes of your time vis-à-vis if you were to be involved in a mishap and gain the risk of incurring a higher risk of bodily injury for you and the other innocent motorists?
Guamanians, should give this some good thought. Guamanians should adhere to speed limits. There is no room for over speeding. The risks simply outweigh whatever minor benefits one may achieve from over speeding.
In the meantime, our law makers should lend their support to traffic enforcers, the current administration should extend the needed logistical support for an effective implementation of speed limits, the needed equipment to give the needed teeth for traffic enforcement, coupled with the needed public information dissemination programs that would certainly lead to an attitude of prevention and deterrence. The fact always is that crime prevention/deterrence is always better than crime solution.
Guam drivers, let’s all drive defensively and safely!!!Where can i sell my breast pump

This week, you will write a review of literature based on the technology you are investigating for your Course Project. A review of literature may be defined as an analysis of published information in a particular subject area. It has some similarities to an annotated bibliography, which you have completed in a previous class, but differs in important respects. An annotated bibliography focuses on annotations, or summaries, of sources. In contrast, a review of literature analyzes the sources, draws connections among them, and notes changes in thinking over time. A review of literature will focus on the following questions.
What are the key points of agreement among the sources?
What are the key points of disagreement among the sources?
Do any of the sources appear to be outliers? In other words, are there any sources that bring up issues, or make assertions, that the other sources do not discuss?
Which sources appear to be the most powerful or influential? Are there sources that all of the other sources deem highly authoritative?
Are there any sources whose assertions seem dubious, illogical, or unsupported by the facts?
How has thinking changed about your topic over time? Are there beliefs that have fallen out of favor?
Successful assignments will do the following.

I have stumbled across a new passion: writing. It is proving to be insightful and rewarding.
You were distracted.
You were tired.
You didn’t have much to share, definitely not in the moment or in the mood.
Same old, same old. Too bad it’s such a chore for you.
It’s a chore for me too, at times.
I don’t want to rise.
Some days I don’t want to do life.
I stay in bed longer but I’m no wiser.
It’s a shame we feel like our lives didn’t amount to much,
As when you asked, ‘what did we do with our lives’?
Where did the yesterdays go?
When did the time pass away?
Now that our age has overtaken us time speeds up yet slows down.
The sun rises, the moon rises, the sun sets, the moon sets.
Noise becomes silence and the silence becomes overwhelming.
Don’t tell me about the noise.
Let’s lose ourselves in our youthful memories.
Let’s remember the melody of today and sing to the remembrance of yesteryear.
I thank you for sharing a few moments of your essence with me.
Until, when we meet again, I find it difficult to forget your absence, your silence.

I've sent repeated emails to Speednames, the ironically named company I use for hosting, since Thursday, and still haven't received a reply from them regarding what's happened to the site. It seems pretty useless that a firm that allegedly handles webhosting for some of Denmark's large companies can't reply to an urgent email within five days, but having dealt with them before I'm not particularly surprised. Needless to say, however, I am extremely pissed off as I sit coding this entry in html, pasting it, then ftp'ing it to the site in order to update this page, and I'm urgently looking around for a reliable hosting company to move the site to.
Yes, I too have a very horrible experience with Speednames.com. They do not reply to my urgent mails at all! Even after weeks of waiting. I think we should highlight our plight to others so that they do not experience the trauma we are going through. To me, they simply ignored my email. And the worst thing is that I have been a client for 6 years.
Posted by: Vincent | January 19, 2006 4:06 PMHow to use Moxie messaging, set up notifications, and manage groups.
Moxie's Messaging Center makes it easier than ever to communicate with your attendees and keep them updated all at once, all in one place!
General
How can I access Messaging on Moxie?
Moxie messaging can be accessed by clicking on the messaging icon on the top right corner of your Moxie page.
A message button is also be visible on instructor’s Moxie profiles.
As an Instructor, how can I control who can message me?
In your profile settings, you can choose if anyone on Moxie can message you, or only your clients.
Who can general Moxie members message?
Moxie members can message any instructor on Moxie from their profile page, unless the instructor decides to only allow their clients to message them.
How can I edit my messages?
Simply hover over your message, click on the three dots, and then click on Edit Message.
Are there any message length limits?
At the moment all messages are limited to 1000 characters.
Notifications
How are instructors and attendees notified about new messages?
Moxie members are notified about new messages in 3 ways:
Red notification bubble on the chat icon on the top right corner of your Moxie page,
Push notifications (if you are using the Moxie App).
What exact email notifications are sent?
You will receive an email notification when:
You receive a direct message.
Whenever there’s a new message from a group member.
Someone mentions you by name (using “@”).
Someone replies to your message/thread.
All notification types are limited to 1 email per hour.
How do I mute emails and notifications about messaging?
In the group, click on the three dots at the top right corner and then select “Mute”. This will stop all email and push notifications.
Groups
What messaging groups are auto-created by Moxie?
Moxie automatically creates the following groups for Instructors:
All clients: anyone who has reserved any of your classes.
All subscribers: anyone who has purchased one of your subscriptions.
Each specific class series: anyone who has reserved that class in the past, or future.
Class series: these are based on the class name, not by name/date. So, for example, if you teach a recurring series of Tabata classes, everyone who has reserved any one of those classes will be auto-added to your Tabata class messaging group. The best part about this is that whenever someone new reserves the class series, they’ll automatically be added to the group.
Can I change the name of a messaging group?
At the moment, you cannot change the names of the automatically created groups. You can change names of the custom groups you create yourself.
How do I create a new group?
From within Moxie messaging, click on the new message icon, select the clients you want to message and click on “Create Group”. This creates a custom group where you can add or remove people, change the name of the group, or freeze the group (this stops anyone from posting any new messages).
How are messaging groups sorted?
The group with the latest messages inside will be at the top, while less active channels will go down over time.
Who can instructors message directly, or add to a custom group?
Anyone who has reserved their classes, or purchased one of their subscriptions.
How do I delete a group?
At the moment you cannot delete any groups. We will be adding this functionality soon.
As an Instructor how do I leave a group?
You cannot leave any of the automatically created groups yet. We recommend simply muting them, if you do not want to receive any notifications about particular groups.
How do I message members of a hidden class?
At this moment, you need to select your hidden class attendees manually when sending a message, and then create a custom group.
Moderating your Messaging
As an instructor what group moderation tools do I have?
You can report and delete any messages posted in your groups by any member. Hover over the message and click on the three dots to display the Report and Delete options. Please make sure to Report the message before deleting, if you want to alert the Moxie team about a particular member. Once reported the Moxie team will review and take appropriate action which may include banning the member.
You can also remove any member from the group. Once removed, that particular member cannot come back to the group themselves - even if they reserve the same class. You can still manually add them back if required.
To do this, click on the three dots inside the group (at the top right corner), then “See All Members”. This will bring up the member list.
What does "Freeze" do?
Freeze function is available for your custom groups - it stops any new messages from being posted in the channel, including yours.
Sending attachments & GIFs
How can I send attachments?
Simply click on the + sign on the bottom right inside the text box, and select the file you want to share with the group.
How can I send a GIF?
Simply type /giphy followed by a word or phrase for the GIF you want suggested. For example, writing “/giphy gym day” would show you a randomly selected GIF related to "gym day". You then have the option to send it, shuffle a new GIF, or cancel sending it altogether.
Archaeologists excavating the scene of the most infamous clan massacre in Scottish history have unearthed parts of a "lost village" in the Highlands valley of Glencoe.
The settlement featured in the 1692 massacre of the MacDonald clan of Glencoe, supposedly because they had failed to swear allegiance to King William III.
Derek Alexander, the head of archaeology for the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), said the excavations had uncovered the remains of buildings from the small township, or "clachan," of Achtriochtan, one of three main settlements along the glen that are now abandoned.
Related: 25 Grisly Archaeological Discoveries
The three townships, each with fewer than a dozen buildings, are marked on a military map of the valley made in the 1750s. "It is likely that these were the settlements, although the massacre would have been 60 years before," Alexander told Live Science.
Inhabitants of Achtriochtan were among those "put to the sword" in February 1692, when government soldiers from the Campbell clan, who had been billeted in MacDonald homes in Glencoe for almost two weeks, were ordered to kill their hosts.
Witnesses said 38 men of the McDonald clan were killed outright, and dozens of others, including women and children, fled to the surrounding mountains and ridges. There, many died from exposure to the snow and winter weather.
The massacre led to a parliamentary inquiry and the dismissal of some Scottish political leaders; the event is also said to have inspired the blood-soaked "Red Wedding" scene of television's "Game of Thrones," Smithsonian.com reported.
Highlands massacre
NTS archaeologists started their excavations of the buried townships in Glencoe last year, in the hope of finding material evidence related to the 1692 massacre and any subsequent occupation of the Highlands valley.
Alexander said the latest excavations focused on the buried remains of a single house in Achtriochtan, one that's about 40 feet long by 20 feet wide (13 by 6 meters) and that might have been home to a large extended family.
It's thought that the stone walls of the house, which were up to 3 feet (1 m) wide, were covered by a layer of turf. This would have been done to insulate the houses and make them better able to withstand the mountain weather.

The NTS is holding an appeal to raise money to build a replica of the excavated house at the NTS Glencoe visitor center. The replica would use construction materials and techniques from the time, Alexander said.
But the investigations have been hindered because little remains of the house's stone walls, although its stone floor remains, he said. Stone from the walls may have been taken to build the road through the valley, and possibly later farm buildings. The stone floor may have been covered by earth and not seen by whoever took the stone from the walls, he said.
Mystery building
The Glencoe massacre of 1692 is infamous in Scottish history, but many MacDonalds survived and reoccupied the townships of the glen, including Achtriochtan, Alexander said.
In particular, several MacDonalds of Glencoe appeared on the muster roll of the rebel army of Charles Edward Stuart, known as Bonnie Prince Charlie, who attempted, and failed, to restore his family to the British throne in the Jacobite rising of 1745.
The muster rolls sometimes included the soldiers' occupations, and the one of the MacDonalds was listed as the keeper of a "change house," or inn, in Glencoe.
The house now being excavated at Achtriochtan was located alongside the road, so the building could have served as the local change house, Alexander said.
"Whether that was any different from any other house, it is difficult to tell," he said. "It might just be that you rested your horse there, stated who you were and got something to eat, or water or whisky or something like that."
A fragment of pottery of a type known as manganese-mottled ware, a ceramic used to make tankards, had also been found within the ruined building.
It seems unlikely, however, that more-substantial material finds will be found within the house itself. "Often the buildings are where a lot of the artifacts are not. They get cleaned out again and again," Alexander said.
Instead, many artifacts were often found where they had been discarded as rubbish in what are called "midden heaps," he said. "If we do more excavations around the structures, we might find more of the material."

The greatest and most important event in the history of the world—Jesus’ resurrection—was announced first to a small group of women who had loved and followed Jesus. These women then communicated the news to the rest of Jesus’ disciples.
In subsequent years, as the young church grew, women like Lydia, Phoebe, and Priscilla played notable roles.
Fast-forward to today. Where do we find women serving in the church? The short answer is—it depends on the church!
Our 2018 annual church survey sought to determine how women are serving in ministry leadership today.
Please note: My intent is not to promote any theological perspectives or provide any commentary on the biblical role of women in the church. Rather, I’m striving to share survey findings to help us understand the current reality.
In addition to the six ministry leadership roles included in the survey (which are listed in the chart), churches shared a number of “other” ministry roles women were fulfilling: Bible study teacher, small-group leader, sharing Communion and offering meditations, serving Communion and collecting the offering, reading Scripture in worship, serving as worship host and presenting announcements, leading and serving in outreach, leading in children and youth ministries, as worship leaders, performing weddings, day-care administration, leading in preschool or Christian school, women’s ministry leadership, serving on the senior leadership team, and counseling. Eight churches noted that they did not have women serving in any ministry leadership roles.
The accompanying chart identifies the six ministry leadership areas surveyed and includes a breakdown of the percentage of churches in each church size category engaging women in that type of ministry. The overall average is also included for each area of ministry.
Larger Church = More Opportunities
The survey showed that the larger the church, the greater likelihood of ministry leadership opportunities for women. For example, 55 percent of megachurches (average weekly worship attendance of 2,000 or more) had ordained women serving as ministers or pastors, compared with only 6 percent of very small churches (average weekly attendance of 99 or fewer). This was the greatest discernable ministry disparity between the largest and smallest churches we surveyed.
The second biggest disparity between megachurches and very small churches was for women serving as “non-ordained ministry directors”: 84 percent compared to 38 percent, respectively. This seems to indicate few very small churches have women on their ministry staffs (perhaps because many such churches have only one paid minister).
Interestingly, very small churches were far more likely than megachurches to have women serving as a “trustee or board member”: 26 percent compared to 11 percent, respectively.
Newer Church + Younger Lead Minister = More Opportunities
I sought to determine whether age of the church or the age of the lead minister had any impact on the number of ministry leadership opportunities available to women.
I discovered that newer churches had far greater opportunities for women to lead and serve. This was true for all areas of ministry leadership except those churches using women as trustees or board members.
The average age of churches using women in at least one area of ministry leadership was 66 years old. The average age of churches that do not use women in any leadership area was 78 years old.
The average age for churches using women to preach or teach was 59 years old. The churches not using women to preach or teach were, on average, 78 years old. The 19-year gap was the greatest of any ministry leadership category.
The survey found that churches with younger lead ministers provide more opportunities for women than churches with older lead ministers; this includes having women serving as ordained ministers or pastors, women preaching and teaching, and women serving as elders.
Among churches with women serving as elders, lead ministers were, on average, three years younger than lead ministers at churches without women elders. (Again, the only exception to this was for churches that had women serving as trustees or board members.)
The Big Two
Women preaching or teaching and women serving as elders have historically been lightning rod issues for our churches. It’s interesting how some positions have shifted over the last decade plus.
In 2008, we asked megachurches and emerging megachurches about women’s involvement in preaching or teaching. That year, 6 percent of megachurches and less than 1 percent of emerging megachurches (average weekly worship attendance of 1,000 to 1,999) reported having women preaching or teaching in worship services. That percentage increased significantly over a 10-year period. In 2018, 38 percent of megachurches and 24 percent of emerging megachurches reported that members of their preaching/teaching team included women. (Note that the way the question was asked in 2018 was actually more limiting than the way it was phrased 10 years earlier, and yet the numbers still increased significantly.)
In 2010, we asked churches ranging in size from medium churches (250 to 499 in average weekly attendance) to megachurches if they had women serving as elders. Overall, 3 percent of the churches surveyed in 2010 reported having women elders. Eight years later, that number inched up to 4 percent of churches.
Interestingly, in 2010, 9 percent of megachurches reported having women elders, but that number declined to 6 percent in 2018. Over this same period, however, emerging megachurches with women elders increased from 2 percent to 7 percent. Large (average attendance of 500 to 999) and medium churches were largely unchanged.
The Impact on Church Growth and Baptisms
Those churches where women had larger roles in leadership grew slightly faster than churches with fewer options for women (3.9 percent compared to 3.4 percent, respectively). The combined average growth rate for all churches in 2018 was 3.5 percent.
On the flip side, churches with fewer leadership opportunities for women had a slightly better baptism ratio (number of baptisms per 100 in average worship attendance) than churches with more options for women to lead (5.6 compared to 5.3, respectively). For the record, the overall average baptism ratio for all churches in 2018 was 5.6.
Where Do We Go from Here?
The trend in culture—and church, it seems—is to afford more opportunities to women, even in historically male-dominated fields. The week I wrote this article, Major League Baseball announced the hiring of its first female assistant coach. And we mustn’t overlook that more women than men graduate from college.
Will these cultural shifts continue to shape the church and its ministry leadership opportunities for women? Your guess is as good as mine! But I hope to continue to monitor the situation as future developments take place.

We want to take this opportunity to give thanks to the Lord for what He has done through each of you in supplying the needed support to provide this ministry of setting people free in Christ.
Thanksgiving is a major part of the Christian’s life. If we keep praising the Lord, we cannot have bad feelings toward people.
“Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your request be made known to God and the peace of God, which passes all comprehension, shall guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 4:6-7) .
“I will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth” (Psa. 34:1).
“It is good to give thanks to the Lord” (Psa. 92:1).
Thanksgiving is known to be very beneficial, not only to the one being thanked, but for the one giving thanks.
It is connected to a compassionate heart. It represents a very positive outlook in life, enabling one to view things properly, and more ready to receive benefits, especially from the Lord.
Billy Graham said, “When we sit around our tables laden with sumptuous delicacies, let us not forget that half the world will go to bed hungry. As we enjoy the comforts of our cozy home, let us not forget that great numbers in the world have no home to go to” (This is especially true for thousands recently). We need to pray for those whose lives have been extremely affected.
Someone said, “We will eventually lose everything for which we are not thankful.” None of us need more blessings as much as we need to appreciate the sweetness of the blessings we already have.” Contentment is wanting what we have, rather than coveting what we think we want.
A thanksgiving prayer from President George Washington is as follows: “Dear Lord: thank you for the wonderful gift You have poured out on our nation. In the name of Jesus, who died for our sins, forgive us and forgive our nation for enjoying Your gifts while trying to live without You. Amen.”
Please pray for us, for we are really desirous to help hurting people, many who are driving distances, coming to us for help. I think of the bride whose groom was drowned just before the wedding would take place. This is a verse of a song she wrote, “Give me a calm, a thankful heart, from every murmur free; the blessings of Thy grace impart, and make me live for Thee.” This takes dedication, love and grace.
We wish you a most blessed Thanksgiving season. We are very thankful for how you have supported us, enabling us to continue leading people to freedom in Christ. We thank the Lord because it is He who really does it all. Thanks be to the Lord! We want to continue to depend upon the Lord to express our love to each of you and those being helped.
Together for His glory,
Paul and Joyce

the way i understand it is you have income subtract standardized deduction and then thats it. If that doubles under trump then thats amazing (from 6000 to 12000)
now media is saying its actually income - standardized deduction - personalized exemption
so your already subtracting more than 10000 by default without the trump change
I am pretty sure most middle classes people were not taking standard deduction, and were itieising instead
so is there a personal exemption you can take in addition to standard?

A quilt is always made up of three layers (with the exception of a cathedral window quilt). There is a back, a middle (batting or another fabric layer) and the quilt top. Then all the layers of the quilt are quilted together with thread.
This process is what makes the quilt warm and strong. It is why quilts are heirlooms that last for generations.
Tshirt blankets are just that - blankets. They are typically made up of only two layers - often a piece of cheap fleece backs these blankets. They are not quilted together. The folks that make these count on the friction between the back and the front to hold them together. They are like cloth sacks that have been sewn shut across the top. They will sag in the wash and eventually, as the fleece loses its pile, they will sag out of the wash. This sagging will pull at the seams where the shirts are sewn together. The seams will start coming apart and the shirts will tear at their weakest points. Friends - you have held onto and saved your or your loved one's shirts for a reason. They are valuable and bring back memories of the wonderful seasons of your lives. Now is not the time for shortcuts. Please send your shirts off to me or another reputable quilt maker. I take payment in installments - very similar to layaway plans. Contact me today to get started!Cheap Louis Vuitton Fashion Pochette Félicie Chain Pouch M62982 Black EPI Leather

The sensitivity of vesicular stomatitis (VS) viruses to interferon (IFN)-mediated anti-viral effects has been well documented. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown the ability of mosquito saliva to enhance vesicular stomatitis New Jersey (VSNJ) virus infection in mice. To investigate the effect of mosquito saliva on virus replication and IFN α/β expression, virus titers were analyzed at various time points after infection in cells that were treated with mosquito salivary gland homogenate (SGH). Salivary gland treatment of mouse fibroblast cells (L929) resulted in a significant increase in virus growth kinetics compared with untreated controls. In contrast, Vero cells, which are deficient in the IFN α/β response, did not yield increased viral titers in the time points examined. Treatment of L929 cells with an IFN α/β neutralizing antibody also slightly increased virus yield. Ribonuclease protection assays revealed that induction of IFN α2 expression was reduced in L929 cells treated with SGH. Modulation of IFN α/β by mosquito saliva may be a critical determinant of the transmission and pathogenesis of VSNSmack_Daddy Posted January 19, 2005 Share Posted January 19, 2005 I am looking for the addition of two new classes.

A number of essential variations in diet program and way of living can assist a…
A number of essential variations in diet program and way of living can assist a human being decrease their cholesterol in a natural way with time. There is no instant take care of, but some people today may possibly notice variations in a make any difference of months.
In some conditions, a man or woman may well have to have medication to help decrease their cholesterol or control other chance aspects.
Nevertheless, even if a man or woman is having medication, it is even now vital for them to make improvements to assist increase their cholesterol concentrations and reduce their chance of facet consequences.
In the body, the liver will make cholesterol, which is a waxy material. Cholesterol molecules flow into in the blood.
The liver helps make all the cholesterol that the body desires, so a particular person does not want to consume cholesterol in their eating plan.
Cholesterol alone is not negative. Blood cholesterol performs an crucial role in helping build cells.
Dietary cholesterol
Other sources of cholesterol appear from the eating plan. Dietary cholesterol is existing only in food items derived from animals, these as meat and excess fat-abundant dairy products and solutions.
The Facilities for Condition Regulate and Prevention (CDC) take note that gurus suggest having as small dietary cholesterol as doable.
This is simply because incorporating much more nutritional resources of cholesterol adds extra of this compound to the physique and bloodstream, which raises a person’s cholesterol levels.
Measuring blood cholesterol concentrations
When measuring cholesterol stages, medical doctors will evaluate 4 markers in a person’s blood:
- Small-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol: The “bad” cholesterol. A reduce LDL variety could be a excellent indicator of wellbeing and reduced risk of disease.
- High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol: The effective cholesterol. Very low HDL cholesterol may well be a hazard variable for other challenges, and a higher HDL variety may indicate well being.
- Blood triglycerides: A frequent form of body fat in the blood. Better amounts could indicate that a man or woman has an elevated threat of some issues, specially when they also have other possibility elements, such as small HDL cholesterol.
- Overall cholesterol: This amount usually takes into account the ranges of blood triglycerides and LDL and HDL cholesterol.
Physicians will use all of these numbers within the context of a person’s overall overall health and other risk things to ascertain their danger of heart condition and stroke.
High cholesterol plays a job in worsening heart wellbeing.
As more cholesterol circulates in the blood, it could be tougher for the coronary heart to pump this blood adequately. This cholesterol can also add to plaque buildup in the arteries, raising the danger of atherosclerosis.
Substantial cholesterol puts a human being at risk of coronary heart illness, as properly as coronary heart assault and stroke.
A person wanting to decreased their cholesterol levels promptly can comply with a couple basic wellness rules.
These involve receiving normal workout and concentrating on a food plan wealthy in plant foods and minimal in refined foods and some forms of fats.
Cholesterol has a ton to do with what a human being eats. For that explanation, a healthful diet regime is one of the to start with points that physicians endorse for people who want to decreased their cholesterol rapidly.
The next dietary modifications might assist a individual reduce their cholesterol as swiftly as attainable.

Decrease saturated fat
Saturated fats are stable at area temperature and may possibly not be healthful in substantial quantities.
Eating massive quantities of saturated excess fat raises degrees of LDL cholesterol. The American Coronary heart Association (AHA) propose limiting saturated excess fat consumption to 5–6% of everyday calories.
Sources of saturated fat consist of meat and dairy goods, these as cheese, butter, and milk, as well as vegetable oils, such as palm and coconut oil.
Insert additional plant meals
A cholesterol-reducing diet program requires taking in a extensive wide variety of plant food items, this kind of as fruits, greens, grains, and seeds.
Introducing a wide range of plant food items to the food plan will help ensure that the human body receives the several vitamins and minerals and nutritional vitamins it requires to function appropriately.
Plant food items are also no cost of cholesterol, so they will not contribute to cholesterol amounts in the system.
In addition, plant meals comprise nutrients that could lower other hazard variables for coronary heart disorder, this kind of as antioxidants and some kinds of fiber.
Enhance fiber intake
Plants are the only source of fiber in the diet plan. Fiber is an essential issue for digestive well being, which may well also influence other hazard elements, this sort of as high cholesterol.
The AHA estimate that a food plan higher in fiber by yourself can assistance reduce cholesterol amounts by as a great deal as 10%.
Ingesting more plant food items will normally maximize fiber consumption. Folks who need to have more fiber might contemplate getting a fiber health supplement to support them access their day-to-day requirements.
Increase plant protein resources
Introducing wide variety into the diet may perhaps support folks deal with some danger aspects for heart condition.
A lot of persons get their protein predominantly from animal sources. However, it may possibly help for them to consist of plant protein resources in their diet regime also.
A range of vegetable foods that incorporate significant quantities of protein include:

- grains, these as rice, quinoa, and amaranth
- tree nuts, these types of as almonds and cashews
- seeds, like pumpkin, sunflower, and hemp seeds
Incorporating plant-dependent proteins to the diet can enable the body meet its protein demands devoid of including cholesterol.
Try to eat less refined meals
It is best to stay away from refined foodstuff when probable.

These foodstuff frequently incorporate substances that a person must stay away from when they are on the lookout to decrease their cholesterol.
Among the the components to steer clear of are refined grains, included trans and saturated fat, and extra sugars.
Numerous lifestyle factors can have an affect on a person’s cholesterol stages. Some people today may perhaps obtain that creating sure changes to their life-style helps decrease their cholesterol.

To realize this, a person requirements to do a 30-minute exercise that will get the heart amount up on 5 times of the week. These activities may contain:

The AHA take note that a bodyweight loss of 10% of a person’s overall human body fat can aid enhance their cholesterol figures.
Remedies are an crucial instrument for individuals who have dangerously substantial cholesterol stages and may perhaps be at danger of an party these kinds of as coronary heart failure or stroke.
Statins are the standard treatment for most men and women. Statin prescription drugs lessen cholesterol and decreased the threat of heart attack or stroke from high cholesterol.
Depending on a person’s unique threat components, medical practitioners may endorse other medications, these types of as:

This part of the documentation will guide you through the steps of integrating your e-commerce site with Delivery Checkout. We'll go through patterns for embedding the shipping selector, handle updates to cart or customer information and marking the checkout session as completed in Delivery Checkout API.
# Migrating from SIW API to Delivery Checkout API.
If you have already integrated with SIW API, the changes related to the Delivery Checkout API are rather simple.
All the Frontend integration remains the same. Although it's required to upgrade your configuration to release
v4.
This can be done by requesting the change via our Customer Success team.
For the Backend, it requires to integrate with the Delivery Checkout API which is purpose of this page.
Here is a list of expected changes with integrating with Delivery Checkout API:
- There's a new API path. Here is the swagger (opens new window)
- The
cartfield is now called
cartsand holds an array of carts.
- The
carthas a field called
cart_idnow, that must be unique within the given session.
- On SIW API,
session.getcould update the session in case of some configuration change or expired token. Now this is not done by
session.getanymore. For this behavior you should use session.pull endpoint.
- Deprecated fields were removed
# Creating a session
The first thing you need to do before you can embed the shipping selector in your checkout page is to create a session. This is done by calling session.create which returns session details and an HTML snippet.
Each
Session has an ID that can be used to later fetch, update or
complete the session. It is recommended that you store the
session ID together with the customer's order.
# Embed the Delivery Checkout
The responses of
session.create and
session.pull contain the attribute
called
html_snippet which includes the HTML snippet to display the shipping
selector in your checkout page. Just put it in the part of the page where you
want the Delivery Checkout to be displayed.
The snippet will then download and execute our
bootstrap.js script which spawns the iframes and sets up channels of communication for session management.
const handleCreateSession = async () => { try { // Call your backend and they call siw/session.create const sessionResponse = await createSession(); // Embed the widget on the page widgetWrapperRef.current.innerHTML = HTMLSnippet; // Trick the browser to run the script, explained below replaceScriptNode(document.getElementById("shipwallet-container")); } catch { // We don't believe it's possible but if our service fails, you render the fallback for the widget here } };
Warning
If you're dynamically inserting the HTML snippet in the DOM, most browsers won't execute the script embedded in it. If you're lucky enough to have jQuery on your page, you can use its
append() function or feel free to copy the snippet below. It removes and inserts back the script nodes to trick the browser to execute them
function replaceScriptNode(node) { if (isScriptNode(node) && !isExternalScript(node)) { node.parentNode.replaceChild(cloneScriptNode(node), node); } else { var i = 0, children = node.childNodes; while (i < children.length) { replaceScriptNode(children[i++]); } } return node; } function isScriptNode(node) { return node.tagName === "SCRIPT"; } function isExternalScript(node) { return !!node.src && node.src !== ""; } function cloneScriptNode(node) { var script = document.createElement("script"); script.text = node.innerHTML; for (var i = node.attributes.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) { script.setAttribute(node.attributes[i].name, node.attributes[i].value); } return script; } replaceScriptNode(document.getElementById("shipwallet-container"));
Caveats
The HTML snippet is designed to only be added to the page once. So if you are using AJAX to load the snippet you should make sure that this only happens once. Adding or replacing it multiple times will cause errors.
However, there is an exception to that when using Multiple widgets. It allows you to add many checkout widgets to the page, but each has different id and in that case, the above constraint applies to each unique widget.
Warning
html_snippet contains an element with unique id
shipwallet-container. Make sure there’s no other element on the page with the same ID, otherwise the widget won't load.
You can override the default unique id with your own by requesting a merchant configuration change from our Customer Support.
# Updating the cart and session
It is common for a checkout page to contain customer interactions that can alter the customer's cart or contact information. Two parts that are used by the shipping selector to display the correct shipping options for a customer. Maybe a customer can login on your checkout page, or maybe they add or remove items from their cart.
In these cases you must use the
session.update call to update the session
with the new information. However, you will have to
suspend and
resume the widget during this process to sync the frontend with the backend.
This allows the shipping options to be refreshed with up to date information about the cart and responses from carriers.
It is essential that you do it after each session update as it might cause inconsistencies between the UI and the actual session.
Two methods are exposed on the
window._sw object.
- suspend - Puts the widget in a freezed state with a spinner covering the whole UI
- resume - Unlocks the widget, triggering an internal BE request for synchronization
const handleUpdateSession = async () => { window._sw((api) => api.suspend()); await updateSession(session.id); window._sw((api) => api.resume()); };
# Handling abandoned carts
In some cases customers can drop out of the checkout process early. Either because they didn't have time to complete the purchase or they went on to continue shopping on the page or for some other reason. In cases like this, when the customer returns, we want them to continue where they left off. By storing the session ID, we can fetch an existing session instead of creating a new one.
This might be easier to follow in our live demo (opens new window). Here's how it could be handled:
React.useEffect(() => { initDeliveryCheckout(); }, []); const initDeliveryCheckout = async () => { const existingSessionID = window.localStorage.getItem("ingrid-session-id"); if (existingSessionID) { const getSessionResponse = await getSession(existingSessionID); handleIngridInitialize( getSessionResponse.data.session, getSessionResponse.data.html_snippet ); } else { handleCreateSession(); } }; const handleIngridInitialize = ( session: SIWSessionDTO, HTMLSnippet: string ) => { // session.pull and session.create should be handled the same way. We've created this utility function // to abstract adding the snippet to the page and setting up event listeners without doubling the code widgetWrapperRef.current!.innerHTML = HTMLSnippet; replaceScriptNode(document.getElementById("shipwallet-container")); window._sw!((api) => { api.on("shipping_option_changed", (option) => { setShippingPrice(option.price); }); }); }; const handleCreateSession = async () => { try { const sessionResponse = await createSession(); handleIngridInitialize( sessionResponse.data.session, sessionResponse.data.html_snippet ); // You want to save the session ID somewhere, so when the user abandons the checkout // you can later restore the session, instead of creating a new one window.localStorage.setItem( "ingrid-session-id", sessionResponse.data.session.id ); } catch {} };
Note
If, for some reason, the session cannot be found when you try to call
session.update or
session.pull with a previous session ID we suggest that
you handle this error in this case by creating an entirely new session.
# Subscribing to user events
User can perform a number of actions that can affect your checkout, e.g. user changing the shipping option can cause a shipping price change.
Luckily, the moment the widget attaches itself to the page, it sets up a Javascript API available via
window._sw where you can set up listeners for events.
You would usually do this right after session.create or session.pull.
const handleCreateSession = async () => { // ...call session create backend and add the snippet to the page // Update the shipping price any time option is changed window._sw(function(api) { api.on("data_changed", function(data, meta) { if (meta.price_changed) { updateCart(data.price); } }); }); };
# Available events
# data_changed
Instead of exposing multiple 'change' events with multiple properties, Delivery Checkout exposes one 'change' event and allows you to decide what data you care about. The callback receives two arguments
data: { delivery_type: 'delivery' | 'mailbox' | 'pickup' | 'instore'; price: number; search_address: { country: string; postal_code: string; address_lines?: string[]; city?: string; region?: string; }; shipping_method: string; external_method_id?: string; }
and
meta: { delivery_type_changed: boolean; external_method_id_changed: boolean; price_changed: boolean; search_address_changed: boolean; shipping_method_changed: boolean; initial_load: boolean; }
meta.initial_load: true informs you that this is the moment where values are actually set, not updated,
as this is the first render of the widget.
# All that looks kind of complicated, how does one use it?
Say you want to know when the shipping price changes to update the total price on the cart
window._sw(function(api) { api.on("data_changed", function(data, meta) { if (meta.price_changed) { updateCart(data.price); } }); });
If you want to also know when the shipping method changes
window._sw(function(api) { api.on("data_changed", function(data, meta) { if (meta.shipping_method_changed) { sendToAnalyticsService(data.shipping_method); } if (meta.price_changed) { updateCart(data.price); } }); });
You can have more if statements or setup multiple data_changed event listeners if that's your jam.
# loaded
Emitted when the widget is fully loaded and interactive
window._sw(function(api) { api.on("loaded", function() { console.log("loaded"); }); });
# no_shipping_options
Emitted when the address is provided but Ingrid can't find any shipping options for it. Note that this requires additional configuration on Ingrid side to be visible. To do that, you will have to contact our support team
window._sw(function(api) { api.on("no_shipping_options", function() { console.log("no shipping options"); }); });
Note
If you render multiple widgets simultaneously, then global variable for event subscription is not
called
_sw, see Multiple widgets.
# Completing session
You should complete the session after receiving confirmation from payment system. It marks the session as complete and creates a Transport Order in the Ingrid system.
Tip
When issuing the complete session request, include the external order ID if possible. You can find more information about external order ID in the subsection using external order identifier.
# Using external order identifier
It is highly encouraged to pass external order identifier (external ID for short) in your session create/update/complete requests. Passing it in one of those requests will store the external ID along with the other session data.
Note
Benefits of using external ID are:
- being able to search by your external order ID in Ingrid Merchant Platform transport orders,
- when booking with Ingrid, your external order ID will be propagated to the booking system,
- being able to register and load the tracking widget using the external order ID provided by the merchant.
You can pass the
external_id field as part of your session create/update/complete request. The following snippet shows how you can pass it in the request via
curl.
curl --location --request POST '' \ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ --header 'Authorization: Bearer your-site-token' \ --data-raw '{ "purchase_country": "SE", "purchase_currency": "SEK", "locales": [ "sv-SE" ], "search_address": { "postal_code": "11239", "country": "SE" }, "carts": [ { "cart_id": "unique_id", "total_value": 129900, "currency": "SEK", "items": [ { "sku": "SKU12345", "name": "Saucony Shadow 6000", "quantity": 1, "price": 1000 } ] } ], "external_id": "your-order-id" }'Month in Review This last month we had meetings in Tennessee and Ohio.

I do not think that any of this stuff should be disagreed with by most republicans and i really assume there’s a middle floor which the majority of Individuals dwell in. The difficulty is that people suppose that issues like science and religion must be diametrically opposed. Science does not have to trump religion nor does religion must trump science as this can be a zero sum recreation. Science trumps outdated misunderstandings that may have been derived from spiritual misunderstandings. The bible was written throughout a time when there was very little understanding of science so it needed to be written for the viewers that will know it at that time. Most churches as of late will merely say that God created the science that created man. All of the sudden there is only a small disagreement and we should respect the beliefs of the other – without putting one thing on the bumper of our automobile in the hope of trying to transform somebody.

Mini cities fuses computational engineering with 3D printing to challenge visualization techniques utilized in hack-a-thons. Sponsored by the Information Assurance Center at Iowa State University, 20 unique cities were designed, modeled, and fabricated by architecture students at Iowa State University and then outfitted with circuitry and lights that diagrammatically visualize infrastructure performance. The Information Assurance Center, a university research center dedicated to the practice of managing information-related risks, hosts a series of hack-a-thons that trains students to defend infrastructure grids against attack. These cities will replace dated 2D graphics previously used during sponsored hack-a-thons, allowing participants to have greater spatial awareness of the grids they are defending.

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
It is the first full day of the Biden administration, and the president says there is going to be a new approach to the pandemic. He did acknowledge there may still be many challenges ahead.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We will level with you when we make a mistake. We'll straight up say what happened. And I said at the outset, the honest truth is we're still in a dark winter of this pandemic.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
President Biden says by next month, the U.S. may reach a number that once seemed unthinkable - half-a-million Americans dead of COVID-19. Today, he signed 10 executive actions to show how his team is moving forward. And to explain, we're joined by NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith and NPR health policy reporter Selena Simmons-Duffin. Good to have you both back.
TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hi.
SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.
SHAPIRO: Tam, to start with you, we saw Dr. Anthony Fauci return to the briefing room today. He was a fixture early on in the COVID crisis as part of President Trump's task force. After that, we didn't see much of him. And his demeanor today seemed really different. Tell us about what he said.
KEITH: Yeah, he noted that he had often been in trouble with Trump for contradicting him on things like hydroxychloroquine or otherwise disagreeing with the former president's push to get the country reopened before it was safe. And after a bit of prodding, Fauci admitted that appearing in the briefing room today, not having to worry about the consequences of what would happen if he contradicted the president, that he felt liberated. Now, he insisted he never pulled his punches with Trump, and that is probably why he eventually got banished. But when he was asked about the difference, he said he had just been in a meeting with President Biden.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ANTHONY FAUCI:.
KEITH: So Fauci and Biden have made the calculation that radical transparency, even if it isn't good news, will help build public trust that they will need to convince at least some share of the public to get vaccinated.
SHAPIRO: And, Selena, even as we're looking at this dire number of half-a-million Americans dead of the virus, Fauci painted a fairly optimistic picture of where we're going from here. Tell us what he said.
SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah, that's right. He said that the surge in cases that we've seen this winter seems to have plateaued. And our colleague Rob Stein actually reported this morning that cases seem to have started to slow already. He also said that hospital capacity is looking less dire as well. He talked about the variants of the virus. He called them mutants in the U.K. and what he called a more concerning variant in South Africa and Brazil. He said that there's not current evidence that those variants are in the U.S. right now but that the U.S. doesn't have great genetic surveillance, so it's hard to be certain about that.
And Fauci also mentioned, at this point, it does seem like the vaccines that have been authorized do work against these new variants. Even if they're slightly less effective, that's still really helpful. And probably most optimistic, he forecasted that the country could get close to normalcy by the fall.
SHAPIRO: Well, let's talk about the executive actions that the president signed. Tam, what is President Biden planning to do?
KEITH: Last week, he talked about his broad strategy - speeding up vaccinations, his goal of 100 shots in 100 days. Today, he signed actions that begin to put those things in action. Part of this is all about signaling, signaling the importance that he is placing on fixing the crisis in the country and signaling that he is taking a fresh approach, a break from the former Trump approach. That said, Fauci said they aren't starting from scratch. There is something that they are able to work with - something.
SHAPIRO: OK, so let's talk about what the difference is because you've both covered the response to the pandemic from the beginning. Selena, what do you see as the biggest differences between the Biden approach and the Trump approach?
SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Well, let's just start with this 200-page document, the national strategy document that Biden released today. The Trump administration never put out a public document like that. A lot of the decisions were really delegated to the states. Operation Warp Speed certainly succeeded in getting effective and safe vaccines authorized in record time, but testing strategies were left to state and local governments. And so there are 60-something different vaccine distribution plans drafted this fall and driving the rollouts in each state and territory.
So the fact that Trump did not have a national plan is in part why the response has been so uneven and disjointed. And the challenge now is going to be to transition from that patchwork to a more unified approach in a year into the pandemic response and turn that pile of papers into action in the real world.
SHAPIRO: As you've reported, Selena, many of the executive actions taken early on in the Trump administration were challenged in courts. Some were ultimately blocked. Could these actions get tied up with legal challenges, too?
SIMMONS-DUFFIN: I think that's much less likely, according to the legal experts that I've been speaking to, for a couple of reasons. First of all, remember when the CDC put out its eviction moratorium last fall? Well, Lindsay Wiley, who's a health law professor at American University, points out that was challenged in court, and so far, the rulings have upheld the federal government's authority to act in this public health emergency, and that's a promising precedent here. And she also points out that Biden is not putting out something like a national mask mandate. Instead, he's choosing a more cautious approach, mandating masks on federal property and on interstate travel. And that's much less vulnerable to potential legal challenges.
SHAPIRO: We have seen such a flood of policy changes just in the last 24 hours. Tam, what do you expect the next stage to look like?
KEITH: Oh, the flood is going to keep coming.
SHAPIRO: (Laughter).
KEITH: The White House has a plan for just a flurry of additional actions based on Biden's top priorities - COVID today; we're expecting the economy, racial justice, climate over the next few days. But the big question remains - what can he do with Congress? Executive action only takes you so far. He proposed this $1.9 trillion COVID relief package and, again, today argued that it needs to happen, that it's urgent, that it's a crisis. But he's getting a lot of pushback from Congress, Republicans in Congress, and it's not clear how fast they can act, even if they do want to do it.
SHAPIRO: That's NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith and NPR health policy reporter Selena Simmons-Duffin. Thank you.
KEITH: You're welcome.
SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Thank you. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.By Taralinda Willis
E-scooters are a national trend with a huge variety of local responses. Keeping track of local regulations on e-scooters is a perfect example of a hot topic that local business associations, entrepreneurs, and advocacy organizations might want to track using CurateLOCAL.
E-scooters are electric scooters that urban residents can use to take short trips around cities. The top two operators are Lime and Bird. Riders unlock a scooter with an app and pay per minute of use. The typical trip is less than two miles.
Fans of the scooters view them as affordable solutions for first and last-mile connections to public transit, which could reduce the public’s reliance on cars. Many of the top scooter companies also provide job opportunities for independent contractors who help keep the fleets operational.
But like any new hot trend, scooters come with their downsides. In cities where scooter operators have set up shop literally in the middle of the night without warning, complaints have poured in from residents, business owners, and law enforcement officials. They’ve expressed concerns about everything from congestion on sidewalks and riders not following any rules of the road, to the unsightly piles of scooters that can end up in popular destinations.
Municipal responses to e-scooters
Most cities are open to the concept of e-scooters, but they don’t appreciate the “ask forgiveness, not permission” approach many operators have taken.
In some cases, state law guides a city’s response. In Milwaukee, scooter operator Bird set up operations the night before the city’s massive Summerfest music festival, to the delight of some, but the frustration of many others. While many city leaders supported the concept, they ultimately banned them because existing state law said they were not street-legal.
In cities like San Francisco, neither city nor state laws explicitly covered scooters when they first appeared, giving local lawmakers an open slate for regulations. After initially welcoming the scooters, Nashville considered banning them after a rider died in a collision with an SUV.
Keeping track of local e-scooter regulations using CurateLOCAL
Most cities who don’t yet have e-scooters are looking at what other cities have done to control them. Some are proactively regulating or banning e-scooters before they arrive, and others are looking at small pilot projects.
Many types of entrepreneurs and organizations could benefit from engaging with their local governments as they develop regulations for e-scooters. A few examples include:
Helpful keywords to track this issue in CurateLOCAL include:
Curate’s database can take you directly to the minutes from government meetings where e-scooters were discussed, and it can provide advanced notice that a city is considering regulating them. Here’s a look at a few of the discussions going on in cities around the country, pulled from Curate’s national database.
Bothell, WA (City) Meeting Date: 10/15/2019
“In order to make e-scooters a permanent fixture in Bothell, staff will need to add e-scooters to the City's ordinances, create a new permitting process, and determine the best path for managing the number of scooters in Bothell and the method of contracting with scooter companies.”
Hoboken, NJ (City) Meeting Date: 7/18/2019
“...the first week there were significant examples of irresponsible and dangerous riding and breaking of the law including riding on sidewalks, joy riding on the waterfront in heavy pedestrian areas, riding in the wrong direction, riding with multiple people on a scooter, and most concerning, youth as young as 7 or 8 riding on the EScooters (and always without helmets).”
Lakewood, OH (City) Meeting Date: 10/7/2019
“Through discussions with the Planning Department, it was found that not only can these devices be regulated with code, they can also be controlled through geofencing technology and the establishment of incentivized parking stations.”$ ···;Precision Rating:P0 P5 P6 from Linqing City Jia Ming Bearing Co·; Ltd·;1·Competitive price 2·High precision 3·After-sale service 4·OEM availability-

At least until she thinks we're looking the other way. She's a ninja. She's slipped out from under RK's arms, while I was off getting a towel. But with both of us there, helping get her little body all clean again (so truly necessary after she takes a good roll in something out there), she sometimes even seems to ease into it. But only for a quick second. I think I caught that moment this bathtime. Photo number 4 shows her little tongue sticking out: She was licking the water off the edge of the tub in this really serene, slow, calm way. It was like her binky.
Of course, I have no idea how Stella really feels. About any of it.
Projection seems to be a large part of this relationship.
I found this little image in an 1940's LIFE magazine that a friend gave me years ago. Since everything is a possible 1"- button these days, I was flipping through the pages and was taken aback at how much this looked like Stella. She's been seen in both these poses on a pretty daily basis. Plus, her ears do the same thing. And I've never understood how it can be comfortable for her little legs to be bent underneath her like that?

aw she's SO cute!

Source of Video: Vkspeed/VkPrimeSafa is head of the Iran-backed militant group’s Liaison and Coordination Unit. In 2019, he was placed on a US Treasury sanctions list, accused of having “exploited Lebanon’s ports and border crossings to smuggle contraband and facilitate travel” on behalf of Hezbollah.
“We’ve had it up to our noses with you. We will stay with you until the end of this legal path, but if it doesn’t work out, we will usurp you,” the message to Bitar said, according to the source.
Neither Safa nor other members of Hezbollah have been named by state media as official subjects of the investigation into the port blast.
The conversation was first reported by Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation correspondent Edmond Sassine in a tweet on Tuesday.
It is unclear what was meant by the threat to “usurp” Bitar, but the warning has raised concerns that the judge could be at risk of being physically harmed.
Hezbollah, which has a political arm consisting of elected members of parliament, has previously been accused of employing intimidation tactics against officials.
The group has not responded to CNN’s request for comment, and it has not issued a public response.
Since his appointment in February of this year, the judge, who also heads Beirut’s criminal court, has sought top political and security officials for questioning in the Beirut blast probe. He is the second judicial investigator to head the investigation. The first judge tasked with handling the probe was dismissed after two ex-ministers charged in the investigation successfully filed a motion for his removal.
Bitar’s investigation of high-profile politicians — including former ministers, the head of the country’s main intelligence apparatus and former Prime Minister Hassan Diab — has posed the biggest legal challenge to Lebanon’s ruling elite in decades. Diab has repeatedly denied the accusations against him.
Many in the ruling elite, including politicians, have immunity in the investigation by virtue of Lebanon’s constitution, but there have been growing calls for that immunity to be lifted for the purposes of this investigation. There are ongoing legal battles, in return, to maintain that immunity and avoid prosecution. Meanwhile, Bitar has emerged as one of the country’s most popular civil servants, hailed for championing rule of law in a confessional power sharing system that has repeatedly shielded powerful politicians and businessmen from accountability.
Dozens of members of parliament, including all from Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc, have petitioned to take the case out of Bitar’s hands and move it to a previously unknown “judicial council” which activists and legal experts say would be heavily influenced by the accused. The move ignited a social media campaign against the so-called “deputies of shame.”
A huge blast at Beirut’s port on August 4, 2020, killed more than 200 people and injured thousands more. The explosion, which laid waste to whole neighborhoods, was caused by the ignition of hundreds of metric tons of explosive ammonium nitrate that were improperly stored in a warehouse for over six years.
At least six urgent letters sent by customs officials since 2014 – the year the material was unloaded at the port under mysterious circumstances — had alerted the authorities to the danger posed by the chemicals.
Successive leaders — four governments and three prime ministers — either would have or should have known about the threat posed by the material, yet little was done to address the danger.
Bitar’s probe has been investigating several politicians for “criminal neglect.” Though the judge has not sought to question Hezbollah officials, according to the lists made public in state media, the group has emerged as one of the most vocal opponents of the investigation.
In a recent televised speech, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah lambasted the probe, accusing Bitar of being “politicized.” Nasrallah offered no evidence to support the claim which was seen as a vociferous defense of the group’s political allies who have been targeted in the investigation.
Over the last two decades, Hezbollah has evolved into one of the most sophisticated armed groups in the Middle East. Nasrallah has said the group’s arsenal includes precision-guided missiles.
In 2000, the group drove Israeli forces out of south Lebanon, ending a 22-year occupation. In 2006, they withstood a 33-day Israeli assault on Lebanon aimed at dislodging them. In 2013, the group joined Syria’s civil war on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad in a move that is widely credited with having prevented the immediate toppling of the Syrian dictator, extending the regime’s life until Russia’s intervention in 2015 definitively tipped the balance in Assad’s favor.
Hezbollah has also been a vocal critic of a popular uprising that began nearly two years ago against the country’s ruling elite and accused the US and Western consulates of supporting the protests.
CNN’s Charbel Mallo contributed to this report from Abu Dhabi.I haven’t posted anything on The Ritz Brothers since January of 2016 , so when TCM aired a trio of their films this weekend, I chose to review what I consider their best solo effort, 1937’s LIFE BEGINS IN COLLEGE. This was their first name-above-the-title movie, and features Harry, Jimmy, and Al at their zaniest, with the added bonus of comedienne Joan Davis as a kooky coed with her sights on Native American football hero Nat Pendleton.
Collegiate musical comedies were a popular sub-genre in the 30’s: COLLEGE HUMOR, PIGSKIN PARADE, COLLEGE SWING, COLLEGE HOLIDAY, et al, so it seemed the perfect milieu for the Ritzes to showcase their peculiar brand of nuttiness. The story is typical campus corniness, as George “Little Black Cloud” Black arrives at Lombardy College (crashing his motorcycle for an entrance) wanting to join the football team, and immediately developing a rivalry with football team captain Bob. There’s Coach O’Hara, in danger of losing his job after three losing seasons, and his daughter Janet, a love triangle with Janet, Bob, and Southern belle Cuddles, and of course the Big Game against Midwestern, where it’s revealed George is ineligible to play because of his pro past.
However, the plot is strictly secondary to the Ritz lunacy. They’re a trio of tailors who’ve been working their way through college for seven years, without much success (they’re lousy tailors!). They befriend George, who suffered a hazing by Bob and his jock friends early on, and find out the kid’s loaded (Oklahoma oil wells), which he doesn’t want the other students to know about. The brothers act as a “front” and give the dean a huge endowment ( driving him crazy in the process!), with the provision that Coach keeps his job and they get to play on the team (they’ve been sitting on the bench those seven years!). This is all an excuse for the boys to show off their precision timing in some nonsensical song-and-dance routines (a hilarious ‘Latin’ number with Harry in drag, an ‘Indian’ number with them as not-so-brave braves, the fan favorite ‘Spirit of ’76’), and the physical and verbal clowning that made other comedians green with envy! Of course, they get into the Big Game in the final two minutes, and almost blow it before making one of the most ridiculous winning touchdowns in the history of these college football moves!
Gloria Stuart makes a pleasing Janet, and even gets to sing “Why Talk About Love?” (though I think she’s dubbed), but Dick Baldwin as Bob is dull as a butter knife. Nat Pendleton talkum like Tonto as George, but his comic timing is solid and he’s believable as an athlete (he won a Silver Medal in wrestling at the 1920 Olympics). Joan Davis was a fine clown in her own right, and performs a solo number highlighting her limber slapstick moves. Tony Martin’s on hand as a band leader, though he doesn’t get to do much except introduce the tune “Sweet Varsity Sue”. Veteran Fred Stone is the Coach, and among the Familiar Faces you’ll find two very young actors: a pre-noir Elisha Cook Jr. as the team manager, and a pre-horror Lon Chaney Jr. as one of the football players!
But LIFE BEGINS IN COLLEGE is all about The Ritz Brothers, and as you watch, you’ll find out where comics like Sid Caesar, Danny Kaye, and Jerry Lewis learned their schticks. No less than Mel Brooks called Harry Ritz “the funniest man ever” – high praise coming from a comic genius like Mel! If you’ve never experienced the comedy of The Ritz Brothers, this film’s a good place to start. OR…. you can start here, with this rare clip of Harry, Jimmy, and Al’s appearance on the 1961 TV series JACKPOT BOWLING, hosted by another of their admirers, Milton Berle:At Bridge Forum 2019,.

A dream wedding venue! From getting goosebumps on our first initial visit to walking down the aisle in the stunning garden with the twinkling lights above you, to dancing the night away in the beautiful barn, we wish we could relive our special day every day!

Amazing day, exceptional venue and priceless memories made!
Faye and Kerry
The Tythe Barn team were perfectionists in giving us the wedding of our dreams. The team are there when you need them in the months leading up to it and on the day, but they also blend into the background making everything happen without you even noticing it on the day. The Tythe Barn runs like clockwork and they’re always looking at ways to improve and move with the times. We had the most amazing day and have pictures & memories to treasure forever. Thank you so much.
Lucy and Tom

Lauren and Craig
We couldn’t imagine having our wedding anywhere else. From start to finish the service was unparalleled and no question was too big or small. Jackie was incredibly generous with the hard work she put in to making sure every part of our day was as we imagined. There aren’t enough words to thank the team for all the effort they put in to giving us the day of our dreams. It was everything and more than we could’ve imagined!

Wedding Guest

We visited six different barn venues but the moment we arrived at The Tythe Barn we were won over. I remember walking back to the car after being shown around and giving each other a little look - this was the one for us!
Kim and David
We got married at the beginning of August and had the most magical day that exceeded our expectations. Everything ran perfectly, the setting was stunning (we had so many comments from our guests) and the food was incredible! This was honestly the most perfect venue and we had the most perfect day!
Beth and MattGainey Signals his Intentions Regarding HalakDecember 16, 2009
''I took this step because it is Jaroslav's wish to have his chance to play,'' Canadiens GM Bob Gainey told ruefrontenac.com. ''He feels ready to play a more important part.''
The "step" is a call that Gainey made to Paul Holmgren, his counterpart with the Philadelphia Flyers, sometime after Ray Emery went down with an injury. Gainey wanted to gauge Holmgren's interest in obtaining Jaroslav Halak.
'Let's be realistic,'' Gainey told the website. "I received a second-round pick from the Washington Capitals for Cristobal Huet and the Flyers gave up a second-round pick from Buffalo for Martin Biron."
It is highly unusual for Gainey to take the step of speaking with the media about an impending move. So why this time? It is possible that he was misquoted, but I don't think that is the case in this situation. The more probable explanation is that the move is strategic on Gainey's part.
To a small extent, the public message may have been aimed at Halak's volatile agent, Allan Walsh. It was Gainey's way of letting Walsh know that he was actively trying to deal Halak as requested. This would hopefully keep Walsh in check so that he wouldn't cause any further problems in the locker room with another divisive message on Twitter.
While Halak did not explicitly confirm that he asked for a trade, his response when questioned left little doubt. "Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. It's between me and my agent so I'm not going to say 'yes,' or 'no.' I have no comment on this," said Halak.
But there was a more important reason for Gainey to openly speak about shopping Halak.
In all cities, but particularly in Montreal, it is important for the GM to manage expectations. Gainey's message was to the media and fans. While Halak may be beloved in Montreal, he will not fetch a top-six forward in return.
While Halak has decent numbers for a backup goalie, he is adored by Canadiens' fans. Some love cheering for the underdog, whereas others are Carey Price-haters. While this may raise Halak's worth in their eyes, NHL GM's don't value those emotional attachments.
They are looking at a young goalie in Halak, who has proved himself to be a very capable backup, but little else. Halak has been shielded from the pressure of the limelight as all of the attention and pressure have been on Price. Halak, has played against weaker opposition, and more games at home. His numbers on the road are not impressive.
Realistically, it is unlikely that the Canadiens will receive any more than a second-round draft choice in return for Halak.
Some have wondered how this situation differs from Sergei Kostitsyn who also asked for a trade? Sergei's request was the voice of immaturity reacting to a perceived inequity. He felt that he was being treated differently from other players (with some justification).
As for Halak, this isn't the first time he's made a "trade me or play me" request. Gainey has to be concerned about the effect it will have on the locker room. One wonders if his teammates can trust Halak if he wishes to prove himself elsewhere.
So, given the limited return, what is the rush to trade Halak? The value of a goaltender doesn't necessarily increase closer to the trade deadline. Instead, it is more related to injuries and situational need. So, Gainey has to take advantage of opportunities when available.
The injury to Emery provided an opportunity for Gainey to initiate a discussion with Philadelphia.
Halak believes that he can be a No. 1 goaltender in the NHL. He will be given the chance to prove it with another team.
Since the beginning of the season, fans should have been preparing themselves for Halak to be traded before March 3. But given the recent developments, it would seem that a move will be made much sooner.
For analysis of a potential Halak trade read Kyle's excellent article: Battleships for Rowboats#1.

I remember thinking that I'd way rather give my parents my money, and not have to like have them go to work anymore, you know what I mean. Because I'd way rather spend more time with them.
Shaun WhiteI got an email from someone who I think may have been a former classmate of Rebecca Rodriguez, who disappeared in 1977 with her older sister, Evangeline Silva, and her sister’s boyfriend, Kenneth Beltram. (I don’t have pics of them so no casefiles for those two.) I don’t know who the person is because they didn’t identify themselves and sent the email from their phone; I just have the phone number.
Anyway, the person said the only photo that I (and NamUs) have for Rebecca is wrong. It’s a school yearbook photo and there were two girls named Rebecca Rodriguez in that class. The person sent me a scan of the yearbook page with the two Rebeccas side by side. I’ve changed my Rebecca’s photo accordingly. I thought I should let people know this.My invite came on a sweltering summer night as heavy smoke blanketed Colorado’s Front Range. The American West was on fire from the Pacific Coast to the Continental Divide and a grim haze filled the air. Casually glancing at my phone, I did a double take. Opening the message, I sensed an irreversible process had begun, like rockfall on a distant peak.
The invite from my good friend Chad Melis outlined a bikepacking adventure from Big Sky, Montana, to the Grand Targhee resort near the border of Idaho and Wyoming. A passion project for adventure photographer Fred Marmsater, our mission was to connect two bike parks with 260 miles of backcountry exploration—bikepacking bookended by trail smashing. Chad, a founder of REEB cycles, assured me it would be a legendary trip. “Fred doesn’t do anything halfway—I’m bringing my big bike.”
Excitement and doubt swirled through my mind. The route passed through rugged grizzly bear country and, adding to my concern, I wondered whether I could hang with a group of legitimate adventure professionals. I hesitated. Though, after months of COVID lockdowns, I felt a deep need for adventure. And with a surplus of vacation time, I had no excuse. I committed to the trip and immediately ran through my faithful gear checklist in a rush of ritualistic habit. My list is like an old family recipe, a time-honored formula for self-reliance.

I grew up knowing my mom was Native, but the fact that she was adopted out of our tribal community as a young child made my identity seem like a fantasy. The only Natives I ever saw growing up were on butter boxes, in cartoons (Pocahontas, Popeye and Peter Pan) and in history books, depicted eating supper with Pilgrims. Of course, I didn’t look like those Natives and neither did my family members. So, if we didn’t look Native, if I was estranged from my tribal community and if I couldn’t be understood by animals like I saw in the cartoons, it seemed as though I should let my Native identity dissipate. In mainstream society, there is little Indigenous visibility. In the cycling world, there is even less.
Despite this, I’ve carved out a home of sorts within the realm of ultra-racing, a niche discipline in which mountain bikers spend days—sometimes weeks—racing long distances without any outside assistance. The ultra-racing domain is populated by a small group of people, many of whom I’ve come to know. I hold the women’s singlespeed records for the 2,700-mile-long Tour Divide Race, the Colorado Trail Race (in both directions), as well as that of the Arizona Trail 300 race. For just about every big ultra-race, I scan the roster for familiar names and see friends listed, yet I rarely meet other Native people. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever met another Native at a starting line. Deep in my spirit, I envision a world in which more Natives lined up to race but I’m not sure how to make that dream a reality.

We live during a time when the natural world is changing more quickly than ever before. Ever-shifting weather patterns are toppling the paradigms of predictable climates, and regions we once viewed as being stable over the course of a human life are becoming volatile before our very eyes. Perhaps now more than ever, humanity’s relationship with the Earth—particularly its wild places—should be cherished in every moment.
We mountain bikers occupy a peculiar space on our planet, constantly striving to balance a delicate symbiosis between us and the dirt in which we play, and from whence we emanate. Mountain bike photographers, especially those with a proclivity for remote-ness, possess an intuitive understanding of the ephemeral essence of our flirtatious interplay with landscapes. We are but fleeting blips in an ageless continuum that envelops and embraces us, if only for a few seconds, as we marvel over the majesty of it all.

It’s 9 o’clock at night, the temperature is 45 degrees Fahrenheit, and, still, there is plenty of light outside. It’s not exactly raining, but we’re huddled in the mist and the dampness is starting to settle in with a decisiveness. We’re starting to get cold in our riding gear and there’s still a laundry list of things to do before we can sink into warm sleeping bags.
Compounding our concerns, the last people we encountered on the trail mentioned that they saw a grizzly bear just down the hill from where we’re planning to camp. This should be par for the course, as we’re on a two-night bikepacking trip in the Alaskan wilderness. But this is far from any ordinary bikepacking trip, as it is the first self-supported bike adventure I’ve done with my entire family. We’ve just climbed more than 1,500 vertical feet with fully loaded mountain bikes, and it is way past our usual dinner time. The hunger and cold are taking their toll, and I know my family has a tendency toward “hanger” when deprived of food. Emotions are running high.

A short, stocky Latino man flashed a smile at me from under his wide-brimmed hat, moving his hands back and forth along a narrow ribbon of dirt that had previously been hidden by a thick wall of sagebrush. I’d watched him approaching from a mile away, free hiking across a massive slope with a flock of sheep following, tailed by his trusty sheep dog.
“¡Aaah … camino!” he exclaimed as he strode along the newly liberated path.
“¡Si!” was all I could muster in response, beaming widely, proud of myself for knowing what the man said. It was the first word I had uttered to another human in four days, because he was the first human I’d seen in four days. I stepped to the side of the trail and waved him through a freshly cut path up to the top of the ridge, where his giant white tent was pitched at an elevation of about 10,000 feet above sea level.
“¡Gracias!” he said, vanishing back into the sage with his flock close behind.

There’s no question that we mountain bikers are going farther on our bikes than ever before. The advent of modern suspension technology, lightweight frames, dropper posts and reliable brakes and tires has made it easier for us to venture higher into the mountains and wander deeper into places once considered downright crazy to explore by bike.
At the same time, advancements in bike-bag design have made it possible to pack ultra-lightly, stuffing the bare essentials into waterproof seat and handlebar bags compact enough to allow for unmitigated singletrack shredding on a fully loaded mountain bike. This, along with continued refinements in backcountry expedition gear, makes surviving in abject wilderness all the easier and compels many of us to roam inhospitable environments with un-precedented confidence.

I hated high school. Admittedly, I was a dork, but still, aren’t most kids at that age? On top of my dork-ness, I was also a late bloomer physically. I didn’t top out until my senior year—the last three months of it. Because of this, I grew up as the little guy and was often pushed around or made fun of for it.
When I was younger and the same size as everyone else, I was an all-star baseball player. But once high school came, my growth stagnated like molasses in January. Meanwhile, my teammates were busy slugging home runs and discussing electric shavers. I got heckled off the baseball team—you can only be called “shorty” and “pipsqueak” so many times.

If you’re like me, you’re deeply captivated by mountain biking. Joking with friends, in a cheeky and biased way, I routinely assert that mountain biking is “the best sport.” But it can be hard to know what draws us so intensely to this curious activity.
Of course, there are the usual reasons, all of which have the merit of being true—mountain biking is fun and social, it’s great exercise and it’s an adventurous escape from the grueling rat race and absurdities of modern life. To some, these truths go so far as to provide a buffer from mental health issues. We know mountain biking enriches life, but for what reason do we, ride after ride, continue to come back and pedal our faithful machines? A deeper truth about our sport is fundamental to understanding what makes many of us tick—the process of overcoming.

If you suffer from binge eating disorder then our expertly produced hypnosis audio has been created to help you train your subconscious into altering negative eating patterns. Problems with binge eating are typically created because of excessive dieting, feelings of anxiety, low self-esteem and a need to look perfect. In our stop binge eating hypnosis download we help to address these areas as well as deliver subconscious suggestions for wellness.*
This binge eating audio download allows you to use self-hypnosis to make you feel calmer and more in control. During hypnosis people tend to be more suggestible because they are relaxed which allows any positive suggestions to be absorbed. As you listen to the audio over time these suggestions start to become absorbed allowing subconscious changes to be made to your eating patterns.*
Our Stop Binge Eating Hypnosis Download should be used every day. During the audio you will be given information to help you recognise the triggers which may be contributing to your need to binge. In particular it can help you to understand the emotions behind your need to binge so that you can find alternative ways of reacting. As you become better at understanding these messages you should find it easier to change old negative eating patterns.*
In many cases binge eating is simply a way of dealing with internal emotional conflicts. Instead of tackling the root cause of the issue food becomes a form of comfort and distraction and acts as a short term fix. Hypnotic relaxation assists in helping the listener to become increasingly aware of the unresolved feelings so that they can be dealt and the overeating controlled. Please note that dieting will only ever increase binge eating and therefore we do not recommend our weight loss audios for this particular issue.
To really benefit from this stop binge eating hypnosis download it should be used daily or when you feel the need to binge. We recommend that this audio is listened to for a minimum of twenty one days. To increase the effect of the audio it can be listened to in conjunction with our overcome anxiety and relaxation downloads.*

ge doors are one of the most important and largest home appliances, thus it is necessary to keep up the annual maintenance to avoid expensive fixes later down the road. While homeowners may be able to fix many of the minor maintenance and inspection items on their own, but garage doors need the assistance of professionals to conduct more complicated services. Below are the tips and signs of when you should get your garage doors services or call on the experts for an annual check-up.
When do you need to have your garage door serviced?
- If the door is needed to be forced or moved while opening or closing, it is the time to get the service.
- If it’s not balanced. To check this, open the door half way manually, it should stay in place. If it shuts on its own, it is not balanced and it’s time for service.
- If it has been more than two year since the last service call.
- If it’s screeching or making excessive noise while closing or opening.
Sometimes, the issues get more serious which only a professional can handle, after all safety is the key!
- Visual inspections including the examination of cables, springs, pulleys, rollers, and mounting hardware for the signs of damage and wear.
- Checking the cracking panels, circuit boards, loud excessive noise, cable jumping off the drum, stripped gears, hinge separation or operator separation.
- Tracking and ensure proper mounting, replacing hardware and fasteners where needed. Adjust the torsion or extension springs tension.
If you’re facing one of these problems in your garage door, then look no further than Secure for Sure. We are the leading professionals who provide top notch garage door services in Jenkintown by using modern techniques adapted with the use of torsion springs to provide flexibility and reliability.

I felt so validated no matter what level I’m at! Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed listening to Henckel.
He makes the understanding of the creation and the Absolute astonishing clear…just the bare bones.
The silence was palable….beautiful…I felt I was touching my true nature.
Thankyou.
A very honest interview. Thank you.
I liked it very much. However I find myself longing to hear him talk about these ideas in the context of the system of yoga. He mentioned this very briefIy in the talk and it had such a strong resonance for me. I hope this may be possible in the future?
Very inspiring. It was a beautiful lift for me. I feel most fortunate to have the chance to hear this again and again. A very special thing to speak so clearly of something so great and mystical – thank you for sharing.
I have studied with henckel my dearest teacher, for many years.
The truth of the teaching is in the way it is manifested in real life.
Myteacher does not need to make himself known.
He is an example of everything he teaches , compassion ,clarity,and pure being.
I feel blessed to be in his healing presence, and in a space of true
understanding and deep presence.

I have enjoyed the pod cast in it’s considered and honest delivery, to Henkel’s journey of his enlightenment.
I am blessed to be a part of his group in which he so generously shares and teaches what he knows. I feel I have grown and changed since joining it and like so often happens other things appear to happen, like books that were given to me, aiding the continuing process.
I have now listen to it a second time and I am sure I will do so again in the future. there is so much more I heard the second time than the first time round. Thank you Henkel!

Despite the grumblings that Apple is failing to shock and wow in the same way as it did when the late Steve Jobs first revealed the iPhone back in 2007, Ben Wood, Head of Research at CCS Insight, argues last week's event and the announcement of iOS11 shows the evolving importance of the smartphone.
When iOS11 drops later this year, it will be underpinned by augmented reality and machine learning features, as well as the ability to further support its burgeoning smart home devices. Developers will be able to tap into these through the ARKit, CoreML and HomeKit platforms.
Wood says: "The focus on iOS11 was immense and necessary in the face of growing pressure from Google’s Android.”
Jeff Orr, Research Director, Strategic Technologies, ABI Research, identifies the machine learning capabilities as a key announcement and a way to offer smartphone users more personalised experiences.
He says: "The Apple example [at the show] of being able to assemble a photo and video montage of a family pet is practical today because of the cloud services operating behind the scenes.
Similarly, the presence of virtual digital assistants (Siri, Google Assistant, Cortana, Bixby, etc.) are primitive today; forms of a voice front-end for web searches.
"With machine learning, entire custom experiences personalized to the user that perform activities and tasks become possible. Understanding context and intent from a voice input, powered by machine learning, make this a reality."
As Orr notes, Apple is far from the only company to be playing in this space. Wood says: "In the case of Google and Amazon these technologies are also the cornerstone of future revenues giving an enhanced understanding of their consumers needs and wants allowing ever more targeted (and therefore more lucrative) advertising opportunities."
Apple's WWDC comes soon after Google's own developer jamboree, which was more open and vocal about its future plans than the iPhone maker's comparatively controlled public approach, much looser than in Steve Jobs' days but still rather secretive.
Wood says: "Google was happy to lay out a long term vision for its efforts in artificial intelligence, machine learning and more whereas Apple was much more circumspect – teasing WWDC attendees with some hints at plans in this area but continuing to maintain tight control over its platform.
"Furthermore Apple’s approach to customer data as part ‘differential privacy’ strategy is completely different to Google approach. Google, Amazon and others are using all the data generated by consumers using their services to optimise and refine its future artificial intelligence capabilities. Apple’s alternative approach of limiting the flow of consumer data from devices and deleting Siri data after six months could put it at a significant disadvantage in future."
Ryan Reith, Program Vice President, Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, IDC, adds: "I would say they have a lot of similar focuses, but of course Apple is trying to make their developer story focus on Apple hardware, whereas Google seems to be taking a much broader industry support approach."
The way the launch of Apple’s HomePod connected speaker was discussed at WWDC gives an interesting, and perhaps unintended, glimpse into how Siri is faring, according to ABI's Orr.
He says: "Apple spent a good portion of the HomePod introduction discussing its approach as a music and audio experience company. This was done to not compare HomePod to Amazon Echo and Google Home products that cost significantly less.
"While the Amazon and Google devices focus on engaging with the platform using voice, this was clearly not a primary value on HomePod. It leaves us wondering if Siri is not a satisfactory interface solution for the home music experience, or if this was simply Apple attempting to not be called out for following existing vendors and products into the marketplace."
Apple may have lacked the ability to truly surprise for some time now, but it does not matter when weekend reports suggest the company will break through the $1 trillion barrier in revenues derived from the iPhone since its launch a decade ago.
Woods notes that Apple gave “few clues” on what we can expect from the upcoming iPhone 8.
He says: "Expectations are running at unprecedentedly high levels for this 10th anniversary update to the iPhone and Apple will need to deliver something special to give iPhone owners clear reasons to upgrade from existing iPhones."
However, the analysts say the focus of WWDC was to give an indication of where the future revenues are coming from. The developed world is moving on, but not away, from the smartphone and Apple wants to be at the forefront of this new business. IDC's Reith says: "I think all WWDC announcements have been strong, but because they are more about laying groundwork for future app developments they seem less sexy as a hardware announcement. Things like HomeKit, ARKit, etc are bit platform initiatives that will be a part of Apple strategy for quite some time."One Racing), Dewald Brummer (2 – MAD Racing / Grand Prix Models) and Daniel Rowe (11 – Ferodo Racing) in direct competition as they wrestle for the last points of the year.

I Introduction
When handling large datasets that exceed the capacity of the main memory, movement of data between main memory and external memory (disk), rather than actual (CPU) computation time, is often the bottleneck in the computation. The reason for this is that disk access is orders of magnitude slower than internal memory access. Thus, since data is moved between disk and main memory in large contiguous blocks, it is often more important to design algorithms that minimize block movement than computation time when handling massive data. This has led to the development of a large number of I/O-efficient algorithms in the I/O-model by Aggarwal and Vitter [1]. In this model, the computer is equipped with a two-level memory hierarchy consisting of an internal memory capable of holding data items and an external memory of conceptually unlimited size. All computation has to happen on data in internal memory and data is transferred between internal and external memory in blocks of consecutive data items. Such a transfer is called an I/O-operation or I/O, and the cost of an algorithm is the number of I/Os it performs. The number of I/Os required to read or write items from disk is , while the number of I/Os required to sort items is [1].
While many I/O-efficient algorithms have been developed in the I/O-model of computation, actually implementing these algorithms can be somewhat of a challenge since operating systems do not give complete control over movement of blocks and management of main memory. However, two major libraries TPIE [13] and STXXL [10] have been developed to support I/O-efficient algorithm implementations. It turns out that most I/O-efficient algorithms are naturally composed of components that stream through one or more lists of data items while producing one or more such output lists, or components that sort such lists. TPIE in particular uses this to provide an interface where list stream processing and sorting can be implemented in a simple and modular way without having to worry about memory management or block movement. However, if care is not taken, such a streaming-based implementation can lead to practically inefficient algorithms since lists of data items are typically written to (and read from) disk between components. In implementations consisting of many small (but I/O-efficient) components, the I/Os incurred when writing and reading such lists can easily comprise more than half of the total number of I/Os, and while this may not be a problem when considering asymptotic theoretical performance, it is unacceptable in practice when the total execution time is measured in hours or days.
In this paper we present a major extension of the TPIE library that includes a pipelining framework that allows for practically efficient streaming-based implementations while minimizing I/O-overhead between streaming components. The framework pipelines streaming components to avoid I/Os between components, that is, it processes several components simultaneously while passing output from one component directly to the input of the next component in main memory. TPIE automatically determines which components to pipeline and performs the required main memory management, and the extension also includes support for parallelization of internal memory computation and progress tracking across an entire application. Thus TPIE supports efficient streaming-based implementations of I/O-efficient algorithms, and TPIE applications are naturally implemented as reusable components, thereby reducing programming time and code duplication.
I-a Previous Work
As mentioned, two major software libraries support implementation of I/O-efficient algorithms for big data analysis, namely TPIE [13] and STXXL [10]. They are both C software libraries, and as opposed to many of the frameworks that have emerged for supporting big data analysis in the last decade, such as e.g. MapReduce [9], Spark [15], and Flink [3], they mainly support single-host implementations. One reason for this is that the libraries, in particular TPIE, are designed to support implementations on standard commodity hardware. Another reason is that no efficient distributed algorithms are known for many of the problems for which I/O-efficient algorithms have been studied and implemented; we refer to surveys [4, 14] and descriptions of implementations (e.g. [2, 5, 6, 11, 12]) for references. Thus in this paper we also focus on single-host implementations. However, is should be mentioned that in the context of distributed programming, pipelining has recently been studied with the Thrill framework [8].
Although both libraries for implementation of I/O-efficient algorithms, the overall philosophies of the TPIE and STXXL are somewhat different. The philosophy of TPIE (the Templated Portable I/O Environment) is to provide a high-level interface that allows for easy translation of abstract I/O-efficient algorithm descriptions into code that is portable across computational platforms and not unnecessarily complex. Thus building on the fact that most I/O-efficient algorithms are composed of streaming components, TPIE provides a generic stream interface that hides how blocked I/O is performed and instead provides methods for processing one data item at a time. TPIE also provides internal memory management where memory allocations are automatically counted towards an application-wide memory limit, and where an application can at any point determine the currently available main memory. Thus applications do not have to explicitly keep track of available memory, which often simplifies implementations considerably. For example, in the TPIE built-in streaming-based implementation of the I/O-optimal external multi-way merge-sort, the number of sorted streams that can be merged I/O-efficiently (without being swapped out by the operating system) depends on the available main memory, where care has to be taken to ensure that the memory used to hold blocks of items for each used stream is counted towards the amount of available memory. The TPIE memory management allows for determining the number of streams to merge without explicitly keeping track of available memory and memory used for blocked I/O. Overall, TPIE is designed to remove focus from the tedious details of creating I/O-efficient applications and allows for implementations that are efficient on all hardware platforms with minimal configuration.
The philosophy of STXXL (Standard Template library for XXL data sets) on the other hand is to achieve maximum I/O-throughput by reducing I/O-overhead as much as possible and by exposing the characteristics of the hardware to the application programmer. Thus, to avoid any overhead induced by the operating system, STXXL allows the user to configure separate disks for use with applications outside of the file systems of the operating system. In fact, STXXL project programmers recommend that a separate disk is set aside for STXXL applications. STXXL also explicitly supports parallel disks. Like TPIE, STXXL supports streaming-based implementations and includes various basic streaming components such as sorting, but unlike TPIE it actually contains support for pipelining of streaming components. However, STXXL expects the application programmer to explicitly define which components to pipeline and explicitly manage main memory. Thus, the programmer e.g. has to specify how much memory each streaming component in a pipelined application should use. A separate (not officially released) branch of STXXL contains support for utilizing multi-core processors for the internal-memory work of pipelined applications [7]. Overall, STXXL is designed such that an application can be tailored to the available hardware, and with the proper configuration an STXXL application can achieve close to full utilization of the available I/O bandwidth.
I-B Our Results
In this paper we present a major extension of the TPIE library that includes a pipelining framework that allows for practically efficient streaming-based implementations while minimizing I/O-overhead between streaming components. The extension also includes support for progress tracking across an entire application and for parallelization of internal memory computation.
Like STXXL, the TPIE pipelining framework saves I/Os by passing intermediate results between streaming components directly in main memory. However, TPIE pipelining is the first framework to provide automatic pipeline and memory management and thus combining the best of the TPIE and STXXL streaming philosophies. The framework is component-centric in that the memory requirement of each streaming component is specified locally by the component developer. The automatic pipeline and memory management then means that at runtime TPIE will automatically determine which components to pipeline and distribute memory among multiple components of a large application in a way that automatically uses all the main memory available to the application. Thus, unlike in STXXL, a TPIE programmer e.g. does not have to consider how the memory uses of the individual components have to be adjusted when they are combined into an application. While such adjustments, along with adjustments of the grouping of components into pipelines, can be done manually for small projects, it can be very cumbersome for large-scale professional software projects involving many programmers, where modification of a component to use more memory can very easily lead to memory over-usage problems if the memory use of other components are not adjusted accordingly. Thus the TPIE component-centric approach simplifies the application development process, promotes modularity and supports maintainability.
Since I/O-efficient applications are typically long-running processes that take hours or days to complete, it is important that an application is able to provide a progress bar that gives a precise estimate of the progress of its execution. To be able to do so in a simple way, the TPIE extension also takes a component-centric approach. Like for memory use, a component developer can in a simple way include support for information about the progress of the component, and TPIE automatically combines information from all components and thus supports a single progress bar that advances from 0% to 100% at a constant pace. Thus, again the use of a component-centric approach promotes modularity.
Especially after minimizing I/O, the use of multi-core parallelization can often help to bring down the running time of massive data applications. Thus the TPIE extension includes easy support for such parallelization by allowing the application programmer to wrap a part of a pipeline in a parallelization directive that will trivially parallelize it across all CPU cores. For instance, when forming sorted runs in multi-way merge sort, the internal memory sorting algorithm in TPIE automatically uses all the available CPU cores.
Overall, the major TPIE library extension presented in this paper supports efficient streaming-based implementations of I/O-efficient algorithm in a simple, modular and maintainable way, and I/O-efficient algorithms can thus be composed and adapted in commercial and research applications while dealing systematically with important aspects, such as memory management and progress tracking, that are not intrinsic to the algorithmically optimal solution. The extended library has already been used to evaluate I/O-efficient algorithms in the research literature (e.g. [5, 6]) and is heavily used in I/O-efficient commercial terrain processing applications by the Danish startup SCALGO111SCALGO: Scalable Algorithmics.. The extension is integrated into the official TPIE project that is available on GitHub as free and open source software222TPIE: Templated Portable I/O Environment..
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section II, we motivate pipelining with a concrete algorithm based on scanning and sorting. After this motivation, we in Section III present in full generality how to use the TPIE extension and briefly discuss its implementation.
Ii An Example Problem
In this section we present an example of a typical sub-problem in an I/O-efficient application, and we show that the problem benefits from a pipelined implementation. By implementing every sub-problem in a bigger data processing application (such as the real-world example in Figure 1) using pipelining, more than half of the I/Os overall can be saved.
Ii-a The Raster Transformation Problem
In geographic information systems (GIS), a terrain is often represented as a raster of heights with each cell indicating the height of the terrain in a certain point. Since the Earth is spherical and a raster is flat, it is not possible to map the entire surface of the Earth continuously to a raster. However, if only a particular region, country or continent needs to be represented, it is possible to project the chosen region to a plane in a way that roughly maintains the geodesic distances and areas. When several rasters must be processed together they must be in the same projection.
We call the problem of transforming a raster from one projection to another the raster transformation problem. Essentially, the problem consists of projecting each cell of the raster from the source projection plane to the unit sphere and from the unit sphere to the target projection plane. These two steps can be represented by a function that maps each cell of the target raster projection to the corresponding cell of the source raster projection. Thus, in the raster transformation problem we are given an input raster of size (that is a by matrix of numbers) stored in row-major order, and we want to produce an output raster of size in row-major order such that the value of a cell in is copied from the value of a cell in . Below we for convenience let be the number of cells in both the input and output raster.
The raster transformation problem can easily be solved in optimal time simply by for each cell in reading the corresponding input value at in . However, this solution might be very I/O-inefficient. For example, if represents matrix transposition where then each access to requires a new block to be read (assuming ) and thus the solution performs I/Os in the worst case. For matrix transposition in particular, only I/Os are required [1]. In fact, in general the problem can be solved in I/Os using a simple five step streaming algorithm (refer to Figure (a)a): First a stream is constructed containing for each cell of an item consisting of a pair . Next is sorted such that appear in the same row-major order used to store . In the third step, and are then scanned simultaneously to construct a stream containing an item for each pair in where is the value of at position . Then is sorted into the row-major order used to store . In the fifth and final step, is then scanned and for each entry the value is output to . Since the algorithm performs a constant number of scanning and sorting steps it uses I/Os and can easily be implemented using the streaming support of either TPIE or STXXL. Refer to GitHub333 for a TPIE code example.
As discussed in the introduction, streaming-based implementations of even simple I/O-efficient algorithms, as the raster transformation algorithm above, might not be practically efficient because items are written to disk between steps. To illustrate this, we will analyze the exact number of items read and written by the above algorithm. For simplicity, we assume that elements can be sorted using reads and writes, which is a practically realistic assumption if external merge-sort is used. Recall that external merge-sort works by first scanning through the input elements and sorting elements at a time in internal memory to produce sorted runs. This requires reads and writes. Next the sorted runs are merged together at a time (using a block of internal memory for each run) to produce longer sorted runs, again using reads and writes. The merging process is repeated until a single sorted output is obtained. However, in practice (where , and are on the order of , and , respectively) so only a single merging step is required. Using this, we can easily realize that the above raster transformation algorithm requires reads and writes without pipelining (refer again to Figure (a)a): Generating the stream in the first step requires writes, and sorting it in the second step requires reads and writes. Reading and simultaneously in the third step to produce requires reads and writes. Again, sorting in the fourth step requires reads and writes, and finally, reading and writing in the fifth step requires reads and writes. However, by modifying the five steps of the algorithm so that the intermediate result of one step is immediately used by the next step (if possible) without storing the intermediate result on disk, that is, by using pipelining, we can reduce the number of reads and writes to each. More precisely, we can save writes and reads of between step one and two by immediately producing the initial sorted runs of step two while performing step one. Similarly, we can save the writes and reads of between step two and three by performing step three (scanning and ) simultaneously with merging the sorted runs. Note that apart from the write and read between the run formation and merging in step two, we in this way avoid writing altogether. In a similar way, we can avoid writing and save reads and writes by also producing the initial sorted run of step four while performing step 3, as well as reads and writes by performing step five simultaneously with merging of the sorted runs in step 4. Altogether, we save reads and writes, that is, over half of the I/Os. Although this does not change the asymptotic I/O-complexity of the algorithm, it translates into a running time reduction of 22 hours if we assume an input size of 1 TB and a disk read/write speed of 100 MB/s.
Note that the pipelining process described above conceptually transforms the five-step algorithm into a three-phase algorithm as indicated in Figure (b)b, where e.g. the second phase consists of the merging part of the step two sorting, step three, and the run formation part of the step four sorting. One could of course implement the algorithm by implementing these three phases directly, that is, by implementing several special versions of external merge-sort (or rather, special run formation, merging, and merging-run formation implementations). However, this would not only be cumbersome, but also unacceptable from a software engineering point of view. Instead, direct support of pipelining where the five-step algorithm is automatically pipelined would be desirable. However, such a pipelining would require system support for identification of phases and careful memory management. For example, the merge and run formation parts of phase two of the three-phase algorithm would normally both require all of the main memory, so the memory somehow needs to be divided between the two parts. As described below, this is handled somewhat differently in STXXL and the new TPIE extension.
Ii-B STXXL Implementation
When implementing the raster transformation algorithm with pipelining using the STXXL streaming layer, the five steps of the algorithm are implemented individually as is natural from a software engineering point of view; we call each such individual part of a pipeline a component. However, since STXXL does not handle memory management, the implementation that combines the components then has to identify the three phases of the algorithm explicitly and compute how much memory is allocated to each of the components of a phase. Refer to Figure 3 for STXXL code that implements this, that is, the main code that implements the five step algorithm in three phases (excluding the code for the individual components). The code illustrates how three phases are explicitly identified and memory allocated. For example, in phase two the memory available for the two sorting components (merging of step two and run formation of step four) is computed by setting aside a buffer of size of the available main memory for reading the input, and then share the remaining memory between the two sorting components. Concretely, the computation is performed with the statement: sort_memory = (memory_available - block_size) / 2. While identifying phases and allocating memory in this way is easy in our simple example algorithm, it is more difficult in larger applications such as the example given in Figure 1. Especially if more than one programmer is working on the application, it is difficult and error-prone to distribute memory correctly.
Apart from the complexity that the need for phase identification and memory allocation adds to pipelined STXXL code, there are also some C syntax issues that add to the code complexity. More precisely, the C syntax used is quite verbose since for technical reasons names of the components often need to be repeated. The reason is that STXXL combines pipelining components using a C feature known as template instantiation that allows for the compiler to inline function calls between different components of the pipeline. For performance reasons, this is necessary when many small components are pipelined. However, the template instantiation syntax is not well-suited for use in large pipelined applications. As an example, consider the C statement typedef TransformPoints<GenerateOutputPoints> TransformOutputPoints; in the STXXL implementation of the raster transformation algorithm. In this statement, the C language typedef statement is used to declare TransformOutputPoints to be a type alias for the TransformPoints component instantiated with the GenerateOutputPoints component. Such a type alias is needed for each component of the pipeline, and only when all the type aliases have been defined the individual component objects can be declared and constructed. In this way, the pipeline has to be defined both in terms of type aliases nested within each other and as actual component objects combined together.
Ii-C TPIE Implementation Using Pipelining
As in the case of pipelined STXXL, in the implementation of the five step raster transformation algorithm using the extended TPIE library with pipelining, the components of the pipeline are implemented individually. However unlike in the STXXL implementation, the combination of the components becomes very simple since TPIE is component-centric and automatically identifies phases and performs memory management. To illustrate this, a diagram showing the eight components used to implement the five steps is given in Figure (a)a along with the pipelining code in Figure (b)b. Note how the code in Figure (b)b lines LABEL:line:tp-def-begin-LABEL:line:tp-def-end naturally corresponds to the pipeline in Figure (a)a. Note that the reading and writing of rasters are handled by two special components to separate the handling of specific raster formats from the algorithm, and how the two sorting components are implemented using two different built-in TPIE sorting components defined in lines LABEL:line:tp-sort1 and LABEL:line:tp-sort2 on Figure (b)b. The reason two different sorter implementations are used (and that the pipeline is defined in two statements defining p1 and p2, respectively) is that the output from the component sorting has to be read by the component constructing simultaneously with the output from the component reading the input raster . Thus, the component constructing has to control when data is received from the sorting component which is done through pull-based streaming. This functionality is implemented with a TPIE so-called passive sorter with an input and an output part defined in line LABEL:line:tp-sort1. On the other hand, the component sorting is a more traditional pipelined component that uses push-based streaming, where input data is received from preceding component (in this case the component constructing ) when ready, and output data in turn pushed to the subsequent component. It is defined with an ordinary TPIE sorter in line LABEL:line:tp-sort2. As an example of a component implementation, the code implementing the component generate_output_points is given in Figure 5. The component contains a method propagate() that is called by TPIE when setting up the pipeline, and a method go() that is called by TPIE to execute the actual component. The component also uses push-based streaming, and it pushes each produced element to the next component by calling the push() method of that component. The details of how the push and pull mechanisms work will be discussed in Section III, where the full TPIE pipelining framework and its implementation is described. Below we highlight some of the other framework features that are used in the raster transformation example.
Memory management. As mentioned, TPIE automatically manages memory and divides available memory among components in a pipeline. Thus in the pipeline definition in Figure (b)b there is no code at all dealing with memory distribution. Often many components use only a small amount of static memory, whereas components such as sorting require dynamically allocated memory depending on the amount of available memory. In the latter case the component has to specify its minimum and maximum memory requirements in its implementation. In the example component shown in Figure 5 no requirement is specified since only static memory is used.
Metadata. Often many components in a pipeline need some sort of metadata about the items that are being streamed between components. In the example, certain components need to use the dimensions of the input and output rasters. While such metadata can of course be passed as parameters to the individual components in the pipeline definition, doing so makes the definition needlessly cluttered. Instead, TPIE provides a general facility for passing metadata between pipeline components. Thus, in Figure (b)b lines LABEL:line:tp-forward-begin-LABEL:line:tp-forward-end, the pipeline definition uses forward() to pass the dimensions of the input and output rasters to the components that need them. The individual components can then obtain the metadata using fetch(), such as when the component generate_output_points in Figure 5 line 5 retrieves the dimensions of the output raster.
Progress reporting. In the example, the TPIE support for progress reporting (e.g. as a progress bar) is also used. As with memory requirements, the code required to supply progress information is not part of the code in Figure (b)b where the pipeline is defined, but rather part of the implementation of the individual component. Thus, the component in Figure 5 provides the needed information by using set_steps() in line 5 in the propagate() method to define how many items it will produce, and then calling a progress stepping function in line 5 in the go() method for each item that it produces. When executing the pipeline in line LABEL:line:tp-exec of Figure (b)b the argument pi is a reference to a progress indicator object that tells TPIE how to display progress. To provide accurate progress estimations, TPIE actually uses statistical information about progress of previous runs of the code. To store information about runs, the problem’s instance size n, computed in line LABEL:line:tp-n, as well as a symbol TPIE_FSI used to identify the application being executed, are also passed to the TPIE framework when executing the pipeline in line LABEL:line:tp-exec.
Parallelism. The example takes advantage of TPIE support for multi-core CPU parallelism in two ways. First, the sorter components automatically parallelized in the run-formation phase. Second, wrapping the component compute_transformation in the directive tpie::pipelining::parallel(…) in line LABEL:line:tp-parallel makes TPIE automatically distribute this part of the computation among all available CPU cores.
Iii TPIE Pipelining
In this section we describe the TPIE pipelining framework in more detail. First in Section III-A we describe how to use the framework, and then in Section III-B we discuss some aspects of the implementation of the framework.
Iii-a Pipelining Use
In this section we first describe how a TPIE pipeline consisting of a number of components can be modeled using a so-called flow graph, and how this graph can be used to identify pipeline phases. Then we describe how components are implemented. Finally, we describe how a TPIE pipeline is constructed and executed.
Flow graph and phase identification. As described in Section II-C, a TPIE pipeline consists of a number of components that push data to or pull data from other components. We distinguish between two types of components, namely regular components that produce output as the input is processed and blocking components that have to process all input before producing any output. Blocking components consist of two sub-components, namely an input and an output sub-component, where the input sub-component processes all input before the output sub-component is invoked to produce the output; the input sub-component might store intermediate results on disk. Sorting is an example of a blocking component; the input sub-component naturally corresponds to the initial run formation step and the output sub-component to the merging step. Blocking components introduce the need for pipeline phases that are executed independently, since the input and output sub-components cannot be executed simultaneously. In the raster transformation algorithm in Section II, the three phases are exactly needed due to the two blocking sorting components.
A pipeline can conveniently be represented by a directed acyclic flow graph, with regular nodes corresponding to regular components and input nodes and output nodes corresponding to the sub-components of blocking components. Regular nodes are connected with other regular nodes and input and output nodes by edges directed along the streaming direction and labeled as push edges or pull edges in a natural way; note that a node cannot have both an outgoing push and an outgoing pull edge. Each input node is also connected with a directed blocking edge to the corresponding output node. To be able to automatically determine the phases of a pipeline, TPIE requires that the flow graph corresponding to the pipeline has two particular properties: First, if all blocking edges are removed, then no input and output nodes corresponding to the same blocking component should be in the same connected component. Second, if all push and pull edges are contracted, then the graph should be acyclic. The first property means that the connected components directly identify the pipeline phases that need to be executed independently. When each such connected component is contracted, each directed edge in the resulting graph indicates that the phase corresponding to needs to be executed before the phase corresponding to . Thus the second property ensures that there exists a valid (topological) order in which to execute the components.
While the second flow graph property above has to be fulfilled for any pipelined program to be valid, the first property only has to be fulfilled if we require that the program is constructed such that all but blocking components can be pipelined, that is, that streaming items are only written to disk by blocking components. For example, consider the small pipeline shown on the right, where component pushes to both a sorter and to a component , which in turn pulls output from the sorter. In this case, , and
the input and output nodes of the sorter are all in the same connected component in the phase graph without blocking edges. However, it is obviously not possible to pipeline all the components in one phase. In particular, it is not possible to pipeline and , since the output from the sorter used in is not available at the same time as the output from also used in . To remedy this problem, and make the flow graph fulfill the second property, a simple blocking component that delays the stream of items from to , by writing them temporarily to disk, can be inserted between and in the pipeline (such that the example has two phases). To support this, TPIE not only contains a built-in sorting blocking component, but also blocking components that delay and reverse a stream. Each of these components come in an active and a passive variant. In the active variant both the input and output sub-components use push-based streaming, and in the passive variant the input sub-component is push-based and the output sub-component pull-based.
Component implementation. The interface of each component in a TPIE pipeline must have certain methods; sub-components are essentially like regular components, so when we refer to components below we mean regular components and sub-components.
Methods push(), pull(), and can_pull() are used to stream data items between components. Consider a component corresponding to a node in the flow graph that produces data that is processed by a component corresponding to a node in the graph, that is, where there is an edge . With a slight abuse of notation, we use and to refer to the two components. If the edge is a push edge we say that is a destination of , and then must implement a push() method and must push each item in the stream to by calling the method .push(). If on the other hand the edge is a pull edge we say that is a source of , and then must implement a pull() method and must pull each item from by calling the method .pull(); must also implement the method can_pull() to return true if there is more data to pull and false otherwise.
A component that is neither the destination or the source of any other component must implement a go() method that repeatedly pushes or pulls data until there is no more data to process. This is because data is neither pushed to or pulled from by other components calling .push() or .pull(). Thus the go() method is used to start the execution of a phase.
Each component must implement (possibly empty) begin() and end() methods that are called before and after the stream processing of the phase containing , respectively. These methods can for example be used to allocate and deallocate memory used by , or set up data structures needed by . Component is also allowed to push items to its destinations and pull items from its sources in begin() and end(). This is e.g. useful when buffers need to be filled up at the beginning or emptied at the end of a phase.
Each component must also implement a (possibly empty) propagate() method that is also called before any stream processing in the phase containing and used to pass metadata between components. Inside the propagate() method may use the forward function to pass key-value pairs to components that can be reached from in the flow graph. It may use the fetch function to retrieve named metadata from other components. Often metadata includes information about input and output data size, and if TPIE should provide progress reporting, at least one component in each phase should provide progress information by calling the function set_steps() inside the propagate() method to indicate the number of items that it will process, and then call the step() function once for each item that is processed. Often is a node with no incoming push or pull edges in the flow graph, that is, the node that creates streaming data.
Finally, a component that requires dynamically allocated memory to perform its stream processing needs to indicate this to TPIE by calling the functions set_minimum_memory() and set_maximum_memory() in its class constructor to request between and bytes of memory, where is used to indicate that the component requests as much memory as possible. After TPIE has distributed memory, can then obtain information about how much memory it was assigned between and by calling the function get_available_memory() in the begin() method.
Pipeline construction and execution. After defining the pipelining components, a pipeline is constructed by stringing together components using the so-called pipe operator as in the expression p = generate_output_points() |compute_transformation() |sort_S1.input().memory(2) where three components, generate_output_points(), compute_transformation() and the input sub-component of sort_S1 are pipelined. For each component, as for the sort_S1.input() component in the example, one can set a memory priority using memory() to indicate to TPIE how important it is to allocate memory to the component; by default the priority is one, and a priority of means that if several components all request as much memory as possible using set_maximum_memory() then a component with priority will receive times the amount of memory as one with priority one.
To execute the pipeline one simply calls the object . TPIE then builds the flow graph and computes connected components to identify phases, and then contracts the components and topologically sorts the graph to find the order in which to execute the phases. After this TPIE executes each phase in turn. To execute a phase, TPIE first distributes memory to each component in the phase based on the memory requests and priorities, and then it calls the methods propagate(), begin(), go() and end() on the components in a specific order based on the flow graph. First, propagate() is called on the components in the phase in topological order to allow each component to call forward(), fetch() and set_steps(). The topological order is used since a component has to be able to pass metadata to components reachable from in the flow graph. Next begin() is called on all components in the order obtained by topologically sorting the flow graph where all push edges have been reversed; this topological order exists as the graph is acyclic, since a node in the flow graph cannot have both an outgoing push and an outgoing pull edge. This particular topological order is used since for a push edge , should be able to push to in .begin(), so .begin() should be called after .begin(); similarly, if is a pull edge, then .begin() must be called after .begin() is called. After this initialization, the main streaming part of the phase is executed by calling the go() method on the appropriate component. Finally, at the end of the phase end() is called on the components in reverse order of the begin() order, that is, in reverse topological order.
Iii-B Pipelining Implementation
Above we have already discussed how TPIE identifies and executes phases of a pipeline, and due to space constraints we cannot describe the entire implementation of TPIE pipelining in detail. In this section we therefore briefly discuss a few aspects of the implementation not described above. The interested reader is also referred to the technical documentation of TPIE .
Memory management. As mentioned, TPIE distributes memory to components in a phase based on the minimum and maximum memory requirements, along with the memory priority of each component in the phase. Component is assigned bytes of memory, for a value of such that the total assigned memory is smaller than the available memory. This way memory is distributed proportionally to the memory priorities unless this gives an amount of memory outside the interval. Since is a non-decreasing function of , TPIE can use binary search to find . Refer to Figure 6 for an example.
Progress reporting. TPIE also supports progress reporting for a pipeline. To ensure that a progress bar shown to the user progresses from 0% to 100% at a constant pace, TPIE maintains an execution time database with information about how large a fraction of the execution time was spent in each phase in the execution of the pipeline that processed the largest instance size. In order to distinguish between different pipelines in the execution time database, each pipeline execution carries the preprocessor macro TPIE_FSI as an argument, which is expanded by the compiler into a string that uniquely identifies the location in the code where the pipeline is defined. In this way, TPIE can store information about multiple pipelines in the execution time database.
Automatic parallelization. Automatic multi-core CPU parallelism is supported in TPIE by applying the tpie::pipelining::parallel(…) directive to a push-based pipeline component. In this case, the processing of the component is distributed among the available CPU cores by instantiating a copy of the component for each core and passing items to these components in a round-robin fashion as they arrive. To amortize the overhead of thread synchronization, items are passed to components in batches of items at a time.
Function inlining. To minimize the computational overhead of the many push() and pull() function calls required when executing a pipeline, TPIE is designed to allow the compiler to inline the processing of several consecutive pipelining components into one function. As in STXXL, this is achieved using template instantiations in C. Thus, if pushes to in the pipeline, then when is compiled the type of is known to the compiler so the implementation of .push() can be inlined into . However unlike STXXL, TPIE is designed to hide the resulting complex type definitions from the pipeline definition, and instead of using recursive template instantiations the pipe operator can be used to define a TPIE pipeline. This is very convenient when building large pipelined applications.

Web Site:My interest in Red Rock Country has shifted from Moab and all of its crowds and development to the Glen Canyon region. The history and geology is just as fascinating but it doesn’t feel quite as much like multitudes have preceded me. There is also the added element of a huge desert lake, offering nearly 2000 miles of shoreline. I have visited the few miles that are accessible by the rare handful of roads penetrating its labyrinth of canyons and have come to the conclusion that I would need some kind of boat to visit any more. Now, before I jump into buying a boat, I’ll definitely have to check out pontoonboatsreview.com‘s guide on when the right time is to purchase.
I am well aware of the small number of highly vocal people who see the creation of Lake Powell as an ecological calamity and want it drained. I have even read a lot of what has been written by them. Glen Canyon as they see it ceased to exist before most of them or I were even born. The version I saw on my trip was the most beautiful place I have visited in the entire Colorado Plateau. There are now hundreds of miles of canyons accessible to anybody who can hire a boat and I suspect that this ease of access is what they really want to end. There is no shortage of otherworldly scenery in Glen Canyon in its current state, that is for sure!
My wife Maria and I have tossed around the idea of houseboating Lake Powell, this year we finally decided to go for it. We rented the smallest houseboat available from Lake Powell Resorts and Marinas- the 46 foot Expedition. It has one bedroom, ¾ bath, a full kitchen including a refrigerator and a generator with an inverter. Propulsion is via a single in/outboard Mercruiser engine with a 110 gallon fuel tank. The boat had a top speed of 8mph, most of the time we cruised at 7mph and got 1.5mpg out of it. Whatever advantage my Cherokee has in speed and fuel economy, the boat trumps with comfort and convenience. Not to mention the fact a Jeep can’t handle water more than a couple of feet deep!
We set aside the week before Memorial Day for our trip for several reasons. The days are getting pretty long but lack the blazing heat of summer. Monsoon season and its wild weather is still a month away. The crowds don’t really pick up until after the holiday. Since it is an off-peak period, houseboat rental rates are lower. Gas prices are still below their summer peak. The water level is rising for the two month period centered around this date. The lake’s water level has not been this high since 2002.
While the houseboat would provide basic transportation and a comfortable home base, we would need some way to get around in the many small canyons that make this lake so special. I am a confirmed landlubber and my wife can’t even swim but we settled on the aquatic version of hiking: kayaking. We took lessons at a local pool and much to my surprise Maria loved it! In order to procure the boats we liked most in time for our trip, I had to rent one and buy the other. We barely got the kayaks and associated gear together in time for departure.
Packing for a houseboating/kayaking trip was quite a bit different than for the self-supported backcountry driving and camping trips we usually do with our Cherokee. I have always hated carrying stuff on the roof but that was the only place I could put the 2 kayaks so I mounted a Thule Stacker to the factory rack. Then there was the matter of bringing along enough good food for two people to eat on a 9 day trip with zero possibility of “running into town”. That meant getting a bigger cooler since we would have a fridge in which to keep perishables. I ended up removing the spare tire, jack and much of the camping gear that is a permanent fixture of the interior of my Cherokee in order for it all to fit. While I was at it I removed the winch to deter thieves since the vehicle would be sitting at the marina for a week.
Our adventure began with a 1am departure from Albuquerque, in order to catch the 8am ferry out of Halls Crossing. We were renting the houseboat from Bullfrog Marina.
The reliable traveling companion turned beast of burden on the ferry crossing.
Fortunately I packed everything in clear plastic totes, which were easy to load and unload. We were expected to haul all of our luggage on handcarts from the parking lot to the boat. It took several trips and about 45 minutes to transfer everything, all the while being thankful that we made the conscious effort to pack light.
Once we had everything aboard we were greeted by Aaron, our houseboat instructor. Having done nothing but tent camping my whole life it was good to have someone to show me how the RV style generator and propane powered amenities worked. He also went over some of the basics of houseboat handling and navigation but to be honest I leaned more by researching the internet beforehand. A few of the things learned on the web came in handy before we even left the dock. I noticed that the boat lacked a shovel- the accepted way of securing a houseboat on Lake Powell is to dig a hole on a sandy beach to bury each anchor. Also, the boat was only supplied with 2 anchors. If you want to sleep through the night, 4 anchors are really necessary, especially while the lake is on the rise. I brought these items up and a shovel and 2 more anchors were doled out, along with the admonition that a maximum of 4 anchors were permitted on a boat our size.
After a couple of hours with Aaron he ran out of things to tell us and we ran out of things to ask him. Suddenly we came to the realization that we were now expected to motor this big, expensive houseboat away from its safe mooring in a calm harbor out into this huge lake where for the next 9 days we would be responsible for its safely and ours, while under way and at anchor, no matter what the weather had in store for us. Between the two of us our sum nautical experience consisted of a couple of hours paddling kayaks around an indoor swimming pool. I did what I am sure any man in my position would do: I turned to my wife and said, “why don’t you drive it first, honey!” Aaron actually offered that he could pilot boats in and out of the harbor but I suggested that he just come along and offer pointers as Maria drove it out. She did a fine job of getting us out of the harbor and Aaron hopped into the pilot boat, bidding us “bon voyage!”
Maria at the helm. For some reason this boat is right hand drive, I have no idea if that is typical.
After a while I took over the helm. Driving a houseboat has similarities to the experience of driving a car, but there are also significant differences. The fist one I noticed was the steering. The houseboat has a big steering wheel that takes more effort to turn as the boat goes (relatively) faster. It also does not have any “centering” feel. You can let it go at any time and the boat continues turning at whatever rate you set. This makes it hard to go anywhere in a straight line as you have to look at the horizon or the compass to tell if you are going straight. Consequently we headed downlake in a zigzag manner. I told Maria this was to deter U boat attacks. She was happy to take a seat on the front deck, free from worries of torpedos and watch the scenery of Glen Canyon unfold.
Here we come, Annies Canyon! This was my first opportunity to find out what happens when you take a 46 foot houseboat into a box canyon. I wanted to learn for myself as those little canyons were what we came to Lake Powell to see.
The boat turned out to be pretty maneuverable, using short bursts of WOT while cranking the wheel hard one way or the other made 3 point turns a leisurely but doable affair. While in Annies we looked for our first night’s mooring site but didn’t find anything. We met success further down the lake at Iceberg Canyon. There were quite a few boats parked in here already but it was getting late and we found room for one more so we made our first camp.
We were both pooped so we called it a vacation and remained here for the next 2 nights. It was really hot, in the high 90’s. Luckily I packed the reflectorized tarps that I use to cool my tent, as well as some light rope to hang them over the windows. This brought down the interior temperature by a good 5 degrees. We actually resorted to running the air conditioner one evening, which we wanted to avoid as the generator needs to be on, making noise and burning our limited supply of gasoline.
My wife wasn’t ready to try kayaking just yet so I headed out by myself to explore… and seek cooler weather. It was quite hot on the houseboat but it was sure cool traveling low and slow in the lake!
Our houseboat stayed in the sun most of the day
My first stop was Dougs Cathedral. It was spectacular, as billed! The hike was a study in contrasts. First a blazingly hot, dry wash. Then came the trickling creek with jungle-like vegetation to push through.
The little lake above the rockfall dam was next. I parked the kayak in the trees on the left side of the canyon as there was the self proclaimed “houseboat from hell” anchored on the beach to the right with the sound system cranked to ROCK CONCERT levels. I don’t know if the volume knob was stuck or what, it was just as loud the day before when we motored up that finger hoping to moor there.
Anyways, I hiked up and over the rockfall to have a look at the lake. It was eerily beautiful, with its drowned forest and calm, rockbound waters. I couldn’t muster the energy to drag the kayak up and over to explore further, it will remain for another trip.
I recently got Nikon’s new 50mm f/1.4 lens and have been eager to try it out on the night sky. I put it to use in Iceberg and loooooved it! The stars look like points, not lines and I don’t have to wonder is that noise or is it a star?
This is at ISO 800, 10 sec @ F/1.8. The moon, still below the horizon at 2:50am, is illuminating some thin clouds.
We called the Escalante River home for most of the rest of our time at the lake. This tributary canyon was every bit as big and impressive as Glen Canyon. We found the only place in Fiftymile Creek where a boat our size would fit. We were parked underneath a huge, majestic alcove and across from where the submerged Gregory Natural Bridge is located. There was very little traffic here, maybe 10 boats a day. This was a good thing as the wakes would bounce back-n-forth off the vertical sandstone walls for a good half hour before calming down again. Thank you to those few who slowed down as you passed!
Fiftymile Creek begged exploration by kayak.
I got my wife into her boat for the first time outside a swimming pool. She had asked me beforehand, “what if I am scared”? I gave her some bs about the canyon being sooo beautiful that all thoughts of claustrophobia or drowning would evaporate.
To be honest, I was a little creeped out at first myself. I have never been dropped down a well before. Kayaking in a bottomless, green lake with sheer vertical canyon walls rising straight out of the water, where the course curves out of sight forward and behind gave me an idea of what it might feel like… for about 2 minutes.
Kayaking Fiftymile Creek, Escalante River
We soon felt the urge all true canyon rats feel: “what is around the next corner?”
All thoughts of claustrophobia and drowning evaporated.
It was like the earth held a secret, just for us. She beckoned us forward, revealing a little at a time.
The only sound was the splishing from the hulls of the boats as we paddled forward.
The only witnesses were red lizards watching us pass at eye level, spaced at even intervals like sentries.
We carried onwards, pausing to absorb each new marvel.
Experience says that the scenery around the next bend should look like whatever was around the last one. Not so in Fiftymile.
It was in Fiftymile where I took what has become my favorite pic of the entire trip.
I introduce to you: my new Happy Place.
Like awakening from a dream, our exploration came to an end, where the canyon bottom rose up to 3620 feet above sea level, bringing our kayaks to a halt.
To Willow Gulch
A parting shot before leaving our Fiftymile anchorage. The reflection suggests an arch, in fact Gregory Natural Bridge is located somewhere on that very sandstone rib, some 75 feet below the waters. Look in Stan Jones’ book for a photo of it, pre-lake.
After 2 pleasant nights in Fiftymile we took a short trip over to the next canyon up the Escalante, Willow Gulch. To say our anchorage was beautiful is an understatement. We found a perfect little notch in the shoreline, almost like a dock for the houseboat. I had a jolly time shouting at the rock face off our stern, just to hear the echos.
We hopped in the kayaks again to explore the neighborhood. Much to our surprise there was another houseboat anchored in a huge alcove around the bend! They had an abundance of shade, but I would be too worried about rockfall to sleep well. We did the reflectorized tarp over the window thing again as it was still in the high 90’s. Maria is cooling off a hand in the lake.
Our trip up Willow Gulch turned out to be short. The rising waters of the lake were reclaiming what had been dry since 2002 and the vegetation soon got too dense for passage.
We were intrigued by the slot canyon hike up Bishop Creek shown in Michael Kelsy’s book so we set off with the intention of doing a combination kayak/hike. Besides, Maria was eager to go paddling again!
The view from inside an alcove along the way.
This spooky looking tree has probably stood dead for 40 years!
Kelsy mentioned floating logs at the end of navigation, what we encountered was a LOGJAM!
I tired to force my way over it, then pick and prod my way through it. I was rewarded with one kayak’s length progress after 5 minute’s labor. The way the logs were packed in there was almost like a deliberate blockade. It was sure effective! Maybe the occasional flash flood pushes them out?
After lamenting the heat for the first half of the trip we got the change in weather we had been wishing for. It rained HARD, pretty much all Thursday night. At daybreak on Friday we were greeted by this out the window of our stateroom:
Hunting waterfalls
I am a sissy about camping in the rain. We had been jeepin and camping with Jared during the week of huge rainstorms in October, 2006. We dealt with flash floods coming out of the Maze District of Canyonlands NP. At that point I was ready for a hotel but he convinced me to stay our planned course. Then I got stuck in quicksand between floods in Red Canyon. Later that week the Blue Hills Road was washing out from under us as we tried to reach the highway in Moab during a sudden downpour. It was a spectacular time to be outside, but kind of a pain to camp and drive in.
With a houseboat to call home, the misery of tent camping and the risk of backcountry driving were gone! We were staying dry inside the boat… except for anchoring. The winds were very light considering the severity of the rain. Flash floods? So what! I am on a boat, I’ll just float a little higher! Other than wind and lightning, which this storm lacked, the only thing to watch out for was the sediment and debris buildup where the flood waters entered the lake. We had planned to move on that morning anyways, having spent 2 nights at that site in Willow Gulch. It was raining like crazy, it had been all night and showed no intention of letting up. Upon arrival at our Willow Gulch campsite I had stacked a small cairn to mark the shoreline. By now it was well below the surface of the lake, I’m guessing the water raised by nearly 2 feet in 2 days. The boat was floating again, despite running it up as high on shore as it would go the night before. I was going to get wet, either retightening the anchor ropes or pulling them onboard. There were several waterfalls of various sizes all around us but I wanted to see MORE!
We cast off in search of that most ephemeral of Canyon Country sights- the flash flood waterfall.
Strange tiger stripes in Willow Gulch before we left. Probably little runoff rivulets floating on the surface of the lake undisturbed due to the utter lack of wind and boating activity.
We set out in search of bigger and better waterfalls and whatever spectacles Mother Nature brings out for these occasions. Just around the corner, our neighbors in the shady alcove were now staying dry thanks to their stone roof, although the ruckus from the nearby waterfall was pretty loud.
A couple of big falls on the Escalante:
“Oh look honey, ANOTHER waterfall!”
Hunting waterfalls by houseboat on Lake Powell during a gully washer is like looking for sand on the beach!
The waterfall hunter in his natural element:
Davis Gulch. I guess the water has been so low in recent years you have had to hike to LaGorce Arch. We took the houseboat, to both sides. The upstream side:
Maria was nervous because of the close quarters maneuvering it took to get to the back of LaGorce. Having to squeeze by a cabin cruiser in that space didn’t make her feel any better about the situation. I was having a ball, having always enjoyed a tight, technical jeep or mountain bike trail. Don’t tell my wife though! The houseboat was surprisingly maneuverable once I realized that things happen slowly and short bursts of WOT really gets it to turn. Coming back out:
The rain kept most boaters off the lake. Here’s a couple of parties sheltering in a perfect little alcove near LaGorce Arch.
Clear Creek Canyon, Cathedral in the Desert is up the slot to the left. We didn’t go over for a closer look as I figured Maria had enough of houseboating the tight canyons.
Leaving the Escalante we were heading towards Hole in the Rock to spend the night and maybe hike up one side or the other. We passed Eureka Canyon so we detoured to have a look. Nobody was home and there was a nice, protected mooring site in there so we parked the boat early.
Is it just me or does the pattern in the spall and desert varnish on the opposite side of the river channel look a little like Bob Marley holding a microphone?
I took a leisurely hike to the alcove at the end of the canyon in a light drizzle. There is nothing more peaceful and private than being outdoors in a beautiful place while it is raining. If you can stay warm, that is. At the time of my visit the hard rains had passed and there was the sparest version of a waterfall coming off the rim. It consisted of a spray of large water droplets that were invisible, until I looked really hard for them. I could hear them spattering into the underbrush, it took a while to find the landing zone. There were some trees ringing the backside of the alcove, the impact set them to dancing. Watching the spray of drops making their graceful 6 second fall (yes, I counted) was the ultimate in relaxation.
To Lake Canyon, then home
Our vacation time was coming to an end so we started heading uplake, hoping to find a mooring somewhat near to Bullfrog. It took our slow boat nearly 5 hours to go from Eureka Canyon to Lake Canyon. It had been raining for over 2 days now and we were seeing a lot more boaters out enjoying the waterfalls. I don’t know if this was because we were on the cusp of Memorial Day weekend, were getting closer to the marinas or if the other boaters were more inclined to get out in the weather.
The weather was deteriorating again by the time we got to Lake Canyon. There was a lot more traffic on this end of the lake, as well as some wind making the water rough so we really wanted a site protected from the waves. The pickings looked slim as this canyon was either water or bare sandstone. A combination of desperation and creativity went into the choice of this site. The approach was guarded by some very shallow rocks, I left some aluminum on them during my first attempt. The boulders on shore made setting anchors easy and this turned out to be the most secure mooring job of the whole week. The rain passed as soon as we finished anchoring the boat so we went for a short hike, exploring the nearby area.
One pontoon on shore and the other floating. With tiiiight anchor ropes, we were in the exact same position the next morning.
The fronts of the pontoons were reinforced and could handle being up on shore pretty hard. This thing was the lake-bound version of a jeep! People with the big, fiberglass hulled cabin cruisers would anchor their boats so they didn’t touch the shore.
Here’s a better look at one when we ran the boat up on shore at full throttle and got it completely dry:
ONLY do this in the spring when the lake is rising rapidly, the rest of the year you will be stuck.
We were disappointed in the lakeside wildflower display all week, wandering around Lake Canyon we found a few. Here’s sand penstemon:
I don’t know if it was the wind the next day, or the heavy Memorial Day traffic on the lake, but the ride from Lake Canyon to Bullfrog was the roughest of the whole trip. I swear the boat came out of the water on some of those waves! It was impossible to avoid them as the surface was a big, chaotic mess of whitecaps. We kept re-latching the gates on the railing around the boat until we figured out that the boat was flexing so much that the gates were simply pulling far enough away from the railing to let them swing free!
By the time we got fueled up and back to the rental marina we were actually glad to be leaving.
I will definitely be back, but for sure not in the peak season. I had a taste of the heat and the crowds of summer and want to avoid them on the next trip. I could easily see complimenting my 4 wheeled explorations with a Lake Powell trip every year. In one week we got a good look at maybe 5% of the lake so there is a lot more to see.

Great to see the highly cyclical FTSE 100, 250 and All Share indices have a strong up day for once on the vaccine news - indeed such a strong up day that they've broken out of five month downtrends. No doubt plenty of risks ahead, but the market signalled its intent today. Here's some basic TA for us all to consider.
The FTSE All Share has broken out of the downtrend, and above its 200 day Moving Average on high volume. This big up day is significant. It's rare to see 5% up days on major indices. Marty Zweig used to talk about strong 4% up days being a very strong buy indicator although it's declined in its predictability over the decades. Technical analysts would look for the formation of a higher low before confirming the change in trend, and ideally to see a rising 200d MA rather than a falling one. There is still work to do and there's still a mass of overhead supply.... but...

About three dozen environmental groups sent a petition to the US Department of the Interior on Wednesday, saying it has the authority to suspend and ultimately cancel the oil leases.
Calls for the administration of US President Joe Biden to cancel extraction in the area came less than a month after an underwater pipeline transporting oil from offshore platforms to the California coast leaked 94,635 litres of crude into the ocean.
California extracted about seven million barrels of oil from offshore sources in 2019, the latest year for which figures are available, according to US government data.
“Federal officials have the power and the duty to stop the oil industry from killing our birds, fouling our beaches and polluting our climate,” Emily Jeffers, a lawyer with the Center for Biological Diversity who wrote the petition, said in a statement on Wednesday. “The Biden administration needs to bring the hammer down on offshore drilling in California’s federal waters.”
The Department of the Interior declined to comment on the petition following a query from The Associated Press.
The Department is required to respond to the petition, Jeffers said. If it does not, she said the environmental groups could take legal action.
The spill, believed to have taken place sometime around October 1, fouled sensitive beaches and wetlands, forced the closure of fisheries, and harmed or killed dozens of fish and birds so far, the Center for Biological Diversity said. The full damage to wildlife is likely to take months to become apparent, it added.
Local officials and businesses in Huntington Beach, California, where crude from the spill washed ashore, also worry oil contamination will hurt tourism in a region known for its surfing.
When the spill happened in early October, Huntington Beach Mayor Kim Carr said some 34sq kilometres (13sq miles) of ocean and portions of the town’s coastline were “covered in oil”. The amount of oil spilled, however, turned out to be less than what was previously thought.
US investigators have said they believe a 366-metre (1,200-foot) cargo ship dragging anchor in rough seas caught the underwater pipeline operated by Houston-based Amplify Energy and pulled it across the seafloor early this year.
They have not determined whether impact with the Panama-registered MSC DANIT caused this spill or if the line was hit by something else or failed due to a preexisting problem.
Article source:The story so far: last Spring, Windows 10 Mobile users started noticing broken thumbnails and photos in Windows 10 Photos on the phone. Clearly something had changed at Microsoft's end in terms of the servers that Photos liases with. The images were still there, as could be proved by using the OneDrive application's Photos view, but something was clearly wrong.
Enter Sherlock Litchfield(!), I wrote this up in July 2018 and concluded that it was Microsoft's new server code not being able to cope with photos shot on the Lumia 1020, and on the Alcatel IDOL 4 Pro (and 4S). And, no doubt, other non-'standard'/supported devices. Do read my linked explanations for more.
A comment in a recent AAWP story claimed that all was working again and, indeed, after some testing here, all my recent 1020-shot and IDOL 4 Pro-shot photos appear to now be shown correctly in Windows 10 Photos:
One caveat is that there are still some thumbnails from Spring 2018 which are 'broken' and it seems that these got generated at Microsoft's end while the faulty server code was present and that these never got reindexed by the company. Will these ever be fixed? Somehow I doubt it. Still, it's fairly safe to 'go back into the water' now in terms of Photos. Data points welcome, but I haven't had a broken thumbnail now for nine months, so I'm drawing a line under the affair.
I don't think it was any of the regular Windows 10 Mobile OS updates (most recent one here) which fixed any of this, and we haven't had a Photos application update for a while - I'm pretty sure that Microsoft simply made their OneDrive and Photos-indexing code more robust on their servers.
Data points welcomed though. Sod's law says that five minutes after posting this story, someone will pop up with a 'It's still broken!' comment! 8-)The events of GTA 5 take place in a car, a race, a movie theater, a golf course, and, for the most part, in the garage of a family member.

Introduction
CIPLE (Certificado Inicial de Português Língua Estrangeira) is the name of the Portuguese Language Test. It is a mandatory test for foreign individuals who want to obtain Portuguese citizenship. The test is quite simple and It is sufficient to qualify as a minimum A2 level from the exam.
What does it mean to get an A2 level? The levels have three main branches. Each branch also divides into two. So, level A is for beginners, level B is for intermediate learners, and level C is for advanced learners. Their sub-branches are namely A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2.
So, the language test examines if you have a basic knowledge of Portuguese. That’s why you don’t have to worry about the difficulty of the exam. Still, some preparation before the exam won’t hurt.
Who Must Take The Exam
If you’re eligible to apply for Portuguese citizenship or for permanent residency in Portugal, you have to take the language test.
On the other hand, if you apply for a temporary residency or a Golden Visa in Portugal, you don’t need to take the language test.

- If you are married to a citizen of Portugal
- If you are eligible for Portuguese citizenship by naturalization

- If you are seriously ill or disabled
- If you are from a Portuguese speaking country
- If you have a certificate which declares that you have a Portuguese language level above A2

Reading & Writing
The duration of this section is 75 minutes. It makes up 45% of the exam.
So, what will you answer in the reading part? Well, you will read some texts such as a dialogue, a piece of news about someplace in the world, short stories, or a descriptive text. The reading questions will evaluate your comprehension of these texts.
The writing section expects you to write a short and simple text about yourself. Alternatively, it could be about something you feel or someone you know.
Listening
The listening section lasts 30 minutes. It makes up 30% of the exam. You will listen to some short audios such as a daily conversation or other simple sentences. After that, you will answer some questions about what you just heard.
Speaking
The speaking section lasts around 10-15 minutes, making up 25% of the exam. Usually, there are two applicants at once in this section. You are expected to use simple daily phrases when you speak the language.
Grading System
If you get a mark of at least 55%, you will pass the exam. The rest of the grading system is as follows:
- 0-54% : Fail
- 55-69% : Sufficient
- 70-84% : Good
- 85-100% : Very good

The integration of employees by means of various activities improves the productivity of the organization. That's a fact. That's because people who know each other better and know how they behave in different situations, not only at work, are simply more efficient. They have better relationships, know more about each other. Somehow they can count on each other in various situations which naturally occur also at work.
What concerns did you have?
It was definitely the biggest game I organized in terms of the number of participants. I have done it twice, in two different organizations and it were two completely different experiences. The first time I was really anxious - there were about 130 or 150 people. The game was played abroad, in Great Britain. Participants were from all continents. It wasn't a homogeneous team, but people were somehow interconnected.
There were many doubts. First of all the game was conducted entirely in English, functional teams were from different countries and continents. So yes, I did have concerns. But in the course of the game it turned out that these concerns were completely unfounded. At the beginning, things start to get moving slowly and then there is this super dynamic phase when everybody starts running, carrying cards and gathering information. Each table decides - sooner or later - on a strategy. Some leaders appear naturally. It's a complete chaos.
Why choose The Tree of Life?
I used to organize various meetings, let's say integration days involving some physical activities, sports. Undoubtedly they also help to learn something and are useful. But games were for me a discovery firstly because they provide team integration and secondly they address very precisely the areas that I personally perceive as very important for the organization. I was really impressed. The Tree of Life game is a combination of integration and different aspects and phases that each company goes through.
For me, the key elements that become apparent from The Tree of Life game are the employees' engagement and concentrating on the achievement of goals. Very quickly all the leadership skills and competences become apparent. People stick to their roles very quickly and demonstrate a high level of energy which can be easily transferred - later during the game debriefing- to real life at work, in the office and quite often everyday situations.
Is The Tree of Life suited to a company offsite?
Yes. We ran The Tree of Life for a company offsite. 110 people took part in the game. Everything was planned very precisely and the game was organized as a coherent element of the main offsite goal. At this moment we talked a lot about all the most crucial things for the company I had recently joined the company as a leader and we discussed such fundamental things as our goal, our values, our priorities and the vision we wish to accomplish.
The vision we then presented to all the staff - we shared it as a management team - was called Double Payback. The final task in the game was, after all the stages we went through, to double the score. The game went so fantastically well and was played with such energy that we finally managed to triple the score. It was wonderful as it made everyone believe that if the organization is focused on its goals and understands its priorities, it completes tasks very quickly, even under time pressure and is able not only to achieve the result which is a vision - because to double the business is a great vision but it can make even more and triple the initial score. It's a very high dose of self-confidence. If all the organization is focused on the same goal, we can accomplish everything.One Minute Reflection – 30 August – Thursday of the Twenty-first week in Ordinary Time, Year B – Today’s Gospel: Matthew 24:42–51
Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming...Matthew 24:42
REFLECTION – “We must sleep in such a way as to be easily awakened. For Scripture says, “Gird your loins and light your lamps and be like servants who await their master’s return from a wedding, ready to open immediately when he comes and knocks.” (Lk 12:35-36). For a sleeping man is of no more use than a dead man. Therefore we ought often to get up at night and bless God.
Blessed are those who watch for Him and so make themselves like the angels, whom we call “watchers”. A man asleep is worth nothing, no more than if he were dead. But whoever has the light keeps watch and “darkness does not overcome him” (Jn 1:5) neither sleep. Whoever has been illumined is therefore wakened to God and such a person is alive, “for what came to be in him was life.” (Jn 1:4) “Happy the man,” says Wisdom,”who obeys me and happy those who keep my ways, happy the man watching daily at my gates, waiting at my doorposts” (Pr 8:34)…St Clement of Alexandria (150-215) Father of the Church

Mortgage rates finally stopped their upward climb — at least temporarily.
According to the latest data from Freddie Mac, mortgage rates dropped over the last week, falling from 3.18% to 3.13% on 30-year, fixed-rate loans. It’s the first time in two months that rates have dropped.
“After moving up for seven consecutive weeks, mortgage rates have dropped due to the recent, modest decline of U.S. Treasury yields,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. “The drop in rates creates yet another opportunity for those who have not refinanced to take a look at the possibility.”
That’s good news for homeowners. Refinancing demand has been on the downslope lately as rates rose, and according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, refinancing applications are down 20% over this time last year.
“Refinance applications declined for the fifth straight week,” said Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice resident of economic and industry forecasting. “Overall, refinance demand has decreased, with volume over the past 10 weeks down by more than 30%.”
Today’s news will likely have the opposite effect — both on refinances and on purchase activity. As Khater puts it, the rates — along with other positive economic indicators — should “continue to bolster purchase demand.”
More purchase demand could be a problem, as stiff competition and low housing supply already plague the market.
According to real estate brokerage Redfin, nearly 60% of homes are under contract within two weeks of listing, and almost 61% of its buyers are met with bidding wars.
What’s worse? Prices are rising at steep rates — up 10.4% compared to last year. Considering about 40% of all homes nationwide sell for over their listing price, this could make it harder for many buyers to find a home they can afford.
“Battles between buyers are more intense than ever, with some houses receiving dozens of offers and selling at lightning speed for tens of thousands of dollars over their listing prices,” wrote Refin’s Lily Katz. “High-end single-family homes are the most likely to encounter competition.”

The Green Party’s Jenny Jones, a member of both the London Assembly and the Metropolitan Police Authority, commented today:
“It's hard to know what we can believe from police spy Kennedy's stories, but it's hard to believe that this was a value for money exercise. I doubt that a total of £200k has been spent on eco activities by protesters in the last 30 years.
“Worse, targeting peaceful protesters means less cash to pay for anti-terrorism, where murder and maiming is the aim, not blockading a power station or sitting in trees.”
Recently announced plans by the Ministry of Justice to extend Freedom of Information laws should open up the previously unaccountable Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) to public scrutiny and result in greater transparency. (2) Jenny welcomes this change, but in light of recent revelations suggests that the ACPO “should hand over its policing units to the Met immediately. The Met occasionally messes up, but at least it has independent scrutiny and a budget that is pored over for opportunities to save money.”
Media reports suggest that the Association of Chief Police Officers may have spent up to £15 million of tax revenue on infiltrating a peaceful protest movement.

Breakfast in Bangalore: ITC GardeniaMonday, July 23, 2012Me! In words
Who doesn't love a good breakfast? We definitely do and have been meaning to get to ITC Gardenia for breakfast for ages now. We have been through all of their restos so far and it just didn't seem right that we didn't do this as well. And so one Sunday morning, we landed at the reception of the Cubbon Pavilion, where breakfast is served.
The entire buffet has an underlying theme of promoting good health and makes use of a lot of healthy grains in the preparation. Once you settle down, I suggest you take a walk around the buffet and see everything that is on offer. I made the mistake of not doing it the first time we went there and ended up filling up much before I had a chance to get through a bigger portion of the buffet. Picto review here on...
Start with something drink first - both the times there were a few variations to what was on offer. Mango Smoothie, Berry smoothie, Salted Lassi instead of sweet, plain yogurt in matkas, grape juice and
oatmeal with fruits.
oatmeal with fruits.
Opposite this is where you can make a start - roasted herbed potatoes, roasted tomatoes, croissants in multigrain, ham, bacon and sausages (generally a mix)
Going forward, fruit lovers will love the spread of poached fruits to start with - kiwi, muskmelon, figs, lychees. It then goes on to a range of other fruits like figs, guavas, lychee, watermelon, papaya
This is a corner that's pretty easy to miss, but it does have some nice goodies on it like chocolate and cappacino muffins, walnut danishes, chocolate donuts, linseed bread rolls and more. The second time we came I picked up a custard filled donut-like treat - the name is at the tip of my tongue but I can't get it. It was really yummy, smooth custard, not overly sweet and the sugar dusted top made it perfect.
And now is when the actual buffet begins. Nothing to beat the typical south Indian breakfast to start with and so you have your idlis, vadas and sambar and coconut chutney beginning things. There is also pongal for those who love it. Dosas for the day are made to order at the counter in the center as well as specialty eggs and those made any which way you like.
If you would rather go the cereals way, then there are quite a few to choose from, along with a range of dried fruits. You have everything from museli to Honey Loops to Chocos. There are also a variety of milks - soy, skimmed, full cream etc to choose from.
Sprouts and dressings - Alfalfa sprouts, Green peas, Iceberg lettuce the first time we went there - the dressings to choose from were the likes of raspberry vinaigrette, mustard dressing and a balsamic dressing. To further spice up the salad were various compotes of dry fruits. Personally loved the raspberry vinaigrette with alfalfa sprouts and lettuce.
The concept of good health is carried across cuisines and there was a Japanese addition to the spread as well - miso soup, Hiya Yakko, Nanbakzuke and more items that I could not pronounce. Was rather stuffed at this point so gave this a skip. The second time round those, there was an Arabic platter with pita bread served with tzatziki, hummus, pea hummus, falafel, muttabel and more. All of these were brilliant.
A very cute thing is the guy who wheels around this cart with fresh croissants straight from the oven and to your table. Make sure you pick one just to sample it... its flaky and with a slathering of butter reallyhits the spot.
This is the central cooking up station where eggs and dosas are whipped up. For the eggs, there are two exotic versions that you can choose from and the same with the dosas as well. You can just order them and they will be brought to your table along with a side of bread or chutnies as applicable. Also, the second time we went there we were told that a range of stuffed parathas and puris too can be ordered. Fresh fruit juices in a couple of varieties too can be had. Below are a couple of plates of what we had.
Classic poached egg on muffin with bacon, roasted tomatoes and bread. Oh yes! the range of breads on offer are plenty and you can end up spending a few minutes there on choosing what you want.
Scrambled eggs with tuna and a kind of cheese with grilled potatoes and tomatoes on the side.
Pita bread with Mutabbal, Pea Hummus, poached fruits and a fig shake.
This buffet is priced at Rs 750 a head plus taxes. Anoushka so far has not been charged even though we were told that children were charged nominally. Reservations are not needed as walk-ins are taken. For us personally, this is definitely worth a twice a month visit. The buffet is on from 7AM in the morning to around 10.30AM. Two visits now and there has been a variety to look forward to in each of the sections of the buffet. Its ITC, so service is brilliant as is the ambiance.

This isn’t the first study to make the link between the existence of morning sickness and miscarriage. But it is the first one that initiated the research even before the women became pregnant. This is important, says Stefanie Hinkle, lead author of the study and a staff scientist at the NIH, “because it allowed us to get detailed data from diaries that women were keeping about their symptoms in the earliest weeks of pregnancy — even before most women knew they were pregnant.”
Of the almost 800 women in this study who became pregnant, 188 — about 23 percent — suffered a pregnancy loss. (This jives with research indicating that around 15 to 20 percent of *known* pregnancies end in miscarriage, with additional miscarriages occurring very early on, before a woman knows she is pregnant.) The women were given diaries to record any nausea and/or vomiting (or lack of) symptoms, starting from preconception up through the first eight weeks of pregnancy. What the study found was that one out of every five women in the study felt some level of nausea only two weeks into pregnancy.
By the eighth week, the number of women who reported either nausea alone or with vomiting skyrocketed to 84 percent.
When researchers took this information and performed a statistical analysis, they found what represents the most definitive data so far on the association between pregnancy loss and morning sickness, according to the blog of the NIH:
For the women who experienced nausea only, they were 50 percent less likely to suffer a pregnancy loss on average. Nausea with vomiting in any given week came with a 75 percent reduction in miscarriage risk.
Those are significant numbers. But, says Hinkle, they should not be taken by women as a message that if they don’t experience nausea and/or vomiting during pregnancy, there’s something wrong: “Every pregnancy is different and just because they don’t have symptoms doesn’t mean they’re going to have a pregnancy loss.”
Morning sickness has racked up its share of research, but there is little clarity on what causes it or why it exists. There have been scientific claims that morning sickness may signal a “more intelligent child” or that it exists to protect the fetus from harmful toxins in meat and vegetables by signaling the mother not to eat certain things.
What we do know is that morning sickness has been linked to higher hormone levels in pregnancy, specifically the existence of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin). We also know that there is a difference between morning sickness and the severe hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), an extreme form of nausea and vomiting, which can cause excessive dehydration and crippling weakness.
This research specifically focused on women with morning sickness, not HG, which in some ways limited the research. And as this article in The Atlantic points out, “The vast majority of participants were married, highly educated, white women — so the extent to which the findings would apply to women in other demographics is unclear.”
If you are a woman who is pregnant, wants to get pregnant or has suffered pregnancy loss, it’s difficult sometimes to discern what information to pay attention to and what to let slide by. But in the midst of all of the noise, this study offers the strongest evidence to date that feeling nauseous, even extremely early on in a pregnancy, may be something to celebrate.

To me, the very notion of philosophy being popular among select groups seems kind of ironic, as the greatest philosophers of the West, many of the thinkers these subcultures idolize, would criticize these groups for their seemingly superficial treatment of the theories and ideas which they spent decades refining and meticulously wording to best fit their moral and metaphysical perspectives. From Socrates to Nietzsche with many thinkers in between, philosophy has been thought of as somewhat of an elitist practice. To Socrates in particular, it was what made the few distinct from the many. It was not so much the knowledge or understanding of some philosophic theories, but the understanding of the method of philosophy and its fundamentally abstract and deeply personal nature. To be a philosopher is somewhat trivial compared to how one philosophizes, and so the engaging of philosophy was only the entry to a uniquely human art. Despite all of the “what would X philosopher have to say about Y modern phenomenon” videos I have, with great interest and pleasure I will admit, indulged in on the internet, I have yet to see a person in our society come to the realization which was explained in a video deciphering only a single paragraph of Friedrich Nietzsche’s Beyond Good and Evil, namely, that all theories and -isms given by philosophers throughout the ages are but autobiographical perspectives of random intellectuals who had little but their own reasons for rather egotistically proclaiming their own interpretation of existence to the rest of the world. Philosophy is an art-form, and like all art, it is the projection of one subjective experience through abstraction to a form of information translatable to another subject, or consciousness, for interpretation, typically in a manner that provokes strong feelings or desire for conceptual understanding.
I do not mean to cast a negative light on the engagement of philosophy and philosophic theories by any person in the past, present, or future, but I do mean to say that so long as one engages in philosophy, which I would argue all humans do to a degree but the members of these subcultures claim to be personally invested in the development and propagation of as well, one ought to understand that the practice is more accurately asking socially relevant and provocative questions rather than discovering meaningful or supposedly accurate answers. Philosophy is not even primarily a serious practice, but a supplemental one like spending a few minutes daily exercising. It can be seen as serious if one attaches all one’s value to whether or not one’s arbitrary values and standards are fulfilled, but if there is anything to be learned from philosophy, it is that these values are in fact arbitrary. Though there are many ways to be wrong, there is no absolutely right philosophy, no absolutely right way to think, and no absolutely right frame of mind. And above all else, one should not seek to gain some measure of the greatest good if one cannot even explain what serves this good or what this good entails.
A professor once told me that the only difference between science and philosophy is that questions in science have facts for answers, whereas philosophic questions don’t necessarily have answers at all. To think that a philosophy can be learned and utilized like a tool is to neglect the very nature of conceptual framing and thinking. One cannot apply any philosophy absolutely, for there are always the criticisms and admonitions of other philosophies that in many cases conflict with, if not outright contradict, the supposed truths of the former philosophy. Learning how to philosophize is like learning how to walk. It serves no explicit purpose other than the utilization of the skills it develops, which in the case of philosophy are usually aimed at defining or eliminating information as either adequately clarifying for all intents and purposes or as simply confusing and nonsensical, respectively. Learning to walk does not help one to go anywhere in particular, but rather to go at all instead of never moving.
To express how I feel about what I’ve seen in regards to philosophy, particularly on platforms like YouTube, I will say the following. I am disappointed in the lack of personal philosophizing happening in the public space. There are too few people presenting their own theories and ideas, outside of an academic or institutional context, about people and existence compared to the number of people content to stay within the realm of what theories and perspectives other thinkers have already presented. In the same vein that there are too few people striving to advance new ideas and perspectives in the sciences instead of spending their effort simply revalidating older theories or conceptually “playing” with invalid models, such as what theorists and scholars such as the Weinstein brothers have complained about being somewhat rampant in institutional settings, there are too few “amateur” philosophers challenging the institutions to do something and produce something of instrumental value to people. There are too few people making their own theories instead of only focusing on the popular thinker or theory of the season. We need not strive to make more subjectively phrased -isms to throw into the conceptual mix of information we are trying to interpret, but, in my opinion, not enough of what’s being said about philosophy has any deeply personal, contemporary origin in philosophizing itself. Nietzsche’s, Dostoevsky’s, Lao Tau’s, and a great many others’ philosophies will always be personally relevant in the manner that art transcends the time frame of the culture from which it was birthed, but if we are to validate our own existence and by extension the societies we uphold, something about our values needs to be said and lived in our own being. A new philosophy must be made, not for something to believe in, but for the sake of avoiding relegating our critical thinkers to obscure corners of society hidden behind unmarketable characteristics where their ideas will barely crack the public’s threshold for attention, until maybe after their death once they are no longer available to revise and refine their mind’s conceptual representation. If our philosophies are existential, psychological records of our experiences, we must make our mark in history for the sake of there being any mark at all.
That being said, I am actually excited for the increased interest in philosophy and intellectual contemplation and reflection. If there is any advice for the practice of philosophy that I would have for others, it would be to admit that what you know is known only as knowing how to conceptualize it or embody it, to know that these two modes of knowing are not equatable or mutually exchangeable, and to remember that in practicing philosophy you would be arranging the self-expressive, subjectively formulated ideas of many thinkers, including yourself, into a network of information that is like an abstract representation of existence built across humanity’s history by many different thinkers with greatly different perspectives. Also, know that no one is better or more valuable morally for being wiser or more intellectual. While some may be able to map entire psychological frameworks, including epistemological and metaphysical distinctions, into conceptual theories, there are many ways with which an individual can demonstrate knowledge and understanding of existence, and showcase their respective intelligence. And always remember that an argument is at least two claims with one, the conclusion, being supported by the other(s).117m2 · 3 bedrooms · 2 bathroom

After graduating from Oxford University with a degree in law, Roz spent the first eleven years of her career working as a management consultant, braving nothing more intrepid than rush hour on the London Underground, before an environmental epiphany led to a radical personal transformation into a world class adventurer.
During the seven years of her ocean rowing career, Roz Savage had more chance than most to explore the far horizons of courage. Spending up to five months alone at sea on a 23-foot rowboat, thousands of miles from land and humanity, at the mercy of winds, waves and currents, she evolved from a nervous novice adventurer into the world's foremost female ocean rower.
While crossing a total of fifteen thousand miles of ocean she had to redefine her comfort zone on a daily basis, and reach deep into her inner sources of strength, self-discipline, and commitment to her goal. She discovered the vital importance of keeping a cool head in life-endangering situations, to optimise her capacity for smart decision-making, accurate risk assessment and creative problem-solving..

None of the schools will open in their permanent accommodation. Educate Together said in a statement that this is not ideal for any developing school.
It said that it has communicated its concerns to the Department of Education and Skills regarding the planning and provision of both temporary and permanent accommodation for new schools many times.
It added that it hopes that opening new schools in permanent accommodation will become the norm in the future.
This is the second-highest number of new schools that Educate Together has opened in a single year and the educational charity now has 84 primary and 13 second-level schools around the country.
The multi-denominational school body says its growth reflects a growing demand for “equality-based” education.
“Our heartfelt congratulations to all the campaign groups who supported these new schools. We are sure these new educational facilities will greatly enhance the options available to families for many years to come,” Paul Rowe, CEO of Educate Together, said in a statement. plans to apply for thirteen new national schools, which would open next year, and it has already applied to open an additional four second-level schools in 2019.

To understand the difference there’s some things we have to understand about Marx.
First, Marx was not a Marxist, he never applied socialism or communism, he was a philosopher, a researcher, a visionary, an academic and an idealist. Therefore, those who take his ideas must understand that they were not the product of trail and error, or application, but they were rooted in ideas and philosophy.
Marx had the opportunity to study and directly observe capitalism, industrialization, mercantilism, and class differentiation, it’s what he was born into and lived in his entire life, so he had real world experiences and examples of all that and his study, analysis, and projections for capitalism are spot on; even today they stand.
As for what came after capitalism Marx could only speculate, predict, and proposes structures and systems; Marx predicted, accurately the fall of capitalism, and the ongoing crisis and conflicts of capitalism, and he speculated and advocated for Communism, Socialism, and the eventual dissolution of the State and it’s structures.
Marx was right about most the past and present, but he was off in many respects about the future; that’s where Scientific Socialism comes in, it’s not based on idealism, philosophy, and visions; it’s rooted in ecology and fundamental statecraft. It’s a economic system not established to generate profit, or extract wealth from the lands or people’s labor, it’s an economic system structured to meet the needs of citizens and the ecosystems. All economic activity and distribution is tied to and regulated by scientific analysis and research, not ideals, like Capitalism and Communism. Production and manufacturing is not driven by profit, but by need.
Scientific Socialism is not Marxist, it’s informed by Dialectic and Historical Materialism but not exclusively; it’s also rooted in African economic history and practices, Africans were not only the first Socialist, they founded the first markets and economies on the planet; Africans founded long standing and ecological economies.
What separate SS from Marxism and Communism is that it’s not simply an ideology, or vision, it’s rooted in historical economic practices and protocols that are alien to Europe and Europeans in general.

Look at the return policy. Many discount retailers will give you a credit refund that’s contingent on the condition of the gear. Make sure to read all the ﬁne print, and be aware that most returns will not ship for free.
If you are tempted by a brand name that’s not familiar to you, do some digging. Discount stores often have oﬀ-brand names. There’s nothing wrong with that, of course, but read reviews and check other sources to make sure you are getting a quality product.
Since you are buying online, remember you won’t be able to try on the product before purchasing it. If possible, become familiar with the ﬁt of different brands of clothing by trying them on in a store or reading measurement charts before adding the items to your cart.
Used gear websites are great, but be aware that you won’t be able to return or get a refund on items purchased through these sites.
Before you buy, ask yourself, “Do I really need this?” Don’t let a screaming deal make you buy something you wouldn’t otherwise.
Happy bargain shopping!

- funded the Child Welfare Privatization Initiatives Project to provide information to state and local child welfare administrators who are considering or implementing privatization reforms. The project will produce six technical assistance papers on a range of topics providing insights about factors that should be considered when approaching or improving upon, privatization efforts.
The purpose of this first paper is to help child welfare administrators think through key issues about transitioning to a privatized system of service delivery. The paper is organized around 12 overarching questions that administrators need to ask themselves when assessing the readiness of their site. Some questions encourage sites to explore specifically why they are privatizing services and whether or not privatization is the best approach to meeting agency goals. The remaining five papers in this series will examine other specific areas. These are:
- Models of Privatization Reform
- Evolving Roles of Public and Private Agencies
- Developing Effective Contracts
- Contract Monitoring and Accountability
- Evaluating Privatization Initiatives
This paper series builds on research, described below, conducted under the Quality Improvement Center on the Privatization of Child Welfare Services (QIC PCW), funded in 2005 by the Children's Bureau, US Department of Health and Human Services. It also draws from the research on privatization in other, closely related social services. Information used for this paper series comes from several sources, including:
- Telephone discussions with state child welfare administrators from 44 states and the District of Columbia;
- Regional forums with public and private agency staff and community stakeholders from twelve states that have privatized at least one component of the child welfare system;
- Literature reviews; and
- Follow-up interviews and correspondence with public and private agency providers and key stakeholders from several states.
From this work we have learned that many states and communities have strong privatization initiatives that continue to move forward. However, some communities have tested privatization and have pulled back from these efforts, largely due to poor performance on expected outcomes. Several existing initiatives have been significantly retooled based on lessons learned and unanticipated consequences of the privatized system.
Privatizing services is complicated and is often politicized. The purpose of this first paper is to inform public and private agency partners as well as legislators as they make decisions about privatizing service. It is designed to encourage agency administrators and legislators to ask critical questions and make important choices prior to the decision to transition services to the private sector.
This paper will begin by discussing the concepts of privatization and some of its core components. It will then present a series of questions and considerations that must be worked through in preparation for systems reform.
Privatization in Child Welfare Services
Although widely used, the term privatization has no single definition in child welfare or in other human services. Some use the term broadly and mean by it all contracted service arrangements, others use it more narrowly.
Research indicates that while all states contract out for some form of direct child welfare services, most restrict the decision making authority ceded to providers. In most cases, the state has retained authority for approving contractors decisions related to reducing a childs level of care and permanency decisions (GAO, 2000; U.S. DHHS., 2001; Westat & Chapin Hall, 2002; McCullough, 2003). Two research efforts conducted in the last five years (Westat & Chapin Hall, 2002; Collins-Camargo, Ensign & Flaherty, in press) have identified only a limited number of state and local initiatives where for certain client groups, primary case management authority has been shifted to private provider(s).(1) this definition is the concept that this type of privatization enhances the need for partnership between the public and private sectors. Recognizing that this will always be a contractual relationship, privatization, due to its expanded reliance on the private sector, creates an opportunity and a fundamental challenge to each partner in the delivery of services and achievement of outcomes. In essence, the more responsibility the public agency gives to private providers, the more dependent they are on their performance. Partnership, accountability and trust become key features of the new system. This is sometimes overlooked in the controversy that surrounds the term.
Another key concept is that privatization is not a service model but rather a systemic reform that involves several design elements (contracting method, cost claiming and reimbursement, service delivery system, contract monitoring, etc.) all of which must be designed and aligned in order to operate efficiently and effectively. Further, many of these elements require ongoing refinements.
The roles and responsibilities of workers in both government and provider agencies are among the issues that will need to be continuously refined. This is because even under a fully privatized system, the public agency will continue to play several important roles including contract procurement, monitoring, program funding and policy agenda setting. Ultimately, it is the public agency that is responsible for the care and safety of the children in state custody. For all of these reasons, what is being explored today by states and communities across the country is the relative balance that public and private agencies play in the delivery of child welfare services, and their respective roles when realignment does occur.
Finally, lessons learned from our research about privatization initiatives in child welfare are anecdotal. In fact, there is very little research that rigorously compares publicly and privately delivered services systems on client-level child welfare outcomes. There has also been very little rigorous research to confirm that one privatization model, contracting method or management model outperforms another (McCullough, 2005; Lee, Allen and Metz, 2006). In short, the information contained in this technical assistance series should serve as a starting point for a sites own research and assessment of its individual readiness to privatize a service, or a service system.
Key Considerations
1) Why privatize services?
It is sometimes overlooked that child welfare services began in the private sector (Embry, Buddenhagen & Bolles, 2000). It was not until the 20th century that a federal social security system, including a child welfare component emerged (Kahn and Kamerman, 1999). While the overall proportion of services delivered by mutual aid and religious charities has ebbed and flowed over time, several events during the 1990s generated a renewed interest in broad scale contracting efforts (increasingly labeled privatization). States experienced escalating costs for out-of-home care driven by increases in both the numbers served and the unit costs of care. In 1997, the federal government passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA), and then, implemented Federal Child and Family Service Reviews (CFSRs). Together, these require states to achieve improved performance on child and family outcomes including child safety, timely permanence and well-being.
Why Privatize: To improve performance and reduce costs, several states and communities have experimented with privatization on a pilot basis and two states, Kansas and Florida chose to implement statewide reforms. Increasingly, a number of strategies including privatization, the application of managed care principles and most recently, the use of performance based contracts, are viewed as means of fusing programmatic and fiscal reforms (Wulczyn & Orlebeke, 1998; Embry, Buddenhagen & Bolles, 2000; McCullough, 2003).
The literature discusses several reasons that states have privatized social services including: the potential for higher quality, cheaper services by means of increased competition; greater flexibility within private organizations; a greater sense of mission and responsiveness to client needs among nonprofits (Sanger, 2001); and greater client choice. There are also a range of practical and political considerations that prompt privatization, including the ability to bring in new capacity quickly while at the same time limiting government growth; facilitating a marked change in the program culture or philosophy; and bringing in new types of providers, such as small community based organizations or faith based organizations (Winston et al, 2002).
This said, the field is beginning to report back that privatization alone will not solve some basic problems that plague the child welfare system and it may not reduce costs. States that have privatized services struggle with the same issues that public agencies do including obtaining adequate community services for families and recruiting and retaining qualified staff (Center for Public Policy Priorities, 2005). Private agency workers experience the same frustrations that public agency workers experience such as high stress, lack of career advancement opportunities and lack of educational preparation for child welfare work (Gleeson, Smith and Dubois, 1993). Early results indicate that simply transferring case management and decision making to the private sector may not improve case outcomes without adequate social, health and mental health resources and foster and adoptive homes in communities, and qualified agency staff that are offered ample supports.
Assessing Systemic Challenges: In light of these systemic challenges, some of the first questions that site officials must consider when assessing site readiness are:
- Does the community have sufficient resources and services for children and families to address their needs and achieve the outcomes of safety, permanency and well-being? If not, how can a privatized system address this? What resources will a private provider need to create additional community supports and/or create that capacity inhouse?
- Have additional funding streams been explored for new contracts (e.g. Medicaid and TANF) to provide additional services?
- Does the community have sufficient numbers of foster and adoptive homes? If not, what resources will providers need to conduct additional outreach and support services to meet these needs?
- If staff recruitment and retention are challenges, what resources and management skills will private agencies need to hire, train, and support staff to help minimize ongoing turnover?
Privatization and Costs: Another important question to ask when initially considering privatization: is the assumption being made that a privatized system will cost less? Research on privatization efforts have found that in most cases, overall spending increases with privatization efforts (Freundlich & Gerstenzang, 2003; Kahn & Kamerman, 1999; GAO, 2000). As an example, the budget for child welfare service in Milwaukee, Wisconsin grew significantly with privatization.(2) Freundlich & Gerstenzang (2003) point out that it is probably unreasonable to expect new privatization initiatives to achieve better outcomes for children and families and do so at a lower cost than the current system.
While there have been only limited examples of states and communities that have saved or even controlled costs (McCullough & Schmitt, 2003), Illinois significantly reduced costs by converting their standard foster care contracts from cost reimbursement to performance based along with other concurrent reforms. Illinois attributes the reduction in the states foster care caseload from 52,000 in 1997 to approximately 18,000 today to the use of performance-based contracts (McEwen, 2006). One of the key lessons that the state learned was the value of reinvesting some of these funds back into the system to support reduced worker caseloads, recruiting foster homes, and providing more clinical services.
In summary, sites must ask themselves: why they want to privatize a service or a service system what they want this new system to achieve and why they expect private agencies to outperform the existing public system. They need to ask whether transferring case management will address these issues or whether other supports will be necessary.
The answers to these questions will impact contract design and monitoring and may also impact the roles and responsibilities of workers in the ongoing oversight of cases.(3) Clearly articulating the why is also the only way for states to know how they will define success once projects are implemented and should guide continuous quality improvement efforts (McCullough, 2005).
2) What is the level of stakeholder support for privatization? How do you gain buy-in?
Privatization can engender opposition from a range of stakeholders because it upsets the status quo service arrangements. There are multiple ways to mitigate this opposition and it is likely that several approaches may be needed to gain support. Due to the anxiety that privatization can cause, a first step for public agencies is to create a communications plan for both internal and external stakeholders to minimize the amount of misinformation (McCullough, 2005).
The literature on child welfare privatization emphasizes the value of listening to stakeholders that will participate in, or be impacted by, the new service delivery system (Kahn & Kamerman, 1999; McCullough & Schmitt, 2003; Figgs & Ashlock, 2001). States and communities that have privatized services report that it is important to include a broad group of community stakeholders somewhat early in the conceptualization and planning process, to not only get their input but to bring them along in planning and avoid costly oversights once new contracts are initiated.
Two studies of the Kansas experience with privatization (James Bell Associates, 2001; Figgs & Ashlock, 2001) underscore this issue. Many key stakeholders were not meaningfully involved in planning and design efforts early on. Because of this, faulty implementation decisions were made. Moreover, several external stakeholders including the courts were unclear about the distinct roles and responsibilities of the public and private agencies. Figgs and Ashlock (2001) found that without this initial buy-in and involvement, the courts, schools, and other local agencies did not trust that the private providers would deliver adequate services. Well into implementation, the private agencies had to conduct aggressive public relations campaigns to acquire the trust of other public entities and community based providers on which they relied.
There are also examples of sites that report successfully including stakeholders in planning endeavors. During regional forums held by the Quality Improvement Center on the Privatization of Child Welfare Services, representatives from El Paso County, Colorado described what they considered to be an inclusive planning process. The County had a history with privatizing other services and had a clear vision that they wanted to partner with private agencies to deliver child welfare services (rather than simply transfer case management) and wanted to better blend funding streams (Medicaid and IV-E) to expand services for families involved with the child welfare system. Forum participants from both public and private agencies explained that both elected officials and agency staff were interested in making this new system work and work well. This involved collaboration during initial planning as well as an emphasis on ongoing communication between systems once the new contracts were issued.
El Paso County, Colorado spent approximately eight months planning the new service delivery system before anything was implemented. County staff met with the provider community as well as foster parents, partnering Child Placement Agencies, Juvenile Court, Guardians Ad Litem, Court Appointed Special Advocates, Respondent Attorneys, local Community Mental Health Center, County Commissioners, and the State Department of Human Services to develop the new service delivery structure. It was reported that as planning went on, county officials kept adding stakeholders to the planning meetings to ensure broad community and stakeholder support for this new approach in serving foster children in El Paso County (Flaherty, 2006).(4)
The broader literature suggests that during the planning phase, program planners might hold focus groups and/or conduct surveys with representatives from key stakeholder groups in and outside of the child welfare system. To varying degrees, those encouraged to participate in initial discussions include:
- The service provider community that would be affected and would be involved in bidding and ultimately delivering target services;(5)
- Representatives of all levels of the public agency (caseworkers, supervisors, managers and top administration);
- Juvenile and family court judges;
- Parents and youth who receive services
- Foster and adoptive parents (or associations);
- Monitors of court negotiated agreements;
- Unions of employee organizations and/or their professional organizations;
- Members of the state legislature and legislative committees;
- County commissioners;
- Auditors; and
- The broader service community e.g. mental health and substance abuse providers.
Explore what they consider to be challenges and constraints in the current system to ensure that you address these obstacles to the best of your ability in the newly privatized system. Explore peoples recommendations for a new system and their concerns about shifting case management to the private sector. Discussions with the provider community should include identifying appropriate and attainable client and systems outcomes, along with benchmarks and quality assurance systems to monitor success. Only in this way can leaders in both the private and public systems design contracts and systems that are responsive to the realities on the ground.
Whether or not private providers and other key players participated in the initial conceptualization of contract requirements, once contracts are drafted, consider hosting informational meetings with potential bidders to get their comments and ideas about the proposed scope of work. Receiving this form of input on contracts before they go out for official bidding can help reduce confusion and minimize implementation barriers.
Public Agencies and Unions: The experiences of states and communities that have privatized tells us that the greatest opposition will likely come from public agency workers and their unions. Agency officials must expect that merely conducting a readiness assessment will produce anxiety and resentment among agency staff and negatively impact morale.
This can be moderated by reaching out to agency workers and their unions early in the process in order to understand and address their concerns. Several states have engaged in workforce transitions that bring public employees that might be displaced, into the privatization planning process, and offer them training and other benefits. A 1997 GAO report on the experience of six state and community governments that had privatized services found that all select sites had provided safety nets for displaced workers. Workers were offered early retirement, severance pay, buy-outs and, in some cases, the opportunity to compete with private providers for the contract work. In some cases, workers were offered career planning and training to move into the private sector (GAO 1997b). Some sites required contractors to give public agency staff preferential consideration in hiring practices.
Dependency Courts: Much has been written about the particular importance of engaging the courts in the planning for privatization efforts (McCullough 2005, Snell, 2000). The courts play a critical role in the child welfare system and can support or hinder implementation activities (Meezan and McBeath 2003). The role of the courts is unique. Ultimately, all decisions influencing the achievement of key outcomes (case plan approval, key decisions on placement and permanency, case opening and closing) must be approved by the courts. Therefore, their impact on the success of privatization initiatives is amplified.(6) Politically, judges can play prominent roles in community affairs. Therefore, it is advisable to consult with them early and often when undertaking systemic reform of the service delivery system.
Court personnel should be involved in planning activities also because there are a range of practical questions that must be addressed about the new system. These include whether public or private agency staff are best equipped to represent cases in court and to what extent this role is shared between systems (McCullough, 2005). Private agencies must be clear about the informational needs of the courts and how court work will impact their staffing and training plans. (There are also a range of liability issues for private agencies that assume case management and court work, discussed later in this paper.)
Community Service Providers: Another important constituency is the broader group of community service providers on whom the private agency will depend, in order to meet client service needs. These providers need to be invited to the table and brought along in program planning or they may be less likely to collaborate in the new system.
Research in Kansas provides another cautionary tale. Due partly to limited initial community involvement in planning, in Kansas, private foster care providers had tremendous difficulty coordinating and paying for community services especially community mental health, in the early years of privatization (James Bell Associates, 2000). The providers were unable to leverage payment for specialized assessments and services ordered by the courts but seen as unnecessary by the community providers and therefore screened out for reimbursement.
Even in cases when collaboration begins early, public agencies must be prepared to provide ongoing support to initiatives to help coordinate and link providers if contracts demand that private agencies access these services. One example is Florida. Like Kansas, some jurisdictions in Florida have struggled with ensuring children involved with the privatized system are able to access quality mental health services. In February, 2007 Florida implemented a child welfare prepaid mental health plan to try to ensure better access to, and improved quality of mental health services. Over 20,000 Medicaid eligible children in the child welfare system are currently enrolled in the Child Welfare Prepaid Mental Health Plan (CWPMHP).
Although this is a statewide plan, each lead agency (which oversees child welfare services in a given region) along with the families, caregivers and treatment providers has control of the review for appropriateness of services. The state health care organization authorizes certain services but the local community determines what level of care to request. Each lead agency has assigned staff to manage the CWPMHP at the local level. These staff are known as the Points of Contact (POCs). The Florida Coalition for Children, a statewide organization of lead agencies and child welfare providers, also has staff positions to provide the technical support to the Points of Contact and monitoring of performance. There are weekly calls and quarterly statewide meetings to keep this new project on track. CWPMHP is beginning to collect data which will be shared through various communication mechanisms (Florida Coalition, June 2007).(7)
3) Has the public agency set aside enough time for planning and designing the initiative?
Decisions to privatize services are often mandated by governors and state legislatures. Privatization is sometimes implemented in a context of class action lawsuits or responses to negative publicity from child deaths or other examples of severe abuse. In short, privatization is frequently politicized and controversial. This was the case in Kansas, Florida, and Wisconsin and most recently in Texas.(8) These pressures can lead to reduced time and insufficient attention to project planning.
Research on existing privatization efforts indicate that many states and communities were under a great deal of pressure to plan and release request for proposals (RFPs) within a compressed timeframe and did not have sufficient time to prepare (Kahn & Kamerman, 1999; Mahoney, 2000; U.S. DHHS, n.d.). Failing to adequately plan services and contracting mechanisms, and adequately support private agency infrastructure needs, puts private providers at financial risk, and reduces the likelihood that public agencies will get the quality of work that they had expected.
As will be discussed in this and/or following papers, there is much to think through before launching privatization initiatives. Some key elements include:
- Program goals, desired outcomes and performance indicators;
- The service needs and service utilization patterns of the target population, based on accurate baseline data;
- Contract risk arrangements, case rates or other contracting mechanisms based on reliable actuarial data;
- Strategies to monitor contracts and hold agencies accountable;
- Roles and responsibilities of public and private agency case managers and administrators (and how the public system will prepare its staff for new roles of contract management versus traditional case work);
- Private agency qualifications (e.g. credentialing) and readiness (e.g. do agency staff have sufficient clinical expertise in working with families and communities);
- Agency grievance and appeal processes;
- How the new service providers will interface with other community services and insure service access for families;
- Rollout schedule of reforms. Should they be:
- Piloted geographically or rolled out in full?
- Phased in programmatically or all at once? For instance, when implementing performance based contracts, should providers be held harmless for a transitional period to assess the extent to which performance measures are realistic and/or to determine the training and support needs of new agencies before penalizing them financially (OBrien, 2005);
- How cases will be transferred to the private agency (how families will be notified, how case records will be copied and transferred, etc.).
These topics are complex and decisions should be based on careful attention and research. In 2006, the Quality Improvement Center on the Privatization of Child Welfare Services held three regional forums with twelve states and/or communities that had privatized at least one component of their child welfare system.(9) Based on their experience, participants (including public and private agency administrators as well as community stakeholders) were asked how much time should be set aside for sites to assess and plan for a privatized system. The general consensus was that sites should allot 12-18 months to prepare to transition services (Flaherty, Collins-Camargo & Lee, unpublished).
Finally, systems reforms takes time to fully implement and it may take longer than planned to see improved outcomes for children and families. There is the possibility that new projects will not show improved outcomes within the first year, or longer. Due to the resources required to transition services (both human and financial), prior to implementation, it may be helpful to have discussions about how the new public/private partners will respond if there are no differences in outcomes, and possibly higher costs, in the first year or two of operations.
4) Are there sufficient administrative and cost data to develop contracts and estimate case rates and other service costs?
As sites consider privatizing services, they must do so with sufficient and accurate information about costs, caseload trends, service utilization and performance on child welfare outcomes in the current system. Accurate data is critical to establishing sufficient case rates for private providers, appropriate performance benchmarks and performance indicators.
When Kansas privatized, the state faced challenges resulting from unreliable administrative data on caseload trends, characteristics and costs. As a result, officials were unable to establish a baseline for the pricing of foster care. In transferring the existing state caseload to the private sector, Kansas mislabeled much of the states existing foster care population as new referrals rather than identifying them as older, more deeply entrenched cases which would likely require more intensive services and a longer duration of service delivery (James Bell Associates, 2001; Snell, 2000; Westat & Chapin Hall, 2002).
The National Child Welfare Resource Center for Organizational Improvement (NRCOI) writes that data used to develop contracts must be seen as reliable and valid by both agencies and providers. It is critical to talk about this issue at the very beginning of negotiations with providers, to understand that it will be difficult, and to expect to invest significant resources (of both time and money) into developing good data to guide negotiations on assessing current performance and planning for improvements (OBrien, p. 1 2005).
State officials in Illinois describe their success in this area and its impact on gaining buy-in from the provider community when it was negotiating new foster care contracts in the mid 1990s. When Illinois changed its contracts from fee-for-child payment to performance based, private providers were concerned about the data by which performance would be measured as this information would drive the new payment system. Providers wanted to be confident that the data would be accurate and reliable. In response, the state contracted with the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago to administer the management information system used to guide decisions about performance and payments to private agencies. Erwin (Mac) McEwen, Director of Illinois Department of Children and Families wrote at the time, this was critical because Unless private providers believed in these policies and the practices for implementing them, it would be impossible for policies to succeed (McEwen, 2006).
The lack of quality information related to costs, service utilization and caseload trends is one of the greatest obstacles to planning efforts. Researcher Charlotte McCullough, who has conducted several national surveys on financing reforms in child welfare and has helped several states think through site readiness issues, reports that many states use guesstimates about actual costs and service patterns because the actual data are not available. The hardest information to gather is client use of external services outside of the child welfare system, most commonly, mental health and substance abuse treatment. This information is important to redesigning both program and fiscal models and planning for the coordination of services.
Once programs are implemented, reliable data tracking systems are critical to contract monitoring and quality assurance (QA) systems. MIS systems should be designed to track both contract performance and client outcomes. In many instances, substantial investments in software, hardware and training are needed to ensure that information technology is available and used for system implementation and improvement (Westat & Chapin Hall, 2002).
5) Is there viable competition in the marketplace to deliver target services?
It is argued that one of the defining features of a privatized system is competition in the marketplace. It is assumed that competition will encourage providers to work efficiently and effectively. Competition is expected to result in higher quality, less expensive services because the purchaser can shop around for the best products at the cheapest costs (Winston et al., 2002, Nightingale and Pindus, 1997).
However, competition does not exist in all communities for all services. Because barriers to entry are substantial, competition may not exist prior to privatization or even following implementation. In fact, informal discussions with state child welfare administrators held during the QIC PCW needs assessment found that the lack of capable providers to deliver services was one of the most common barriers to initial or expanded privatization efforts among those states that identified barriers (University of Kentucky & Planning and Learning Technologies, 2006). States and communities considering privatization are advised to examine the provider landscape and assess whether there are viable providers to provide the targeted service.
For instance, instead of issuing an RFP, Florida issued an Invitation to Negotiate for lead agencies, to assess provider capacity and determine if agencies had the necessary infrastructure to provide quality services (Freundlich and Gerstenzang, 2003). Floridas assessment of agency capacity focused on:
- Agency purpose and relationship to community,
- Quality assurance system,
- Organizational stability,
- Human resources management,
- Information systems, and
- Proposed service delivery model for lead agency services and activities.
It is interesting to note that the state did not initially score providers on their capacity to deliver child welfare services, but rather looked more generally at infrastructure and management issues (Freundlich and Gerstenzang, 2003). In fact, a great deal of attention was paid to the providers financial security including matters of:
- Existence of security bonds, liability insurance and performance bonds,
- Savings to cover at least 60 days of agency operations,
- A viable, long term business plan,
- An accounting system that uses cost centers that would allow providers to assess costs by case and predict costs into the future, and
- A risk management program.
6) If necessary, how can public agencies expand provider capacity and thereby increase competition?
Child welfare can learn much from other fields about expanding competition in the marketplace. Cohen and Eimicke (2001)(10) suggest that government agencies might offer providers capacity building grants to encourage them to enter the system. Alternatively, government can help to pay for contractor expansion such as purchasing facilities or hiring new staff. The authors caution that although both approaches will increase competition, they may also reduce potential cost savings from privatization, at least in the short term.
This issue is complex in child welfare because federal Title IV-E funding only reimburses after services are delivered and only for certain, limited activities. That said, some child welfare agencies have supported capacity building, primarily through the use of start-up funds. Learning from Kansas and its own early implementation efforts, Florida began to offer its lead agencies transition funding to support start up costs including efforts to write agency systems of care and contracting procedures for local service networks. Other sites, such as Milwaukee, Wisconsin, have provided grants to private providers to open new facilities.(11)
The payment structure itself can have an effect on competition. Pure performance-based contracts can exclude organizations with fewer resources often smaller community based organizations or faith based organizations since they often cannot bear the financial burden of providing services until payment points are achieved (McConnell et al., 2003). Public agencies might reach out to a wider pool of private bidders especially those that do not consider themselves eligible due to agency size or lack of history of child welfare service delivery, by creating several smaller contracts that may be more appropriate for smaller community based or faith based groups.
Philadelphia has always relied on private agencies to deliver prevention and foster care services. Partly due to its multi-ethnic demographics, the city has worked hard to support smaller, community based organizations that reflect the communities being served.(12) The city offers its providers free, ongoing training on case management services as well as parent education and other services. To encourage participation of smaller providers, the city has also authorized that larger providers may serve as fiduciary agents (or fiscal sponsors) to smaller groups. A sponsor is a nonprofit corporation that receives and disperses funds for organizations and provides administrative and financial supports to programs that lack this capacity (Green et al., 2006). In Philadelphia, the Greater Philadelphia Urban Affairs Coalition provides a variety of business services, including payroll, accounting, and auditing services to its member programs. They also offer providers access to group vendor discounts for goods and services, including office supplies and insurance coverage and access to legal services. The Coalition charges providers five to eight percent of project budgets for this service.(13)
Another means of increasing competition is to allow the public agency (or units of the agency) to compete against private providers for the contract(s). While we are not familiar with any such instances in the privatization of child welfare services, this has happened in other human services, such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) (Nightingale and Pindus, 1997).
7) Do private providers have sufficient skills and administrative capacity to manage large scale contracts, and monitor service delivery and client outcomes?
As described in the literature, some of the most common challenges and knowledge gaps reported by private providers who manage new, risk-based direct service contracts include:
A lack of knowledge of contract risk issues. There are presently a broad spectrum of contract models ranging from no-risk purchase of service contracts where private providers are reimbursed at agreed upon rates for services, to higher risk managed care and/or performance based contracts. The latter types of contracts introduce risk to the private provider because payment under these contracts is not strictly linked to service delivery, but rather to the achievement of specific contract goals, which may be achieved only after incurring service expenditures for some time.
It is well documented that rate setting is one of the biggest challenges in privatization efforts (Kretman, 2003; U.S. DHHS 2003). Several factors determine the financial risk to providers who are not reimbursed under traditional purchase of service contracts. The contractor may be required to absorb costs in situations when they are serving more cases, providing more services, providing more expensive services or providing services for a longer period than originally planned. One national study found that states use a range of information to develop case rates. They use historical data about past expenditures and target populations and often the geographic region being served. Due to challenges in identifying service costs, several states and jurisdictions were found to estimate case rates and then further negotiate these rates with private providers as additional data and experience using the rates became available (Westat & Chapin Hall, 2002).
Even after establishing negotiated rates, many states have implemented means to further mitigate provider risk. These include using:
- Risk corridors whereby providers are sheltered from expenses that exceed a certain level but must also reimburse the state if they spend less than a certain level, or
- Risk pools whereby contractors can pull down funds needed, based on agreed upon formulas.
Capacity to track and report client outcomes and other data. While many private agencies have strong internal management information systems (MIS) and case tracking systems, others do not. When assessing readiness, public agencies must decide whether the private agency will be able to use the public agencys SACWIS (or comparable agency system) or whether the private agencys own system should interface with the states SACWIS. Alternatively, will data need to be entered into both systems? Ideally, private agency systems should be able to track:
- The case plan
- Client location and status
- Service utilization and
- Service costs.
The system should be user-friendly and be able to generate useful reports easily and quickly (McCullough, 2005).
Ability to recruit, train, and retain qualified staff and managers. For over a decade, the child welfare system both public and private agencies has struggled to hire and retain qualified staff. When assessing readiness, public agencies should not assume that the private providers will be able to recruit, train and retain new staff more easily than the public agency. This issue will be explored more fully in later papers.
Florida addressed many of these uncertainties by implementing a readiness assessment process for all new providers. For the six year period between 1999 and 2005, the department systematically transitioned the management and day-to-day operations of the child welfare system to lead agencies in 22 regions of the state. From the outset, contracts included a start-up period to enable lead agencies to build the infrastructure and finalize a series of deliverables that were submitted to the department including specific plans for: their system of care, human resources, network development, quality assurance systems, fiscal and risk management, and transition.
Even with a phased-in approach, researcher Charlotte McCullough reports that the state realized after several lead agencies made the transition that a formal, standardized assessment of readiness was needed to ensure that both the lead agency and its local public partners were fully prepared to implement the approved plans. The Department developed a readiness assessment tool and a formal process for assessing and preparing local department units and lead agencies to become ready to safely transition services. The Departments Readiness Assessment process utilized an external team of peer experts to assess the development of the local infrastructure and transition plans, and provided technical assistance to both public and private agencies prior to initiating transfer of any services. The assessment tool and process were refined on several occasions to reflect challenges encountered and lessons learned at each stage of the statewide roll-out (McCullough, 2003).
8) Do private agency front line staff have sufficient skills and knowledge about child welfare policies and evidence based reforms to deliver services?
When designing privatization initiatives, states must decide what level of credentials should be required of private agencies. Must agencies be accredited? Will contracts specify worker credentials or will this be left to the private agency? These decisions will be driven partly by the anticipated division of activities and functions between agency workers and other community based agencies that can provide clinical and other special services.
With the privatization of the case management function, public agencies will need to decide whether private agencies must meet all of the existing child welfare training and certification requirements of public agency workers. Other decisions involve who will provide the training and how it will be funded. Title IV-E funding can be used to reimburse 75 percent of states training expenditures related to foster care and adoption services for public agency workers. Training delivered to private agency workers is reimbursed at 50 percent (GAO, 2004).
It cannot be assumed that public agency workers will transition to the private agencies bringing with them their skills and experience with child welfare issues (James Bell Associates, 2000). In Kansas, the public agency remained fully staffed with few workers transferring to the private agency and in other states, only limited numbers of agency workers transferred to the private providers.
Due to the extensive hiring that will need to take place as private agencies take on significant new child welfare functions, training might be offered on flexible and ongoing schedules so that new workers can be trained shortly after they are hired. Kansas, for example, worked with its Training Institute (the University of Kansas) to shorten traditional training modules from 1-2 days to 3-4 hours, to permit new workers to remain in the field as much as possible. Much of the initial training focused on enabling new workers to examine their own belief systems about parenting, ethnicity and social class, and familiarize them with basic child welfare policies and state statutes (Ortega and Levy, 2002). The University of Kansas training team works closely with the states private providers to develop ongoing training programs. Considered to be part of their technical assistance program, private agency management help design advanced training topics which sometimes involves bringing in local or even national experts, to train on specific topics (Ortega and Levy, 2002).
The third paper in this technical assistance series, Evolving Roles of Public and Private Agencies, will more thoroughly discuss transitioning from publicly to privately delivered service systems and states experience with front line training needs.
9) Is the public agency prepared to design a new service delivery system and assume new roles focused on contract design, procurement, and monitoring?
As has been discussed, designing a new service delivery system involves several considerations and should be driven by system goals, target population and even scope of system reforms. Designing the contracting models goes beyond the financial approach used to support services. It involves several complex decisions about whether or not to use a lead agency, the type and structure of contracts and the extent to which the public agency continues to oversee individual cases.
Public agencies must consider whether they want to function primarily as an administrative oversight agency and transfer all operations to the private sector, or whether they want to contract out for specific functions and retain decision making and/or service coordinating activities.
Designing new service delivery systems, as well as assuming new responsibilities for contract design, procurement and monitoring, are complex issues that go well beyond the scope of this paper. Each will be discussed more fully in later papers, including the lessons learned to date. But, following are some limited considerations on each topic.
Contract Design: Once sites have settled on a program model and contracting method, they must be able to prepare contracts that are clear and complete. Contracts often lack the needed specificity because the agency does not have sufficient experience preparing contracts and/or, information is not available. McCullough (2005) reminds us that [a]fter a decade of experimentation, there is still no compelling evidence of the efficacy of one financial approach over another. From a survey of private agency administrators in five states that had privatized some component of their service system, she found that administrators of every program discussed challenges in their initiatives chosen contracting mechanism (McCullough 2005 p19).
A number of key topics that should be fully clarified in service contracts:
- Specific target population,
- Service provision (scope and duration),
- Special populations that are explicitly included or excluded from the target population,
- Responsibility for determining federal/state (if local initiative) funding eligibility and reporting,
- Billing and payment arrangements, including when and under what conditions financial incentives and penalties will apply,
- Standards for program and client data collection and reporting,
- A quality assurance plan that describes how the contractors performance will be assessed, and
- Agency grievance and appeal processes.
Procurement Process. The process for letting, evaluating, and awarding contracts must be transparent and fair, in reality and in perception. How bids are evaluated, scored, and awarded can have important ramifications for the level of controversy surrounding privatization processes that lack transparency or appear open to favoritism or corruption can lead to legal and political problems. In addition, the level of specificity and prescription within the RFP can affect the quality of the service approach. The public agency letting the contract needs to balance the goal that providers meet certain quality thresholds with the desire to encourage bidders to be innovative in service design and delivery (McConnell et al., 2003). As a result, certain process and outcomes must be defined and prescribed, while leaving sufficient discretion in how these are met.
Monitoring. Effective monitoring is critical to successful privatization, but has been an ongoing challenge in privatization initiatives. A 1997 GAO study found that monitoring contractors performance was the weakest link in the process (GAO, 1997a). More recent studies have found similar challenges. A 2002 GAO study of TANF contracting found significant problems tracking TANF fiscal and program activities in 15 states over two years, and noted potential problems in over a quarter of states (GAO, 2002). In a separate 2003 HHS study of TANF case management privatization, in two of the six projects studied, state auditors exposed inadequacies in state monitoring (McConnell et al., 2003).
There are cases where public agency casework staff have been shifted to contract oversight positions without sufficient training and ongoing guidance. Adequate MIS infrastructure is often lacking. In short, when planning and preparing for privatization efforts, contract monitoring can require large scale investment in computers, software and training on both the side of the public and private sectors (Embry, Buddenhagen & Bolles, 2000).
In most cases, monitoring assesses compliance with statutes, regulations and the specific terms of the contract agreement. Today, with the new emphasis on performance contracting, there is an expanded interest in also monitoring major outcomes the effect of the services on clients. Contracts are being monitored, and in many cases rewarded, on the basis of child and family outcomes in addition to their compliance with process or practice standards.
A Westat and Chapin Hall (2002) study found that the two most common forms of contract monitoring for child welfare fiscal reform initiatives were the use of collaborative case reviews and analysis of management information systems. Among the 22 states studied, case reviews involved ongoing collaborative decision making meetings or periodic case reviews where public agency staff look over a sample of cases to examine service provision and costs. Public and private agency staff discussed service quality, patterns of expenditures and permanency plans. States are also increasingly relying on management information systems to monitor services. For instance, New York has implemented a new interactive MIS (called EQUIP) that allows the public agency to tie reimbursement to child outcomes (OBrien, 2002).
Eggers (1997) recommends that plans for contract monitoring (and by extension, quality assurance systems), must be thought through prior to the release of an RFP for services. The plan should be included in the contract and describe:
- Reporting requirements,
- How information will be shared (through reports, shared MIS, meetings),
- Agreement to share (and means of access for) client records,
- What happens when there is non-conformance with contract requirements (e.g. use of corrective action plans),
- How providers will be held accountable, and
- Complaint and appeal processes.
The National Child Welfare Resource Center for Organizational Improvement has examined state quality assurance systems and prepared A Framework for Quality Assurance in Child Welfare. The Framework serves as a helpful guide for state officials and includes both case studies and steps to design effective QA systems (OBrien, 2002).
10) Are roles and responsibilities clear between the public and private sectors?
Coordination between the public and private agencies is a critical task even in full scale privatization because the public agency is still ultimately responsible for the quality and nature of the services clients receive, the achievement of client outcomes, the appropriate use of taxpayer funds, and compliance with the law. In addition, in nearly every community in the country, child investigations and protective services are still being carried out by the public agency.(14)
Establishing clear roles and responsibilities between agencies has emerged as one of the most complex challenges of privatization. Elements that must be considered include:
- Developing and coordinating case plans for new entrants (because the public agency will conduct the investigation and may coordinate early services);
- Determining funding eligibility for programs (with the need to train contractors to understand multiple program rules);
- Bringing into line the goals of public and private agencies (contract employees may focus more on performance targets while public employees may focus more on process and timeliness);
- Coordinating services and information to keep clients from falling between the cracks (different or incompatible management information systems can make this more difficult); and
- Encouraging good working relationships among staff when cultures, pay, and compensation policies can differ significantly.
When designing the new service models, decisions must be made about specific roles of both the public and private agency workers. Questions include:
- Who handles matters of eligibility for Federal title IV-E and Medicaid dollars and other requirements? If this function has been transferred to the private sector, how does the public agency verify these findings?
- Who has primary responsibility for developing the case plan, the public or private provider?
- Who presents information about the case and makes recommendations to the court about the case plan including goals, services, etc. the public or private agency worker, or both?
- What are the decisions that can be made by the private provider?
- Selecting services
- Level of placement
- Visitation
- Case goal
- Whether and when to return a child home
- Recommendations for termination of parental rights (TPR)
- For which of these decisions does the private provider seek approval from the public agency worker? How does this work and in what timeframe?
In many communities and states, these relationships and roles have evolved over time as public agencies become more confident in the decisions about, and services delivered to, clients.
It is also important to keep in mind that contractors need to have adequate control over case management decisions when using risk-based contract arrangements such as managed care and performance-based contracting. In many cases across the country, private agencies are reimbursed for performance, but do not have final decision making authority over how they direct services and resources. This disconnect between financial risk that private providers assume and the actual control they have over casework, will continue to challenge privatization efforts (Westat & Chapin Hall, 2002).
11) What are the legal risks with privatization?
There are a range of legal issues that must be considered when privatizing services. The federal government is actually silent as to whether the case management function can be privatized. McHugh (2000) found there is nothing stated that directly sanctions, nor prohibits it.
Instead, federal law holds states ultimately responsible for the placement and care of children in foster care and for all other federal mandates under Title IV-E and other provisions of the Social Security Act. Moreover, under federal constitutional law, some public child welfare agencies have been held legally responsible under certain circumstances for ensuring that children are not harmed while in state custody based on involuntariness of states action. Accordingly, if a public agency were to privatize all or any case management responsibilities, federal law would seemingly still hold the public agency accountable for its contract agents actions. (McHugh, p. 13, 2000)
In addition to federal law, states must examine their own laws which may specify certain purely government functions in the delivery of child welfare services. North Dakota, for instance, amended its child protection statute in 2005 allowing it greater flexibility to contract out child welfare services (Section 50-25.1-06). Other states, including Arizona and Texas, are looking into more subtle legal issues. These states have determined that state law does not explicitly prohibit privatization of services, but are exploring whether state law and court rules might preclude the private agencies from presenting the states recommendation in court, even if they serve as the agent of the state.(15)
Finally, states must consider the liability issues of the private agencies. Will private agency workers have legal representation in courts? If, for example, private providers are representing the case in court themselves, does state law grant immunity to the provider as an agent of the state? If not, what are the legal consequences of this for the private agencies? What are the financial consequences for the private provider for legal representation and insurance coverage? Some locations are trying to determine whether State attorneys will be able to represent the private agency case workers in court as they currently do for public agency, child protection staff (McCullough, 2005).
12) Will privatizing services alone bring about improved outcomes or will the agency need to implement other reforms in tandem with privatization to improve system performance?
When considering whether privatization will benefit the current system, agency leaders must examine how privatization will support or complicate other reforms underway. Initiative planners must determine whether they will need to adjust other features of the service system when cases and case decision making authority are transferred.
Privatization efforts should be considered part of a states or communitys overall reform agenda. As discussed earlier, privatization alone will not likely solve all problems facing an often overburdened and under funded system. In Illinois, state staff recognized that there were a complex set of interrelated pressures hindering agency performance which needed to be addressed on several fronts (Shaver, 2006). Some of the core design changes involved a re-design of front-end operations (reducing caseloads of investigative workers, implementing a new risk assessment tool, reducing time to service referral), redesigning contract monitoring (doing away with the dual case management system where public and private agency caseworkers jointly reviewed all key case decisions), developing the performance-based contracting system and adding guardianship as a permanency option. In short, privatizing case management and redesigning the payment structure of the foster care contracts was just part of the states overall reform agenda to improve permanency rates.
Conclusion
The first round of Child and Family Services Reviews confirmed what many have known state and county child welfare systems continue to struggle to achieve timely permanence for children. The reviews also confirmed the chronic barriers states face in delivering services, including the fact that large caseloads and staff turnover limit caseworker visits with children and thereby fetter a states ability to ensure federal goals of timely permanency and safety (US DHHS, 2004).
The reasons for undertaking privatization reform are varied but a common theme is improving outcomes for children and families. To achieve these results, privatization efforts must be based on careful up-front assessment of current issues facing the child welfare system, thinking through where improvement is most desired, and scrutinizing the capacity of private providers to deliver on expected results. Most experienced observers advise.
One of many benefits reported by those states and communities that have privatized large segments of their child welfare system is that privatization can leverage support from the community and expand the political base for advocacy and program expansion. In addition, by broadening the service provider community, the system can offer more specialized and, in some cases, more culturally appropriate services.
In short, privatization can improve service delivery and child and family outcomes, but it remains a complex systemic reform that requires considerations of multiple political and program factors. As noted in this paper, it is important that sites undertake this process in an informed manner to a number of points; specifically:
- Mandates alone wont achieve outcomes. Writing a contract that demands a certain level of performance will not ensure that intended outcomes will be achieved. Just as public agencies have struggled to continuously improve service delivery, private agencies will have their own set of struggles. Short and long-term plans for staff training, contract monitoring, technical assistance, and corrective action must be thought through prior to implementation.
- Successful initiatives are partnerships. Private agencies may not be able to leverage needed community services and build capacity without the support of the public agency. In fact, private community-based agencies may be less well-equipped to broker needed health and mental health services from other community providers than the public agency. Initiatives must be planned with time and resources dedicated to knowledge transfer and opportunities for collaborative problem solving.
- You cant get something for nothing. Improving quality of services delivered and the outcomes achieved requires investing needed resources, at least in the short-run. Recent privatization reforms teach us that privatization can help achieve outcomes, spur innovation, and align performance with financial incentives. However, these reforms also show that in most cases, enhancing system performance comes at a higher cost than the current system.
- Dont ignore staffing issues. Again, a change of this magnitude will have multiple ramifications for staff in both public and private agencies. Public agency staff may not support the change, and private agencies will face many of the same difficulties recruiting, training, and retaining child welfare staff. Early discussion of needed supports is critical.
It must also be remembered that privatization, or systemic, fundamental reform cannot be planned in a vacuum. Sufficient time must be devoted to a thorough assessment of where you want to go and what in the current system supports or inhibits performance. New service delivery systems must be designed to take advantage of system strengths and to address identified barriers to performance. In addition, the best-intended reform can get quickly off-track (even before implementation) if the planning process is not inclusive. The child welfare system involves many key players in the delivery and oversight of services early involvement and buy-in from these players is important to designing and implementing efforts.
Many scholars of child welfare privatization initiatives have suggested that the effectiveness of privatization efforts depends on the quality of planning and implementation activities carried out by the public and private sectors (Nightingale & Pindus 1997, Freundlich & Gerstenzang, 2003; McCullough, 2003). Public agency officials must select among a range of service delivery models, contract payment methods, quality assurance and contract monitoring methods. Each component must be designed, and then aligned with other design features to achieve agency goals (McCullough, 2005). The next paper in this series will present a range of structural models and fiscal arrangements used by states and communities today and will highlight lessons learned to help states weigh options. Future papers will provide detailed information about how states have divided roles and responsibilities, developed contracts and carried out contract monitoring and accountability functions.

On the criminal justice policy front: Pieces from Bloomberg and Rolling Stone focus on Minneapolis, where, in the immediate aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd, a veto-proof majority of city councilmembers pledged to dismantle the police department root-and-branch and replace it with new systems for public safety. Instead, the council voted this week to trim just 4.5% from the police budget in 2021, a move that will not change the number of cops on the street. Both pieces examine how, in the course of the last six months, vows to “reimagine public safety” devolved into yet more incremental change. A piece from The Atlantic also centers on the movement to “defund the police.” Since May, when the ambiguous phrase – both policy demand and “snappy slogan,” progressive rallying cry and conservative lightning rod – was jettisoned into the cultural mainstream, “the national conversation about police reform has devolved into a never-ending argument over words.” And a piece from the New York Times explores the impacts of this summer’s racial justice protests on the burgeoning “progressive prosecutor” movement. Recent months have seen the election of reform-minded DAs in reliably blue urban areas like Chicago and Los Angeles; but also in Texas, Florida, Ohio, and deep-red south Georgia. Many of these candidates won by framing their races as referendums on police reform, racial justice, and mass incarceration.
In muckraker/watchdog reporting: A new study by the Prison Policy Initiative highlights the role of mass incarceration in spreading COVID-19. Researchers found that the number of new COVID infections over the summer of 2020 was greater in areas with larger and more concentrated incarcerated populations – not just among those working or confined in detention facilities, but also among those who simply live nearby. All in all, the authors estimate that “mass incarceration led to 560,000 additional COVID-19 cases nationwide in just three months.” “No Way Out,” a multi-part investigation by The Marshall Project and WFAA, examines the spread of COVID-19 through the Texas prison system over the last nine months. Their report shows how a lackluster response by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice allowed the disease to spread, exacerbating existing outbreaks and putting inmates, prison staff, and surrounding communities at risk. And a new analysis by The Marshall Project and AP News reveals the full extent of the pandemic behind bars. They found that one in every five state and federal prisoners in the US has tested positive for COVID-19 – a rate more than four times higher than the general population. As the pandemic enters its tenth month – and as the first Americans begin to receive a long-awaited COVID vaccine – at least 275,000 prisoners have been infected, and more than 1,700 have died.
In complex crime storytelling: A piece from the New Republic asks, “What do Black people really think about the police?”. In 2020, widespread protests put law enforcement – especially the idea of “defunding” police and reinvesting that money into social services – at the forefront of the fight for racial justice. But at the same time, the “defund” movement has brought to light a puzzling contradiction, in which “the broader Black community evinces a distinct disapproval of the police while simultaneously voicing the desire to see a more persistent police presence in its communities.” A piece from the Independent focuses on “the rise of the podcast detectives.” Using the wealth of information and resources made available by the Internet, citizen detectives step in to fill the gaps left by law enforcement and the criminal justice system, taking it upon themselves to investigate or reinvestigate the most horrific of crimes. But these citizen detectives “exist at two uncomfortable intersections: between crime and entertainment, and between content and real life,” and the things they say – the theories they share, the information they uncover – can have a very real and often unanticipated impact on those whose lives were touched by crime. And, in a piece for the New York Times, journalist Elizabeth Breunig recounts her experience of witnessing a federal execution. Alfred Bourgeois was put to death last Friday at the federal penitentiary in Terre Haute – the tenth federal execution this year. His was “the kind of offense often adduced in advocacy for capital punishment: cruel, senseless, depraved.” Breunig writes that even as a fervent opponent of the death penalty, she understood the impulse to “erase from the earth every trace of [such] a crime.” The essay grapples with these feelings, and the immutable conflict between emotion and belief: “I began to think I wouldn’t know with certainty what part of me was being honest about capital punishment until I saw it for myself.”
And in culture/true crime: The New York Times reviews “Finding Yingying,” a new documentary from MTV about the search for Yingying Zhang, a visiting scholar from China at the University of Illinois who went missing in the summer of 2017. Filmed in the “dread-filled” first days of the search, “Finding Yingying” follows Zhang’s family, back in China, as they grapple with an “unfathomable horror: the disappearance and probable death of a loved one who was living far away.” Though the subject matter is unavoidably grim, director Jenny Shi – a former classmate of Zhang’s in their shared hometown – captures the family’s ordeal with compassion, humanity, and grace. The New Yorker highlights “The Parameters of Our Cage,” a collaboration between the photographer Alec Soth and an incarcerated man named Christopher Fausto Cabrera. In January, Soth received a kind of fan letter from the Minnesota Correctional Facility where Cabrera is currently serving out a twenty-six-year prison sentence. He wrote back, and, in the months that followed, the two developed an unusual, touching friendship built on their shared love of art. And, in a piece for Current, Rahsaan “New York” Thomas, the incarcerated co-producer and -host of Ear Hustle, discusses his experience of putting together a podcast from inside San Quentin, being nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, catching and fighting COVID-19, and covering the pandemic behind bars.How to make the best of Instagram as an Influencer ?

Many patients don’t know that cancer can affect the vulva, which is the outer part of a woman’s genitals. Women may be worried about their sexual health in addition to the cancer.
Working together, our team of specialists will recommend a treatment plan aimed at curing a woman’s cancer as well as helping her to preserve or regain her sexual function. We also embrace innovative treatments, including clinical trials of new medicines and surgical approaches to reduce side effects and speed recovery.
A number of factors can increase a woman’s risk of developing vulvar cancer:
- Being older than age 50
- Carrying the human papilloma virus (HPV), a common infection that is transmitted sexually or through skin-to-skin contact. There are many types of HPV. Types linked to vulvar cancer include HPV 16 and HPV 18.
- Having a precancerous condition of the vulva called vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN).
- Having a condition called lichen sclerosus, which can cause the skin on the vulva to become thin and itchy
- A history of cervical cancer or precancerous cervical conditions
- Having a rare skin disease called vulvar Paget’s disease, which causes redness and scaliness.
Vulvar cancer does not always cause symptoms in the early stages. That’s why it’s important for women to get regular pelvic exams. During the exam, the gynecologist will check the vulva for any abnormalities. Women can also get an HPV test as part of a pelvic exam to see if they carry the HPV virus.
Women should also see a doctor if they experience any signs of the following symptoms, which may be signs of vulvar cancer:
- Itching around the vulva that doesn’t go away
- A burning feeling or other pain in the vulva
- Any bumps, lumps or other growths
- A sore in the vulva that doesn’t heal for a month or longer
- A change in color or texture (for example, a part of the vulva appears lighter, darker, or thicker than the area around it)
- Unexpected bleeding or discharge.
When vulvar cancer is suspected, we typically conduct a biopsy, or remove a small piece of suspicious tissue. Our experienced pathologists, who are specially trained in diagnosing gynecologic cancers, use various laboratory tests to determine if the cells are cancerous and what subtype of vulvar cancer it is. There are four subtypes:
- Squamous cell carcinomas: Most vulvar cancers begin in the squamous cells, which are the primary type of skin cells.
- Adenocarcinomas: About 8% of vulvar cancers are adenocarcinomas. These start in gland cells.
- Melanoma: About 6% of vulvar cancers are melanomas, which is a skin cancer that grows in pigment-producing cells.
- Sarcomas: About 2% of vulvar cancers are sarcomas, which start in tissue, bone and muscle cells.
- Basal cell carcinoma: While very rare, basal skin cancer can form in the vulva.
We may also conduct imaging tests, including MRIs and CT scans, to determine how far the cancer has spread and gain other critical information needed to guide treatment.
Surgery
Surgery is the most common treatment for vulvar cancer. Our highly experienced gynecologic-oncologists are experts at operating on the vulva and surrounding organs and tissues. Our primary goal is to remove the tumor, along with a small amount of tissue around it to prevent the cancer from coming back.
If the cancer has spread extensively, part or all of the vulva may need to be removed. This procedure is known as a vulvectomy.
When women are concerned about the appearance of the vulva, our gynecologic-oncologists will partner with plastic and reconstructive surgeons at UChicago Medicine. Our plastic surgeons are experts at taking skin and tissue from other areas of the body to reconstruct the vulva. Reconstruction closes the wound, helps with healing, and provides a semblance of normality.
Our surgeons place a high priority on preventing or limiting pain and other complications from surgery. For instance, not long ago, many women who underwent vulvar cancer operations had numerous lymph nodes in the groin removed to see if cancer had spread beyond the vulva. These procedures sometimes led to lymphedema, which causes chronic leg swelling and other problems. Today, whenever possible, our surgeons use a less invasive approach called a sentinel lymph node biopsy. This involves injecting dye into the cancerous tumor during surgery. The dye naturally travels to the first (or sentinel) lymph node. The surgeon then removes the sentinel node to check for cancer. If the sentinel node is clear, no other nodes need to be removed.
Chemotherapy and Other Drug Therapies
Patients with vulvar cancer may benefit from chemotherapy, which are cancer-fighting drugs.
Women with rare subtypes of vulvar cancer, including melanoma, may also benefit from clinical trials being conducted at UChicago Medicine on immunotherapies, such as Keytruda® (pembrolizumab). Immunotherapies can help the body’s own immune system fight the cancer.
Radiation Therapy
Radiation may be recommended before or after surgery for vulvar cancer. At UChicago Medicine, our experienced radiation oncologists aim to prevent or limit damage to healthy cells and surrounding tissue during radiation. This helps reduce irritation and other side effects.
Patients with vulvar cancer typically get external beam radiation, which is delivered from outside the body. At UChicago Medicine, we use a radiation technique called volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). This technology allows us to deliver radiation to the tumor as well as cancer cells that might be hiding nearby while limiting harm to nearby organs, such as the bladder.
Supportive Services
Our dedicated supportive oncology program provides a range of services, including mental health counseling and social work services. Patients with vulvar cancer and their patients can access these services at any time.
Many Women Have Never Heard of Vulvar Cancer. Here's What a Survivor Would Like You to Know
“If I can help one other person to learn what vulvar cancer is, to recognize it, to take care of themselves and make sure they go to the right specialist – then I’ll feel like I’ve given something back to women who may be suffering from this cancer," says Susan Golden, vulvar cancer survivor.Read Golden's story

In comments at an IT summit reported by German media outlet Heise (we recommend you click here for the full article), Dobrindt — Germany’s Minister for Transport and Digital Infrastructure — said he saw the long-term future of Germany as being a “gigabit society”.
Germany is currently deploying a number of high-speed broadband technologies, with Deutsche Telekom in particular focusing on upgrading its existing copper network with Fibre to the Cabinet or Fibre to the Node technology, including the VDSL standard. It is also planning to deploy 5G mobile broadband services.
The German Government has previously announced that it would guarantee all households in the country would receive broadband speeds of at least 50Mbps. Deutche Telekom reportedly said at the event that it believed it likely it could offer speeds as high as 250Mbps over FTTC/FTTN using vectoring technology.
However, at the event, it appears that Thorsten Dirks, President of Digital association Bitkom and CEO of Telefonica Germany, described the 50Mbps target as only a milestone. Dobrindt appears to have backed the view that transition towards a “gigabit society” is where Germany must go.
There are certain similarities between Germany and Australia. Both countries are currently focusing on upgrading legacy networks such as copper and HFC cable networks, using Fibre to the Node technology especially, coupled with the vectoring standard. And both countries also have some of the world’s most advanced 4G mobile networks — with much planned in the way of future mobile upgrades.
However, in Australia, the current Coalition Government and the leadership of the NBN company believe that the 50Mbps speeds described in Germany as “only a milestone” will be sufficient for some time.
For example, in an interview with TelecomTV published a month ago (we recommend you click here for the full article), NBN company chief Bill Morrow downplayed Australia’s desire for very high-speed broadband.
“So you want that as quick as you can get it, right? If you can say fibre-to-the-node can deliver up to 50Mbit/s for most everybody, isn’t that enough for the next 10 years to get this thing going and then, if there is more demand, then you just push fibre further down the street using the company’s profits rather than adding in more taxpayer money?” what speed do people actually want? An all-fibre NBN is capable of speeds of up to a Gbps. Yet the vast majority of people on this network — about 80 per cent — are choosing plans of 25Mbps or less. As you would expect, people are not willing to pay for something they don’t need.”
opinion/analysis
In this case, what we see is that Australia and Germany are actually pursuing very similar technological solutions to the issue of high-speed broadband availability. But the rhetoric from the top could not be more different. In Australia, it is common for our politicians and NBN executives to talk down the need for high speeds, seeing 50Mbps broadband speeds as sufficient.
In Germany, it appears clear that these speeds are viewed as nothing more than a bare minimum — a stepping stone.
One wonders why this huge disparity exists — and when, if ever, the two views can be reconciled.

Big difference is (IMO), as has been said by many here, many times…
Those abroad upgrading copper, own the copper and as such it’s in their financial interest to continue to invest minimally to wring every last cent from their otherwise obsolete copper, rather than bite the bullet and do it properly with fibre.
What we did here was rightly take obsolete copper out of the equation, to be able to progress beyond such antiquated technology… but then the current government idiotically brought it back.
I’m sure he meant stepping stone and not mile stone too.
250mbps (speed we don’t need according to coalition clowns) yet another stepping stone to their “gigabit society” capability. So yes very similar in that we like to waste time and money on intermediate steps to the inevitable goal.
I guess we can expect GimpCo to move the goal posts again in yet another politically motivated twitverse post in the next few days due to this new international example too…
I’m sure he didn’t, a mile stone is a marker along a continuing journey; which is actually a much better description than a stepping stone which just gets you across a stream or pond to the far side. So I think he meant exactly what he said, there’s no reason to pause when you pass it (as the LNPs lot plan to for 10 years!) especially when network volumes double yearly.
Exactly what 50mbps is.
If he really does consider 50mbps a “mile stone” (I’m sure he actually does, my comment was to point out the absurdity in considering it a mile stone) then that is not saying a lot about the standards Germany has and Australia would have if we followed.
Hey, most Aussies will be lucky to get 50Mbps in the next 10 years. Don’t worry your pretty head about it.
Indeed HC,
Milestone implies something of significance…
Whereas anything to do with copper here or abroad, in comparison to fibre, pales into insignificance ;)
i prefer “millstone”
as in ‘a millstone around his neck’…..
Actually it would appear both are saying the exactly the same thing. Reutilise existing infrastructure to save capex and deliver ubiquitous high speed internet at customer demanded speeds as quickly as possible, upgrading where increase speeds demanded using available (continuously improving) technologies.
Since we missed the analysis of BT’s copper announcements several weeks ago perhaps a comparison of DT’s broadband upgrade vs NBNCo? Very instructive.
“Actually it would appear both are saying the exactly the same thing.”
Oh, really? What gauge is Germany’s copper? Also, it says they’re upgrading existing infrastructure – we /bought/ existing 60+ year old infrastructure – you’re saying they did the same?
Yes Richard, but NBNco doesn’t have existing infrastructure.
I know this is confusing – but NBNco aren’t Telstra. They only play one on TV. They liked it so much, they bought the company!
Oh please, tell me again, the story of how a model that is designed specifically for incumbents, works for an entity, that isn’t?
I do like that one. It’s my favourite story! Shame it’s in the fiction isle though. Bit of a bummer, hey.
Deutche Telekom, and BT both owned the copper.
In our case, TELSTRA owned the copper. However they wouldn’t do the FTTN option that was brought to them. So we had to bypass them. As a result we didn’t have existing infrastructure.
It’s not hard Richard. You can’t re-utilise something you don’t own.
Well until the government change resulted in a humongous waste of money to allow us to pay for the operating expenses of the Copper network.. YAY TEAM.
So no, completely different. Your comments are foolish.
+1
I believe the reason for the huge disparity exist in Australia is that only a few could get any better than the up to 24Mbps service we have had. Only the few could under stand the benefits of the fast speeds. As due to the glacial rollout of the MTM so far it will still many years before most can see the benefits.
Considering our national average is now 6Mbps up from 4Mbps because of FTTP. 4Mbps average was an utter disgrace due to lack of investment from the private sector and one of the main reasons for the NBN to begin with.
Indeed. So much for quicker and sooner. And by the time it’s done more time and money will be required to fix the mess that could have been avoided by doing it right the first time.
So where exactly is NBNCo’s plan to get us all to this “gigabit society”?
As far as I can see NBNCo doesn’t even have a clear path to vectored VDSL and I’m yet to see the fully costed plan for DOCSIS3.1. To say nothing of Fibre on Demand, of which NBNCo says virtually nothing.
All the MTM has provided so far is a host of questions to which there seem to be few answers.
Of course the biggest question of all is, who pays for this move to a gigabit society since MT’s crippled NBNCo is extremely unlikely to be able to afford to do so?
All reports are that NBN’s FTTN will be vectored. (It was the minimum they had to do to get half-decent speeds out of Australia’s network.)
You’re right, there is no plan after FTTN and HFC because imagined future technologies will obviate the need for future expenditure in this government-supplied service. That’s the plan, apparently.
Vectored will have problem with the overbuilding of other FTTN/B networks that are running.
+1 Graham…
At least the German’s are looking to the future not just the next election…
When the higher speeds than 25Mbps on the NBN are as unaffordable as they are, the claim that people are not willing to pay holds no water and is a triumph of mean-spiritedness and negativity, which will come at the expense of new economic opportunities as much for the companies who would service those subscribers as for the subscribers themselves.
“We can’t get companies to supply infrastructure, so we are half-heartedly doing it ourselves. We are actively limiting economic development. Aren’t we great that we’ve saved money doing so?!”
We stayed in 25mbps is not we don’t want it faster but we cannot afford it .. jeez ..
Whatever happened to 25 Mbps by 2016, 100 Mbps by 2019? Now it’s 50 Mbps for the next 10 years…
Passed under the radar as the “friendly media” are no longer on a witch hunt, for obvious reasons.
The German approach, and the Australian MTM approach are remarkably similar.
One you have FTTN, and HFC you can progressively roll FTTH over time.
But the big difference between here and Germany is population density. They can get from 50-1000mbps much more economically than we can.
I think eventually we will get there, but I don’t see the need to spend it all up front, and right now, I just want the current rollout done and dusted, the politics over with, and then move on with gradual upgrade over time.
John
The problem with the mess we have now is that since the cost is now costing very close to Turnbull own SR figures for FTTP and the ROI decreasing. The NBN won’t beable to pay for any gradual upgrade unless asking the taxpayer again to pay more money for those upgrades.research area of

Singh, and C. Guestrin, “‘Why should I trust you?’: Explaining the predictions of any classifier,” in Proc. ACM SIGKDD Int. Conf. Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2016 (). Ribeiro et al. is in-line with the Po’D from a few days ago, Chakarov et al. “Debugging machine learning tasks,” CoRR, vol. abs/1603.07292, 2016.
Whereas Chakarov et al. address the problem of finding errors in training data via misclassifications, Ribeiro et al. address the problem of demystifying the cause of a classifier making a specific decision. This paper is timely and strong. My one-line précis of it is: We propose a method that helps one understand and trust the decisions of a classifier, as well as improve the system.
Ribeiro et al. advance a new way (at least to me) of understanding classification systems. They propose “explanations” that qualitatively link the output of the system and the contents of the input. One illustration they provide is in medical diagnostics. A classification system has decided from a patient’s history and symptoms that they have the flu. Ribeiro et al.’s proposed approach identifies the information leading to that classification, e.g., sneezing, aches, patient ID, etc. A doctor working with such information can then make an informed diagnosis. Another example they give is an image classification system. The explanation for a particular decision highlights those parts of an image (superpixels) that are closely tied to the classification. When it highlights irrelevant regions, one then knows something is amiss.
The approach of Ribeiro et al. is called LIME: Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations. (It has a github page!) An explanation for the classification of a specific instance comes from building an interpretable model (e.g., decision tree) around that instance. What does that mean?
Take an observation x in some feature domain, which the classifier f labels f(x). For that observation x, LIME forms an “interpretable representation” x’, which is a vector of binary elements related to some meaningful vocabulary, e.g., bag of words. (They way LIME does this is not completely clear to me… and when it does become clear I will update this.) Then, LIME aims to build a new classifier g that maps the domain of the interpretable representation x’ to the range of f such that: 1) it is a good approximation to f around the neighbourhood of x; 2) it is not too complex (a stand-in for “interpretability”). Ribeiro et al. pose this problem in terms of optimising complexity (like the number of regressors) and approximation error over a family of “interpretable” functions, e.g., decision trees of varying depth.
The toy example shown on the github page is illustrative. A classifier f might produce a complex decision boundary from a training dataset, but LIME only seeks to produce a decision boundary that closely approximates f near the point of interest, but a boundary that is interpretable in a domain that is less abstract than that of f.
To make this computationally feasible, LIME approaches it iteratively. It samples an instance around x’ (randomly turning off its non-zero elements), and projects that point z’ to z in the feature domain (how this happens is entirely unclear to me … and when it does become clear I will update this). Then it forms an approximation error, e.g., (f(z) – g(z’))^2. For a whole set of such sampled points {z’}, LIME computes the weighted errors of a collection of interpretable functions {g}. Simultaneously, LIME computes the complexity of these functions as well, e.g., sparsity.
LIME picks the best model by minimising a linear combination of the error and complexity over the set of interpretable functions. In the case of regression, the few non-zero weights of the selected model point to particularly significant elements in the interpretable domain with respect to the classification f(x).
Ribeiro et al. offer great examples, which are detailed in this blog post of the lead author. Even more, they show how this approach to understanding classification systems can lead to improving their generalisation.
I find this work exciting for several reasons. The first is that it supports much of what I have discovered to be the case in a significant amount of research in music informatics (MIR). Many music content analysis systems are unknowingly exploiting aspects of data that are not meaningful with respect to the problems they are designed to solve. And so we don’t know which are solutions and which are not. My current favourite example is the music genre classification system that uses sub-20 Hz information. (Our working hypothesis is that some of observations in the benchmark dataset was collected using recording equipment having identifiable low frequency characteristics, like a modulated DC of a PC microphone in front of a radio playing country music.)
The second reason I like Ribeiro et al. is that it provides a new approach to uncovering “horses”. Ribeiro et al. is not using interventions or system analysis, but instead a proxy system specialised for a specific point under consideration. That is a brilliant and novel approach to me.
The third reason I like Ribeiro et al. is that they clearly show how understanding the behaviour of a system really does lead to improving its generalisation. It also shows classification accuracy and cross-validation can be quite unreliable indicators of generalisation.
With papers like Ribeiro et al., the case grows stronger that your machine learnings may not be learning what you think. We cannot take on faith that a particular dataset has good provenance, or is large enough, or that high accuracy probably reflects good generalisation. Everyone must be wary of “horses”! Keep an eye on the first event of its kind, HORSE 2016!
Neat application. I always wondered about the use of sparsity in classifiers, here it is a strong feature. Though I wonder how well this will actually do for interpreting deep nets, or finding weird “album effect” frequency domain effects in MIR.

In civil cases, he repeatedly sided against the worker and for the employer; sided against consumer protection; sided against Planned Parenthood; sided against the separation of church and state. In criminal cases, he argued that correction and police officers should be immune from liability despite majority findings that the vindicated suspects' constitutional rights had been violated; and he argued that convictions should be upheld despite findings that the defendants' lawyers were ineffective, or that Miranda rights were violated, or that the incriminating evidence was unconstitutionally obtained.
Perhaps most notable (and in my view most worrisome), is that even when Gorsuch sided with the defendant, he set forth the very narrow, literalist view of the 4th Amendment that it does not prohibit unreasonable searches or seizures. Rather, it only prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures if they involve one of the few particular items mentioned in that amendment--i.e., "persons, houses, papers, and effects." But nothing else. This is a view, by the way, based on long-overruled decisions of the Supreme Court from an earlier era. This also just happens to be the same narrow, literalist view of search and seizure protections taken by Gorsuch's hero, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, to whose vacancy he was appointed. And it is the view condemned in recent years by, among others, conservative Justice Samuel Alito, whose separate concurring opinion in U.S. v. Jones, 565 US 400 [2012] exposed the dangers of that view which was embraced in Scalia's opinion in that case.
Sooooooo, has Gorsuch's record on the federal appeals court been reflected in his record to date at the Supreme Court? He has been a justice for only a short time. Confirmed by the Senate in April, he has only participated in those cases which the Court considered as it was wrapping up its term. And yet....
Let's take a look.
Death Penalty
McGehee v. Hutchinson: In Gorsuch's first public vote, he sided with execution. He broke the Court's 4-4 tie to allow Arkansas to proceed with several executions that the state wanted to complete before its supply of lethal drugs expired. Each of the death inmates had already been imprisoned for 10 years; a few for more than 20. Each of them had legal claims challenging their convictions or sentences or even insisting on innocence. State and federal courts at various stages of the litigations had found some merit in their claims. But the Supreme Court declined to review the claims and, with Gorsuch's vote making a bare majority, approved the executions.
Campaign Finance
Republican Party of Louisiana v. FEC: The Supreme Court majority summarily affirmed--in a four word entry--the decision of the court below to uphold a particular provision of the federal campaign finance law (the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2002, aka “McCain-Feingold”). The provision in question prohibits the use of unregulated contributions made to political parties for federal election activities. Gorsuch, together with Justice Thomas, noted his disagreement with the majority's disposition of the case and would have proceeded with the full review process.
Indigent Criminal Defense
McWilliams v. Dunn: The Alabama courts had denied the death penalty defendant the assistance of a mental health expert. By a typical 5-4 ideological split, with Justice Kennedy casting his vote with the liberals, the Court held that indigent defendants who have raised serious mental health issues do have such a right, and it sent the case back to the lower courts to apply the law correctly. Gorsuch joined Justice Alito's dissenting opinion, taking the position that the decision of the state courts should have been affirmed, because the Supreme Court had not previously "clearly establish[ed] that a defendant is entitled to an expert."
Employee Grievance
Perry v. Merit Systems Protection Board: A 7-2 majority of the Court ruled that an employee could seek judicial review of his "mixed" grievance (i.e., discrimination underlying a civil service grievance) in federal district court; significantly, such a court is not required to defer to an administrative ruling which, in this case, was adverse to the employee. Gorsuch dissented. In an opinion joined by Thomas, Gorsuch argued that an employee seeking judicial review of an adverse administrative ruling on his civil service grievance can do so only in the Federal Circuit Court. And, again here's the significance: that court must affirm the employee-adverse administrative ruling unless it is utterly irrational.
Trump's Travel Ban
Trump v. Int'l Refugee Asst Project: The Court unanimously agreed to review the constitutionality of President Trump's executive order that suspended the entry of certain foreign nationals into the United States. At the same time, by a 6-3 majority, the Court mostly upheld the orders of the courts below that had temporarily barred enforcement of the executive order. The Court did, however, partially reverse the courts by allowing the executive order to be enforced "with respect to foreign nationals who lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States." Gorsuch joined Thomas's dissenting opinion, arguing that the executive order should be allowed to be enforced in its entirety--i.e., including its enforcement against those with "a close familial relationship" with an American--because the "Government’s interest in preserving national security" outweighed the resulting hardships to affected individuals.
Church-State Separation
Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer: By a 5-2-2 majority, the Court held that Missouri engaged in unconstitutional religious discrimination when it denied the church's request for funding for its playground--which funding was generally available to non-religious institutions. [Missouri is one of those state's with an strict (originally anti-Catholic immigrant) prohibition against aiding religious institutions.] Chief Justice Roberts' majority opinion, in a footnote, underscored that "This case involves express discrimination based on religious identity with respect to playground resurfacing. We do not address religious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination." Gorsuch, joined by Thomas, wrote a separate concurring opinion disassociating himself from that limiting footnote. Anticipating other applications of law to religious institutions, he wrote that "general [constitutional] principles here do not permit discrimination against religious exercise—whether on the playground or anywhere else." [Hmmm, such as laws requiring equal treatment of gays and lesbians and same-sex married couples, even in the face of religious objections? And see immediately below!]
Gay Rights
Pavan v. Smith: This case involved Arkansas's refusal to include the name of a biological mother's same-sex spouse as a parent on the child's birth certificate. By a 6-3 majority, the Court summarily granted review and reversed on the ground that, in accord with the Court's 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, same-sex married couples are equally entitled to “the constellation of benefits that the State has linked to marriage.” Gorsuch dissented. In his opinion joined by Thomas and Alito, Gorsuch insisted that "nothing in Obergefell indicates that a birth registration regime based on biology...offends the Constitution."
Gun Rights
Peruta v. California: The Court declined to review a decision of the 9th Circuit that “the Second Amendment does not preserve or protect a right of a member of the general public to carry concealed firearms in public.” The California law, which generally prohibits concealed guns in public places, was thus upheld. Gorsuch joined Thomas's dissent. The dissenters complained that the majority's decision not to take the case "reflects a distressing trend: the treatment of the Second Amendment as a disfavored right." They were also unequivocal about their position on the California law. As Thomas concluded for himself and Gorsuch: "the Framers made a clear choice: They reserved to all Americans the right to bear arms for self-defense. I do not think we should stand by idly while a State denies its citizens that right."
Well there it is. By his votes and separate opinions in these ideologically-laden cases, Neil Gorsuch has in short order left little doubt about his strong ideological leanings. And beyond ideology or political philosophy or jurisprudence, consider his partisan bent. How would a typical Republican politician vote on these issues? Not a judicially retrained judge or strict constructionist or believer in federalism (i.e., states' rights) or any other actual, coherent judicial or political philosophy. But a partisan Republican.
What's the common thread through his positions on issues as varied as gun rights and gay rights, Trump's travel ban and campaign finance, worker rights and rights of the accused? That's right, connect the dots. His record on the Supreme Court already screams "ultra-conservative partisan Republican."
Some--like the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation and other very conservative groups and individuals who recommended him to Trump--undoubtedly are pleased with Justice Gorsuch's record thus far. Others, more moderate or liberal, much less so. But whether pleased or not with Gorsuch's Supreme Court record to date, it is undeniably what it is: politically partisan, conservative Republican.Please let it be Spring

-.The Savoy, a professional hospitality college in Merano, is a centre of excellence in training the future professionals of the catering industry.
Under the watchful eye of over 60 teachers, the Savoy buzzes with passion and dedication from the 700 students engaged on courses including those for chefs, sommeliers, waiting staff and hospitality and tourism managers.
The school teaches everything required for a successful career in catering and hospitality, not only practical sessions in the kitchen and restaurant but also modules teaching teamwork and interpersonal skills.
The requirement
- The Savoy needed a kitchen for the new educational facility. This was to be built alongside the existing building which had become too small to house the growing number of students.
- The kitchen in the old facility had gas appliances from the Ambach System 900, Ecoline and Compact Plus lines. Appliances were needed for the new kitchen that had electronic controls and state-of-the-art technology; offering significant savings in energy consumption.
- The school was not just seeking a simple supplier of kitchen equipment; it needed a partner to undertake the project from start to finish and supply all the appliances needed for the students: cooking ranges, washing and refrigeration systems and blast chillers, as well as kitchen extractors, ventilation systems and all the elements for the self-service area.
- The new facility presented a number of challenges. Not only did the building have distinctive sloping walls but for logistical reasons the training spaces, such as the kitchens and the classrooms had to be located on different floors.
- The Savoy needed highly functional, yet aesthetically pleasing products – the new kitchen had to be robust and high performance enough to stand up to the rigours of the students.
The solution
- Some 14 years on, the Savoy decided to ask Niederbacher, the company that installed the original appliances for the kitchen in the old school. Niederbacher was a reliable choice, the Savoy knew they could guarantee results were experienced in handling complete projects in the world of professional catering. Ambach was chosen, without any hesitation, once again, for the new kitchen at Savoy.
- In order to best meet the needs of the school in terms of high-performance, the robust yet compact Ambach System 700 and System 700 double service cooking lines were installed with a single hygienic top, together with the System 900 line, perfect for the school’s high volumes.
- The kitchen tops were welded in situ and occupy an overall surface area of 150 metres. Amazingly, the worktop alone (that connects the kitchen to the restaurant of the school, where the students practice) comprises 22 metres of stainless steel!
- The project took two years and was the result of great teamwork between all the partners involved: the directors of the school, the team of architects, the technicians and the project managers from Niederbacher and Ambach.1802 1205 W Hastings Street, Vancouver, BC

Let’s go back way into the 70s. When listened to Doldrum’s new album, the track Loop reminded me on a song that I remember from way back. It took me a while to figure it out: the track’s name was Popcorn, an iconic electronic instrumental released in 1972. The French band who played it, Anarchic Systems, is, as the name suggests, rather a rock band, but one of their members played the MiniMoog, so they got to record this song and sold some 700,000 copies of it (my parents might even have bought one).
My personal memory of this goes back to a mall in the suburbs of Paris: a friend and I just got a new cool t-shirt and we were running around like crazy while the PA played Popcorn. That one of the powers of music: to nail down a memory in time and place.

Thanks for understanding.JT has given its backing to a group of young technology pioneers who have formed the first professional organisation with players competing in global Virtual Reality eSports competitions. JT has become the global sponsor of “Team Gravity”, founded by Jersey resident Tim McGuinness. The team competes in the game Echo Arena, which is a three-versus-three-person game of virtual ‘Ultimate Frisbee’ – however, it plans to compete in more eSports and has recently recruited its fourth member.
The team competes on a weekly basis but also attends major eSports events, such as ESL One in Hamburg and IEM Katowice in Poland, the biggest gaming event in the world, attracting 173,000 people and an online audience of 46 million. Team Gravity recently finished first in the European Stage Finals of Echo Arena and is looking to qualify for the World Finals in September.
Mr McGuinness said: “eGaming and eSports have been around for some time, but the addition of Virtual Reality takes it to a new level and is a growing global phenomenon. With VR, it is much more akin to playing a sport than a game; you need to train and you need to have the right mentality as you can play for up to three hours non-stop – it is a full body workout requiring great fitness, dexterity and skill.
“JT’s sponsorship will be crucial for us as Team Gravity grows in this brand-new industry, which has huge prospects as technology develops even further. As a player, I also have a lot to thank JT for; in the virtual space, I will be playing against people around the world, even my own teammates are based in Sweden and Germany. We rely on having a super-fast internet connection, and with JT’s full-fibre network in Jersey, I know I have the ultimate bandwidth to compete at the highest level.”
Tamara O Brien, Head of Customer Experience at JT said: “JT has been at the forefront of communications technology for more than 120 years so supporting VR eSports – which is fast becoming a global movement – is a great fit, especially as Team Gravity also has a strong local connection through Tim. We’re proud to support Tim and his teammates with both funding and technology, to help them grow and develop and we wish them every success in the forthcoming World Qualifiers. We’re also looking at further local opportunities to work together in the near future to help show young islanders the possibilities this exciting growing sport has to offer, so watch this space.”

In other 1D modeling software, lower slots can be activated in order to minimize water flow provided by the minimum level urged by the model. Is it possible with Infoworks ICM? Other solution?

Short Sweet and Utterly Complete
“A mop went to a party. But he was shy, so he just went home and cleaned up the house.” My wide-eyed 6-yr-old shared this with me a few days ago. He’d been tasked to create a story at school. “That is a terrific story!” I said, charmed and full with love for my little Tolstoy.
I am impressed by his literary effort for several reasons:
It is short, sweet and utterly complete.
It is random and unexpected. I haven’t heard too many mop stories recently.
It has a clear protagonist facing a genuine challenge.
The solution is real and not sappy. Sadly, our moppy hero goes home alone, but he satisfies himself by activating his inner strengths. One can only assume that a mop of his character will indeed meet his princess mop at some point.
Kissing my son’s tan cheek, I asked him, “After he cleaned his house, was the mop happy? Did that make him feel better?” “Yes,” he said, rocking back and forth on his heels. “And what did he do after he cleaned his house?” “Nothing, cuz that was the end. He went to bed.” The fact that our mop did not mope made me respect him even more.
Everyone can relate to a well-told story, because our entire lives are one big narrative. You are the hero facing real challenges. Your character arc is considerable, as you try to win the day and better yourself. The best communicators make their point in a story because, whether it’s a PowerPoint presentation, a barstool exchange or a eulogy, you engage your listener when you weave a tale.
Unless you want to see eyes glaze over, do not just spew facts; we all suffer data overload these days. As a stockbroker, I was taught that people don’t buy stocks; you sell them stocks. In other words, you paint a picture and create a happy ending that they can see and clearly understand. Of course, I’m asking you to tell true stories here. Not stockbroker stories.
I will never tire of this photo. My Cinderellas holding hands. The best story I’ve written yet.
In my opinion, we do way too much talking in our lives. I certainly do. And most of what I say is unnecessary. The least I can do is try to make it entertaining. Offer the proverbial spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down. And if it does not go well, I can always go home and clean the house.

Sam Waweru, the mortgage lender’s group managing director, says they expect full-year earnings for the year to fall below the 25 per cent than what was registered in 2017 financial results.
“The trading environment continued to be unfavorable,
leading to a slowdown in the real estate sector growth. The tough operating circumstances have led to an increase in the non-performing loans position, which has also adversely affected the business performance,” he said.
He delivered the warning announcement as HF Group sunk deeper into loss territory after posting Ksh332 million loss after tax in the nine months ended September, compared to a Ksh159.7 million profit after recorded in 2017.
Total interest income fell by 14% to Sh 4.7 Billion as total non-interest income also fell by 7.2% to Sh 598 Million. Operating expenses, on the other hand, rose by 11.4% to Sh 2.4 Billion. Non-performing loans grew by 10.4% to Sh 8.9 Billion.
HF Group increased its investment in Government paper by a massive 429.5% to Sh 3.9 Billion as loans and advances to customers declined by 11% to Sh 45.4 Billion.
Good morning Kitty. 44 here at 5 am. Wife's parents anniversary party postponed because of
their grandchild being injured badly in that accident. So I might go south to PA and work on the
tractor, try to finish it up. Maybe try to finish up the field I was mowing in the Summer to test it.
Today I might try to install a second heat register in the living room, stays to cool in there during the Winter.
I installed the duct work for the whole house over 20 years ago when we got natural gas up here
on the mountain. Repairs on the furnace will be more difficult now because the store that sold
general furnace parts shut down. Store that opened up where they were only sells parts for the
furnace that they sell. I will look for another store that sells parts for a wide range of furnaces but
might not find one, probably not very profitable to sell parts. It's a pain to wait a week or so for a
furnace part ordered online. Last year we had to get an igniter for it and was before our store went
out. We do still have most of the original electric heat so better off than many homes that have no
back up. Most people would call a contractor to fix their furnace anyway.
Finally slept well tonight after two nights of not enough sleep.
Have a good day Kitty.

So beautiful....know how much you miss your friend/pet
Good morning Kitty. I woke a little early, not to bad. Another cool morning but supposed
to be in the 70s today. A good bike ride down to the farm today.
Finally got the second heater vent in the living room yesterday. Put a lot of smoke in the house
cutting through the vermiculite flooring. Day before that I pulled a board out of one of those new
windows I installed. Before I new better, I put a board over top and went in hard, was making the
latches to far apart and hard to get them latched. Had to put a hook in the wood and pull it out with
a hammer puller. Now it has a couple spacers and the rest filled with insulation foam.
Brandy was one of my closest friends. One of the most kindest, understanding, loving, beings I ever knew.
Brian probably trying to finish some things before it gets colder out, like many of us are.
Enjoy your day Kitty.

The biggest thing parents can do to support distance learning is to help their kids build good habits around a plan for success.
BOULDER, Colo. (PRWEB) August 20, 2020
Space. Preparation. Routine. Engagement. Excellence. If you’re a parent of school-age kids, pull out your iPhone and get to know those five words. They may just save the school year.
At least, Brad Jones and Tommy Giovagnoli, the two inventor-dads behind the rewards chart app Smiles & Frowns™, hope they will. These are the five keys to their new SPREE Distance Learning™ plan they’re introducing with a major app update this week. (Smiles & Frowns, free on iOS)
“We have kids ourselves, so we know how hard remote school has been. Last year, we all kind of coasted over the finish line. But starting the school year without a plan? That’s ten times harder.”
The way Brad and Tommy see it, parents feel like they’ve been given half of the responsibility – but none of the tools – to help their kids succeed at home learning. So they wanted to at least give parents a good place to start.
So how do two dads tackle a monster challenge like this one? By reading, rolling up their sleeves, talking to teachers – and just getting to work. Of course, it doesn’t hurt when you already have a well-reviewed positive behavior app out there.
“Hey, Dads like to fix things, which is how Smiles & Frowns started,” Tommy G said. “For distance learning there’s plenty of expert advice there, but no plan. So we boiled it down to a few simple things you can focus on and built a behavior chart around that.”
Their “SPREE” plan is a rewards chart meant to help kids build strong habits around what they’ve identified as five keys for distance learning success:
1. Creating and maintaining a dedicated SPACE that is specifically built for learning
2. Strengthening their PREPARATION skills, so they log in ready to learn each day
3. Establishing a ROUTINE that will keep them on a dependable road to results
4. Supporting active ENGAGEMENT so kids lean into their studies instead of laying back
5. Encouraging a mindset of EXCELLENCE that help kids continue to set goals and achieve
With their app, Kids earn Smiles for a variety of good behaviors built around these five areas, and Frowns when they do things that work against success, like playing with their cell phones during study time or logging into class from bed. Smiles minus Frowns equals the Spending Smiles kids use to earn whatever Rewards they agree on with their parents. It’s simple and effective.
“The biggest thing parents can do to support distance learning is to help their kids build good habits around a plan for success.” Jones says, “And that’s what our app does best.”
Smiles & Frowns™ is a free iOS app available on the Apple App Store. (Smiles & Frowns, free on iOS) Along with their new SPREE™ Distance Learning behavior board, the app also included boards to help build positive habits around behavior, chores, manners, study time and more.
Tom “Tommy G” Giovagnoli is a writer, problem solver and Emmy-winning marketing man who grew up in a factory making the “Iron Mike” baseball pitching machines his own father invented. Brad Jones is a life-long builder, coder and senior data expert can’t resist the challenge of a really good challenge. Together, these dads operate under the working philosophy of Parents, Unite! to create solutions by parents, for parents, so we can all get through this crazy ride together.You are currently browsing the category archive for the ‘Michael Hayden’ category.

Cheney allowed civilian wiretaps before 9/11. What? Wasn’t that illegal? Apparently that was overridden by the Vice President.
Wait a minute. Didn’t the NSA have apparatus that listened for various words such as “Jihad” or “terrorist”? Yes, it did, but as soon as that was discovered to be coming from an American, the tap was dropped and the name of the person was expunged. The NSA was following the letter of the law…….
In fact, as the Bush administration was coming in, the Clinton administration, in their freshman orientation guide for incoming republicans, said in their packet Transition 2001. “Warning to the incoming administration: the agency.”
Or so was the intent. “What we were supposed to do, was delete the name of the person,” says a former NSA encryption analyst. “Even during the Clinton years, the computers would accidentally pick up some of the key words said by Americans.” The analyst deleted those name in the reports he sent the senior analysts.
That changed in 2001. Under orders by Cheney the names were included. Furthermore, Cheney sent back orders that those persons were to continue to be surveilled 24/7. What disturbed this analyst was that some or most of these terrorists he was ordered to listen to, worked in the White House or State Department.
In a revealing statement, another analyst says: “There was a real feeling or paranoia emanating from the Vice President’s Office, and I don’t think it had to do with anything with the threat of terrorism……”
According to James Bamford, author of the best selling books The Puzzle Palace and The Body of Secrets, before 9/11 the agency was not poking as hard among regular citizens as it does now. That all changed after 9/11. However a strong case for selective spying on government officials, seems to be the focus of the Vice President during the summer before 9/11.
If you remember it was that summer(2001) that the NSA took the unprecedented step or opening its doors to reporters. The director even said on Nightline : ”
“We’re a foreign intelligence agency. We try to collect information that is of value to American decision-makers, to protect American values, America–and American lives.”
American values? Isn’t that one of the code words used by the neo-cons? American values such as the destruction of the social net, establishment of an untouchable rich caste, and the wearing down of our Armed Services through unnecessary deployments?
But in answer to that question: he continues:
.”
(Hasn’t that all changed, as of August 11th?)
Today that spokesperson is head of the CIA.
So while the official voice who I believe is still today trustworthy and genuine, was speaking still on the Clinton platform of government within the law, his superior. the VP, was going behind his back to wiretap illegally.
Final thought: remember when Paul O’Neil left the administration fuming and 24 hour later 180’d and clammed up? Inner beltway speculation was that they got to him somehow.
We now know how…………………
Bottom line, before there was a war……there was an illegal act instigated by the Vice President…….Are we safer than we were under Clinton?
“I see nothing…….nothing!….”

It is so frustrating to live in these times. So many things need commented upon. They need researched. They need exposed. They need discussion.
It is in times like these that one discovers exactly what one’s priorities are.
I woke up feeling the need to comment on Delaware’s wind power. It has been awhile for me and I needed, particularly with the cancer clusters in the news today, to find outwhether any other coal fired power plants had cancer clusters popping out around them.
Then I received some economic news that set me off. New insights of a Stock Crash that makes 1929 look puny.
I then got a call from someone who had no health care and wanted my advice on how to go about getting a cyst removed…..Another topic that needed addressed.
Later today I got fired up over watching a panel discussion describing the so called union of Canada, the US, and Mexico. Although the presentation was just on trade barriers only, during the questioning, the public conversation turned to covering a union of the three countries. The most telling of the answers was that this type of wild speculation was prevalent only because every negotiation was being done in secret. No one really knows what is going on on the larger scale because each splinter group is meeting with its counterpart without disclosing any information to the other splinter groups.
What was needed was full disclosure with one negotiation held around one table done in the open for all to see………
Sort of a metaphor for Delaware’s State legislature………
Next, while listening to WDEL I got fired up over my children’s education. Ideas popped out of the conversations and I needed to flush them out and post them.
But by the time I got back to post, it was time to check on the court case in San Francisco. Like a kid opening a present, I frantically searched for any comment from that telling exchange. I finally found one just minutes after it was posted.
So as I look back and reflect upon my day, I see I value the environment, cheap energy, open disclosure, improvements in education, and a fierce protection of our privacy. But at the core of my being, I will drop all these to protect the Constitution. The Constitution is really worth giving up ones life over.
And right now, after last weeks vote on the Protect America Act, our Constitution is in danger. Great danger. Of course each of our elected officials can decide NOT to be Julius Caesar and NOT take the reins of a dictatorship that have been handed to them, but they would be bucking the trend of human history, if they did so………
I am struggling to understand how and why any Democrat would or could have voted to allow this travesty to happen. The more I find about the turn surveillance has taken since 9/11, the more apparent it seems that everything was staged to allow the reins of power to be handed to a choice few. For once done, no one can take them away. I am struggling to figure how rational, thinking human beings, could be so unaware of the potental of wrong doing and yet so trusting of those who have proven they cannot be trusted.
After all that is why History is there. In 2002 when protesters were chanting “No Blood For Oil” I smiled and thought that made a nice chant, but that slogan was so far fetched that it never could have seriously been possible. My research into whatever files I could find leading up to the invasion of Iraq, have proved otherwise. Apparently, we did invade Iraq for oil……..
So even though the idea of a “shadow” government that could quietly become the acting government also seems like a nice chant, but is still a bit too far-fetched and could never be possible,……. I have, no choice, but to act like it is, based on the past actions of this administration.
Yes, of course I hope I’m wrong……I hope it with all my heart. But had a greater number of Americans seen the light in 02, and frozen this nation in its tracks, we would not be where we are today, looking over casualty lists……
This stuff is not out in the open. The main stream media neither can or will investigate deeply enough. Even then, the stories are getting buried when and if they are reported.
I can only hope that more citizens become concerned that their right to privacy has gone with their ability to challenge this administration.
With spy satellites now focusing cameras on our backyards with a resolution of 4.54 inches, we need to be very careful about who is looking. Men, it would be a smart idea to keep your clothes on. Women, watch out for those cleavage shots………
Ladies and Gentlemen: the Constitution is in grave danger. You need to hold your Congress accountable: they have made a decision worse than the Dred Scott Decision. Don’t just phone or email……That becomes a statistic. Show up at one of his meetings in Georgetown, Dover, Wilmington, or Newark……Ask him in front of everyone why he decided to sell your freedoms down the river……….Only public scrutiny and/or embarrassment can and will make the difference. For if our public officials defray from defending the Constitution, then it is up to us to ensure that this document, and the freedoms that come with it, are still around for our grandkids and great-grandkids…………..
Even if just to stall for time, bite up several of the six months, distract the administration from carrying out their mysterious plans, impeachment procedures need to begin. Had such fortitude been present in Rome, as Caesar crossed the Rubicon, history could have turned out much differently………….

Hyperbole has its uses. Often points are scored in courtrooms, on televisions, and national debate through the use of hyperbole.
Only by writing, have I fully come to appreciate its usefulness. The effect of such comes not from what is said, but from the thought process that goes through each listeners head as they try to decipher the irrationality of what they have just heard………..Often through that analysis, they make some neural connections that are often quoted as “thinking outside the box…..”
It is unfortunate that in this case, my title is not hyperbole. It is my response to this, which I picked up from a link on Delaware Liberal…..
I have to admit, even though I try to use clean language when I write, when I read this my bowels rolled over and I even said “Oh shit. Here it is.” For amongst ourselves we have been talking about the repeated tendency of our president to laughingly consider himself as a king. And as we did, all of us knew in the back of our minds that the only real rational for such unconstitutional actions was for them to actually think………. that they would someday become one…………
Many of our generation were never schooled in the classics. As one who sprinted through two years of Latin, I would highly recommend that the reading in Julius Caesars’ own words, his argument for the replacement of the Roman democracy with the instillation of himself as its dictator, be required reading for all members of all democracies.
Fortunately today we do not all need to know Latin,…… for the same argument is dramatically portrayed in the last three episodes of the Star Wars Trilogy. The Dark Side is among us……………………………
But this recent executive order scares me…….. for next comes the assassination of our Jedi knights and the heartless slaughter of their future generation……………………….
I am no Jedi knight, but I may have to become one after this..
From the executive order signed days ago……….
I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, find that, due to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States,.:(for) any person..undermining efforts to promote economic reconstruction and political reform in Iraq or to provide humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people.
If one assumes the language is English and that the words therein have the meanings associated with those defined by dictionaries of the English language, then as someone who is adamantly against the Bush Iraqi Oil Grab, I am one of these, I am included. So are most of you…….
So is Dennis Kucinich, Olympia Snow, Joe Biden, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi…….all of us who protest not the war, but it’s failed policy, are in the same boat, for according to Republican Sen. Bunning of Kentucky, anyone who opposes the war, is in effect giving aid and comfort to the enemy.
Despite the reality that the opposite is true, as Dana was quick to point out here, that it is really the policy of George W Bush that has banded and bonded disparate groups (united by their hatred of both al Qaeda and the US) to “GET US OUT OF IRAQ“, ………. under the language of this order, even poor June and Rebecca Young, who have eloquently spoken against the war, are now like Will Smith and Gene Hackman,……………. enemies of the state.
And should we, as patriots, decide to help our friends and neighbors after their bank accounts have been frozen and assets devoured, we too stand on the wrong side of this capricious Ministry of Magic..
To our representative E-ZPass Mike Castle, Republican of Delaware: Our sincere thanks for your silence in support of the dissolution of what was once considered the greatest nation to have ever existed on this planet……….May future generations show you mercy and spare you the infamy that has hitherto, been previously reserved for Benedict Arnold, Judas Iscariot and Pontius Pilate……….3027 Mulberry Greens Ln 89e, Jefferson, GA 30549

But the main narrative arc in Big Fish has particular resonance for sons, a specific emotional current that touches anyone who grew from boy to man without ever really knowing his father’s love. This wound is familiar to many men, maybe most. And in one form or another, it can last a lifetime.
… Decked out in amazing theatrics and amusing imagery, that core pulse connects father-longing sons subliminally to the musical by John August and Andrew Lippa as it did to its source, the film by Tim Burton. And the way the Keegan production directed by Mark A. Rhea and Colin Smith keeps that primal pulse palpable is one of the show’s most remarkable qualities.
… By the end of Big Fish, the abyss between these men is no more. It is bridged, and they are reconciled, through the legerdemain of brilliant storytelling and ebullient acting and singing. I won’t say how that happens. You have to see for yourself. It’s delightfully entertaining magical realism, after all, not theatrical therapy. But do not be surprised if afterward, moving memories of one’s own father’s life have been stirred and inspired.- 18 Sep, 2010 1 commit

Made with in Bristol, UKBy Conn Maciel Carey’s COVID-19 Task Force.
Accordingly, employers now, more than ever, must understand and may want to take certain actions based on the vaccination status of their workers. However, obtaining information on an employee’s status and using that information to dictate policies and practices in the work environment has legal implications and raises many important questions that could pose difficulties for employers who want to ensure that they proceed in compliance with applicable laws. Below, we provide answers to questions we have received related to employee vaccination status as well as tips to effectively deal with these novel and complex issues.
Question 1: Can employers ask employees about their COVID-19 vaccination status?
Yes, but employers should be mindful of compliance with federal and state laws on disability, privacy and discrimination. If the employer requests confirmation and/or proof that an employee has been fully vaccinated, this should be a simple, straightforward inquiry to determine an employee’s current vaccination status. Such a simple, general inquiry is legitimate and would be considered permissible under applicable employment laws, particularly if it is made to determine whether:
- the employee may be excepted from certain of the employer’s policies and safety requirements due to their vaccinated status (based on new CDC guidance);
- an employee who has been exposed to a close contact must be tested for COVID-19 or quarantined; and/or
- if the employee qualifies for an incentive from the employer or the employer-sponsored health plan (if applicable)
As noted above and will be discussed in more detail below, the CDC’s May 13th guidance states that fully vaccinated individuals can resume activities “without wearing masks or physically distancing,” except where otherwise required by law or workplace guidance. Although how this guidance will be applied in the work environment is still being considered by federal, state, and local lawmakers, it is likely that employers will be permitted to alter safeguards in the workplace for those it knows are fully vaccinated. In addition, CDC guidance explains that fully vaccinated persons may refrain from testing and quarantine requirements if they remain asymptomatic (which has already been adopted in some states).
To implement this guidance, an employer may ask to see the white vaccination card (“white card”) indicating the type of vaccine and administration date(s), and may keep a log or make a copy of the white card to support any decisions made or policies implemented based on vaccination status. Another option that seems to be gaining some traction around the country with health departments and other agencies is the use of a self-attestation form. Rather than viewing and/or copying employees’ white cards, some jurisdictions are requiring or encouraging completion of an attestation form for vaccination status that includes information about the voluntary nature of the information sharing, the confidentiality in which the information will be maintained, and some basic information about the vaccination.
However, if an employee indicates that s/he has not been vaccinated, the employer should never ask “why not,” in order to avoid obtaining information that may be disability-related and protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”). This question could also potentially elicit information regarding genetic information protected by the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act (“GINA”) and/or an employee’s protected status under Title VII based on a sincerely held religious practice or belief.
Related to an employee’s vaccination status, if the employer has its own medical staff provide vaccinations, hosts vaccination events at the workplace, or makes arrangements for employees to obtain vaccinations through a third-party provider, it may be necessary to ask pre-screening questions that could indicate a disability. Such questions are permissible only if “job-related and consistent with business necessity.” Any retained records must be maintained as confidential medical records. And if the vaccination is administered to employees by a medical professional employed by the same company, HIPAA may be applicable.
Question 2: If I ask for a copy of the white card with each employee’s vaccination status and/or otherwise track my employees’ vaccination statuses, is this documentation subject to any recordkeeping requirements?
It depends. If you obtain a copy of each employee’s white card to substantiate the employee’s fully vaccinated status, that could be considered medical documentation subject to certain recordkeeping requirements under both the ADA and OSHA regulation 29 C.F.R. 1910.1020. Related to the ADA, there is current EEOC guidance that indicates this type of documentation would not be considered a medical record to the extent it does not contain medical information. Specifically, the EEOC states that “[i]f an employer requires employees to provide proof that they have received the COVID-19 vaccination from a pharmacy or their own health care provider, the employer may want to warn the employee not to provide any medical information as part of the proof in order to avoid implicating the ADA.” In addition, EEOC guidance explains that the vaccination itself is not a medical examination.
The white card generally contains the employee’s name, date of birth, type of vaccine and date of each dose. It is unclear based on the EEOC’s guidance whether any of this would be considered “medical information,” though presumably this would have been the type of documentation contemplated as proof of vaccination. However, because the white card does contain information arguably medical in nature, employers should probably treat them as medical records for now. This means the copy of the white card should be stored separately from an employee’s personnel file, in a medical file for the employee if one exists. It must also be treated as confidential – i.e., access should be limited to those with a business need to know the information.
The ADA explicitly permits employers to share otherwise protected medical information with supervisors and managers who have a need-to-know, so they can help implement necessary work restrictions and/or reasonable accommodations. As for how to go about doing that, in an ideal situation, information regarding vaccination status could be stored with HR, and managers could contact HR to confirm whether a particular employee has or has not verified vaccination status if there are any disputes or questions in the field. If that is not practical or feasible, another option is to give certain supervisors direct access to a confidential list of vaccinated/non-vaccinated employees to ensure proper implementation of safety rules to the extent they may differ based on vaccination status. Employers just want to be sure to only share this information with management who have a bona fide “need to know” in order to enforce a safety policy, to not disseminate this information any wider than necessary, and to educate those supervisors about the sensitive/confidential nature of the information.
From an OSHA perspective, the white cards would seem to meet the definition of a medical record under 29 C.F.R. 1910.1020(c)(6)(i) as a record “concerning the health status of an employee which is made or maintained by a physician, nurse, or other health care personnel, or technician.” Per the standard, if an employer obtains a copy of the white card to substantiate and track vaccination status, it will have to maintain that record for the term of the employee’s employment plus 30 years.
If, instead, an employer decides to generate its own tracking system or summary document for tracking employees’ vaccination statuses that is created by an employee who is not a health care professional, that document would likely not be considered a medical record covered by the retention requirements of 29 C.F.R. 1910.1020. This view is consistent with previous OSHA guidance and interpretations relating to body temperature screening of employees during the pandemic. For example, in a footnote to its guidance in the “Control and Prevention” section of its website, OSHA states:.
As this tracking system or summary document would not be created or maintained by health care personnel or a technician, it would similarly fail to meet the definition for employee medical record under 1910.1020(c)(6)(i). Also, if the record created to track employee vaccination status is not linked to a workplace exposure or required in the course of employment (i.e., for travel necessitating the vaccine), it likely would not be considered an employee record that must be retained pursuant to 29 C.F.R. 1910.1020. For example, OSHA has explained in its guidance that it does not consider drug testing results as medical records where the only exposure to toxic substances or harmful physical agents in the workplace is no different from typical non-occupational situations.
Accordingly, the information in the tracking system or summary document would likely not be treated as a 1910.1020 employee medical record that must be maintained for the term of employment plus 30 years. But we anticipate that OSHA guidance and/or potential Emergency Temporary Standard will provide some clarity on these issues.
As discussed above, however, employers should likely treat the vaccination information in the tracking system or summary documents in a confidential manner, separate from other employment records, in compliance with the ADA and similar state laws. Also note that some states may require employers to maintain records of employee COVID-19 vaccination status.
Question 3: Can I alter my current policies and safety rules related to masks and social distancing based on the CDC’s May 13th Guidance?
Likely yes, if state, local, and federal agencies alter their current mask mandates and social distancing requirements in response to the CDC’s guidance, but the answer is going to vary by locality. At the federal level, OSHA has yet to archive or otherwise update its guidance from back in January and February 2021 that employers should:
“[n]ot distinguish[ ] between workers who are vaccinated and those who are not: Workers who are vaccinated must continue to follow protective measures, such as wearing a face covering and remaining physically distant, because at this time, there is not enough.”
That guidance is still live on OSHA’s website but is substantively outdated because the justification points to a lack of knowledge at the CDC that it now seems to have as stated in its guidance.
Although OSHA has not modified the substance of that guidance, it has updated its website with this note:
The .
In other words, OSHA is instructing employers that the updated CDC guidance takes precedence over federal OSHA’s January and February guidance, presumably while it figures out how to update its guidance, as well as what impact the CDC update has on its emergency rulemaking.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has taken a similar approach to federal OSHA as the CDC’s May 13th guidance may also impact current interpretations of anti-discrimination laws related to vaccination status. An employer’s ability to apply its current policies and safety requirements differently based on vaccination status could have legal implications under laws like the ADA and Title VII. Indeed, the EEOC already has several FAQs that address mandatory vaccinations and an employer’s legal obligation to accommodate employees unable to be vaccinated based on disability or a sincerely held religious belief. To that extent, the EEOC also posted a notification to the public that it is considering whether any of its current guidance is impacted by the CDC’s update.
Importantly, however, the CDC’s new guidance and OSHA’s directive to reference it for measures to protect fully vaccinated workers may take a backseat to state and local laws and regulations or local guidance. Thus, if an employer’s workplace is in a jurisdiction that still has a Governor’s mask mandate, a State OSH Plan emergency temporary standard that requires masking and distancing, or a state law or regulation to that effect, it should continue enforcing mask and distancing requirements. But if the workplace is in one of those jurisdictions where there is no prevailing law, mandate or guidance that still requires masking and distancing at work, and the employer wants to eliminate mask requirements for fully vaccinated employees, it can do so, but should develop a system to make reasonable efforts to verify and track employees’ vaccination statuses. Indeed, in certain jurisdictions, the applicable law will mandate that employers have documentation of vaccination status if they want to take advantage of more relaxed requirements. For example, the way the proposed amended Cal/OSHA Emergency Temporary Standard defines “fully vaccinated,” employers may not consider a worker to be fully vaccinated unless the employer has documentation verifying that worker’s vaccination status.
For a more detailed review of the May 13th guidance, check out our prior post on its content and impact.
We will continue to monitor updates from the CDC, as well as OSHA and the EEOC, and provide additional information on these questions, and the topic of the treatment of vaccinated workers more generally, as it becomes available.225 Madison Avenue at 36th Street, New York, NY 10016.

You'll want to put on your headphones for this,. Lord Rick has had rocks thrown at him around these woods. Though most of the time ,it's just him scaring himself, things are different this time. You can actually hear a "scream". Could it be wolves or coyotes? Who knows. Rick explains:
Your sitting there listening to the crackling of the fire sometimes its to quiet then you hear something your trying to make sense of. The moon is not out and earlier you were trying to do Sasquatch vocalizations. Then all of sudden you hear what sounds like to strange vocalizations as if some hunt is taking place then you hear the scream of something being taken down. I had reacted as quickly as I good turning on the cam and you could hear more vocalizing. Tammy believes they are coyotes but I never seen them in the sierras or heard them on my journeys so it was odd. On the west side of the lake if you work your way out of the basin over the ridge is a very remote canyon that runs parallel with the lake. I integrated some photos of a case I worked up in NW Pa.of some animal mutilations we found in this one general area our team had a bigfoot sighting. I have to say I did find some coyotes that were mutilated I believe that Bigfoot may find them to be a nuisance along with the carcass of a small dog. In any case I try to keep an open mind we are in the forest you have many animals such as cougars, black bears, wolves, deer and even cattle. But what I recorded and heard at least what I could get was very odd then again during the day I heard similar vocalizations and seen a bipedal creature hide behind a tree. This should send some chills down your spine animals or monsters it gives me great pleasure to be able to share my experiences with our viewers and spook Tammy a little. Even though she believes they are coyotes she still shows great concern that making Bigfoot calls is not a good idea because she believes that these creatures are not nice. Anyhow it gets better because later in the morning when the sun came up my son seen a bipedal creature across from the lake that lumbered off after tree banging. I definitely think that the expedition was a success we found so many oddities but come on out listen to some tales and strangeness around the campfire.

The formidable high street retailer Argos has launched a budget tablet to compete with the likes of the even-more-formidable supermarket Tesco's Hudl tablet.
The Bush MyTablet will come in three sizes, 7-inch, 7.85-inch and 10.1-inch when it goes on sale on Saturday, July 26. Although the largest option won't be available until August.
So, what's on offer? Well all three run KitKat, the latest version of Android and all three come with 16GB of internal storage and the option to boost it with a micro SD card.
Although all three arrive with a 2MP rear-facing camera, the 7.85-inch and 10.1-inch models pack a 5MP front-facing camera over the 7-inch's 0.3MP camera. It's fair to say you'd be using these more for video chatting than snapping great pictures.
The two larger tabs both use a 1.4GHz quad-core processor while the smallest uses a 1Ghz dual-core chip. Screen resolution is 1024 x 600 for the 7-inch and 10.1-inch while the 7.85-inch features a 1024 x 768 display.
Make no mistake, these are not iPad mini killers. But if we've learned anything from the likes of the Hudl or Google's Nexus 7 it's that there's plenty of people out there looking for a no-frills, budget tablet.
And budget these are. The 7-inch will set you back £79.99 while the 7.85-inch and 10.1-inch variants will cost you £99.99 and £129.99 respectively.- Find a Trail

First time on this trail. Pretty along the River but I agree with others poorly marked so we did lots of turning around and backtracking. Will definitely do it again but will start further up the line to avoid traffic areas..
We started this loop at our hotel on Clover Island. We crossed over the Columbia on the Ed Hendler Bridge, into Pascoe, then headed upriver, passing many nice parks. For the most part, the trail is right beside the river. We then crossed over the river again on the I 182 bridge, and rode upriver on the Riverfront trail to find some lunch. This starts in the Columbia Point Marina park. There are plenty of places for lunch along this trail . We then headed back downriver to Kennewick. It is not a scenic on this side.
And I agree about the poor signage. This trail is not well marked, we had to rely on Google maps (with bicycling turned on), to find our way. Mostly around the bridges..
Clean and comfortable paved trail, great for bikes.
Nice ride on mostly asphalt! It has a nice park that runs along this trail for stopping and resting! Benches, water fountains and adult swings are available along the route! There is a lot to avoid on this trail, dogs, joggers, walkers, other bikers and occasionally a goose, duck or swan! Bathrooms are available at the park!
My daughter lives at the trailhead of this trail and while visiting I ride it daily! It is nice blacktop with a few traffic lights to get through! The number of birds to see is really nice with a estuary along the trail! Due to this being a neighborhood type trail there are lots of families riding and people walking dogs! It also has lots of places to shop, eat and rest on benches with water fountains! Nice easy ride!
Richland Riverfront Trail
I live in Kennewick and ride the Richland Riverfront Trail several times a week. I usually get to the trail by using the Sacagawea Heritage Trail or the Keene Road Trail (see my report on the Sacagawea Heritage Trail where I discuss the interconnecting of the trails in the Tri Cities area.. The Richland Riverfront Trail is an out and back trail of approximately 7 miles in each direction. There are several trailheads in the area but the major ones with parking for more than a couple of cars are as follows:
Columbia Point Marina Park
Bradley Boulevard
-North end of Condos
Howard Amon Park
- Richland Community Center
- Lee Boulevard
- Newton Street
- Boat launch Facility
Leslie Groves Park
- River Road
- Newcomer Street
- Park Road
- Saint Street
- Snyder Street
Although this trail is located in the center of a metropolitan area you are on a paved trail or when on a street or road traffic is light, there is no water or restroom facilities available on the trail north of Leslie Groves Park so plan accordingly. Although not a major problem, the Tri-Cities does have a homeless problem and it is not unusual to see one or two sleeping on one of the benches along the trail, I have no knowledge of any problems related to these people. Restrooms are available in Columbia Point Marina Park, Howard Amon Park, and Leslie Groves Park (there are no restrooms north of Snyder Street).
I will start the narrative from Columbia Point Marina Park and detail the entire trail. I will point out facilities close to the trail where you can get food, drinks, or points which may be of interest. Trail markings are few, however since the trail is continuous from one end to the other with the exception of one area where you have to travel on a residential street which has signs marking the bike route they are not a problem like on the Sacagawea Heritage Trail. As there are several hotels along the trail and a popular area for locals to walk it can be crowded for a cyclist so I will detail some of the detours you can take to miss the congestion if it is present
The Trail
Begin at Columbia Point Marina Park, there is plenty of parking here, unless they are using it for the annual boat show or one of the bass tournaments. The trial actually starts at the end of Columbia Point Drive at the river. The trail runs north along the river side of the park and continues towards the boat launch facility. There is a restroom next to the boat launch facility and on the other side of the boat ramp are three restaurants for those that are hungry, these art not fast food but middle to upper scale facilities. If you’re looking for something lighter or not so fancy you can head back up Columbia Point Drive to the shopping mall at George Washington Way. There are other food facilities just off the trail through central Richland. Most users bypass this short section of trail in the park and begin their trip on the western side of the boat ramp where the trail leaves the parking lot. Overall this section of trail is fairly wide and pedestrians and cyclist coexist with no problems, however, the first few feet of the path from the boat ramp is narrow and a curve so you need to take it easy until you get to the top of the incline and make the right turn.
This section of the trail has benches for resting or taking in the views. On your right is the piers associated with the boat launch facility and a little further the piers where boats are permanently moored. On you left will be two of the restaurants and two hotels followed by several waterfront condominiums. At the end of the second hotel the trail turns ninety degrees to the left and the corner is somewhat blind and you need to be careful here. After the last condominium you will come to the Bradley trailhead on your left with river views to your right and a vacant lot on your left. The pavement in this area is not broken or damaged but has several rises and falls which can be a little unsettling if not aware of them. At the end of the vacant lot the trail turns to the left and passes another hotel. The trail follows the shoreline of the river and after a short distance make a turn to the right, caution the foliage along the river makes this a blind corner so be prepared to be face to face with a pedestrian or another cyclist. A very short straight section and you make a turn to the right and then after a couple hundred feet another somewhat blind turn to the left as you pass another group of condominiums. After passing the last condominium you pass yet another hotel and the trail narrows somewhat while transiting this area, after passing the hotel the trail widens and you have now entered Howard Amon Park.
On the left will be the Richland Community Center with its parking lot. The park contains several covered pavilions with tables and other amenities for use by the public. As you reach Lee Boulevard on your right will be a pier at which you may find the paddle wheel Mississippi style riverboat which ply's the Columbia and Snake rivers from Lewiston, Idaho to Astoria, Oregon with a stop in Richland. Parking is available on Lee Boulevard and in a lot to the north of Lee Boulevard between the park and George Washington Way. There is a restroom facility on Lee Boulevard next tot he tennis courts. If you continue west on Lee Boulevard and cross George Washington Way the next street you come to is The Parkway which has several small restaurants, one of which is Frost Me Sweet Bakery and Deli which has been featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on the Food Network. Also you will find Greenies bicycle shop.
At this point the trail along the river narrows and it can become cumbersome to travel on a bike if there are pedestrians present, a usable detour is to travel up Lee Boulevard and turn right onto Amon Park Drive. If you plan on continuing on the trail next to the river skip to the next paragraph. As you travel through the parking lot on your left will be Northwest Paddleboarding where you can rent paddleboards and kayaks, take paddleboard lessons or a paddleboard tour. At the north end of the parking lot Amon Park Drive turns to the right and then back to the left to parallel the river and trail which are a short distance on your right while on your left will be another hotel. As you reach Newton Street on your left will be a restaurant and on your right will be a restroom facility. Continue on Amon Park Drive until you reach the parking lot at its end, the trail exits from the northwest corner of the lot and proceeds up onto a levee section of the trail.
For those who choose to continue on the trail from Lee Boulevard you will find benches and other amenities along the trail. There is a restroom adjacent to the small parking lot located at Newton Street. Proceed north until you reach the boat launch facility and turn right across the ramp and continue around the east side of the parking lot on the trail and continue up onto the levee section of the trail.
As you climb up onto the levee there is another hotel on your left, once on the top of the levee section of trail you will notice a path bearing to your left and back down the levee towards George Washington Way. At the bottom of the path on the left is a new building which houses a winery and Porter’s BBQ which has been featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. This section of the trail which is on the levee is one of my least favorite sections due to the buckling of the asphalt pavement. Somebody has painted lines around most of the bad spots but it is wearing off and either needs to be reapplied or repairs made to the trail. If the trail is crowded or you want to miss some of the bumps you can take the next path to the left down to Harris Avenue, turn right on Harris Avenue and parallel the levee north. The first street on your right will be River Road, turn onto River Road and once over the top of the levee turn left into the parking lot. If you stayed on the top of the levee when you reach River Road turn right before the vertical railroad tracks stuck in the ground. This is the beginning of Leslie Groves Park which has a unique path system ,which most users honor, the path closest to the river is for pedestrians while the path slightly inland is for cyclists. If on a bike turn left where the railroad track is missing and into the parking lot. Just ahead between the parking lot and the pedestrian section of the trail will be a restroom facility. Where Howard Amon Park was all grass like your lawn many areas of Leslie Groves Park are natural foliage. The cycle trail transitions from the parking lot to a trail at the north end of the parking lot, marked by two large boulders spaced wider apart than the rest of the smaller boulders. Both trails continue north within a few yards of each other and at times are separated by trees or other foliage. Eventually you will reach Newcomer Street which has a small parking lot for trail access. Continuing north you will reach the more developed portion of Leslie Groves Park, on your right you will find sand volleyball courts and a sandy beach which is used for swimming, CAUTION NO LIFEGUARD, SWIM AT YOUR OWN RISK. On your left will be the south end of the parking lot located at Park Street, near this area there are two pavilions with tables and a restroom facility.
Continuing north the trails continue on to Saint Street where there is a large parking lot. The pedestrian route continues north along the river where you will find tennis courts on your left along with another pavilion. Cyclists have a decision to make here as the trail between Saint Street and Snyder Street is rather rough from tree roots causing the pavement to buckle, if you decide to stay on the path cross the west end of the parking lot and continue on the path with the tennis courts on your right. If you decide to bypass this rough section jog slightly to your left and continue north on Harris Avenue. Harris Avenue has no businesses on it and is only residential so traffic is minimal or non-existent plus it is a fairly wide street. At Snyder Street turn to the right towards the river and pick up the trail on your left.
At Snyder Street the pedestrian and cycle trails merge back together and in the boat launch parking lot near the trail you will find the last restroom facility as you head north on the trail. The portion of the trail north of Snyder Street is designated as the North Leslie grove Natural Area and as such is covered in vegetation natural to the area. The trail continues north through this area until it turns to the left up a short incline onto Ferry Road for a short distance until you reach Harris Avenue. Turn right onto Harris avenue and continue north until you reach Sprout Road. Across Sprout Road will be Washing State University, Tri-Cities Campus, you will turn right on Sprout Road and at the end of the street pick up the trail which immediately turn left as you enter it and then down a short downhill followed by an equal uphill section with the river on your right and the university campus on your left.
Other than the landscaped areas of the university this section of the trail in a natural habitat and you can expect to see wildlife native to the area, this includes rabbits and the occasional snake. More than once between the university and USS TRITON Park I have been startled by a rabbit dashing across the path mere inches in front of my recumbent trike. After leaving the university campus behind you merge onto Waterfront drive for a short stretch until the path picks up on the right side as the pavement ends for Waterfront Drive, stay to the right of the line of boulders. After passing a picnic table on your right the path takes a mild bend to the left and appears to go straight with a branch going to the right. Turn right as the straight section ends in a very short distance. Go up the slight incline past a couple of roadside tables and find yourself approaching some riverfront homes. It has recently been announced that the area to your right and immediately west of these homes will be developed into a higher end luxury apartment complex.
After passing the last of these homes you will climb a short rise and approach a pavilion on your right which has a table. From this pavilion you will be able to overlook the Columbia River and the Port of Benton barge slip which services the Hanford Site (formally Hanford Nuclear Reservation). If you look off to the northwest from this location you can visually follow the trail and see the sail from USS TRITON at the top of the bluff. From this pavilion it is a short ride up the hill to finally arrive at USS TRITON park. USS TRITON park is a very small park with parking for ten cars and a space just slightly larger than the sail itself.
USS TRITON Park
USS TRITON was a first generation nuclear powered submarine of the US Navy (fourth hull design, eighth boat built) which during her short career made history by becoming the first submarine to circumnavigate the Earth while submerged. The course generally followed that of the first circumnavigation of the world led by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan from 1519 to 1522. TRITON was originally designed as a radar picket but quickly outdated with the US Navy’s acquisition of carrier based early warning radar aircraft. TRITON was commissioned on 10 November 1959 and decommissioned on 3 May 1969 when her design made her no longer viable as a fleet asset. She was towed from Norfolk Naval Shipyard (Portsmouth, Virginia) to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (Bremerton, Washington) in 1993 to await her turn in the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program. Triton began the recycling program in 2007 and completed the recycling in 2009.
The recycling process removes all hazardous material whether chemical, mineral, or nuclear and disposes/contains it while parts of the vessel such as steel which can be recycled is sent to the appropriate facility for reuse. The reactor is highly contaminated and during the recycling process it is removed and encapsulated in suitable containers for long term storage, these containers are then transported to the Hanford Site where they are placed in long term storage. During the recycling process the sail was removed as a single unit and placed on a barge and towed from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard out to the Pacific Ocean and up the Columbia River to the Port of Benton Barge slip where it was offloaded by the cranes you see and transported by the multiple-wheel high-capacity trailers you see adjacent to the park, up the hill to its present location where it was mounted to its current location. There is a sign on one side of the sail which instructs ou haw to arrange for a tour inside the sail if you desire to do so.
USS TRITON park commemorates not only USS TRITON but all of the nuclear powered ships and submarines who have undergone the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program whose reactors have been sealed during the recycling and placed on barges to take the same voyage as USS TRITON’s sail. Upon their arrival at the Hanford Site they were offloaded and transported to their burial location.
Return is a reversal of your north bound journey. I hope you enjoy this trail as much as I do, other than the bad areas of pavement this is a great trail. I ride thirteen miles to ride this trail and thirteen miles back home, the ride is worth it. trail..

Now, an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm developed by researchers at the College of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State could help predict susceptibility to substance use disorder among young homeless individuals, and suggest personalized rehabilitation programs for highly susceptible homeless youth.
“Proactive prevention of substance use disorder among homeless youth is much more desirable than reactive mitigation strategies such as medical treatments for the disorder and other related interventions," said Amulya Yadav, assistant professor of information sciences and technology and principal investigator on the project. “Unfortunately, most previous attempts at proactive prevention have been ad-hoc in their implementation.”
“To assist policymakers in devising effective programs and policies in a principled manner, it would be beneficial to develop AI and machine learning solutions which can automatically uncover a comprehensive set of factors associated with substance use disorder among homeless youth,” added Maryam Tabar, a doctoral student in informatics and lead author on the project paper that will be presented at the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) conference in late August.
In that project, the research team built the model using a dataset collected from approximately 1,400 homeless youth, ages 18 to 26, in six U.S. states. The dataset was collected by the Research, Education and Advocacy Co-Lab for Youth Stability and Thriving (REALYST), which includes Anamika Barman-Adhikari, assistant professor of social work at the University of Denver and co-author of the paper.
The researchers then identified environmental, psychological and behavioral factors associated with substance use disorder among them — such as criminal history, victimization experiences and mental health characteristics. They found that adverse childhood experiences and physical street victimization were more strongly associated with substance use disorder than other types of victimization  legalization, “So if a policy planner or interventionist were to develop programs that aim to reduce the prevalence of substance abuse disorder, this could provide useful guidelines.”
Other authors on the KDD paper include Dongwon Lee, associate professor, and Stephanie Winkler, doctoral student, both in the Penn State College of Information Sciences and Technology; and Heesoo Park of Sungkyunkwan University.
Yadav and Barman-Adhikari are collaborating on a similar project through which they have developed a software agent that designs personalized rehabilitation programs for homeless youth suffering from opioid addiction. Their simulation results show that the software agent — called CORTA (Comprehensive Opioid Response Tool Driven by Artificial Intelligence) — outperforms baselines by approximately 110% in minimizing the number of homeless youth suffering from opioid addiction.
“We wanted to understand what the causative issues are behind people developing opiate addiction,” said Yadav. “And then we wanted to assign these homeless youth to the appropriate rehabilitation program.”
Yadav explained that data collected by more than 1,400 homeless youth in the U.S. was used to build AI models to predict the likelihood of opioid addiction among this population. After examining issues that could be the underlying cause of opioid addiction — such as foster care history or exposure to street violence — CORTA solves novel optimization formulations to assign personalized rehabilitation programs.
“For example, if a person developed an opioid addiction because they were isolated or didn’t have a social circle, then perhaps as part of their rehabilitation program they should talk to a counselor,” explained Yadav. “On the other hand, if someone developed an addiction because they were depressed because they couldn’t find a job or pay their bills, then a career counselor should be a part of the rehabilitation plan.”
Yadav added, “If you just treat the condition medically, once they go back into the real world, since the causative issue still remains, they’re likely to relapse.”
Yadav and Barman-Adhikari will present their paper on CORTA, “Optimal and Non-Discriminative Rehabilitation Program Design for Opioid Addiction Among Homeless Youth,” at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence-Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-PRICAI), which was to be held in July 2020 but is being rescheduled due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Other collaborators on the CORTA project include Penn State doctoral students Roopali Singh (statistics), Nikolas Siapoutis (statistics) and Yu Liang (informatics).: Orchard Books/Scholastic

Shared.Well ... this cat is heading away for a week's vacation and I am not planning to do any blogging during that time.
Heading on vacation raises the issue that all managers, (and business owners), have when they are going to be away. How will my people react? There are various reactions that are possible. Will they self-regulate and be as productive as usual? Will they take the opportunity to "goof off" and relax a bit because the boss isn't around? Will they take the opportunity to demonstrate that they can be very productive, without the boss around?
My experience in all my years in business is that people typically take advantage of the situation to slack off a bit.
Obviously it would be fantastic if they were to just grab the opportunity and demonstrate their ability to be productive even when no-one is watching. The benefit that they get is a higher level of trust, and the likelihood that management will give even more autonomy, but that is rare.
It will be interesting to see how productive the company has been when we get back ... but for now I'm looking forward to sun, sand and relaxation! See you in a week!

Alan Jackson has been living with a degenerative nerve condition for a decade, the country star revealed on Tuesday (Sept. 28) in an interview with Today.
Jackson was diagnosed with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 10 years ago. The inherited disorder — also known as CMT, "ironically enough," the singer says, nodding to the country music-focused television channel and brand — causes nerve damage largely in the arms and legs, the Mayo Clinic explains, and can cause muscle contractions, a loss of sensation and difficulty walking. The Mayo Clinic notes that symptoms typically begin during adolescence or early adulthood, but can — as with Jackson, who was diagnosed in his early 50s — develop mid-life, too.
"There's no cure for it, but it's been affecting me for years. And it's getting more and more obvious," says Jackson. "And I know I'm stumbling around onstage. And now I'm having a little trouble balancing, even in front of the microphone, and so I just feel very uncomfortable."
CMT is not deadly, and it does not decrease the life expectancy of those who have it; in fact, Jackson shares that his grandmother, father and one of his sisters all inherited and lived with the disorder, too. However, there is no cure for the disease, and as interviewer Jenna Bush-Hager points out to her Today co-hosts at the end of her segment with Jackson, he doesn't need assistance to walk yet, "but he will."
Jackson tells Bush-Hager it's a "relief" to share the news of his condition after so many years, because he's been getting "self-conscious" about how he looks onstage. The news doesn't mean he's stepping out of the spotlight just yet, though.
"I never wanted to do the big retirement tour, like people do, then take a year off and then come back. I think that's kinda cheesy," Jackson says. "And I'm not saying I won't be able to tour. I'll try to do as much as I can."
Jackson released his newest album, Where Have You Gone, in May. His only remaining tour date for 2021 is an Oct. 8 stop at Nashville's Bridgestone Arena.

Wondering if your business needs ePub or PDF? Then, this article is for you. In one corner, we have the endlessly flexible eBook solution that has revolutionized how people consume their favorite books. In the other, the old school business document solution used by millions across the world to create, share, and store secure documents. We’ll cover the pros and cons of both so you can make a decision for yourself.
ePub vs. PDF—let’s settle this once and for all.
ePub or PDF? PDF or ePub? Now that digital libraries can fit in your front pocket, these two forms of digital publishing are at the forefront of the business world. But deciding which is best for you is tricky since they have so many key differences. If your business relies on digital documents (it should) or you are planning to publish just about anything, you need to consider this choice carefully.
Let’s get started.
ePub vs. PDF: What is the ePub format?
Before we get into talking about which one is better, we should probably cover what they actually are first.
E-Publishing (ePub)
E-publishing was developed with today’s modern mobile readers in mind. It is a flexible, reflowable, highly interactive XML format for digital publishing that works especially well for ebooks. Regardless of device or screen size, the reader can have a tailored experience that makes it easier than ever to enjoy that cheesy romance they know they shouldn’t be reading.
Of course, it isn’t just limited to books. It can be used for manuals or other digital documents (we’ll cover more on this later).
In case you’ve been living under a rock, the portable document format (PDF) is the world’s standard in digital documents. Originally created by Adobe in 1993, it has been the go-to for digital documents for people, businesses, and governments for the better part of 3 decades. Basically, it recreates a paper document in digital form which gives you increased security and flexibility.
ePub vs. PDF: Do they have anything in common?
Before we get to covering what sets them apart, we should cover what they have in common.
- Multi-Platform Access: Both types of digital publishing are available in many formats with a range of different readers. Flexibility won’t ever be an issue.
- Built-In Security Features: In the case of PDFs (especially Soda PDF!), passwords and other multi-layer security methods will have your important business docs under lock and key. For ePub, there are digital rights management (DRM) capabilities that protect your work from reproduction. Both methods are secure in their own right.
Key Differences
When it comes to ePub vs PDF, the major difference is the reading experience. The general consensus is that e-published books have the edge in readability.
PDFs are essentially digital printed documents. It’s like having a piece of paper in your hand, except it’s on the screen (this has many advantages though!). PDFs can be viewed exactly the same as the original format. For readers on small devices, this can be a challenge.
ePub was created with today’s mobile device readers in mind. This is due to “reflowability”.
Reflowable: A reflowable document is a digital doc that can adjust its presentation to the device. This is especially important when it comes to reading books on small screens.
If you were reading a PDF on a tablet, for example, you would have to constantly pinch, zoom and scroll horizontally. An ePub doc will automatically resize to fit the screen, including making the text “flow” around images. This function alone has made it the choice among ePublishers like Kindle and Nook.
Other Key Differences
- Editing: If you have a great PDF tool (like Soda PDF….), you have the ability to annotate, make highlights, and a lot of another neat features. This makes it GREAT for sharing documents between coworkers. ePub books are usually read only. However, that reading experiencing can be enriched more than PDF. Speaking of that…
- Rich Media: Although strides have been made with PDF 2.0, ePub is still superior in terms of rich media. Interactive media, video, hyperlinks, and more make for a far richer reading experience. Again, keep in mind that this does not include editing the text or making your own notes, though.
- eSign: Soda PDF and other PDF tools allow you to eSign documents to show ownership. You can even set passwords so that only people within a team or company have access to certain features. ePub doesn’t offer that same type of advantage.
- Popularity: This is hard to gauge but as it stands currently, there are far more PDFs and PDF services than ePub. This will provide far more flexibility when it matters most.
- Accessibility: A major drawback for PDF (that has been helped a bit by the 2.0 upgrade) is that the code is complex. This makes it difficult for developers to create better add-ons. Converting them to a web friendly format is also quite difficult. ePub on the other hand is written primarily in 2 languages, XML and XHTML. This makes it not only more accessible but more compatible with most types of software.
Verdict: ePub vs. PDF—who wins?
When it comes to the battle of these digital publishing formats, the winner is:
It depends.
It really comes down to what your personal or business needs are. E-publishing is definitely superior for books and other digital scripts that are meant to be read on tablets and other mobile devices. PDFs are superior for business documentation that is static, meant to be annotated, and needs to be signed/stored securely.If you are an automobile enthusiast, you have likely read various car reviews online, in newspapers, or magazines. Car reviews are informative since they provide a lot of information about a car. They also help you figure out the strengths and weaknesses of a car and help you decide if a particular vehicle is the best fit for you.
Car reviews are fun to read. But they can also be fun to write. You do not have to be a car guru to write a car review. All you need to have is:
- A laptop or computer,
- A car to review, and
- The passion for telling your readers about that car.
We at EssayZoo have concocted a list of tips on how you can write a good review on a car. Read on to discover how to review cars in an effective and informative manner.
Getting Ready to Write a Car Review
Step 1: Choose a Car that You Want to Review
First, you choose a vehicle that excites you. You do want to have a biased opinion about the vehicle. For example, if you dislike sports cars, you are not the best person to be reviewing an Alpine A110. Informative reviews come from individuals who appreciate the opportunity to drive the car.
Second, you should choose a car that you can get your hands on. It can be tempting to write a review of the newest BMW 325i. But, chances are it is almost impossible for you to get your hands on one. Instead, choose a car that is available at a local dealership or a car that a friend has.
Step 2: Read Various Auto Reviews
One of the most effective ways to learn how to write is by reading. The same principles apply to car reviews.
Before you write a car review, read a copy of Motor Trend. You can also access the digital version of Motor Trend online and read the reviews there. This will inspire and motivate you to write a stellar review.
When you finish writing your review, you can seek editing help from resume editing services. This will help you publish error-free and high-quality reviews.
Test Driving the Car
Step 1: Drive the Vehicle as Much as You Can
One of the underlying purposes of a car review is to let your readers know the driving experience of a car. You might only have the vehicle for several hours, which makes it difficult to give an informed perspective. Thereby, the best approach you can take is to drive the car as much as you can in different conditions and situations.
Automobile experts from yourmechanic.com recommend that you find an open road where you can test out the:
- Suspension,
- Brakes,
- Throttle, and
- Steering
Drive through the town to see how the car’s engine handles idling. The more experiences you have in the vehicle, the more precise your review will be.
Step 2: Explore as Many Features as you Possible
To get an accurate feel of the car, try out as many features as possible. Try out the safety sensors, navigation system, and backup camera. Use the sound system, adjust or recline the seats, and open the sunroof. The more you explore, the better your review will be.
Step 3: Ensure that you take Notes
When you are driving the vehicle, keep a notebook with you, and pull over various times to take notes.
You may be confident in your ability to remember significant details of the car. But, when you prepare to write later, you will likely have little to write about. Note down everything you like and dislike.
You can also hand over the notes to a “write my essay service in UK” and get professional help with writing the car review.
Drafting the Review
Step 1: Have an Objective Stance
You should always make your opinions known when drafting a review. But, never let your bias cloud the review. Rather, try to look at things in an objective manner.
At times, you might need to admit that your stance is not the same as the public’s stance. For instance, if a company has released a new version of a car, do not say that” the interior is too modern.” Instead, say that “the interior is too modern for my liking, but younger drivers will appreciate this feature.” Blend your subjective views with your readers’ objective truths, and you will have a stellar review.
Step 2: Talk about the Whole Vehicle
Experts from wikihow.com advise that you should cover the entire vehicle.
Do not focus only on the aspects of the car that you disliked or liked. The car review should cover the:
- Price,
- Mileage
- Aesthetic
- Performance
- Ergonomics
- Comfort
- Driving experience
Ensure that you cover all these aspects in your review so that your reader gets a full review of the vehicle.
Step 3: Use Actual Examples
Stating a bunch of facts is a recipe for a boring car review. This is because your reader will have a difficult time applying those facts to reality.
To prevent this from occurring, use real-life examples to give context to parts of the car. For instance, instead of stating, “The cabin was silent,” you could state that “The cabin was so quiet that I was able to talk to my passenger without having to raise my voice.”
Step 4: Enjoy
Readers can always tell whether a writer had fun with cars model writing. Even if you are not impressed with the car you were reviewing, you can still have fun when writing the review.
Ensure that you enjoy the writing process, and the reading process will be enjoyable to your readers.
Final Word
Whether you are embarking on the review journey or you are an established pro, these tips will help you draft a stellar review. If you follow these tips, writing a killer review will be an easy task, and you will be eager to get your hands on another car to review../Asians4Asians-56a229c73df78cf77272bf89.png)

1+1=2
If we have a look at a very basic equation like this, sure, we already know that it is correct! Right? At least I hope so! But how did you do it? How can you make sure? Are you relating to past experiences? Can you show me the mathematical proof? It sounds funny to think about it, but people in general always want some kind of a proof. It’s just inside of us, right? Someone claims something and we, we are skeptical at the beginning! Very skeptical! But once we have some proof, well, we feel much more comfortable with looking into the subject differently. If we are really honest, for mathematical equations, we just take a calculator. We type in the numbers and see what we get! Right? Right! And do we check those numbers? Well, we can type it in a second time if you mean that, but otherwise, well, not really!
Discipline works like math. There are rules, for sure! There is proof! Lots of proof! But at the end of the day we do not have the time to look at the equation and find the solution by ourselves. We may just need a kind of a calculator that is just doing the magic for us. Without thinking, without double checking, without any effort.
Discipline is on the one hand this very basic thing we all pretend to have understood a long, long time ago, but on the other hand something not many people seem to really use.
The thing about discipline is that you do not need to know how it works as long as you are using it. Some people might wonder how it is possible to write a daily blog in between doing all those other things in our lives. They wonder how it is possible to really sit there every single day. The answer? Well, it is as easy as solving mathematical equations. You just need to add the right input in order to get the output you want. As easy as that!
I can write my blog every single day, because I have mastered the topic of discipline. In fact, I have defeated it a long, long time ago. But so can you! Is discipline really as easy as that? Just the logical consequence out of your doing? In fact, yes it is!
But you do not believe me, right? You expect some proof! Lucky me, that you have collected so much data in your past already. If you want to proof my statement, just look into your past life. Pick whatever moment you want and start to think about reasons why you failed doing something for longer than a view weeks. Maybe you have started to go to the gym, or your daily meditation session, or whatever it is. Just try to get back to those moments. And well, after that, take situations where you have pushed through until the very end. The search for your new car, the way you have conquered your partner, or got this position you always wanted. Look at your behavior in those moments and tell me the difference! You will see, the input was differently.
Your past experience taught you that 1+1=2, but it also taught you that 1+0= not 2!
The secret to being disciplined? Well, you already have it inside of you. You just need to learn how to use it more often! Discipline is always there for you if you want it to be there. But sure, if you do not want to, it will not get off the couch, watching you stumbling through life.
Every single day you wake up, there is another chance for you to change your life forever. Why don’t you change it today? It is that easy! You just need to start!
See you next time!Dear Professor Winston
My husband and I have been trying to conceive for 5 1/2 yrs and have completed 3 fresh and 1 frozen embryo transfers. The first attempt resulted in a pregnancy which miscarried at roughly week 7. The further 3 attempts resulted in negative pregnancy tests. I have had a hysteroscopy and laparoscopy both I was told were clear of any problems. My husband has a low sperm count with a diagnosis of oligospermia and recommendation of ICSI which we have done on all 4 attempts. A report of my womb area from August 2011 showed an anteverted small uterus with an arcuate shape appears normal in echo texture and measures 66x42x28mm. The endometrium appears regular in outline and texture and measures 4.2mm, type D. Both ovaries are accessible. The right ovary is normal in size measure 26x25x17mm =5.9ccs and contained a 10mm follicle and 5 natural follicles. The left ovary is small, measure 23x21x17mm =4.3 ccs and contained 4 natural follicles. No obvious ad exam cysts, masses or pelvic free fluid seen. This is concluded as : small uterus and left ovary. After the 3rd attempt, I had a cervix stretch and mock ET as I had difficulty and pain with the implantation. I have the result pages for my husbands sperm analysis but there are so many numbers I really wouldnt know where to start. My question is this after 4 non pregnancy cycles the NHS have stopped funding us. In order for us to try again we will need to pay for it. We are looking around £7000 for this depending on where we go and what services we opt for. In your professional opinion, and I understand its difficult with having never met, would you advise us to give up? Or is there still a chance for us with private care? I’ve heard about embryo glue and womb scratching, this is not something we were offered on the NHS and it does sound wonderful but maybe we are being convinced about this method in an attempt to get us to spend more money with them. Any help you can suggest would be incredibly valuable. Many thanks K.
Dear K,
Sadly, nothing in IVF treatment is quite as wonderful as it may sound. The idea of causing a minor injury to the uterine lining came from some good scientists working at Weizmann Institute in Israel and they tried the idea out successfully afterwards in the local hospital in Rehovot. They found that this did improve the chances of implantation in the cycle immediately after the injury, and just possibly in the one after that. There are theoretical reasons why it may improve chances a bit but it doesn’t make a ‘wonderful’ massive difference. As for ‘glue’, the embryo does not need glue to attach itself to the uterus and it is highly probable that attachment is due to the embryo and its function rather than anything in the uterine cavity. Any ‘glue’ is likely to be a complex genetic message sent by a normal embryo to the uterus – that is to say, it is possible that a viable embryo is in control of its own implantation. So added substances are a very simplistic and unlikely solution. Incidentally, I greatly approve of the mock ET you had; this is a really useful way for the doctors on the unit to get some feel for how your uterine cavity is. Did they use ultrasound, too, during the transfer to ensure the catheter was in the right place?
As it turns out, many embryo transfer do themselves turn into a minor injury to the lining but it isn’t absolutely clear whether this is beneficial although there have been a surprising number of reports of people getting spontaneously pregnant soon after a failed IVF cycle.
One thing that occurs to me from your email is the finding of an ‘arcuate’ uterus which is reported as ‘small’. Was this done merely on ultrasound? Or was it diagnosed at hysteroscopy? Occasionally the finding of an ‘arcuate’ uterus can be significant and I always used ensure that a hysterosalpingogram was done in such circumstances with a tiny amount of die placed in the uterus. If there really is a marked change in contour, this argues a congenital abnormality which just may be significant and can be corrected before another IVF cycle.
An answer to those questions might be helpful, and an HSG useful if you haven’t had one – it’s a lot cheaper than a failed IVF cycle.
Best wishes

Turning Microsoft Word documents into audio playlists using Amazon Polly
Listening to your Microsoft Word documents as audio is a great way to save time or to be productive on a long commute. You can easily convert an entire block of text into MP3 format with Amazon Polly. But you can vastly improve your listening experience with just a few simple steps.
In this blog post, I show how you can use a serverless workflow to convert your word documents into MP3 playlists using AWS Lambda and Amazon Polly.
To review a Word document that I needed to listen to, I converted the whole document to one block of text, then converted it to MP3 using Amazon Polly. After listening, I realized that a long, single-voice MP3 file results in a monotonous stream of audio.
Next, I split the document into small parts and processed each part with a different voice and cadence. This process added audio cues to keep me engaged while listening. I came up with the following serverless architecture that takes in a Microsoft Word document and generates MP3 files and an ordered M3U playlist file. I can download my list and listen to the Word document as an audio playlist anywhere!
Solution overview
The following diagram shows the architecture of this solution.
The following steps generate the MP3 files and playlist:
- Upload the Word document to the Project bucket at /src.
- On upload, a PUT object event triggers the Word to SSML AWS Lambda function.
- The Lambda function splits the document into multiple SSML files, assigns a VoiceId tag to each file, and saves them to the project bucket at /ssml.
- Several PUT object events in the /ssml key trigger the Amazon Polly SSML to MP3 Lambda function, which starts an Amazon Polly task to convert the SSML document into an MP3 file. The Amazon Polly task then saves the MP3 file in Amazon S3 and the file metadata to the Mp3 metadata table in Amazon DynamoDB.
- After Amazon Polly completes its tasks, invoke the m3u builder Lambda function to generate the m3u playlist file and save it to the Project bucket.
The following table shows the solution components and describes how they are used.
Building the Word to SSML Lambda function
I used Apache POI to read the Word document and split it into several small SSML files. I provide an extensible implementation that works for any three-level document that contains a set of sections, each containing a set of topics, and each of those topics containing a set of paragraphs.
I used the public Amazon Polly FAQs as an example document, which uses categories of the FAQ (for example, general, billing, data privacy) as the sections. Those sections divide into individual questions for the topics, and into individual answers for the paragraphs.
This same model generally applies to any three-level document: The user supplies a way to identify sections and topics. The default implementation extracts the sections from text with the Heading 1 Word style and identifies topics by recognizing the question mark character in the sentence.
Prerequisites
You need a few tools to follow the steps in this post:
- OpenJDK 8 and Apache Maven 3.5: The Word to SSML Lambda function uses the Java 8 runtime and uses Apache Maven for packaging. Install OpenJDK version 8 or higher and Maven version 3.5 or higher. I tested this solution with Maven version 3.5.0 and OpenJDK Runtime Environment Corretto-8.202.08.2.
- AWS Command Line Interface: Some of the instructions assume that you have a working AWS CLI version to execute the test steps.
- S3 bucket: Lambda functions can only use artifacts from an S3 bucket in the Region in which you choose to deploy your solution. Choose a bucket to reuse, or create a bucket by running the following command:
Deployment steps
Follow these steps to deploy your tool.
- Clone the GitHub repository for the project.
- Export the AWS Region, project S3 bucket, and AWS CloudFormation stack name as environment variables for convenience.
- Change to the project directory and execute the
deploy_lambda_cloudformation.shscript to provide your chosen AWS Region, S3 bucket, and name for your CloudFormation stack. This script performs the following actions:
- Packages the three Lambda functions and copies it to your S3 bucket.
- Copies the CloudFormation template to your S3 bucket.
- Deploys the stack with the chosen name.
- Waits until the Lambda function successfully creates the stack. This should take approximately two minutes.
- Updates the bucket notifications template (scripts/bucket_lambda_notification.json) with values from the stack output.
- Adds event notifications to the S3 bucket.
- [Optional] After the script executes, in the AWS CloudFormation console, verify that the stack deployed and is in CREATE_COMPLETE status.
- In the S3 console, verify that the bucket contains your event notifications. The first notification, on the
polly-faq-reader/src/path, invokes the Word to SSML Lambda function when a new DOCX file uploads to this path. This Lambda function generates several SSML text files and uploads them to the
polly-faq-reader/ssml/A notification set up on this path then invokes the Amazon Polly SSML to MP3 Lambda function. The following screenshot shows sample events.
- Now you’re ready to test the MP3 conversion. Copy the demo/src/polly-faq.docx to the Project bucket at polly-faq-reader/src/. This triggers the Lambda functions to generate SSML and MP3 files.
- List the polly-faq-reader/ prefix in the S3 bucket and verify that it generates new SSML and MP3 directories.
- Wait about two minutes for the Amazon Polly tasks to complete. To verify when MP3 conversion completes, you can verify that the number of files in the /ssml directory matches the number of /mp3 files.
- The tool builds an M3U playlist file to play all the generated MP3 files in the correct order. In your terminal, in the scripts directory, execute the
invoke_m3u_builder.shscript providing your Region, bucket name, and name of your AWS CloudFormation stack.
- Verify that a new polly-faq.m3u file is present in the S3 bucket at polly-faq-reader/mp3/.
- Download the mp3 files and m3u playlist to your computer.
- Open the m3u playlist file in your preferred media player and listen to the files.
Clean up
To clean up the deployment and avoid incurring future costs, follow these steps:
- In the S3 console, select your bucket and delete the two event notifications.
- In the AWS CloudFormation console, and delete the polly-stack.
- If you no longer need the SSML or MP3 files, delete them. Run the following commands:
Conclusion
In this post, I demonstrated a serverless workflow to convert Microsoft Word documents into an MP3 audio playlist using Amazon Polly and AWS Lambda.

I am known to serve up a fancy cheese board at gatherings because they look so beautiful with the eclectic ingredients arranged harmoniously and SUPER easy. Although I can (and have!) eaten cheese as a meal, I wanted to jazz up my normal offerings and cook a full meal versus just a plethora of snacks. Enter the roast chicken and vegetable grazing board.
This board is an impressive and a unique way to serve up the main course and side dishes at a casual dinner or even for Thanksgiving. A succulent roast chicken paired with all your favorite vegetable sides and jewel like fruits nestled next to each other, it’s a feast for the eyes and belly.
MAKING YOUR BOARD
Figuring out how to arrange your spread is a fun, delicious puzzle for any board. I pick the larger or circular ingredients on the board first and work around them. I spread the, out along the board to break up the larger pieces. In this case, I adD the sliced chicken and chicken thighs first. Because they are evenly distributed, everyone can reach a piece of chicken no matter where they sit at the table. Then I add the hasselback potatoes followed by the carrots. Next come the looser roasted veggies such as Brussels sprouts and roasted squash. Taking chopped fruit like figs and persimmons, I fill in the holes along the board. And finally for some aromatics and flourish, I tuck in fresh herbs like sage and rosemary sporadically. It created one beautiful spread that is worthy of being painted!
THE MENU
The menu for this particular roast chicken and vegetable grazing board is:
- -za’atar & thyme roasted whole chicken, sliced
- garlic and herb hasselback potatoes
- roasted carrots with za’atar topped with goat cheese, tahini sauce and pomegranate seeds
- honey roasted brussels sprouts
- roasted butternut squash
- fresh figs, persimmons & pomegranates
- rosemary & sage for aromatics
Served up with the Harvest Honey Moon cocktail with Hangar 1 Honeycomb Vodka, this is a meal worth remembering! Are you inspired to whip up your own version of this roast chicken and vegetable grazing board for your next party or gathering?Our very own Wes, was picked as a Rising Star and will be speaking about his rise to “fame” on the latest SA Rising Stars KLUP Newstalk Radio segment!

Circumstances change in family law matters and the parties often find themselves in a situation where they need to reopen their prior divorce or custody case as a result. The need to modify a prior child support order or custody arrangement comes up frequently in family law cases. When there is a substantial change in circumstances, the parties have a right to petition the court to modify the prior custody agreement, child support order or visitation schedule. But what usually happens is that the parties enter into an informal, unenforceable arrangement that causes more problems than it solves.
The courts will not modify these agreements for any reason, however. It must be substantial and significant. Contact our office to see if your change in circumstances warrants a modification of your prior court order. The Kirlew Law Firm are experienced Miami family law modification attorneys and can help you decide whether you need your prior agreement or court order modified
Common Reasons to Modify a Prior Order or Custody Agreement?
There are several reasons why people may seek to modify a divorce decree or a custody order. It could be for reasons of child support, visitation, overnight timesharing, education or medical issues, financial or otherwise. These are what we call significant life events that are a substantial change in circumstances and warrant a modification of the prior agreement or court order. Some of these changes in circumstances may include:
- Losing a job;
- Making more money;
- Making less money
- Serious injury or illness;
- Mental or physical disability;
- Relocation of one or both of the parties;
- The child becoming emancipated;
- Remarriage;
- The child’s behavior or educational needs change.
If you have experienced any of the above or something similar that you think might qualify as a change in circumstance warranting a modification, contact our offices and we will discuss your options with you.
Can I challenge a Modification request?
Absolutely. Every modification request must either be done via motion if the case is still open, or a supplemental petition if the case is now closed. In either circumstance, the other party retains the right to challenge and contest the modification request being sought by their ex-spouse or the other parent of their child. Courts grant modifications when they are in the best interest of the child. But the unilateral decision of one party to do something that changes the circumstances of the other party or the minor child is not in of itself a reason to change the prior agreement or custody order. That is why it’s important to have an experienced lawyer review the modification request and advise you on your legal rights and how to successfully challenge the modification request.Coronary heart disease is not a modern ailment, said researchers who after scanning more than 50 Egyptian mummies concluded atherosclerosis was commonplace in these preserved ancient bodies.
These were the conclusions of a study presented in New Orleans on Sunday at the annual scientific session of the American College of Cardiology (ACC). A report of it also appears in this week’s online issue of Journal of the American College of Cardiology Imaging.
Senior and corresponding author, Dr Gregory S. Thomas, a clinical and research cardiologist at Mission Internal Medical Group, Mission Viejo, California, and professor and director of Nuclear Cardiology Education, University of California, Irvine, said in a statement reported by HealthDay News that the discovery shows we may not be so different from our ancient ancestors as we thought.
Coronary heart disease (CHD), also called coronary artery disease, is a narrowing of the small blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. It is commonly caused by atherosclerosis, a disease where plaque builds up inside arteries, making it harder for oxygen-rich blood to get to the heart and other parts of the body.
The plaque that furs up the inside of the artery wall is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium and other chemicals in the blood. Over time, as it hardens and narrows the artery, it can lead to serious problems, such as heart attack, stroke, and even death.
For years, we have assumed atherolsclerosis is a modern problem, due to our fast-food diet, sedentary lifestyle, and other environmental risk factors associated with the developed world.
But it would appear that ancient Egyptians also had this ailment, and they weren’t exactly sedentary.
For the study, on several visits to Egypt, Thomas and colleagues performed whole body CT (computed tomography) scans of 52 ancient Egyptian mummies, including one of an Egyptian princess that lived over 3,500 years ago, between 1580 and 1550 BC, and other mummies from the Middle Kingdom to the Greco-Roman period.
On the CT scans they looked for cardiovascular structures and signs of arterial calcifications. To ensure reliable results, the images were interpreted by getting 7 physician to agree on the readings. They also collected demographic data from historical and museum records and estimated age at time of death “from the computed tomography skeletal evaluation”.
The results showed that:
- 44 of the 52 mummies had identifiable cardiovascular structures, and of these, 20 had either definite (12 subjects) or probable (8 subjects) atherosclerosis (definite meant they could see the artery and its calcification evidence, probable meant they could see calcifications where they expected an artery to be).
- Calicifications were present in a number of arteries throughout the bodies: including the aorta, the coronary, carotid, liac, femoral and peripheral leg arteries.
- The 20 mummies with definite or probable atherosclerosis were on average older at time of death (average age 45.1 years give or take 9.2 years) than the mummies where they could see the cardiovascular structures but not signs of atherosclerosis (average age 34.5 years give or take 11.8 years).
- Two mummies showed signs of “arterial atherosclerosis with calcifications in virtually every arterial bed”.
- The princess was one of two mummies that showed signs of definite coronary atherosclerosis.
The researchers said this study is the earliest documented evidence of coronary atherosclerosis in a human, and shows definite or probably atherosclerosis existed in mummies who lived in ancient eras covering a time span of more than 2,000 years.
“Atherosclerosis is commonplace in mummified ancient Egyptians,” they concluded.
While the CT scans did not enable them to establish the cause of death, the researchers noted that ancient Egyptian scrolls do describe symptoms similar to cardiac chest pain.

Written by: Catharine Paddock, PhDJustice Antonin Scalia may have gone on to his reward, but his judicial philosophy has only become more powerful here in the mortal realm. Don’t believe me? President Obama — of all people — appears to have endorsed Justice Scalia’s judicial philosophy of original intent for interpreting the U.S. Constitution. Just yesterday . . .
he stunned this political observer by referring to the “clear,” plain language and original intent behind the wording in the U.S. Constitution. Mark Landler and Jennifer Steinhauer, reporting for the New York Times on Tuesday, had the story:
“The Constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now,” Mr. Obama said during a news conference after a meeting in California with…[Southeast Asian] leaders. He said that the Constitution demanded that a president nominate someone for the court and that the Senate either confirms or rejects. “There’s no unwritten law that says it can only be done on off years,” Mr. Obama said. “That’s not in the constitutional text.”
I, for one, welcome President Obama to this brave new world (for him, anyway) of Constitutional interpretation, and applaud the philosophical growth and maturity that he is showing. By adopting the philosophy that the original intent behind the plain language of the Constitution is of utmost importance in deciding the meaning of those words, he has put himself squarely along side the late Justice Scalia, along with Justice Clarence Thomas.
He has taken the first step into a wider world, and (one can only hope) soon see the logical beauty of the judicial analysis behind such recent court decisions as D.C. v. Heller, in which the majority opinion authored by the late Justice Scalia relied on an originalist interpretation of the plain text of the Constitution to hold that the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protected an individual right to keep and bear arms.
At the time, the President indicated that he disagreed with the decision, but I am confident that his own intellectual integrity will lead him to endorse the decision, for consistency’s sake.
It will also be interesting to see what kinds of nominees the president will come up with to fill the new vacancy on the court. I am sure that the Federalist Society can promulgate a list of hard-hitting legal minds that follow the originalism (or possibly just pure textualism) that Obama has now endorsed.
Or: perhaps the President is just an intellectual fraud and unprincipled Nixon-style politician who latches on to whatever argument his speechwriters throw at him to justify whatever increases his own political power.
I’m sure it’s one of those two options.
Why do I feel as tho I’m bent over a desk with a hand on each shoulder and my pants around my ankles?
You’ve been there for a while. The anesthetic is just wearing off.
😉
The nitwit-in-charge had no problem with filibustering Samuel Alito. Sure, now he says “sorry about that.” So I guess that it would be okay for the Republicans to filibuster Jughead’s nominee, as long as they apologize nine years later. Fair is fair.
The NY Slime approved of filibustering Alito. But it seems that their thinking has turned 180 degrees since they embarrassed themselves back then. I guess it depends on whose ox is gored.
POTUS and the Slime — their hypocrisy knows no limits. Unfortunately, the stupidity of the average American also knows no limits.
I wish Mcconell had a sense of humor; “Future me is very sorry he opposed you until the end of your term” would be a hilarious rejoinder.
Future McConnell would have to have much larger cojones than present McConnell..rom a Washington post article
Except that Obama has stated that he will not make a recess appointment, but will wait until the Senate returns from its current recess.
“Except that Obama has stated that he will not make a recess appointment, but will wait until the Senate returns from its current recess.”
Well, Obama has also said:
“If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor”
And –
“If you like your (health insurance) plan, you can keep your plan.”
Fool me once, etc.
@Mark N., Obama will not make a recess appointment because he wants to be able to disparage Republicans as racist when he makes a minority appointment, which he certainly will. Grist for the campaign, as it were. Were Obama to make a recess appointment, there would not be an up or down vote until that piece of garbage is out of the WH.
It doesn’t matter what Barry says or does regarding this . Our elected representatives must avoid , at all cost , letting A. C. be replaced by a progressive .
Here is the link to the article.
Lots of good stuff from Volokh Conspiracy on this, including a flashback to Senate Democrats passing a resolution against election year Supreme Court recess appointments.
The brouhaha instigated by the Republican presidential candidates is just a tempest in a tea pot. Obama has the right and duty to nominate a replacement for Scalia. Then it is up to the Senate to affirm or deny. There is no good reason to leave the court without nine justices for more than a year while a new president is elected, makes a nomination, and what has become a months long gauntlet of a confirmation process to take place.
I do not recall all the names I saw as the possible “short list” of nominations to the Court. Two are justices of the D.C. Circuit (an often tapped source of nominees), one of whom is from India by birth and has a very respectable resume. Two others (start your whining now) are Loretta Lynch and (believe it or not) former AG Eric Holder (who has no chance of ever being confirmed after the contempt citation and the Fast and Furious Fiasco). And the last was Jeh Johnson, who has a very interesting resume aside from his current stint.
Obama, acting in his capacity as President, has the *power* to appoint a Justice. It’s not a right.
There is nothing sacred about the number of Justices on the Bench. The count has been changed many times by an Act of Congress over the years.
If the President decided that he was going to do nothing but appoint unqualified cronies to the Judiciary, why would it be wrong for the Senate to block those appointments, even if it left the Supreme Court with “only” eight justices? Or seven? Or five? The Court would continue to function, and cases would continue to be adjudicated. There’s a procedure for handling 4-4 splits. It’s not like the Supreme Court handles hundreds of cases in a day, ala Harry Stone’s Night Court.
The tempest in the teacup is the idea that doing without a ninth justice until 2017 would somehow damage the judiciary or the country. It would not.
“There is nothing sacred about the number of Justices on the Bench. The count has been changed many times by an Act of Congress over the years.”
So, a President can be elected, and if his (or her) party has solid control of the lower and upper House, he can have the bench expanded to (whatever convenient number of) justices, then nominate who he wants and have his party confirm and swear them in?
Nice way to pack a court. What happens when the other party gets control and decides to shrink the court, who fires the excess justices? Or just wait for them to retire or croak?
No one. That’s why Roosevelt’s court packing scheme was so extreme. The only possible option would be impeachment, but that’s very difficult, and what would be the justification?
Sedition.
If we reduced the court to 7, then assumed the logical concepts of seniority, wouldn’t that say goodbye to Sotomayor? Wasn’t she the most recent? Sounds good to me.
There is no conceptual difference between a right and a power in this context. No, there is nothing “sacred” as to the number of justices, but the number has always been an odd number to avoid ties, and the fact of the matter is that a tie is a waste of a very limited judicial resources. I never suggested that it would be “wrong” for the Senate to block appointments, or more realistically, simply vote down any nomination of an unqualified candidate, so don’t put words in my mouth.I don’t know what “procedure” there is to handle ties; it is my understanding that a tie is an affirmance of the Circuit Court decision. And despite the small number of cases, the work load is tremendous, and the issues important that they address. The more minds the better.
In the final analysis, you evade my point, that there is no good reason to delay a Supreme Court nomination and confirmation process for a year and a half simply because there is an upcoming election; in fact, I don’t believe any President has failed to do so in similar circumstances. Just because he is a Democrat and you would prefer that a Republican do the nominating is not a valid reason. And it may turn out, to our chagrin, that it would be an avowed progressive socialist doing the appointing.
“There is no conceptual difference between a right and a power in this context.”
From a layman’s perspective only. The Constitution, however, defines the “powers” that the People have delegated to the federal government generally, and the President in particular. It does not describe any “rights” of the President or any other officeholder beyond which they would possess along with the rest of the citizenry.
“a tie is a waste of a very limited judicial resources.”
I’m not sure what resources are wasted — the tie is treated as an affirmation of the lower court, but not as binding precedent. The case at bar is adjudicated one way or another. I suppose you may mean there’s a potential waste of resources from the issue at hand winding its way back up to the Court in some future litigation — In which case yes, that might be true. Of course, that’s also true of a lot of federal courts, many of which have pressed Senior (semi-retired) Judges into service to help alleviate backlogs.
“The more minds the better.”
Yes and no. It would mean a bit more work for the clerks and the Justices. I’m not sure if more minds are always better — sometimes too many cooks spoil the soup.
“there is no good reason to delay a Supreme Court nomination and confirmation process for a year and a half ”
Well, no, there are potentially some very good reasons for doing so. If the President appoints a Justice who appears to be determined to use her powers and influence while in office to usurp the civil liberties of the people, there is a very good reason for the Senate to simply sit on its hands and run out the clock on the Administration.
“And it may turn out, to our chagrin, that it would be an avowed progressive socialist doing the appointing.”
Maybe. Or maybe not. Depends what kind of people the avowed socialist will try to appoint, and whether they’d be more or less inclined to respect our civil liberties. (Probably not. On the other hand, an open and honest “socialist” might have slightly more integrity than the current officeholder.)
The upshot of all this is that we don’t know if there’s a good reason to try to block Obama’s nominee yet. We won’t know until we actually nominates someone. But given the performance of nominees from Obama and other Democratic presidents in the past (such as the amoral pragmatist Breyer, who appears to want to expand federal power at the expense of civil liberties wherever he can,) I’d say that there’s considerable reason for all of us to be ready to try to do so.
Update to my previous post: tie cases may actually be reargued after confirmation, per SCOTUSBlog:
Jan 20, 2017 is not a year and a half, over a year, or any of the other references in this thread. Is there a rule that a new president has to wait 6 months after inauguration before nominating a SC justice? Cuz I haven’t heard of that. Schumer was demanding that W not be allowed to nominate a SC justice in July, 2007, which WAS a year and a half, but he has forgotten that, now, or maybe it was different.
“The upshot of all this is that we don’t know if there’s a good reason to try to block Obama’s nominee yet.”
And we won’t. Osama uses the power of government to hide the truth from us, and nominates justices who lie about their positions to the Senate. We need to not allow any nomination he makes. If America wants to elect Hilarity because of that, she can nominate whoever she likes, but the current POS should be done.
Thank you Mr. Paulsen , I could have never put it so eloquently as you have here .
Please , everyone , read this again .
100 % correct .
Very important to understand and spread the knowledge .
“There is no good reason to leave the court without nine justices for more than a year while a new president is elected, makes a nomination, and what has become a months long gauntlet of a confirmation process to take place.”
No good reason? Keep another “living constitution” liberal that hates guns and will do away with Heller the first chance they get isn’t a “good reason”?
Of course there is a good reason to delay, to give the new POTUS the choice of nominees for SCOTUS.
This presidential election is referendum on the will of the people. The tradition is clear, and anyone who believes the SCOTUS will suffer for waiting 8 months hasn’t been paying attention.
Naturally some lawyers will squawk because nothing happens on some cases until the situation clears up.
The idea that federal court judges, district and SCOTUS is not politicized is either incredibly naive or simply propagandizing for the Left.
U.S. Constitution, Article II, Section II:
No procedure is specified. All it says is “by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate”. If the Senate says the nominee will never make it past the committee vote so we won’t waste anyone’s time, then they’ve Advised and have not Consented. If Obama miraculously sent someone over acceptable to the Senate majority, then there might be a discussion worth having. Otherwise, the Senate doesn’t owe the President anything very specific, Constitutionally speaking.
Exactly: no where in the constitution does it require that they consent; and there are many ways in which the Senate can choose not to consent to a given candidate; they can do a simple up or down vote, but they could also kill it in committee or filibuster it until time runs out. I would have preferred that they had given specific candidates (preferably universally strict constitutionalists) as advice, rather than a blanket statement that they would not consent to any, but, that is not the tact they chose; that is their prerogative.
The Constitution says “Advice and Consent”. It does not say “Go pout in the corner”. By vowing not to consider ANY nominee, the Republican leadership is refusing to fulfill their constitutional duty, which is treasonous.
The Constitution says “Advice and Consent”. It does not say “Go pout in the corner”. By vowing not to consider ANY nominee, the Republican leadership is refusing to fulfill their constitutional duty, which is treasonous.”
“Treason “is a strong word. You are incorrect. The histrionics aren’t helpful. The law as it stands is…
As affirmed by a Supreme Court decision during this administration, the Senate’s protocols and procedures are their own to determine. Just as the Senate is in session when it says it is, the Senate discharges its authority to “advise and consent” as it says it will. (The Senate also can decide to overturn it’s own long standing conventions and precedents, as for example, when Majority Leader Harry Read decided that there would be no more filibusters of federal judicial appointments. As Leader he was quite adept at using any maneuver available to amplify on: “Shut up,” he explained.)
There is no requirement that the Senate take up a nomination timed for the convenience of a particular president, party or election. Sometimes one politician or another is annoyed at the timing. All this has happened before, and all this will happen again.
As also affirmed by the Supreme Court during this administration, when the court several times determined that legislative matters should reside with the legislature, for example declining to overturn the Affordable Care Act on grounds that if people object, the remedy is the political process.
This court, and indeed the originators of the constitution, if you would read, for example, The Federalist Papers, throw such contentious issues to political resolution, repeatedly. The current administration, with it’s electioneering skill (“I won.”), will make great amounts of hay off this event. The Stupid Party will likely wrap themselves around the axle any number of ways.
As the current president infamously said (which might help explain the limitations on cooperative governance under his administration): “I won.” Well, they won. Several times. So they get to do what they get to do.
One could suggest that if the current president wants a nominee to go through, he might 1) try to choose someone acceptable to most of the Senate and 2) maybe don’t start the discussion with the public name calling. In the end, he wants the issue. You, yourself, aren’t helping the process, falling for this.
For myself, I would prefer that issues of the scope and authority of the federal government be themselves resolved in a political process. I’m not a fan of the executive declaring “We can do this, too.” then it winding up in court. Thus, I have clear preferences in the kind of justices I would prefer to see on the court. And my preferences in this align not at all with the current president’s.
In this sense Scalia was far more “originalist” than “conservative.” Indeed, like Roberts, he p-o-ed the “conservatives” more than once via his relatively consistent philosophy of law, in both cased pretty limited.
Indeed, this president is in the position of being able to build a legacy of his choosing, through any attempted appointment, while himself being out of reach of the consequences of any political process. The legacy this president is building in his approach to this issue so far, is, well, consistent.
I doubt the ANY is entirely accurate. Which renders the “treasonous” not entirely accurate, either. I do think Obama should try calling the Republicans on their obstinate stance, by nominating Ted Cruz…
Osama should name Cruz AG. Somebody should, anyhow.
“…refusing to fulfill their constitutional duty, which is treasonous.”
Really? That’s what you got? What’s next: “racist, homophobes?”
The bald truth is, the solution here is political – get a different bunch of people elected, and / or inflict consequences on folks who don’t do what you’d prefer. Mr. Paul is doing exactly the latter, as the “treasonous” and related name calling is simply attempting to inflict a political cost on people he doesn’t agree with policy-wise. Good for him, but let’s call it what it is.
Megan McArdle has a useful take on judicial appointments in her most recent column. Judicial appointments have become so fraught because they have become “policy by other means.”
My proposal for anti-gun folks in the US is the same: use the political process. If you don’t like what you are able to do nationally, maybe try state, regional, or smaller. For example, I think the firearms laws in NYC are silly. NYC *imposing* their preferences on people hundreds of miles away, is something else, entirely.
If you can’t get the laws you’d like past the constitution (“Heller” for example), my advice remains the same. Propose your amendment and have at it. If you can’t get enough other people to agree, well, that’s be cause they don’t agree. And they’re here too. And you don’t get to impose your preference for disarming other people by verbally abusing the Senate into accepting a Supreme Court Justice who will do it for you.
The other bald truth here is there are remedies for “treason.” I look forward to seeing from Mr. Paul the lawsuit vs. the AG demanding the offenders be prosecuted for treason; the petition to the White House demanding that The President direct his administration to do exactly that; demands for motions to impeach from various congresscritters (I’m sure Chuck-y could be convinced to do it on an otherwise slow news day. Former Leader Read, would take rather less convincing, I suspect.)
Otherwise, this is just more “politics by other means”, of the name-calling variety.
Treasonous? LOL. How is the Senate saying they won’t confirm any nominees not exactly like Obama saying he will veto any bill passed that repeals Obamacare. Nothing is stopping Obama from wasting his time and nominating someone when he already has the answer. Let him nominate away.
Let’s say that come November, a Democrat wins the White House, and Republicans retain control of the Senate. Are we to wait another four years? Do the Democrats have to win both the Presidency and a super-majority in the Senate to fill the empty seat?
Congress is free to override any Presidential veto, if they have the votes.
Congress is not free to sit on their thumbs indefinitely until they can get a President who will appoint who they want to the Supreme Court.
In your scenario, if the new Democratic President feels she has the political capital and can convince the public we need another Justice the Republicans in the Senate will feel the heat to act from their constituents. Democracy in action. Note that there is no reason why we can’t continue with 8 justices. You would think that the Liberals would be happy that the court is down one conservative vote. Odds are more court cases will swing their way. I guess the need to prop up Obama’s legacy with any kind of accomplishment overrides all other considerations. I hope Obama does as expected and nominates an extreme leftist forcing the Democratic presidential hopefuls to swing further left to defend his choice.
The advice Senate Republicans have given Obama is they believe no one he can nominate will be able to receive their consent. Obama could call the bluff by nominating someone that should be acceptable. Say, Frederick Scullin or William Traxler, who both handed down highly significant pro-gun decisions. If they still refuse to budge, then yeah, they’re just being petulant morons.
However, they are under no obligation to approve somebody just because there’s a vacancy. The President has the power to nominate, and the check on that power is the requirement of the Senate’s consent.
“Let’s say that come November, a Democrat wins the White House, and Republicans retain control of the Senate. Are we to wait another four years?”
Wow that situation has never happened ever in the history of the Repulic!
Oh, wait it did. Look up Sonia Sotomayor. There make believe crisis solved you can sleep tonight.
Treasonous? No, but it is politicking at the expense of the federal judiciary, and that is something the voters are fed up with. The federal bench is woefully short of judges and justices all over the country, and the business of the Senate is to get those seats filled with qualified candidates. Candidates should be reviewed and given an up or down vote, and be done with it. The administration of justice does suffer when there are not enough judges to handle the case load; justice delayed is justice denied.
The administration of justice? Hahahahahah. Where there is a Kelo v. City of New London, there is no justice.
and tonight’s “Nightmare Scenario”……………………………
“Obama, emboldened by Hillary’s suggestion of naming him to the Supreme Court once she’s president, does a fast end run and nominates himself for the Supreme Court. The republicans, totally out maneuvered, have little choice (and even smaller cajones) and confirm his nomination leaving Shotgun Joe as the new President. Shotgun Joe, also emboldened by his sudden power, realizes that he can use the power of the presidential pulpit and declares his candidacy for the Democratic nomination and then wins he election going away in November by promising all the Democratic voters more and more of the same as Obama”
Sitting back with a BIG bowl of popcorn to watch all of this unfold
Not going to happen. Not only is it ridiculously implausible, Obama doesn’t want the job.
You are correct, Sir
I don’t know what the Justices are paid but past presidents can make a lot more getting paid for speeches. As demo stated by that silver tongued devil, Bill Clinton & pant suit granny, Hillary.
Also, he would have to show up for work some days.
He pays attention to the Constitution when it’s useful to him, like when he needs something to wipe his ass.
Or the Senate could follow Trumps advice, Delay, delay, delay that way if he is elected he can nominate his liberal nut job sister to the seat.
He has already stated two names that he considers the type of justice he would nominate, William “Bill” Pryor Jr. and Diane Sykes.
Major problem if a 2nd Amendment case gets in front of the Supreme Court. Richard Pearson & the NRA affiliate Illinois State Rifle Association are doing their part to speed the process. Supreme Court denied review of Friedman v. Highland Park in December 2015.
Pearsons justification for selling out his members in Rep. Brandon Phelps “NRA backed” HB183 carry bill in 2013 was they had to have preemption. Criminal penalties of 6 MONTHS or 1 YEAR in jail for hundreds of gun-free zones, an unelected Star Chamber review board where any cop in IL can smear the applicant anonymously, and of course Duty to Inform so police can execute armed citizens, provided by NRA lobbyist Todd Vandermyde. All for the greater good according to the big brains in southern Illinois.
They got preemption and a 10 day sunset on any assault weapons ban by local government. The hicks at ISRA couldn’t call it a win and drive their monster trucks back to Dixieland, they had to sue Highland Park. Feeling their oats after doing nothing to promote concealed carry for 20 years. Flop!
On December 7, 2015, the Mayor and police chief of Highland Park held a press conference to crow about their victory over “the gun lobby.” Reporter Marcella Raymond from WGN was there, stating “we have contacted ISRA (world headquarters) in Chatsworth, but our calls were not returned.” Dr. Arie Friedman made a mistake when he trusted the “man” who sold out Otis McDonald. Be sure to thank ISRA for jamming up case law for all 50 states.
As with their use of “choice,” for the Left, “consent” too is a one way street.
I wouldn’t hold your breath!
Looks like POTUS Dindunuthin’ has hired a legal clerk to spin for free on demand at NYT. Sorry, Old Gray Whore, I stopped reading you years ago on principle.
Here’s more mockery of the Telepromter In Chief. Read the middle link if not the others.
A correction concerning Justice Scalia. He did not advocate “original intent”, and actually opposed that idea as being too subjective. He advocated “original meaning”: what a reasonable person of the time would understand the words used to mean.
Note that “of the time” includes the time of any amendments. Someone the other day said that Scalia and the originalists would deprive women and blacks of the right to vote. He seriously did not understand that Scalia and other “original meaning” people would note that the amendments to the constitution are now in force (being adopted in accordance with the original meaning of the constitution), and they should be interpreted in light of what a reasonable person at the time of their adoption would understand the words to mean.
“Advise” would include the Senate taking the opportunity of presenting the President with a list they approve of ahead of time and urging him to pick one.
The Senate should thus make a list of people who would stand with Barry Goldwater on the issues of armed citizens, gay rights, etc., since Barry today would be considered a left winger on most individual rights, but a right winger on arms.: GRC's reference SQRL client for Windows can be downloaded with the links below:

SQRL
This article is about the computing topic. For other uses, see Sqrl.
SQRL (pronounced "squirrel")[2] or Secure, Quick, Reliable Login (formerly Secure QR Login) is a draftopen standard for secure websitelogin and authentication. The software typically uses a link of the scheme or optionally a QR code, where a user identifies via a pseudonymouszero-knowledge proof without the risk of revelation of information about the transaction to a third party.
History[edit]
The acronym SQRL was coined by Steve Gibson and the protocol drafted, discussed and analyzed in-depth, by himself and a community of Internet securityenthusiasts on the newsgroups and during his weekly podcast, Security Now!, on October 2, 2013. Within two days of the airing of this podcast, the W3C expressed interest in working on the standard.[3]
Google Cloud Platform developers Ian Maddox and Kyle Moschetto mentioned SQRL in their document "Modern Password Security for System Designers".[4]
A thesis on SQRL analyzed and found that "it appears to be an interesting approach, both in terms of the envisioned user experience as well as the underlying cryptography. SQRL is mostly combining well established cryptography in a novel way."[5]
Benefits[edit]
The protocol is an answer to a problem of identityfragmentation. It improves on protocols such as OAuth and OpenID by not requiring a third party to broker the transaction, and by not giving a server any secrets to protect, such as username and password.
Additionally, it provides a standard that can be freely used to simplify the login processes available to password manager applications. More importantly, the standard is open so no one company can benefit from owning the technology. According to Gibson's website,[2] such a robust technology should be in the public domain so the security and cryptography can be verified, and not deliberately restricted for commercial or other reasons.
Phishing protections[edit]
SQRL has some design-inherent and intentional phishing defenses,[6] but it is mainly intended to be for authentication, not anti-phishing, despite having some anti-phishing properties.[7]
Example use case[edit]
For the protocol to be used on a website, two components are necessary: an implementation, that is part of the web service to which the implementation authenticates, which displays a QR code or specially crafted URL according to the specifications of the protocol, and a browser plugin or a mobile application, which can read this code in order to provide secure authentication.
The SQRL client uses one-way functions and the user's single master password to decrypt a secret master key, from which it generates – in combination with the site domain name and optionally an additional sub-site identifier: e.g., , or – a (sub-)site-specific public/private key pair. It signs the transaction tokens with the private key and gives the public key to the site, so it can verify the encrypted data.
There are no "shared secrets" which a compromise of the site could expose to allow attacks on accounts at other sites. The only thing a successful attacker could get, the public key, would be limited to verifying signatures that are only used at the same site. Even though the user unlocks the master key with a single password, it never leaves the SQRL client; the individual sites do not receive any information from the SQRL process that could be used at any other site.
SQRL implementations[edit]
A number of proof-of-concept implementations have been made for various platforms, including for the server (PHP,[8]Drupal,[9] and C# .NET[10][11]) and for the client (Android,[12][13][14]C# .Net,[10]Java,[15] and Python[16]). There are also various server-end test and debugging sites available.[17][18]
Legal aspects[edit]
Steve Gibson states that SQRL is "open and free, as it should be", and that the solution is "unencumbered by patents".[2] After SQRL brought a lot of attention to QR-code-based authentication mechanisms, the suggested protocol was said by blogger Michael Beiter to have been patented earlier and thus not generally available for royalty-free use.[19][non-primary source needed] The patent in question (not expiring until 2030) was applied for by and granted to Spanish company GMV Soluciones Globales Internet SA (a division of the Madrid-based technology and aerospace corporation GMV Innovating Solutions), between 2008 and 2012 by the patent offices of the United States, the European Union, Spain, and Portugal.[20] Gibson responded: "What those guys are doing as described in that patent is completely different from the way SQRL operates, so there would be no conflict between SQRL and their patent. Superficially, anything that uses a 2D code for authentication seems 'similar' ... and superficially all such solutions are. But the details matter, and the way SQRL operates is entirely different in the details."[21]

Squirrels Research Labs Reveals Intel® FPGAs in Power-Efficient Next Generation Ethereum Mining Accelerators
NORTH CANTON, Ohio, Feb. 19, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Squirrels Research Labs (SQRL), a world-leader in blockchain technology, today announced a flagship product in the successful JungleCat line of high-performance blockchain accelerators. With the introduction of two new modules starting at $1349, including 16GB of HBM2 in the highest capacity Intel® Stratix® 10 MX FPGAs, SQRL extends its market leadership in FPGA cryptocurrency mining solutions and customer value.
“We are incredibly excited to launch this product based around Intel’s FPGA technology,” SQRL president David Stanfill said. “The added capacity of 16GB HBM2 memory coupled with our industry leading 300W-per-chip design gives our customers unique and unparalleled access to mine even more cryptocurrencies.”
The new JungleCat modules can be used to mine top-tier cryptocurrencies using algorithms like Ethash (Ethereum), Equihash, and Cuckoo Cycle with an outstanding return, in part due to industry leading power efficiency. They also offer tremendous advantages in other data center compute workloads, including video processing, database acceleration and machine learning.
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) is an industry pioneer in silicon across multiple verticals, and their collaboration as a supplier puts decades of experience and expertise behind the SQRL team.
“We have been working closely with Intel to optimize our product offerings for our customers’ needs,” Stanfill said. “We’re incredibly proud of the results so far, and we’re excited for the future.”
High capacity 16GB HBM allows the new JungleCat products to keep critical data closer to computational resources, reducing power and ultimately providing superior performance, even for algorithms that utilize significantly smaller amounts of memory.
“This is game changing,” Stanfill continued. “We’ve built products around HBM2 before, but with Intel’s help and the unique advantage of their Hyperflex™ architecture in the Stratix 10 MX products, we were able to take the lessons learned about the unique bottlenecks in our workloads, and bypass them with this advanced generation of product.”
More details about the new products are forthcoming. SQRL will begin accepting orders in March, with shipments expected the same month. Units will ship with support for multiple algorithms, including those already supported by SQRL’s previous BCU-1525 and ForestKitten products.
The company is expecting continued high-demand for these products and recommends interested parties contact [email protected] to begin reserving inventory.

With the eldest member of BSCC aged 96, our community elders have a wealth of knowledge about Palestinian culture and heritage that they are eager to share with the younger generation—and the younger generation is ready to listen!
The Friends School of Ramallah/ El- Bireh has been educating children since 1869, offering a rich curriculum that teaches students to recognize their responsibility to society. BSCC is a place in which students were able to put what they learn about social responsibility into action. The visit is just one manifestation of BSCC’s mission in action— to foster an intergenerational hub where community members can hold activities, programs and build community with and for each other.

News release
February 22, 2021 Ottawa, Ontario Transport Canada
Our railways are an important part of our national transportation network. That is why the Government of Canada is focused on the reliable transportation of dangerous goods by rail in colder weather, and the protection of both railway workers and those living near Canada’s rail corridors. In a large nation like Canada, rail is often the only economically viable mode of transportation to move commodities within the country, across the border, and to our ports for shipment overseas. Our rail system makes a significant contribution to our country’s economy and that is why the Government of Canada is continuing to take strong action to ensure rail safety.
Today, the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, announced that changes to the Rules Respecting Key Trains and Key Routes have been approved by Transport Canada. These changes are the result of Ministerial Orders that were put in place in 2020, to address important risk factors for derailments caused by railway infrastructure, especially during winter operations.
The revised Rules Respecting Key Trains and Key Routes, under the Railway Safety Act, now:
- require railway companies to develop a winter operation plan that is specific to each subdivision where higher risk key trains operate, which must be approved by a professional engineer;
- require use of new technology to detect a broken rail in areas where it is not currently present;
- strengthen track inspection (increased frequency and improved quality) and track maintenance requirements (i.e., ultrasonically testing replacement rail and improved record-keeping); and,
- define a ‘higher risk key train’ as a train carrying large quantities of crude oil or liquid petroleum gases and prescribe speed restrictions for these trains.
Transport Canada continues to work with the railway industry to make our railway system even safer for Canadians.
Quotes
“Canada maintains one of the safest rail systems in the world as a result of shared efforts between our government and numerous partners, including railway companies and communities. Today, we are making changes to address risks associated with the transportation of dangerous goods by rail, including train speed, colder weather operations and further strengthening track maintenance and inspection practices. Our government is committed to continuing to work to build an even safer Canada for everyone.”
The Honourable Omar Alghabra
Minister of Transport
Quick facts
In 2020, the Minister of Transport issued a number of Ministerial Orders, under the Railway Safety Act, which put in place speed restrictions for key trains and higher-risk key trains.
The Minister of Transport also ordered railway companies to propose changes to the Rules Respecting Key Trains and Key Routes that would make these speed restrictions permanent and to propose additional changes to further strengthen track maintenance and inspection practices.
Transport Canada approved the Rules Respecting Key Trains and Key Routes in 2016, under the Railway Safety Act, in response to a series of derailments of trains carrying crude oil (e.g. Lac Mégantic (2013), Gladwick (2015), Gogama (2015)).
These rules impose speed restrictions on railway companies that operate key trains, and stronger requirements for track inspections and risk assessments for key routes.
Transport Canada monitors railway companies for compliance with rules, regulations, and standards made under the Railway Safety Act through risk-based audits and safety inspections.:These days, troops of Chemical Battalion 38 of MR3 have mobilized its troops and vehicles to spray disinfectants in pandemic-hit areas, such as Ha Long city, Van Don international airport, Dong Trieu town (Quang Ninh), POYUL Co., Ltd (Kim Dien hamlet, Hung Dao commune) and quarantine areas in Chi Linh city (Hai Duong province).
In addition, the troops also sprayed Cloramin B 25% along main roads and streets in Hai Phong city in a length of more than 400km. Reportedly, the unit has ensured that 100% of its troops are ready at all times.
Together with the chemical troops, the medical force of the region also established a mobile team to carry out pandemic prevention and control in units and hospitals. They took part in checking body temperature and spraying antiseptic at checkpoints and quarantine areas.
Meanwhile, some units of MR3, including Regiment 2 (Division 395), Regiment 125 (Hai Duong provincial Military Command), MR3’s Military School, Infantry Regiment 244 (Quang Ninh provincial Military Command), have moved to other places so that their barracks can be used for quarantining tasks.
The wholehearted participation of the MR3’s armed forces, in coordination with the local authorities, has contributed to curbing the spread of COVID-19 pandemic.

On the 2021 Greentech Pageant in Kraftwerk Berlin this week, German automaker and founding competition associate Audi mentioned how it’s working to enhance the sustainability and ecosystem surrounding its rising lineup of electrical automobiles, from funding European utilities to extend renewable vitality technology and piloting new methodology for recycling plastics testing using a form of synthetic intelligence to observe its whole provide chain for “sustainability dangers.” Let’s begin with that final one, as a result of it is a doozy when you get your head round it.
Audi is mainly constructing and testing a form of eco-friendly big brother to look at its suppliers with the aim of early detection of so-called “sustainability dangers.” This “threat radar” makes use of synthetic intelligence to observe publicly accessible sources — together with information and media sources and social networks, like Twitter and YouTube — in additional than 50 languages and 150 nations worldwide for pink flags, together with social triggers — resembling labor regulation violations, workforce or civil unrest, little one labor or discrimination — or environmental considerations like air air pollution, water air pollution, water consumption or waste issues. Apparently, the system additionally appears to be like for cyber threat matters, together with suspected cyberattacks, information fraud or information theft.
If, for instance, the AI will get wind by way of Twitter {that a} mining firm that provides a battery producer for an Audi E-Tron is utilizing little one labor or a information group reviews that an upholstery provider is an issue polluter, an inner alarm is triggered at Audi, signaling an investigation into the violation and, if vital, correcting motion. The aim is to maintain Audi’s arms clear and ensure that the automobiles it builds and the over 14,000 suppliers its makes use of are as sustainable as they are often, all the best way again to the uncooked materials. Nonetheless, the idea of AI surveillance by means of massive information is a contact creepy.

A lot much less creepy is the extra easy aim of accelerating the proportion of renewable vitality generated in Europe to fulfill the rising proportion of electrical automobiles bought. Audi has said a aim of feeding 5 terawatt-hours of inexperienced photo voltaic and wind energy into the European grid by 2025 — the equal of constructing about 250 new wind generators. To begin, the automaker is partnering with vitality firm RWE in Germany to open a photo voltaic farm with a capability of 170 million kilowatt-hours fed by practically 420,000 photo voltaic panels. This shall be, in line with Audi’s launch, one of many largest impartial photo voltaic farms in Germany and the stepping off level for increasing to extra European nations.
Audi can also be piloting a Chemical Recycling pilot venture for automotive plastics that can generate high-quality pyrolysis oil from waste plastic, which it may well then use to create new plastic automotive parts which can be of comparable high quality to virgin plastics. As soon as perfected, pyrolysis oil recycling ought to cut back the necessity for crude oil in automobile manufacturing. Audi can also be different methods to cut back plastic waste; for instance, plastic waste from A6 and A7 meeting is sorted, shredded and processed into 3D printing filament that’s utilized in meeting elsewhere within the manufacturing course of.

Along with methods to cut back plastic waste in manufacturing, Audi introduced a pair of partnerships concentrating on the removing of plastic from the atmosphere. Teaming up with Clear Rivers and Everware, 3,200 kg of plastic has been fished out of the Danube river to be upcycled, whereas litter traps have been put in close to Brussels and Budapest.
In the meantime, a partnership with the Technical College of Berlin is growing highway microplastic filters for city runoff. The filters goal the practically 110,000 tons of tire and highway microplastics generated in Germany alone yearly — ending up within the soil, rivers and ocean — with a modular design that may be tailored to particular data-driven situations and even the climate. For instance, in areas the place stop-and-go visitors is widespread, the filters can goal brake mud. On quicker stretches, the filters might be optimized for tire put on particles. If a storm is predicted, upkeep crews may even proactively sweep the road earlier than the downpour to cut back particles and assist improve the lifetime of the filters.

O'Briens Creek fossicking area
O’Briens Creek near Mount Surprise is well-known for gem-quality topaz, attracting visitors from all over Australia and overseas.
Access
Mount Surprise is a small township about 200km south-west of Cairns between Mount Garnet and Georgetown on the Gulf Developmental Road. From the township go north-west across the rail line on the Mount Surprise Station road and travel 37km to cross Elizabeth Creek. Follow the sign to the fossicking area along the road to the left for a further 1.5km, passing Diggers Rest about 200m before the main entrance sign. Refer to the map for details of tracks and signs within the fossicking area and note boundary limits.
The gravel road to O’Briens Creek may become impassable in wet weather and care is required on black soil sections. Flooding of creeks and gullies occurs during the wet season. Check local conditions before setting out.
Map
Facilities
Camping is not permitted in the fossicking area. However, the landholder of Mount Surprise Station allows camping nearby, at a site adjacent to Elizabeth Creek with basic toilet and shower facilities, for the payment of a fee. Fossickers intending to camp should contact the landholder's agent at the camping area about 200m south-east of the Elizabeth Creek crossing. Camping is also not permitted elsewhere on adjoining properties. A range of accommodation is available at Mount Surprise.
The creeks are dry and water is not usually available on the diggings.
Fossicking notes
The rocks in the vicinity of O’Briens Creek are mapped as the Elizabeth Creek Granite of Carboniferous age. The granite is a pink medium-grained, and slightly porphyritic granite containing minor mafic minerals. Topaz and tin were deposited in veins and altered zones derived from late-stage melts and fluids during the cooling of the granite. These resistant minerals were liberated by erosion and later concentrated in creek alluvium and possibly hillwash. The area has been extensively worked for alluvial tin.
Topaz and other gemstones are found in alluvial gravels (wash), which are up to 2m deep, usually in present creeks and gullies. The wash consists of sand and gravel with some cobbles and boulders. Colluvial or hillwash deposits also have potential to be gem-bearing. Tailings from previous tin mining operations throughout the area offer further potential for gem finds.
Other gem materials found in association with the topaz are mainly the quartz varieties, rock crystal, citrine and smoky quartz, and the beryl variety, aquamarine. Fragments of cassiterite (tin oxide) are also found.
O’Briens Creek, Tourmaline Gully, Crystal Gully, Swampy Gully, Six Mile Creek, McDonald Creek and Lancewood Creek are the main areas of interest to fossickers (see map).
Digging with hand tools and dry sieving are the usual methods used to search for gems.
Special conditions
Several mining claims and two mining leases within the area are excluded from the declared fossicking area (see map); these must not be entered without the permission of the holders. Posts mark the corners of each tenure. Several residence areas exist along Elizabeth Creek (see map), which are also excluded from the fossicking area.

His book, which is self-published, begins to remedy the situation with the most thorough, accessible and vigorous dissection of Rand yet. However, judging by Fred Seddon’s review (1) in the Journal of Ayn Rand Studies, taking Rand seriously is no guarantee that Randians will return the favour.
Seddon is a professional academic and a somewhat controversial figure within Objectivism, largely due to his courageous, if somewhat oblique, defence of Immanuel Kant, who is a cartoon philosophic hate-figure to Ayn Rand’s followers. Given his modest iconoclasm and JARS mission to bring Rand to the wider academic world one might have hoped for a suitably engaged response to Nyquist’s book. However, the result is lost opportunity as Seddon is clearly not up to the job. He claims the book has a ‘narcotic quality’ on him; but not, I fear, in a good way. It turns out his review is so airheaded if you read it on a plane you could safely switch the engines off.
Seddon’s ineptness is evident from the beginning. He seems to be literally unable to understand the simplest thing Nyquist writes. For example, Seddon quotes Nyquist calling Rand ‘an important and perhaps even a great thinker’ but says that the book leaves him with the opposite impression. After all, Nyquist criticizes her views on everything from epistemology to art, from morality and politics to science and history. “How much remains”, puzzles Seddon, “for her to be a great thinker about?”
But Nyquist is crystal clear about what he means by ‘great thinker’ – all that is required is to read the relevant passage:
”For even though (Rand’s) philosophy is riddled with non-sequiturs, over generalizations, incompetent formulations,pseudo-empirical references,”. (ARCHN, xiv)Nyquist then offers Plato, Plotinus, Leibniz, Berkeley, Kant, Fichte, Hegel among others as examples of thinkers generally regarded as ‘great’ despite their manifold errors. Simple enough even for a professor of philosophy one would have thought, but somehow Nyquist’s meaning has escaped Seddon. This is especially odd, as this passage occurs immediately following the sentence Seddon quotes. How has he managed to miss it? Perhaps the ‘narcotic quality’ Nyquist’s writing has on the professor caused him, Grandpa Simpson-like, to nod off now and again.
Unfortunately, this is only to be the first of many narcoleptic moments. Seddon is no less obtuse in his critique of Nyquist’s methodology:
“(Nyquist) tells us that he does not have access to Rand’s mind and so he will ‘judge her entirely by her writings.’ But he immediately begins to focus on her intentions…and constantly tells us what she is consciously thinking as well as her subconscious motives.”But the quoted snippet from Nyquist - ‘judge her entirely by her writings’ - simply does not mean what Seddon thinks it does ie: that Nyquist is ruling Rand’s intentions out-of-bounds for discussion. In fact, Nyquist means quite the opposite. Again, all one needs to do is read the passage in question to see that, far from sidelining Rand’s intentions and motives, Nyquist is indeed focusing on them, and using her writings to establish what they are.
“Now obviously I have no direct access to Rand’s mind. I have to judge her entirely by her writings – which is not always easy. In my opinion, the best way of circumventing some of the difficulties involved in interpreting Rand is to begin by focusing on her intentions as a philosopher. (emphasis DB) Her intentions are at least perfectly comprehensible – something not always the case with her philosophical doctrines, which are often riddled with non-sequiturs and palpable distortions of reality.”(ARCHN, xxix)Again, simple enough – and again, Nyquist’s meaning is perfectly evident from reading the very next sentence to the one Seddon cites. Yet somehow Seddon contrives to get it completely backwards.
This is bad enough; but worse, it does not appear to have dawned on our absent-minded professor that the entire book is premised on the stated intention of Rand’s philosophy – that is, “the projection of an ideal man.” This is the central argument of Nyquist’s book after all, hammered home from Chapter 1 onwards – that Rand’s ‘ideal man’ is a rationalization that bears no relationship to the empirical reality of human nature; and as a result, Nyquist argues, the philosophy behind this ‘ideal’, Objectivism, despite all its claims to the contrary, becomes simply another variation of rationalism. Understanding Rand’s intentions is the key to the book, yet Seddon has not grasped this remarkably obvious point. Tellingly, while this yawning gap between Rand’s theories and actual human beings forms the central platform for “Ayn Rand Contra Human Nature”’s argument (perhaps the title might have given him a hint?), Seddon does not refer it even once in his review - a quite remarkable feat of missing the point. One suspects if Seddon was reviewing “Anna Karenina” he would think it about the lack of safety precautions in 19th century Russian railway stations.
Perhaps Seddon would have better luck getting ARCHN’s arguments if he spent less of his time in engrossed in trivia. His opening salvo is an extended discussion on the riveting topic of…wait for it…Nyquist’s section headings. I kid you not. Unfortunately even when Seddon does stumble across a reasonable technical point, he can’t seem to make it stick. For example, Seddon worries that as Nyquist is not concerned with verbalism and arguing over definitions, Nyquist might end up using one definition of a term, and Rand another. “Won’t they be talking at cross-purposes?” he frets. Well, maybe. But having voiced this concern, he can only find one possible example of this happening in the entire book – in the discussion of the “self-evident”, which Nyquist refers to as “those things which the self has first-hand experience of” and Rand refers to as that which must be accepted, even to be denied. While he claims that this is Nyquist beating a strawman, Seddon neglects to tell us exactly why this is such an egregious misrepresentation. Are Rand’s inescapable ‘self-evident’ concepts such as ‘existence’ and ‘consciousness’ not things which, in Objectivism, one has first-hand experience of? And if in fact they are compatible with Nyquist’s definition – and it appears at first blush they are - how would this then vitiate Nyquist’s criticisms? In other words, Seddon’s point is…? One suspects he really doesn’t have one.
And so on in an increasingly hapless vein. He seizes upon Nyquist’s demonstration that Rand uses vague definitions to ‘prove anything’ (ARCHN, 150) she wants and shows that formally in logic there are in fact some things you can’t prove, whether the terms are vague or not. But narcolepsy has struck again – Seddon does not appear to have read the qualifying sentence that immediately follows Nyquist’s demonstration - “just about anything” (ARCHN,151, italics DB) - which shows that Nyquist was not speaking formally in the first place. So Seddon’s point is another fizzer.
Things descend into outright farce when Seddon mischaracterises Nyquist as a ‘positivist’ just because, pace Karl Popper, Nyquist mocks the empty verbalism commonly associated with the word ‘metaphysics’ and considers the best test of the ‘certainty’ of a theory to be how it stands up to the empirical facts. “If one claims that all swans are white and produces a white swan, or a 1,000 white swans, as evidence for his claim, is that the end of the matter?” Seddon intones. “Popper built a career on the importance of falsifiability. Has Nyquist forgotten this fact?” Perhaps a better question is: has Seddon dozed off completely? It seems he has. Turning to the text, we find Nyquist spends a page and a half outlining the famous ‘problem of induction’ in ARCHN’s intro (ARCHN, xix-xx), including the standard ‘white swan’ example Seddon claims to be confused about. More embarrassing still, in chapter 3 - the very same chapter Seddon is discussing – we find nothing less than a lengthy and thoroughly approving discussion of the importance of falsifiability. (ARCHN, 171-174) – again, complete with the ‘white swan’ example. Nyquist quotes Popper:
“…no matter how many instances of white swans we might have observed, this does not justify the conclusion that all swans are white” (ARCHN, 171)and also writes:
“The best that can be said on behalf of a theory is that it has survived every attempt to refute it.” (ARCHN, 174)Thus the answers to our bemused professor’s questions above are, clearly, “no”, and “no”. Who is Seddon trying to kid? Firstly, anyone who read the book – or even the chapter - half-attentively would realise this. Secondly, having stated the formal case against inductive ‘certainty’ at considerable length, Nyquist is again just speaking colloquially when he says “certainty” or “once and for all” or “know” or “probably” or similarly philosophically troubling phrases. As Nyquist says, again in the same chapter, "I will do everything in my power to avoid being technically excessive or abstruse..." (ARCHN, 100) And of course Popper did exactly the same thing in his own writing. Thirdly, surely Seddon knows enough about 20th Century philosophy to know that as Popper is the most famous critic of Logical Positivism, anyone who right from the outset declares himself a Popper fan is unlikely to be much of a 'positivist'. (Seddon invokes Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle; yet despite Nyquist's impressive array of intellectual sources I could find no reference to either in ARCHN)
It appears that, true to form, Seddon has simply not understood what he has read. He cites Nyquist:
“If you want to know whether causality is valid, study the empirical word of facts. Only by observing the facts can you know what they are.” (ARCHN, 195)Seddon seems to think this passage equates ‘observation’ with ‘knowledge’ and is both ‘bad Rand’ and ‘bad Popper.’ In fact it is just bad Seddon. Nyquist is not saying, as Seddon thinks, that the only way you can develop theories (or what Popper calls ‘knowledge’) is from observing facts. This would be bad Popper indeed. He is saying – and merely reading the second sentence of the quote makes it quite obvious - that the only way to get the facts is by observing them. Hardly an interesting statement, let alone a controversial one, and certainly not a statement that anyone, especially Popper, would be ‘vituperative’ about. Seddon is clutching at straws. After all, Leonard Peikoff himself makes the exact same point as Nyquist: he writes, “Thinking, to be valid, must adhere to reality”(OPAR, 110) and claims the old Dragnet line ”Just give us the facts, ma’am” is his motto. So is Peikoff now a ‘positivist’ too? Would Seddon rate OPAR as the Tractatus all over again?
By now it is difficult to avoid the impression that Seddon has not really read, let alone engaged with, the book he is purported to be reviewing – and what few sentences he has read, he appears to have misunderstood. One charitably assumes this is merely serial incompetence, and not a deliberate attempt by Seddon to mislead his readers. Whatever the case, we can only wonder: as a professional thinker, would he accept such standards from one of his students? One can only hope not. And while I know little about JARS other than its aim of improving Objectivism’s credibility in academia, this kind of clowning can only have the reverse effect.
As such, his criticisms of ARCHN probably don’t merit further discussion. While Seddon either misstates or fails to address Nyquist’s otherwise clear and forceful arguments, he does however have a positive gift for the inane – perhaps his taking Nyquist to task for not calling Leonard Peikoff “Dr Peikoff” takes the prize here. But just when I was about to write it off as little more than an insight into the mind of the unpaid academic reviewer on deadline – surely JARS cannot have fronted up with cash for this effort – Seddon suddenly becomes interesting. But his topic is not Nyquist, but Rand – in particular Rand’s theory of ‘contextual certainty’.
Seddon starts with a discussion about whether he can be ‘certain’ there is not a naked woman in his bedroom (did I mention ‘inane’?). He defends the idea that he can achieve not just ‘certainty’ of the truth of this proposition, but an accompanying ‘proliferation of certainties’. So, clearly, as far as Seddon is concerned and contra Nyquist (and Popper), ‘certain truth’ is easy and prolific; indeed manifest. All one apparently has to do is, as Seddon does in his bedroom, simply look around. (2)
But then having come out all in favour of a manifest truth, Seddon then executes a startling 180 degree shift away from such a doctrine. “In defense of Nyquist” Seddon suddenly backpedals, .”(emphasis DB).
But Seddon goes further than this. In a truly eyebrow-raising section he writes:
“.” (italics DB)If he is still talking about Rand here - and presumably he is - it now seems she was arguing all along that the ideals she advocated like laissez-faire capitalism - and we can assume, her ‘ideal man’ - are not realizable in reality – that like all such abstractions, “one cannot expect them to be actual”. They are merely goals “to be aimed at”, not things “that may actually be”. This is a truly remarkable take on Rand, who furiously railed against any ‘dichotomy’ between theory and practice, against all forms of compromise, against “the hopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all” and insisted that “nothing but perfection will do.” Seddon is effectively saying: she didn’t really mean it.
Of course I don’t believe for a moment that Seddon is right about Rand any more than he is right about Nyquist. It seems to me that Objectivism is just another in that same long line of philosophies Seddon mentions, traceable at least back to Plato, searching for the method of obtaining ‘justified true belief”. That Rand had to settle for a transparent verbal fudge such as “contextual certainty” – indistinguishable in practice, as Nyquist ruthlessly demonstrates, from your regular, common-or-garden uncertainty - is merely proof that just like those who came before her, she did not find it. As a result what remains of her various ‘absolutes’ is, as Nyquist’s book also demonstrates, really just hopped-up rhetoric designed to fill the sizable gap between her ambitions and her achievements.
In sum, in Seddon we seem to be dealing with someone who insists on his own idio...no, let us be kind...idiosyncratic philosophic interpretations, with little or no regard to the facts. As I have shown with regard to “Ayn Rand Contra Human Nature”, Seddon’s criticisms are mostly based on nothing more than his own seeming inability to read plain English. With regard to Rand, while it would itself be Seddon-ish to read too much into a few sentences, I would be most interested in how the rest of the Objectivist community views what appear to be major concessions – albeit offhandedly expressed - to moderns such as Popper on key issues. And on reflection, this may be the key to it. Perhaps the man is not as incompetent as he seems. Perhaps he is simply in a difficult position, having to straddle the world of academia and the world of Objectivism, both brutally critical and both diametrically opposed. Perhaps in all his obviously facile criticisms of Nyquist’s book he hoped to reassure the Objectivist community that he was keeping the faith; simultaneously offering sotto voce key concessions to reassure academia that he could not possibly support anything as outré as ‘justified true belief.’
Whatever the case, on the basis of work of this quality Seddon will be certainly retaining his reputation as somewhat controversial. But not, I fear, in a good way.

(2) I suppose it is worth noting, in passing, some simple refutations of the standard arguments Rand raised against the meaning of ‘certainty’ or ‘absolute certainty’ as it is commonly used. Firstly she claims that it represents ‘the standard of omniscience’ and that as man is not omniscient this is an invalid, Platonic-mystical standard that cannot be applied. But this is a poor argument for the following reasons. One, rather like we might usefully propose “absolute zero” as a hypothetical standard, despite the fact that it seems impossible we will ever actually achieve it, it is always possible by way of analogy to propose “absolute certainty” as a hypothetical standard which we also may never achieve. Two, sometimes Objectivists argue that if there is no basis for uncertainty in a particular case, no contrary evidence or fault in the logic, we can say that we are ‘certain’ in an 'absolute' sense. But in reply we can simply turn to our own experience (and the experience of mankind in general) to encounter many examples where this ‘certainty’ has failed us; where we have overlooked contrary evidence, or a fault in our logic. We are humans, and humans can err. And even in those rare cases where we have had all the facts in front of us, no particular evidence for doubt, clear definitions and a compelling logical argument, there has been the odd time we have still ended up being wrong. What we learn from these experiences is that it is perfectly reasonable to doubt such ‘certainties’ could be described in any reliable way as “absolute”. (We always hope for the best, but this is hardly the same thing). For we have all experienced the feeling of being absolutely certain that something is true. And we have all occasionally experienced the shock of discovering that this cherished belief is in fact false. There is nothing mystical or invalid about either counterargument.

This is merely a restatement of mysticism, ie, of fantasy as a standard of knowledge. It is not a method of knowing reality as a guide to the actions needed for man's life in the material universe.

Stephen, do you regard the scientific standard of "absolute zero" as a "restatement of mysticism" because we are unlikely to physically achieve it?
I somewhat comprehend your disagreement with Ayn Rand's philosophy, yet I do not believe that her theories themselves were at fault but herself as a philosopher. Rand's ideals (whatever they may be in each case) appear omnipotent and desirable because they model ficticious characters. She models an unattainable state as a standard of man (although I do believe it to be attainable with the correct amount of dilligence) yet does not tell the reader how to emulate it. While philosophy is essentially idealism converted into tainted realism, realis appears to have been purged from Ayn Rand's philosphy not because her philosophy is incorrect but because of ambiguity.
Anon: "I somewhat comprehend your disagreement with Ayn Rand's philosophy, yet I do not believe that her theories themselves were at fault but herself as a philosopher."
I can agree with that up to a point, but only up to a point. Rand's theories have at least one fatal flaw: a factually incorrect, over-romanticized view of human nature. Because this view was central to her view of existence, it corrupted Rand the philosopher, as her philosophy had to be orientated toward upholding a view of human nature that was not entirely consistent with the facts. It turned her philosophy into a species of rationalization, rather than a method of attaining wisdom about man and his relation to existence. These corruptions, to be sure, did not prevent Rand's theories from having an element of truth in them, particularly if they are taken broadly enough and the troublesome particulars are ignored. Broadly speaking, she is right in her realism and in her disgust with totalitarianism and the radical left. There is even something to be said for the eudaimonistic implications of her moral philosophy. But her empirical irresponsibility in her philosophy, fostered by her need rationalize her ideal man, runs far too deep in her thought to rescue most of her theories from serious contamination. If a thinker fails as a philosopher, it's almost certainly going to affect his (or her) theories.
I suppose I can agree with you a bit. Rather than relating her theories to actual philosophy, she creates theories similar to those of a motivational speaker. (There are many gaps in her philosophy, and many issues not delt with. Her scope is narrow.) Her main objective is not to define and understand man, but to mold him into an achiever (or at least what is considered to be an achiever). Her essays merely instruct future valedictorians. But, what can we say, she is just an extreme idealist.
As for her "over-romanticized view of human nature", it is spurred by her veneers (or appearances) that are meant to impress the public. For example, she holds her standards at the highest level and often criticizes actions or creations that do not meet them. Is it truly possible for a philosopher to fill an entire philosophy into a novel? Is is truly possible to abide by all of those codes?

Objectivists call knowledge contextual which is a way of acknowledging it is fallible. What they seem to mean is that if idea X solves problem Y, it will always do so, that cannot change. X is objective knowledge. If later people become interested in problem Y2 instead, X may not solve it, but it is still a correct solution to Y. It therefore doesn't lose its knowledge status -- it was correct knowledge in context. And since it never loses its knowledge status, it makes sense to call it knowledge.
Something like that.
Further, the context might be that you didn't understand everything about Y or about X. Pretty much whatever turns out to be wrong with X, you could call it a context issue. In one context (perhaps a naive, ignorant, simplistic starting context), X is knowledge, and then in another context, (e.g. after understanding the issues better), it turns out X is wrong. So contextual knowledge is a lot like fallible knowledge.
Yes this is pretty close to Popper-compatible. Why wouldn't it be?Italian wine has seen a lot of love lately. Last week, the country was crowned the best destination in the world for wine lovers, and earlier this month the hills of Congegliano and Valdobbiadene – home to the country’s renowned Prosecco – were added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Meanwhile, Italy’s standing as a wine-producing powerhouse continues to flourish. More than 400 types of grapes are grown across 20 winemaking regions, helping Italy take the global top spot in terms of the amount of wine produced, and putting it second only to Spain when it comes to exports.
Let’s take a look at the multi-millennia-old history that’s shaped Italy’s formidable wine reputation into what it is today.
Ancient roots
Wine had long been a part of Italian culture when the Greeks first arrived in Italy in the 8th century BC, but they bought with them a true art of winemaking, and the techniques to help it flourish. The Mycenaean Greeks have been attributed to this initial endeavour, introducing viticulture first to Sicily and southern Italy. So impressed were they by Italy’s mild climate that they called the country Oenotria, or ‘the land of trained vines’.
Later, following the Roman defeat of the Carthaginians, large-scale, slave-run plantations began appearing in coastal areas, complementing the winemaking work the Etruscans were already doing in central Italy. Wine had become such a central part of everyday life – and demand for it had so increased – that in AD 92 Emperor Domitian was forced to destroy a large number of vineyards in order to free up land for food production.
Roman wine was much stronger than the Italian wine we know today, and due to its high alcohol content was usually diluted with water. The Romans preferred sweet wines and favoured white, and would often add unusual flavours such as honey, herbs, salt and even chalk in a bid to modify its taste.
While it might yet take several centuries for winemakers to refine their flavours, the Romans during this period can be credited for many contributions to contemporary winemaking. They used props and trellises, for example, and Greek presses for extracting juice. They discovered that aged wines tasted better and were the first to store it in wooden barrels. They also forged the foundations of generally-accepted winemaking wisdom, taking the time to classify their grapes and learn more about climate and terroir.
Curiously, viticulture outside of Italy was prohibited under Roman law during this time, and exports to other areas were made in exchange for slaves. Once these laws were relaxed, vineyards began to flourish throughout the rest of Europe, although Italy remained a vital import centre for wines and vines.
Adversity and triumph
The popularity of Italian wine rose and fell with the Roman Empire, although it was still consistently produced, largely by Christian monks during the Dark Ages. Come the Renaissance, however, its popularity once again skyrocketed – until the nineteenth century when, along with much of northern Europe, Italy’s vineyards fell afoul of the vine louse phylloxera.
A great number of prestigious vineyards were destroyed, and their replacements were planted with quantity rather than quality in mind. As such, the early- to mid-20th century saw Italy become a global source of inexpensive table wine. The 1960s saw officials finally take action to restore the country’s once-grand winemaking reputation, and introduced a series of laws to control quality and labelling.
The first Italian system of classification of wines was launched in 1963, and Italy’s modern wine landscape was born. Several modifications and additions have been made to the legislation since its inception, but the system now includes four basic categories, ranging from Vini (so-called ‘generic wines’) to Vini DOP (wines with protected designation of Origin). Within the DOP category exists a number of further sub-categories, each with stringent rules and regulations that are commonly taken to denote status and quality.
That said, however, looser rules for ‘lower’ categories do not always indicate lower quality. Talented winemakers will sometimes create wines using varietals or varietal percentages that do not match DOC or DOCG requirements. ‘Super Tuscans’ are a good example, and while renowned labels such as Sassicaia, Tignanello, Masseto and Ornellaia may not meet the rigid requirements of some classification levels, there is no doubt they are some of the most sought-after wines in the world – with price tags to match!
Today, Italy is known for noble reds such as Chianti, Barbaresco and Brunello, as well as zesty whites and, of course, ever-popular sparkling wines such as Asti and Prosecco. The country’s vast range of wines encompasses a flavour profile to suit every taste – and every match is one born of quality and passion. It’s not hard to see why Italian wines continue to take the world by storm..Future Energy is Bringing Two EOR Innovations in Thermal Enhanced Oil Recovery (TEOR)
eSteam™ zero-emissions downhole steam technology provides shigh-quality saturated and superheated steam; uses 40% less feedwater and increases oil production by over 50% compared to conventional OTSG techniques while saving 25%+ in operational costs.
NaNoEOR™ zero-emissions nanotechnology provides a novel exothermic reaction in the reservoir that generates hydrogen gas. The game-changing nanomaterials significantly reduces viscosity, emulsifies the oil, reduces the interfracial tension between crude oil and water, and causes wettability alteration for improved areal sweep efficiency maximizing oil mobility for increased oil production.
Thermal EOR (TEOR) is the primary EOR process for heavy oil extraction and one of the most common in the US, accounting for over 40% of its EOR production. It seeks to reduce oil viscosity to allow easier flow to the surface by introducing heat on the reservoir level, most commonly by introducing steam.
Our world has grown smaller. There are fewer unexplored new oil fields, and the world’s energy needs are rising. This makes it increasingly important for companies to extend the lives of their existing reservoirs, extracting every possible drop from each oil field to extract the billions of barrels of already discovered oil that has been impossible to reach.
Thermal Enhanced Oil Recovery (TEOR)
Traditionally, companies have relied upon primary and secondary extraction to recover oil from wells. Still, according to U.S. Department of Energy studies, this leaves half to three-quarters of the total oil reserve behind. Given this low level of efficiency, companies have turned to enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in recent years.
Unlike the primary and secondary methods, which simply displace oil to the surface or extract what’s already there, EOR relies upon changing the oil’s properties to significantly facilitate extraction.
Thermal EOR (TEOR) is the primary EOR process for heavy oil extraction to reduce oil viscosity to allow easier flow to the surface by introducing heat on the reservoir level, most commonly by introducing steam.
TEOR has undergone a transformation, and this process of innovation and improvement is reducing startup costs, run time, and feedwater usage and are essential to ensuring we maximize recovery in every oil field and limiting the environmental impact of extraction throughout the process.
TEOR Solutions to enhance cost efficiency and environmental impact
Indeed, the name of the game is “efficiency.” The less room a solution requires, the less water it needs. Similarly, the less time it needs to run, the better it will be for total costs and environmental impact. This has been the challenge Future Energy LLC took on with some of its latest two EOR innovations, e.g., (1) eSteam™ zero-emissions downhole steam technology; and (2) NaNoEOR™ zero-emissions nanotechnology. These two EOR technologies seek to turn TEOR into a cost-efficient, high-efficiency solution with no emissions.
Steam is at the core of many TEOR solutions. Higher quality steam or superheated steam can result in significant improvements to heavy oil production and substantial reductions in feedwater usage. Disruptive solutions such as eSteam™ and NaNoEOR™ avoid generating emissions that damage the local environment.
Efficiency, optimization, and environmental focus are all critical for ensuring the energy industry can meet the growing global energy demands. It is no longer enough to rely on primary and secondary extraction or dismiss environmental concerns. Today’s energy industry needs to be as efficient and green as possible. Thus, that is what Future Energy’s latest TEOR solutions, eSteam™ and NaNoEOR™ can help companies achieve.

NEW YORK (Reuters) – Oil prices rose Thursday after major oil producer Saudi Arabia rejected calls for more OPEC + supplies and the International Energy Agency said the surge in prices could stimulate demand for oil among power producers.
The market slashed gains after inventories rose more than expected as refiners cut production during a generally slower period for these facilities.
Futures gained 62 cents, or 0.75%, to $ 83.80 a barrel at 12:57 a.m. EDT (1657 GMT) after hitting a high of $ 84.50 a barrel. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 55 cents to $ 80.99.
US crude inventories rose a surprising 6 million barrels, far more than the modest increase of 702,000 barrels expected by analysts. Production increased slightly, reaching 11.4 million bpd. [EIA/S]
“The continued increase in domestic oil production in the United States is pulling the market down a bit. This should relieve some of the growing pressure in the market,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York City. .
Demand for oil is expected to increase by half a million barrels per day (bpd) as the power sector and heavy industries abandon more expensive sources of energy, the IEA said, warning that the crisis energy could fuel inflation and slow the global economic recovery from the pandemic.
In its monthly report, the IEA increased its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2022 to 210,000 bpd, and now expects total oil demand in 2022 to reach 99.6 million bpd. b / d, slightly above pre-pandemic levels.
Saudi Arabia has rejected calls for further increases in OPEC + production, saying the removal of production cuts by the group shielded the oil market from the sharp price swings seen in the natural gas and oil markets. coal.
At its meeting this month, OPEC + stuck to its previous agreement to increase production by 400,000 bpd per month.
OPEC +, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its Russian-led allies, has done a “remarkable” job as so-called regulator of the oil market, Saudi Energy Minister says , Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, at a forum in Moscow.
U.S. shale producers have been reluctant to invest in increasing production after years of low yields. US production remains well below the record at the end of 2019 at nearly 13 million barrels per day. On Wednesday, the EIA announced that production would rebound to 11.7 million bpd in 2022.

Credit: Kristel Porter / Courtesy
Via Energy News Network: A pioneer in Minnesota’s solar industry is attempting to replicate a green economic justice blueprint in the state’s largest African American community. Ralph Jacobson founded the solar firm Impact Power Solutions (IPS) in 1991 and was its CEO until 2019, when he shifted into a role focused on justice, equity, diversity and inclusion. Jacobson, who is White, has been working with the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians for a few years on a crowdfunded solar, microgrid and jobs training project in northern Minnesota.

The SolStar Rooftop Solar Project will attempt a similar model in North Minneapolis, where Jacobson has partnered with multiple Black entrepreneurs on a plan to install solar on two dozen residential rooftops this year while also training neighborhood residents for clean energy industry jobs.
Jacobson began meeting with North Side leaders last year, telling about his success with the Red Lake Nation and suggesting the same strategy could work in North Minneapolis. He quickly realized it would not be an easy pitch in part due to gentrification fears and residents’ long history of being ripped off by businesses promising riches.
“There’s a lot of skepticism in the Black community because they have been prey to scams,” Jacobson said. “People are skeptical, and so they’re gonna wait and see what happens to somebody else before they get involved with this.”
Jacobson sought out partners who knew the neighborhood and had the right blend of skills to make SolStar a success. Among the first was Kristel Porter, a well-known community organizer and candidate for a North Side City Council seat. (Porter is also a board member of Fresh Energy, which publishes the Energy News Network.)
“We would really like to address racial equity through renewable energy,” Porter said. “That’s key. I want to make sure BIPOC people have access to it.”
Porter is the founder of a group called MN Renewable Now, which promotes city and utility clean energy programs to area residents. She is now taking the lead on recruiting homeowners to SolStar, and her prior experience reveals that the neighborhood has begun to embrace clean energy.
MN Renewable Now has spoken to neighborhood associations, knocked on doors, tabled at food shelves, and caught people outside grocery stores to advertise its events. As a result, more than 150 North Side residents signed up for an Xcel Energy wind power program, 37 subscribed to community solar gardens and 70 signed up for home energy efficiency audits.
“A lot of people that we ran into wanted solar on their roofs and they want the equity of owning solar,” Porter said. “But they couldn’t get the financing.”
After joining SolStar, Porter and Jacobson decided to recruit homeowners living in the geographical boundary of the 55411 zip code. She chose the area because of its high concentration of low-income BIPOC residents and its designation as one of the city’s Green Zones, which brings with it city money for solar and efficiency projects. Porter and her team quickly found more than two dozen homeowners interested in having solar installed on their roofs.
Jacobson tapped Blaine Williams, a Black solar assessor, to manage the program and check out potential participants’ rooftops to ensure they could support solar panels. Williams had spoken to Jacobson several times about working for IPS, but the timing and opportunity never matched. After losing his insurance industry job last year, he received an offer to help lead the SolStar initiative.
The North Side native, who now lives in a nearby suburb, sees the project as good news for the neighborhood. “North Minneapolis is kind of last on a lot of lists, you know, unless it’s negative publicity in the news, like crime and stuff,” he said. “So, to be the first in something is really unique.”
Jacobson connected Williams with solar assessment training, and Williams put it to work studying the rooftops of homeowners Porter recruited. He has found nearly all of them, so far, can handle solar panels. The experience with SolStar, he believes, will lead to employment in the solar industry after he suffered a challenging year without much work.
The project “really supported me rolling those dice so hard,” he said. “I went from being unstable to really stable to potentially having no income for a year to this position with SolStar. Things are going so well I can’t imagine this will be the end of it.”
Looking for potential training partners, Jacobson reached out to Joaquin “JT” Thomas, a Black master electrician and president of S3 Solar Service Solutions. He and his partner, David Rawlings, have an on-the-job training program that it will use for SolStar recruits referred through a city of Minneapolis workforce training program focused on emerging employment markets.
Clean energy and the promise of a green economy remain an abstract concept to some in the neighborhood, Thomas said, but SolStar could help people see prospects beyond saving money on utility bills. SolStar is a “start — a small start — but a start,” he said. “This is about getting people trained and giving people opportunities to work. At its finest, this is the green economy in action.”
The financing came together with assistance from a former state legislator and Minneapolis attorney Jeremy Kalin of Avisen Legal PA. Kalin has studied the problem of providing solar in low-income neighborhoods where low credit scores, fixed incomes, and sparse credit histories create financing barriers. During his tenure on a White House clean energy task force during the Obama administration, he learned how Baltimore and Philadelphia created solar programs serving moderate- and low-income residents.
Kalin and Jacobson plan to use incentives from Xcel Energy’s Solar Rewards program along with the city’s neighborhood revitalization fund and Green Cost Share initiatives to pay for a portion of SolStar. He said the rest will come from socially minded investors who can take advantage of the solar tax credits to reduce their tax liabilities.
SolStar plans to offer 2.5% interest payments to investors. Homeowners in the program will receive at least a 20% reduction on their energy bills and a chance to fully own their solar installations after six years, he said. Tax benefits run out the seventh year of solar projects, Kalin said.
SolStar is limited to 24 homeowners because state law requires entities selling power to more than that number of customers open to regulation by the Public Utilities Commission. Should Jacobson and his team continue SolStar in the future, each project will be confined to 24 customers, Kalin said.
Investors still need to be recruited, though Jacobson seems confident. More training is needed, and government funding details have to be ironed out. But he and his team believe as the details are finalized, the $500,000 project should start sometime this year.
For Jacobson, SolStar represents another chance to refine his public-private partnership investment model and provide a blueprint to other entrepreneurs and agencies. As the green economy continues to grow, the industry needs to train a more diverse population to ensure greater equity and opportunity, he said.
“Black and Native communities have not been the beneficiaries of equal opportunity,” Jacobson said. “Systemic racism has dramatically stunted the opportunity for a generation of wealth in these communities. I look at projects like these as investment-grade reparations for that. It’s a worthy investment; it’s not a donation.”.

The Myth of Equality: Uncovering the Roots of Injustice and Privilege
by Ken Wytsma
{Amazon | Baker Book House | ChristianBook.com}
The Myth of Equality far exceeded my expectations. It was so clear, well-presented, and helpful. I appreciated the author’s honesty and articulate explanation of the history of racial injustice and privilege, as well as suggested steps to remedy unbiblical thinking and behavior.
My black South African husband read it as well and was very impressed. He plans to purchase 10 copies to lead a group discussion at his workplace.
Before I listened to the audio version, I saw that a friend recommended this book online as a good “starting point” for those just entering the conversation about racial justice and equality who are looking for an overview resource to help them understand the issues at hand. After listening to the book, I heartily agree that this is the best starting point. In fact, if you can only read one book on this topic, of the books I’ve read so far, this is the one I would recommend.

Here is a quick overview of the muscle groups associated with your abdominal area.
The primary functions of the abdominal muscles are to stabilize your body, keep the abdominal organs in place and to bear down in movements such as child birth, coughing, elimination, etc. There are four layers of abdominal muscles:
1. The outermost layer of the abdominal muscles is the rectus abdominis.. The next layer of muscles are the internal and external obliques. These muscles run diagonally on the sides of the torso from the top of the hips to the middle ribs. Their primary function is twisting, side bending and rotation of the trunk. They also assist in flexion of the trunk. They also assist in flexion of the trunk.
4. The transversus abdominis is the deepest layer of abdominal muscle. This muscle goes around the midsection – front to back with fibers running side to side. The lower portion attaches to hip area (front and back) and the upper portion attaches to the to the lower ribs. Contraction of the transverse muscles pulls the belly in. These muscles are more associated with autonomic nervous system functions such as coughing, bearing down, elimination and childbirth. An easy way to connect with these muscles is to place your hands on the sides of your of your abdominal area and cough.
In my book “ABS! 50 of the best core exericses to strengthen, tone, and flatten your belly” you will find ab and stomach exercises that work all four muscle groups. Click on the book below to learn more.

Really fun patio, wonderful breakfast, awesome service. Always a fun place for weekend brunch.
My friends and I enjoyed our food and drinks at Kristy's. The drive up the restaurant has great views, but sitting in/outside the restaurant does not have direct views to the ocean if that matters to you. Parking is free in the lots around this little shopping area. No complaints, everything was good!
Great menu.... delicious food.... wonderful staff and a lovely setting! Definitely recommend!!I’ve been going through my closets and looking at the pile of things I have accumulated over the past year. Someone gave me a baby doll to give to my granddaughter but she’s into goats and sheep and horses. No dolls in her bed (thank you very much.)
In another room, on another shelf is a package of Leggos and some action figures still in their original boxes. I also have some Christmas tea towels, soaps and lotions.
These items were bought ‘just in case’ however, now I have a surplus of items that need to be regifted, rehomed, recycled and used. Here and now.
So, I logged on to my Freecycle.org account and posted the item ‘Offered: Baby Doll: still in box’ for someone who maybe needs a gift for a little girl or boy. I will list the other items and post them as well.
In my room, I have a wonderful candle that I light every now and then. I decided to burn what I have and order more. I went to the Henri Bendel website to order a new supply of Vanilla Bean candles only to find that HENRI BENDEL has closed up shop and all my candles are no more. It’s actually the smell and the memories they evoke that I’ll miss the most.
Maybe that’s why people hold on to so many things – forgetting that it’s not the THING but the memory behind it that matters.
There are some smells that take me right back to another place and time. Old Spice, Jean Nate cologne, Ambush perfume, cigar smoke, Chanel #5, lilacs, cinnamon sticks – all have a place in my memory bank.
But not on my shelves or in my closets. Time to release, let go and plan to make more memories!
One thought on “Good bye stuff: Hello memories!”
I’m doing this as well. I’m trying to consolidate.
At time I’m finding it a bit difficult.

November 21, 20211. Generate Another Facebook Membership –. When you need to maintain your Tinder totally split from the zynga community, consequently this might assist.
What you should perform is definitely develop another account on fb using your second current email address; simple and easy. No record, no complications! Use this accounts limited to Tinder. But, this approach is sort of dishonest. Per me personally, it is the easiest method to make use of Tinder without enabling the zynga family be informed about it.
A possible match may think of it as shady and ponder exactly why you believed the requirement to generate an independent account for Tinder completely. However, this next profile will consist of actual information on one, as well as your photographs; so this may explained to their match later. With that being said, one person possessing a number of reports, breaches Facebook’s terms of use. In longer streak, your game account just might be obstructed if discovered to be duplicated. If you want to submit wrong/fake expertise, you’d staying fooling your complement.
2. Revise “Tinder” From Facebook Or Myspace Apps –
Whether your basis for keeping away from a zynga sign-in is simply to protect the point that you’re on Tinder, this idea my work. Check out down pointer and click on notice additional alternatives.
Pay a visit to “Apps” on Twitter (in sidebar), locate edit under “Tinder”, and place ‘App presence’ to “Only Me”. Because of this, nothing of your own myspace partners (like household members) will know that you’re using Tinder, unless they’re on Tinder at the same time.
3. Tweak Tinder Methods –
Once you’ve changed your Facebook profile configurations, it is for you personally to check out Tinder.

In particular, Congress has provided customers of cell phone companies with protection as to their location information. In 47 U.S.C. 222(a), Congress states that “every telecommunications carrier has a duty to protect the confidentiality of proprietary information of, and relating to, … customers.” Other provisions make clear that location information is part of the information to be protected. 47 U.S.C. 222(c), (g).
Some have argued that this provision creates a property right or interest in the customer. While this information has been disclosed to a third party (the cell phone company), it is argued that the customer still retains a property interest in its protection. Thus, if one has a property oriented understanding of the Fourth Amendment, as Justice Scalia seemed to have, then this property right might indicate the customer had a right to be protected under the Fourth Amendment.
This is an interesting argument, but it may or may not be right under the original meaning. As I explained in my prior post, the Fourth Amendment provides that “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.” Therefore the question is whether this information is a “paper” or “effect.” Perhaps Justice Scalia had a property oriented theory of the Fourth Amendment, but the text of the Amendment does not speak of property, but of more specific things, such as “paper” or “effect.”
Under a straightforward, but perhaps narrow definition of paper and effect, the information would not be a paper or effect. A paper would refer to the actual physical piece of paper, not the information contained on it. An effect would refer to personal property or movables that a person can carry on their person. In neither case would the “information” be a paper or effect. Perhaps a paper or a memory stick with that information on it would be a paper or effect, but not the information itself.
Yet one might argue that these terms should be read more broadly. In particular, perhaps an effect should be understood to include not merely personal property movables but also property in information. Perhaps, but my sense – albeit based on limited study – is that this information would not have been considered an effect in 1791.
But maybe a different interpretive rule would justify a broader reading. If property in information of the relevant kind did not exist in 1791 – there were patents, but no privacy interests seem implicated by them, and trade secrets did not exist until the 19th century – then one might say that the relevant legal environment did not exist at the time of the Fourth Amendment. In those circumstances, sometimes it makes sense to answer the question based on an analogy. For example, one might argue that freedom of press might extend to radio or tv news, even though they did not exist at the time of the First Amendment, on the analogy that they are similar to the printing press in the relevant respects. Similarly, one might argue that if property in information of the relevant kind existed in 1791, the Fourth Amendment would have protected it. Maybe.
In a future post, I hope to show how Congress, the states, or private parties might protect against disclosure in a way more likely to satisfy the Fourth Amendment’s original meaning.Why did the progressive presidents break up monopolies?

New Federal Aviation Administration guidelines announced for fire departments
Listen to this article on the Fair Reach Forum – a firefighting podcast to inspire discussion.
As a first responder and member of a public agency, there are two ways to pursue proper authorization for flying unmanned aircraft or drones under the guidance and authority of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
Fire service authorization
First, a firefighter can operate a small unmanned aircraft if they and their drone fly under 14 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 107, remote pilot and operations certification.
Secondly, Title 49 USC 40102 defines fire departments as a governmental function. This allows fire departments to apply for Public Aircraft Operations under a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (PAO COA) within the guidelines for public agencies.
14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 107
Part 107 details the requirements for remote pilot certification and responsibilities, as well as the operational limitations of the unmanned aircraft to be flown.
The operational limits described in Part 107 deal with basic flight constraints, including a drone weighing less than 55 pounds and flown by line of sight. In addition, under Part 107, drone flights must consist of daylight operations only, flown at a maximum altitude of 400 feet and away from restricted airspace.
While Part 107 outlines allowable aircraft size and characteristics, flight limitations and airspace restrictions, it also describes the areas of operation where waiver authorizations are appropriate. The waiver authorizations referred to are the bedrock of civil aviation for the protection of life and property and are found in Section 333 of the same code.
Section 333 – Detailed waivers for certified remote pilots
Detailed exceptions and the entire authorization process under 14 CFR Part 107 are described in Section 333 and are critical in allowing for drone operations outside published restrictions. Most civil or governmental drone operations will require some waiver authorization including safety considerations and risk mitigation strategies in order to be in compliance for recognized operational conduct. Once approval of a waiver is adopted under the definitions cited in Section 333, it remains valid until it expires.
The advantages to securing a remote pilot’s license is the ability to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) with waivers and without individual flight approval, the authority to supervise others flying, and the capability to obtain a temporary remote pilot certification while waiting for permanent pilot status. While it may take three to six months to process a completed application for remote pilot, a temporary certificate can be issued in less than 10 days.
The disadvantage in obtaining a remote pilot’s license is that a candidate must first take and pass the aeronautical knowledge test and then complete the FAA Airman Certificate and/or Rating Application to receive a Remote Pilot Certificate. Study materials are readily available and the test costs approximately $150 taken at a Knowledge Testing Center.
Public aircraft operations under a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization
The second method of UAS authorization, Public Aircraft Operations under a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization, provides for defined mission parameters and greater leeway in flight approval, while allowing for flight waivers. This is the short-term advantage in the PAO COA certification route for drone flights – a specific mission statement with defined waivers suitable for continued use by an emergency response agency.
While a certified pilot can fly either civil or public operational flights, PAO COA can only be classified as a flight by “public aircraft” and requires flight mission approval functioning as a public operation with a public aircraft. Remember, however, fire departments are classified as public agencies under federal code.
Public unmanned aircraft missions under PAO COA can be described in general terms such as search and rescue, wildland fire analysis, safety inspections and the like. This allows unlimited public flights over a specified period of time and subject only to renewal review.
Just as with Remote Pilot Certification, these exceptions to PAO are called waivers and such exemptions can be applied for as completely separate addendums in the form of a COA.
During special circumstances and in controlled airspace, depending on the needs of the operation or mission described in the PAO, a COA under PAO can allow an unmanned aircraft to be flown:
- At night
- Over people
- From a moving vehicle
- Outside the line of sight
- Above 400 feet in altitude
Waivers can be applied for individually or in groupings.
In an effort to streamline the application process, the FAA has developed three general COA classifications:
- Blanket COA. This is a general waiver with minor exceptions that allow most agencies to meet 75 percent of their mission objectives.
- Jurisdictional COA. A jurisdictional waiver expands the access area beyond the limitations imposed by a blanket COA, specifically in the area of restricted airspace.
- Special government Interest (Emergency COA). An Emergency COA allows for a one-time operation based on imminent risk to life where a manned aircraft is deemed too hazardous.
Application process for PAO COA
The typical application process for a public aircraft operations certificate with appropriate waivers (PAO COA) begins with a technical and operational review of proposed actions, including operational description, performance envelope, avionics and equipment, communications and flight information data. Such an application can be approved within 60 days of receipt provided there are no errors or issues in the application. The criteria for submission are available from the unmanned aircraft section of the FAA website.
Service priority
Whether applying for an RPC or requesting a PAO COA, civil operational requests receive the highest priority as these are flights conducted by first responders and other associated federal, state and local agencies tasked with life safety and property conservation objectives.
In the appendix of governmental functions, participants are defined as those individuals participating in national defense, intelligence missions, firefighting, search and rescue, law enforcement and aeronautical research, as well as those working in biological or geological resource management.
The Federal Aviation Administration’s new online DroneZone Portal can expedite first responder applications through its Special Governmental Interest (SGI) process. Instructions are specified in 14 CFR Part 375.
Training for pilot certification is available on the FAA’s safety website. Applicants are encouraged to review the Airman Certification Standards (ACS) for Unmanned Aircraft Systems, the Remote Pilot Study Guide, and the online sample questions before taking the Knowledge Test.

Dr D B Kumar IAS Coaching Centre In Hyderabad Reviews – Top IAS Coaching in Hyderabad
Dr. D.B. Kumar IAS coaching centre which is located in Hyderabad is one of the good institutes in Hyderabad. The institute aims at providing good quality and standardized coaching for IAS aspirants who want to excel in their UPSC examinations. There are various factors which makes this institute equitable with other institutes of the locality and each factor is taken a serious look in this review which makes the aspirants identify the pros and the cons of the institute before choosing it.
The main things that are to be considered are explained as below.
Courses Offered in Dr. D.B. Kumar IAS Coaching Centre In Hyderabad – Best IAS Coaching in Hyderabad
The general studies course that is offered for IAS aspirants is the main course that is offered in this institute.
In addition to this, three main courses are offered by the institute. The courses along with the fee that is charged is mentioned as below.
• The Indian Polity, Governance and constitution model which is offered at a rate of Rs.18,000 which includes the curriculum for both prelims as well as main examination.
• The Indian Econoomy module for prelims and main examinations which are available at the rate of Rs14,000
• The Ecology and Environmental module which is available at a rate of Rs. 12,000 and this also encompasses both prelims and final examinations.
The validity for all these courses happens to be about 60 days which also has a 15 days additional window for revision of the entire course.
Each of these modules also include 40+lecture sessions and are capable enough to cover all the necessary items within these sessions.
Course Material – Best UPSC Coaching in Hyderabad
The course material is prepared directly under the supervision of the founder and it is to be noted that it is completely in lines with the prescribed syllabus for IAS aspirants. They have taken extra care to prepare the syllabus which comprises of all the necessary things and also the general updates that is required for the UPSC aspirants to keep their knowledge up to date. Some of the sessions are also uploaded online so that the students get an access to the teachings at their own comfort. The conceptual clarity is one of the highlights of the course material and especially the courses on Geography and General studies is much of an attraction in this institute. They do not have much of a test series in their overall curriculum. Only some weekly tests are present and reviews pertaining to those tests. This can be improved as such. There are also a number of demo classes that is available and these demo classes help the students to get a taste of the institute before making the decision of joining it.
Faculty – Top UPSC Coaching in Hyderabad
The institute has a rich array of experienced faculty who are well versed in the field of teaching exclusively for IAS aspirants. The general classes and other optional classes are taken by Dr.D.B.Kumar who himself is an IAS officer and has a long experience in coaching the students.
Since the batch strength is limited to about 20-30 students, the faculty to students ratio is excellent and by this individual attention can be given to the students.
The students have reported that the faculty are very friendly and take utmost care in resolving to the doubts of the students.
Infrastructure – Best IAS Coaching in Hyderabad
This parameter also acts to be good enough and also advantageous for the institute. Since it is located in a prime spot, it is easily accessible for the students to come and learn. The classrooms are spacious enough to accommodate the small batch strength of 20-30 and can house enough members so as to enable hazzle learning for the students. The absence of a full-fledged library is one of the disadvantages in this case as the students have to resort to other places to take in reference notes and also take in reference journals, books and so on.
Some of the students have quoted that the location is quite noisy and this causes some amount of disturbance as they progress ahead with their coaching via classroom training.
Assessments and Seminars – Top UPSC Coaching Institutes in Hyderabad
The students are advised to take several assessments as possible, before they take up the prelims and final examinations. These tests are taken in a regular manner and the students are tested based on their classroom learning. These assessments are taken and reviewed by the instructors and the necessary feedback is given to the students. Such feedbacks help the students to gain more knowledge and also help them to correct their mistakes before they take up the main examination.
In order to foster greater learning, debates, discussions and seminars are being conducted in a regular manner. By these methods, the students are able to get fruitful insights from experts and also by the debates they are able to get an exposure from their peers.
Online Presence – Top IAS Coaching Centers in Hyderabad
One of the few areas which the institute has a setback is their presence in the online avenues. They lack an individual website which makes students look for other domains to fund out answers for their queries about the institute. Online tests are also not quite evident. Having said that, many video lectures are otherwise available which is posted directly by the lecturers. These video lectures accessed by many and they have found the content to be useful. Live streaming of many lectures are being made available to the students by one particular website. This in turn helps the students to promote online learning.
Other Advantages – Best UPSC Coaching Institutes in Hyderabad
The institute has been vital in creating many All India Ranks in the UPSC examination. Some of the exemplary examples include Andra Vansi(IAS) and also Bharat Kumar Gupta(IAS). Both of them were students of this institute and have managed to ace the examination with flying colours. The overall experience of the faculty is yet another advantage of the institute and they are still continuing in bringing laurels.
Taking all these factors into consideration, it can be said that, the Institute provides quality coaching to the students with advantages of location, course materials, faculty, infrastructure and so on. The various people who have passed the examinations are examples of how the institute trains the students.

Somi‘s recent sharing on the show Turkids On The Block to promote the full album XOXO has sparked controversy.
Everyone knows that Somi has a good relationship with many celebrities, which can be clearly seen through her SNS. But when choosing her close friends in showbiz, Somi did not hesitate to answer: “I’m closest to TWICE. Up to now, they still treat me very well.” “I don’t have many friends. People often think that I’m close to many people in showbiz, but that’s not true. I also want to find friends.” – Somi added.
The female idol admitted that she is not as close to many Kpop idols as many people think. Only her friends during the trainee time, such as TWICE, are close to her in showbiz.
However, this statement infuriated many netizens because Somi and BLACKPINK members had repeatedly demonstrated their close relationship as sisters, especially after Somi officially joined The Black Label – the company founded by Teddy, BLACKPINK‘s main producer.
BLACKPINK has repeatedly expressed their support for Somi’s new products, even visiting the studio to cheer on her. But when it comes to her closest colleagues, Somi always chooses TWICE. Therefore, many fans of BLACKPINK were disappointed with Somi.
However, Somi has not been supported by TWICE fans. Many people are still not satisfied because she unfollowed the members of TWICE after leaving JYP.
The most contentious incident occurred when Somi shared a screenshot of Jennie‘s SOLO in the first place and TWICE‘s Yes or Yes in second place on the chart. Many fans thought that Somi was flattering Jennie and mocking TWICE through the photo. Thus, until now TWICE’s fans still believe that she is not sincere with TWICE because of her previous actions.Dod.
Prof Ernst,
I’m confused by your statement: “Unless A is an overtly harmful therapy, it is simply not conceivable that A+B does not generate better results than B alone.”
If A is a placebo and the study is double blinded does this statement still hold?
An ‘A+B versus B’ study cannot be double blind and A would not normally be a placebo.
Supposing you are correct that this is an A+B study where A is a placebo effect. This means that the placebo effect (B) can according to the study facilitate significant gain and reductions in HDL, LDL and Total Cholesterol, Triglycerides, Glucose and Uric acid. These are clinical parameters that you would not expect to be changed in patients who have had a few extra nice chats with a homeopath and a placebo sugar pill.
I would suggest then more research on this placebo effect then as quite obviously the full potential of the standard B treatment was not being utilised.
Firstly, the placebo effect is well understood. That is why studies need to be designed in such a way as to eliminate its effects. The B treatment in this case is the real treatment; A the placebo adjunct.
Secondly, deliberately prescribing inert substances is a form of lying to patients and is considered unethical these days… Except of course, by charlatans, who do it all the time. If a patient wants to take some form of alt-med placebo in addition to the real treatment, the doctor’s response tends to be “Take it if it makes you feel better”, providing, of course, that the placebo treatment is not inherently risky: such as IV injections, with the risk of infection, or absorption of a chemical that may interfere with the treatment.
Teapot
This trial shows evidence that a placebo treatment has produced significant changes in clinical parameters- not just a feel good factor. My point is how best to maximise treatment B? Your approach is just to dismiss a significant result as the well known placebo effect. I would suggest that we need to find out more about this placebo effect and how to utilise it without lying to a patient.
these aspects of placebo are well-understood already: administer a treatment with empathy, compassion and time, and you will maximize the placebo response.
So that is repeatable and predictable?
Some call it “white coat” effect. If you take your prescribing from a caring doctor you will get placebo effect, no need sugar pill for that. Studies have shown that, it’s why “remote healing” and other things can create placebo effect without even any visible treatement. The prob is obviously all doctor don’t have the time to be “caring” or they are simply bored or exhausted for other (human beeing).
By memory I remember that placebo effect might come from dopamine release and some people can be more or less sensibilized to it, like some people are more or less prone to depression. Just type placebo – dopamine in medline and you got paper about it.

“So that is repeatable and predictable?”
It is, or we wouldnt design studies with complicated blinded method.Quick Green Tea Summary Points
- Green Tea (Camellia sinensis) is one of the most popular herbal medicines with a wide range of reported benefits
- Many of Green Tea's benefits are ascribed to its catechin content in the form of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)
- As such, many Green Tea extracts come standardised to EGCG content
- Some of Green Tea's most popular benefits include weight loss and correcting factors associated with heart disease and diabetes
- Wide ranging doses of Green Tea have been used in studies, with common doses being between 100 and 500mg
- High quality Green Tea extract tend to be standardised for catechin content
What is Green Tea?
Over the recent years, green tea has possibly been one of the most well studied herbal remedies. It has been linked to a variety of health promoting effects such as thermogenesis and protection from heart disease. There is no doubt that green tea is good for you, but science is only really starting to scratch the surface of the potential of this super food. Green tea is a tea made from the leaves of the plant Camellia sinensis. Although many other teas are made from this same plant, the green tea manufacturing process allows minimal oxidation. This may be the discriminatory factor that gives green tea its many potentially beneficial properties.
Where Does Green Tea Come From?
Green tea originated from China and then spread to many other parts of Asia such as Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and Thailand. In those countries, green tea was used as both a beverage and a traditional medicine. However, over recent years, green tea has also become popular among the western world for its drinking and medicinal qualities.
Green Tea Benefits
Green tea contains a type of polyphenol (group of plant compounds with health promoting effects) known as catechins. Out of the many catechins found in green tea, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the most abundant. These are antioxidants and the “active ingredients” of green tea, so to speak. However, there are also a variety of other important nutrients such as vitamins C and E, chromium, zinc, manages, and selenium. Scientific studies exploring the effects of green tea often use green tea extracts, which contain all the catechins.
Green Tea Benefits for Fat Loss
One of the most interesting properties of green tea is its potentially beneficial use for weight and fat loss. Studies have found that after consuming a green tea extract, subjects experienced a 17% increase in lipid oxidation (Venables et al, 2008) and 4% total energy expenditure (Dulloo et al, 1999) compared to those receiving a placebo. Simply put, green tea increased the amount of fat burn and total energy used. Findings such as these are supported by many others. The drinking of four cups of green tea was reported to reduce the body weight of healthy people by almost 1 kg, and body fat by 2.4% in only 14 days. The authors of this study go on to say that this effect may be even more pronounced in the obese (Al-Dukaili et al, 2009). A longer study showed that the consumption of green tea over 12 weeks, along with a controlled diet was able to cause almost double the reduction in body weight and fat mass in comparison to a control (Nagao et al, 2005). I could go on with examples of research supporting green tea as a fat loss aid, but we’ll be here all day, because of the sheer amount of supporting evidence. Some might argue that the thermogenic properties of green tea is due to its caffeine content. However, it has been shown that when given equal amounts of caffeine, people do not experience the same level of thermogenesis (Dulloo et al, 1999).
Green Tea Benefits for Heart Disease
There are many risk factors associated with heart disease, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol. In many of the above mentioned studies, these factors were also investigated. It has been found that along with weight loss, subjects given green tea also experienced reductions in blood pressure (Al-Dukaili et al, 2009) as well as decreasing total and bad LDL cholesterol, possibly be reducing cholesterol absorption (Al-Dukaili et al, 2009; Kim et al, 2011).
Green Tea Negatives and Side Effects
Green tea is well tolerated and often consumed in large quantities (over a litre a day) among millions of people worldwide. However, there are some things you should take note of. The most obvious one is caffeine. If you are sensitive to caffeine, it may be a good idea to avoid green tea products before bed. Some mild side effects have been reported in small groups of people from consuming large amounts of green tea (8 to 16 cups a day). These mainly relate to digestive complaints (Chow et al, 2003). It may help to reduce side effects if green tea is not consumed on an empty stomach. There have also been some reported cases of green tea interfering with the action of some anti-cancer drugs, and has also been recommended that pregnant women should avoid green tea. It is important to keep in mind that green tea extracts are more concentrated than the beverage. Therefore it is wise to remain within the product's recommended dosage.
A recent study has shown that protein may actually inhibit the absorption of EGCG and other catechins in green tea (Egert et al, 2013). For this reason, it may be a good idea to separte green tea and protein from being consumed together if you wish to get the most out of your green tea. Given that high protein diets are common for bodybuilders and those wishing to burn fat, this may pose a challenge.
Green Tea Recommended Dosage and Ingredient Timing
Generally, studies performed on green tea have employed fairly concentrated doses. These range anywhere between 90 to 800 mg catechins. This equates to a lot of tea. Portions can be broken up and taken with meals, up to three times a day. It has recently been shown that catechins may be up to 3 times better absorbed when taken along side citric acid (lemon/organe juice), vitamin C, and xylitol (an artificial sweetener) (Shim et al, 2011).. Furthermore, in fat loss mixtures, green tea is very rarely the sole ingredient. So you need to consider that although the concentration of catechins may be low, they are also working in conjunction with the cocktail of other weight loss ingredients in the product.
Stacking Green Tea Supplements
Green tea extracts go well together with other fat loss products like fat loss proteins and fat metabolisers. However, if you are already using a powerful thermogenic supplement, or a fat loss supplement with high amounts of green tea extract it may not be a good idea to stack that with a full strength green tea extract. Also, knowing the increased absorbablity of green tea in the presence of vitamin C and citric acid, taking the supplement with a vitamin C supplement or orange juice may be beneficial.

The most common types of benign mole include: Compound melanocytic nevi, which are usually raised above the skin, light brown and sometimes hairy. Dermal melanocytic nevi, which are usually raised, pale and sometimes hairy. Junctional melanocytic nevi, which are usually brown, round and flat.
What are harmless moles called?
Benign nevi are normal moles. They are not a sign of melanoma, or skin cancer. Benign nevi have a very low chance of turning into skin cancer. Dysplastic nevi are also called atypical nevi.

Most moles are benign and no treatment is necessary. Some benign moles may develop into skin cancer (melanoma). See below for signs. Larger than normal moles (more than a half inch across), atypical moles are not always round.
What are cancerous moles called?
The first sign of melanoma is often a mole that changes size, shape or color. This melanoma shows color variations and an irregular border, both of which are melanoma warning signs. Melanomas can develop anywhere on your body.
What does benign mole cancerous?
Most people have some skin marks, such as freckles and moles. These may multiply or darken over time. Benign means they are not cancer..
Are changing moles always cancerous?
No, changing moles do not always equate to skin cancer and most moles are usually harmless. It can be normal for moles to change in number and appearance; some can also disappear over time. For example, hormonal changes during puberty and pregnancy can cause moles to increase in number and become darker.
Do moles get bigger with age?
Moles may change over time. They may get bigger, grow a hair, become more raised, get lighter in color, or fade away. Many people develop new moles until about age 40. Most of these are normal changes.Description

With all of its devastation and challenges, the past year shone a light on critical issues that many believe will, and should, deeply inform Jewish education beyond the pandemic. As continues to be evident from the contributions in this eJP series from leading figures, understanding our learners as whole people who need the benefits and support that good education offers remains a high priority for Jewish education. Whereas once many educators may have declared that the purpose of Jewish education was to make people more Jewish, we now hear that for Jewish education to be successful it must help to make individuals stronger versions of themselves and more integrated and influential members of the communities in which they live. What the following contributors emphasize is that whether it’s in classrooms, campsites, conference centers, or online, we are witnessing a Jewish education sector that has risen to the occasion of this pandemic, and in doing so also begun to pave a way for thriving Jewish education into the future.

A financing solution that raised the client’s credibility and traction in the competitive telecoms market
The client
PT Hauwei Tech Investment is a subsidiary of Huawei Technologies (HWI), an Indonesia-based global leader of ICT solutions. The company’s telecom network equipment, IT products and solutions and smart devices are used in 170 countries. Huawei was ranked 228th in the Global Fortune 500 in 2014, based on revenues.
The challenge
HWI signed a long-term contract for the sale of telecoms equipment. The contract value was USD 100m, but the transaction involved financing supply of the first USD 30m of sales. Being a new entity, the buyer wanted a long-term financing. HWI offered the buyer financing in two parts: a medium-term financing under a three-year deferred payment agreement signed between HWI and the buyer; and a longer-term buyer financing solution to be arranged by a Chinese bank to replace medium-term financing.
The solution
Deutsche Bank was involved in the first part of the medium term financing. A total facility of USD 30m with a tenor of three years was secured by issuance of promissory notes from the buyer/obligor, resulting in non-recourse to the seller.
To cover the credit risk of the obligor, Deutsche Bank obtained a corporate guarantee from the obligor’s parent. In addition, the exposure was secured by credit insurance cover to the extent of 90% of each promissory note discounted.
A unique element of this transaction was that the underlying sale transaction occurred under Indonesian law, the financing was structured under Singapore law and the credit cover through insurance was under Chinese law. This transaction was the winner of one of Treasury Today magazine’s Adam Smith Awards.
Benefits for the client
The well-structured bridge finance solution allowed the seller to clinch its selling proposition to its client to eliminate competition. This was important to the client given the obligor wanted longer-term funding. Moreover, organising long-tenor financing without a bridging medium-term financing offer would be difficult.
HWI was able to provide a financing solution to its buyer while avoiding taking any risk onto its own books, including performance risk of its equipment. The deal raised Huawei’s credibility and increased its traction in the highly competitive telecoms market.
The reaction
Nate Zhou, Customer Finance Manager, PT Huawei Tech Investment: “We were very pleased with Deutsche Bank’s world-class solution which enabled Huawei to not only reduce the receivable with a long tenor, but also totally decreased the payment risk of our customer and help us win an important supply contract. Furthermore, Deutsche Bank’s industry expertise significantly helped in developing our business with our strategic banking partner.”Daria +380632272420

Vintage is a key reference to assess the quality of a wine. Each vintage is unique. It is the memory of the climate and of the major events during the year for a winemaker. With the appellation and the Domaine, the vintage helps to estimate the ageing potential and to foresee the best drinking date.
Some of the great vintages of the 20th and 21th century: 1906, 1908, 1919, 1923, 1928, 1929, 1934, 1937, 1945, 1947, 1949, 1955, 1959, 1961, 1962, 1964, 1966, 1969, 1971, 1976, 1978, 1985, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2015, 2016…
Place des Grands Crus is full of rare vintages and offers a large selection going from 1906 to the most recent vintages, coming from private cellars or directly from the Domaines.
1959
1959 is an exceptional vintage in Burgundy! We hadn’t had so much sun since the end of the Second War. Thanks to short repeated rains in September which gave to the vineyard all it needed after a hot and dry summer. The harvest was excellent. The red wines have a great complexity and a beautiful length on the palate. The white wines, rarer, offer a silky texture that mixes the aromas of praline, honey and crème brûlée.
1961
One of the proofs that the difficult climatic conditions can give an excellent vintage. In fact, coulure and millerandage made small and compact grapes, of beautiful quality. The vineyard was able to fight a dry and hot summer. If the wine was austere at the beginning, it has masterfully balanced itself with time. Some well-known producers such as Bernard Clair consider this vintage as the finest they had to vinify. A great reference !
1971
A great vintage, which was a reference for all the winegrowers, even though the quantity was not there. The rain and hail were intense, compromising the harvest on some plots, especially in Côte-de-Beaune. However, the grapes had a remarkable concentration, guaranteeing a great maturity, but requiring patience! The 1971 wines did not open until the 90’s, and today they are still predicting an apogee that will last a long time. A refined velvet, generous flavors, mixing stewed fruits and a touch of coffee bean, here is the signature of this vintage.
1976
1976 is a good vintage which could have been exceptional! An intense drought from July to September has limited the yield and gave an important concentration to the grapes. In the 90s, the wines were still too tannic. They open with time, have powerful aromas, fruit and velvet. But they lack a little ethereal elegance that we except from a great vintage. It is made for ageing which requires patience to reach the plénitude.
1978
According to Henri Jayer, this vintage was the best of the century, even if it started very badly. A cold year, a late maturity, and a bad start of summer could have deprived us of this sensational result. And yet, if at the end of August, nobody seemed to believe in this harvest, an extraordinary September and an exceptional October made the panache of the vintage! 10 hours of sunshine a day and a north wind during the late season brought in a low quantity harvest, but gave a “very beautiful texture, very tender, but with a lot of flesh and tremendous power tannic, “said Henri Jayer. It is said of 1978, brilliant today, that it is ready to live another century !
1990
Another very exceptional vintage, marked by a long spring, favoring coulure and lack of ripening. A hot and dry summer, rains in August arriving at the right time and a sunny month of September allowed to obtain a harvest in perfect conditions. The concentration of the wine is remarkable; long on the palate, very well balanced, most probably going toward a long ageing.
The beautiful balance, however, allows the less patient to enjoy their exquisite flesh right now! 1990 is “the great vintage of pleasure”! In white, this vintage is a little less complex than 1989; but white wines are notoriously racy, bold, charming.Questions:?

Baccarat is an extremely popular card game that is played regularly for the most part casinos. It’s a comparing usually played between two players, usually with a bank of nine women or men. Each baccarat coup includes three possible outcomes: player, banker, and tie. When the player declares “I win” all players immediately take a credit from their player account; the total amount you credit is add up to the money in your pot. The banker then calls the winning hand and all players immediately take a credit from their banker’s player account; the amount you take is also equal to the amount of money in your pot.
If you can find no other players in the baccarat game, all players collectively bet exactly the same amount because the maximum amount allowed by the casino where in fact the game is being played. The overall game is usually played in single player versions, where each player gets the same amount as in the first scenario. However, it can be played with two or more players by removing the initial player from the betting game and replacing him with a fresh player; the new player would go to the place where the final player stood.
This is of baccarat game is easy to describe. In this card game, you can find twenty-eight cards, which are easily explained. The ace, king, queen, jack, ten, and one will be the basic suits, and each card possesses a specific value when dealing. So, you may either call the ace if it has a value higher than the queen or vice versa. You may also call the king if it includes a higher value than the queen or vice versa. If there are fourteen other cards in the deck, you may call the cards up to thirteen times, counting for theces.
Now, as long as the bets are at least five credits each, there is absolutely no way you can lose at baccarat games. However, what you should do is maximize your bankroll. In order to win real money, it is best to play small bets initially, while gradually upping your bankroll over time. Additionally it is far better play with larger banksroll; however, this is simply not always possible, since some players have to start out with small amounts before they have to know how much you will probably win. To determine the quantity of your winnings, you should multiply the total number of players for the baccarat game with the amount of cards dealt to them. For anyone who is playing baccarat online with two players, also you can be prepared to win from seventy-five percent of the total number of cards dealt to your two opponents. This percentage is particularly saturated in land-based baccarat games, where players usually deal seven cards to each player.
Additionally it is easy to calculate how much your winnings in online baccarat games. You can find two simple methods to do so: one, the progressive method, and the no-call method. The progressive method, as the name suggests, provides player additional money if he or she doubles his or her initial bet. The no-call method, on the other hand, does not give the player any money if she will not call the bet. Both of these methods work with a point system, which means that the player wins when he or she reaches a specific amount, and loses when he or she loses the same amount.
Because the game goes on, players can transform their side bets from time to time. This is especially ideal for players who need sudden money. In baccarat online, changing side bets is also possible, but this might be risky because it requires them to improve their currencies in one currency to another, such as for example from the US dollar to the Euro. This can be very dangerous, because losing a substantial amount of money all at one time isn’t advisable. So instead, it is best to play slowly, and then switch to changing your bets.
Also, baccarat players have the option to decide whether to place their bets with or without chips. Some players prefer to bet without chips, while some think that it’s far more convenient to place their bets with them. Whichever method you choose to play, always remember that you must trust the banker, and that you’ll lose everything at some point or the other.Hi ... I have been using Muvee AutoProducer 5 with great success and recently upgraded to Muvee Reveal X ... In AutoProducer 5, I ran into an aspect ratio problem whenever I had 480x640 videos (created by a Canon Powershot SD850 shot holding vertically instead of horizontally ... then rotated 270 degrees using VirtualDub ... and converted to either xvid or mp4 using WinAVI) ... the image appears to be stretched after creating the muvee using any style. When I upgraded to Reveal X ... the aspect ratio stretch issue still remains. The strange thing is when the video is loaded into the project and previewed, it appears stretched initially, then it reverts back to the proper aspect ratio when preview playing.
But when the project is built into a muvee, the end product result is stretched ans scaled (making it look short and fat).
Is there any way to correct this through some default config files? ... I didn't see any settings control over video masking or sizing ... I have a muvee all ready to go for youtube, but the video generation is buggy making it not ready for prime time. Please advise.
Do you need the video(s) uploaded to your ftp server?

Gilad Atzmon Concert Cancelled )
21 comments :
As a jazz fan and generally a supporter of free speech, I am concerned to hear that the Gilad Atzmon concert has been cancelled. Unless the staff at the Star and Shadow have suddenly decided they don't like Gilad's playing, they presumably have made a political decision and it is incumbent on them to give some explanation to the public who were planning to attend as to the basis for their decision. I don't know the detail of his political views but they seem to be pretty publically available for those interested and presumably the film would say something about them. Of course, people could watch it or not, as they choose. Things are in a pretty bad state if you can only hear jazz if the politics of the player fits those of the venue. JC
Must say I'm shocked. It certainly suggests that the Star and Shadow didn't do their homework in the first place. Gilad Atzmon's political views are so well documented that the decision should have been taken long before the booking was accepted and publicized. As it is, the decision seems to go against the principles of free speech. And we'll all lose out on hearing a brilliant musician.
It would be interesting to hear why an artist's personal views on any subject - whether it be religion, politics, morals or anything, should be a reason to scrap a performance of the quality of Gilad Atzmon. What are they trying to do? Ensure that the dwindling audiences for jazz disappear altogether? The other question is, of course, why leave it so late? I always thought that the art forms had risen above the small mindedness of the petty quarters of society. Let's face it, if any of us were to base our patronage on agreeing with an artist's personal beliefs, the concert halls would be pretty much empty most of the time. Unless there is a reason that I can't think of, and hasn't been detailed, I certainly won't be subscribing to any promotions at this venue in the near future. And I hope it hasn't been cancelled just because someone with an alternative viewpoint to that of the artist is using it as a pathetic way to reinforce their own beliefs. I won't use the terminology here but we do have laws against that sort of thing. I'm sure you know what I am alluding to. I am not only disgusted but very concerned and would be interested to hear why his political views were thought as grounds for cancellation. I don't give a toss about the whole thing, I just know we have been deprived of a great night of fantastic music form a very skilled musician.
Sorry to hear about this. We had a lot of pressure to cancel the recent Orient House Seven Jazz Leeds gig too, with some not too subtle intimidation. The gig was brilliant - as they usually are from Gilad - his new Orient House album is lovely. I personally think we have to stand up to these pressures but don't underestimate the impact - most jazz organisers give their time voluntarily for fun and just won't want all this baggage.
Steve Crocker
Seven Jazz Leeds
So if someone holds strong views that are not concordant it's now "baggage"? I don't care if they are volunteers or not, they are not there to impose their own personal political or religious beliefs. If they don't like it tell them to dedicate their time elsewhere. If this attitude had prevailed over the years, we would have been deprived of many of the jazz greats that held views that clashed with the brainwashed and bigoted in society. There is no room in the arts for this type of thing.
I have Gilad Atzmon and Orient House Ensemble booked for three events in Shetland and I'll certainly not be cancelling them on the basis of slanderous rubbish like this. There seems to be a highly politicised group who are making determined efforts to get Gilad's gigs cancelled by telling huge porkies about him. I'm just sorry that Star and Shadow people fell for this muck. People who try to take away an artist's trade (not to mention the other band members) have a warped sense of their own self-importance.
Jeff Merrifield
Not wanting to comment on whether the film/gig should have been cancelled or not I think if you go to Gilad's website you will see it's not all 'slanderous rubbish' unless of course you agree with the sentiments. For example this is a post about an alleged rape victim
And this another aout the attack by Italian Facists on Innocent football supporters
No platform for racists or fascists!
1. There is nothing 'slanderous' about this. Nor are there any porkies. Atzmon's views are publicly available for all to see on his website. The decision to cancel the gig was made by consensus at the S&S meeting (so not a majority) and those who made the decision had read Atzmon's writings and discussed them at length.
2. This is not about free speech. The S&S did not object because Atzmon has 'controversial' views. They objected because he contributes to oppression against Jewish people and women..
4. Atzmon is clearly the egoist here. He says a rape allegation is false (he cannot possibly know this) and that it has been fabricated because the alleged perpetrator has shared a platform with him.
5. Atzmon's political beliefs cannot be separated from his music because he uses his music to promote his political beliefs.).
8. Perhaps people on here might want to reflect on how the Palestinian movement has sought to distance itself from Atzmon. You don't combat the racism of the Israeli state with a racism of your own.
I agree with what David has said, and I'd emphasise that, while Gilad Atzmon repeatedly claims that his views are controversial because they are anti-zionist, that simply isn't true. Plenty of people with anti-nationalist views, and who have worked in the Palestinian solidarity movement, were amongst many others who raised problems with Atzmon's views with the Star and Shadow.
As for talk of a 'highly politicized group', or arguments that politics shouldn't intervene in music: god forbid that Jazz should be in any way influenced by a serious political consideration of racism. Something which clearly never happened in the history of Jazz, ever.
Seriously, If you think Jazz should just be 'about the music' and never consider or contain the political and racial views of its musicians, no wonder your audiences are declining if you treat it as such a neutral, reductive commodity.
David I accept every word you say.
Those who scream freedom of speech are ignorant's, that play by the flute of Racist Atzmon.
He is Not and Anti Zionist, he is a Anti Jews and a racist, that promoted his music career with his ex Jew Ex Israeli story.
Now he tries to push his fading out Political and racist views by his music.
Did some of the people ask them-self why do all Palestinian groups pushing Atzmon away.
Because of his Racist Anti Jewish views.
The evening that was canceled was not about Music.
Its using Music to push Racist views of a disturbed person.
Hello everybody..
Gilad Atzmon here..
Just to put words in context. I can see a bunch of people, pretty much anonymous, slandering my name and reputation in a typical orchestrated manner. I am used to it by now and I take it as a proof for the validity of the argument i try to push. If I, i, a person who grew up in Israel and served in the IDF, cannot criticise Israel and Jewish identity politics, then no one can!!
However, in case someone fail to realise, my ideas and writings have been endorsed and praised by the greatest and most credible humanists around. Just to list a few below.
"A transformative story told with unflinching integrity that all (especially Jews) who care about real peace, as well as their own identity, should not only read, but reflect upon and discuss widely." Professor Richard Falk (United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories)
"Fascinating and provocative" Professor John J. Mearsheimer
)
"Atzmon’s insight into the organism created by the Zionist movement is explosive." Professor William A. Cook

Do I have to provide you with anymore?
and mind you, these are people who read my work inside out, some of them were subject to horrendous campaign ala David Bell and they stood firm behind me..
If I were a Bell....
David Bell, 1. There is nothing 'slanderous' about this. Nor are there any porkies. Atman’s views are publicly available for all to see on his website. The decision to cancel the gig was made by consensus at the S&S meeting (so not a majority) and those who made the decision had read Atzmon's writings and discussed them at length.
Gilad: We have heard the reports from the meeting, It wasn’t exactly an ‘academic gathering’. As it seems, you are also not familiar with my writing or thoughts. `for this meeting to be fairly held, I should have been notified and become aware of the accusations leveled against me with the minimal right to reply.
2. This is not about free speech. The S&S did not object because Atzmon has 'controversial' views. They objected because he contributes to oppression against Jewish people and women.
G: This is laughable, If Bell was familiar with my writing he would obviously know that I am not opposing Jews. We have Jews in the band, at a certain stage the OHE was 75% Jewish, I am married to a Jewish woman. However, I am certainly critical of Jewish politics and ideology and as far as I am aware opposing ideology and politics is still kosher in this country. The argument about women is just to idiotic to address.
this morning I listed dozens of major academics and humanists who support my work. Would any of them stand for an antisemite? a racist? or a women hater? I guess you all know the answer….
G: This is obviously a very sad argument. The reference to the football match was 1. Critical and cynical 2. Said in reference to a picture of a Free Palestine Billboard 3. If Bell thinks otherwise, he should immediately attend a police station and issue a complaint against me . Needless to say, that I ve never questioned by police in the UK or anywhere else!
But If Bell fails to see, it is my relentless fight against some of the strongest lobbies on this planet that buy me so many supporters all over the world. I wasn't intimidated by Israel or the Mossad, and certainly won't surrender to an idiotic pseudo Marxist Sayan with zero intellectual integrity!
4. Atzmon is clearly the egoist here. He says a rape allegation is false (he cannot possibly know this) and that it has been fabricated because the alleged perpetrator has shared a platform with him.
G: I case Bell doesn’t know, out of his SS cinematic collective people are innocent unless proved guilty. Accordingly, Martin Smith is innocent. As far as I am aware, there is no complaint issued against him in the police. And the SWP commission vindicated him. So unless proved otherwise, Martin Smith is NOT a sex offender , and let me assure you, that if it is proved otherwise , I will be the first to comment and retract. But then, if Smith is innocent, as he is, then this David Bell is engaged here in a vile slanderous campaign against two innocent people: Smith and myself. Interestingly enough, Bell’s action actually proves that I am correct. He clearly chase me for my views, yet for some reason, he drags Martin Smith in and slander his reputation presenting him as a rapist.
cont'
5. Atman’s political beliefs cannot be separated from his music because he uses his music to promote his political beliefs.
G: Atzmon doesn't have a political belief and doesn't use the stage as a platform to promote ideas which he doesn't hold. Atzmon comments on humanist and ethical matters and often use the stage to promote such views. Atzmon believes that Artist should wor towards Truth, Justice and Peace...I advise Bell to spend £15 and attend Atzmon gig so he, knows , at least , what is it that he tries to stop. Because as far as i can tell , Bell is in the dark... I am one of the most successful jazz artist in this country, i sell out pretty much every concert , and if Bell really believe that British music lovers would follow a ‘racist’ act he is either 1. mad. 2. stupid 3, foreign to British culture 4. probably a mixture of the three.
G: Bell, You are yet to prove me being neither anti semitic or misogynist, but you managed to prove yourself lacking intellectual capacity, let alone minimal intellectual integrity.).
G: I have heard reports from the meeting, it was not exactly the academy of science and revolutionary thoughtsCan you summarise my thoughts mr Bell? If not i will help you. .:...
8. Perhaps people on here might want to reflect on how the Palestinian movement has sought to distance itself from Atzmon. You don't combat the racism of the Israeli state with a racism of your own.
G: The Palestinian movement didn't distance itself from me. Some elements within the Palestinian movement stood up against me. This is unfortunate but totally acceptable. But it has been now proven by Cambridge academic Blake Alcott that non of the arguments against me were actually valid.. to read more
Alcott proved that Palestinians who criticised never read my work..In fact some of them admitted that they indeed failed to read me. me I guess that like in the case of Bell, Ali Abunimah & co didn't do their homework and were exposed by now. However, you can look at the list of endorsers, many of them are leading Pls activists, academics and writers.
In a free society people are entitled to disagree, but silencing campaign is symptomatic to fear.. and reading Bell emails to promoters expose a lot of such fear. I feel sorry for the man and would offer him a copy of Songs Of The Metropolis, I do believe in my musical therapeutic powers.
Gilad Atzmon (and I assume thats you), Your response to David is frankly nasty- firstly, you insult the intelligence of the venue organizers, then you come out with this gem: "and if Bell really believe that British music lovers would follow a ‘racist’ act he is either 1. mad. 2. stupid 3, foreign to British culture 4. probably a mixture of the three"
now I'm no expert on British music lovers as a whole- I mean, the extent to which the 'British music lover' is even a valid category for debate is suspect- but firstly, that's just wrong- you only need to look at the response from British fans when people like Mark E. Smith and Nick Cave are called out for their views on race and gender respectively to see how little attention some UK fanbases pay to these issues. Sorry, but there's a really strong and nasty streak of racism in UK music history (just read up on what happened in Ska and Punk scenes in the 80s) and you'd do well to note it.
Secondly, suggesting that because David doesn't accept your argument on this, he either a)stupid b) has mental health issues or c) is foreign- is a statement that reveals a real intolerance in your attitude here and frankly, reads kind of racist in itself.
I don't know what kind of knots you, as someone who has just identified as being from a culture you claim is foreign to the UK, tied yourself in to implicitly reject your own views on grounds of origin, but this is the argumentative equivalent of stepping on a rake so it hits you in the face. A racist, unreflective rake.
That's before we get on to the implied stigma of mental health in that sentence.
Atzmon, if you are going to criticize the Star and Shadow meeting for its supposed lack of intellectualism, you will have to defend yourself with something more substantial than simply listing positive quotations about yourself. An appeal to authority is no substitute for debate.
You have not responded to the substance of David Bell's criticisms. However, I don't want to speak for him so I will explain my own opposition to the gig. Having read your writing online, it seems clear to me that your politics is founded upon a racist conception of 'Jewishness'. You defend yourself here by writing:
..."
Well - you are absolutely correct that a critique of Zionism should include a discussion of Jewish culture. However, by even imagining that there is any single thing that could be called 'Jewishness' you betray the possibility of a coherent critique. Rather than approaching the vast diversity of people that identify as Jewish, their diverse practices, thoughts and politics, and the local differences between and within Jewish communities, you invent a category of 'Jewishness' that cannot take this diversity into account.
In the same vein, in order to understand Islamic extremism, we should examine Islamic culture. If, however, we claim that there is some kind of single category called 'Muslim' under which we can gather the rich diversity of Islamic practices, such an examination becomes impossible. More worrying than this, however, is that this attempt to create a single racial or cultural category is inherently racist. We will not explain Islamic extremism by defining 'The Muslim' any more than we can explain or combat Zionism by defining 'Jewishness'. We will, however, fuel hatred and fear.
You describe your comments on the stabbing of a Tottenham supporter as 'critical and cynical' and claim that they were stated in reference to the Free Palestine banner. What you seemingly fail to realize is that making a 'cynical' reference to this act of random violence reveals the racism inherent in your politics. You do not appear to take this attack very seriously. I can only assume that you feel that violence committed against Jews is somehow validated or at least appears only half-serious if it is connected to the Free Palestine movement. I, too, have stood behind banners that read Free Palestine. Do I laugh or make jokes when a Jewish boy is stabbed? No. I don't make light of this because I believe this violence to be deeply saddening and dangerous for the Free Palestine movement itself. You laugh, from what I can tell, because your concept of a Jewish identity seems to legitimize the collective punishment of 'the Jews' (whoever they are) as a response to the crimes of the state of Israel.
I can think of little more profoundly and fundamentally racist than this logic. And it is this logic that pervades all of your comments on Judaism.
"Greta Berlin - Co-Founder, the Free Gaza movement".....
Been pushed out of the BDS because of her Antisemitic VIEWS.... You forgot to put up Racist David Duke which is a big fan of your books too.
Atzmon as most Israelis (he is not Israeli Anymore, but he is an Israeli for the BBC to take part in a show about his HOME COUNTRY MUSIC......) can criticize Israel, as most do.
But you don't criticize Israel, you continue to juggle with your Racist Dialect and think you can fool the world for years.
Well looks like those games are over, you are judged for what you are a Racist.
Without taking sides I have decided to close this thread as the remit of this blog is music not political agendas. I'm sure the participants will find somewhere else to continue the discussion.« April 2014 | Main | June 2014 »

My hands are much happier using this yarn from a local farmer's market. It's from Local Color Fiber Studio, two women creating yarn with local wool and plant dyes. It's so squishy and soft . . . Rambouillet and silk . . . a huge relief after the hemp.
There is some experimenting with short rows going on. I have a pattern sitting right here that tells how to do such things, but I can't be bothered with reading directions right now, I just want to knit. So, I'm winging it.

On Saturday, I came across something from my grandfather. He's not someone who was a part of our lives, other than the wake of baggage that he passed along. The last time I saw him was about twenty-five years ago. I cornered him, asking questions, trying to get to the truth of some of the stories. He waved me off in his growly way.
On Sunday, I learned that he had died the day before.
That afternoon I went looking for fabric to cover the last corner of "uncertainty". I landed on this, loud and obnoxious, named "Journey". I think it was meant to be joyful, I latched onto the map aspect of it, then as I looked closer, began seeing things in it- storms, sea monsters, sea-sickness.
There was this moment, and I can't find the right words for it, but an overwhelming moment, of beginning to let it all in, when I put my hands on it all, and began to shake- from all of the broken and lost pieces of the story, from sadness of not feeling sad, for this man that is gone.
Some manipulation is taking place, making it part of my odyssey for truth and understanding.
Rex, he was a fisherman who lived to be ninety-eight. I wonder what his story was? How did he get from there to here?

I am having a hard time putting together clear thoughts, not just here, but I am moving forward, though it is very slow and quiet, except for the noise in my head.
"Uncertainty" is almost full. Lately, there are days that its clashing of parts hurts my eyes and brain. On others, it seems to hold all the answers.

Buying Guide
- Sensor’s Size
The primary thing to think about before opting for a camera is the size of its Sensor. There are versions of sensors based on their size, i.e., a crop sensor and a full-frame sensor.
The cropped sensor captures sharp pictures with enhanced focal length, but the only problem is that the camera and lenses will behave differently.
Moreover, crop sensors aren’t the best choice when it comes to capturing pictures in dim light. Full-frame sensors are much more efficient in this regard.
But if you seek something affordable in sensors, then crop sensors are the best. This is because they provide satisfactory image quality and are pretty economical.
- Megapixels
For professional food bloggers, considering the number of megapixels in a camera is very important. Higher the number of megapixels, the better the quality of the printed image will be.
- File Size
Another point to decide is whether you want to work on JPEG files or RAW files. JPEG is a basic form and is much suitable for beginners. It is easy to operate and has a smaller file size as compared to RAW.
However, RAW is bigger in file size and is primarily for professionals. It has a better color gamut and has a broad dynamic range.
Furthermore, RAW files can endure heavy editing and won’t lose any data though RAW-supported cameras are pricier.
- Focus Points
Professional photographers rely on manual focusing most of the time. But it is what they are professional at, and not every beginner can do that. Thus most rely on ‘autofocusing.’
Thus, while seeking an ideal camera for food photography, try to opt for the one that has a greater number of focus points. Because the greater their number is, the better you will be able to capture even the tiniest details.
- ISO Level
ISO levels of a camera are important to consider while buying a camera because not all the time would you be relying on a tripod to capture images. In addition, there can be discrete noise levels in your surroundings.
Especially as a food blogger, if you are recording videos in a food market, tackling background noise is utterly important.
And this is where the ISO level steps in. It reduces all the shaking and noise levels and improves the quality of images and videos.
- Lenses
Ensuring a good quality of lenses is undoubtedly very important while purchasing a camera. Also, make sure that the camera does not have fixed lenses; otherwise, you will not be able to make a lens upgrade to your camera.
Verdict
If your budget permits, invest in a full-frame camera if you wish to photograph food professionally. If you can’t afford a new device, acquire a used one from a trustworthy vendor.July 21, 1997 Press Releases

This decade has seen many new concepts cropping up with regard to the concept of astigmatic correction with TORIC IOLs. First, Douglas Koch's path breaking work on Posterior Corneal Astigmatism, followed by the concept of Centroid SIA by Abulafia and others. The concept of Centroid SIA and its importance has been explained in this blog in two separate articles.
A new work and no less promising than what we have been already introduced to is the concept of Total SIA by Dr Jack Holladay.
Straight to business , what is the concept of Total SIA ? Total SIA is the vector difference between the postoperative refractive astigmatism at the corneal plane and the pre operative Keratometry reading. The Total SIA, that is postoperative refractive astigmatism minus preoperative keratometric astigmatism , according to Holladay, will include post operative posterior corneal astigmatism changes, astigmatism resulting from IOL tilt and decentration, etc. However, Holladay cautions that the postoperative refractive astigmatism should be vertexed to the corneal plane to determine the Total SIA.
"For example, if you took someone who had a spherical cornea and you made a temporal incision, what we're finding is that person ends up with a little induced against-the-rule on his refraction even though the K readings show that he got a little with-the-rule. What that tells us is there's more going on than just the change in the front surface of the cornea," Dr. Holladay was quoted to say in an article in Eye World published in February, 2014 by Erin L. Boyle EyeWorld Senior Staff Writer.
Using Total SIA therefore may be an improvement over traditionally calculated SIA, even if such SIA has been calculated on the centroid method. By traditional SIA, I mean the post operative Keratometry values minus the pre operative Keratometry values. As Holladay advocates, the later does not consider the PCA and any astigmatism that may arise from IOL tilt and decentration. We all know, that our eyes do have tilt and decentration. The natural tilt of the IOL in the vertical axis , temporal decentration , may result in an average ATR astigmatism. Holladay says, this may be to the tune of .20D.Holladay also advocates for a stable post operative refraction at six months for Total SIA calculation. This ofcourse is taking into fact the healing effect of corneal incisions.
With Toric IOLs, the parameters needed for analyzing astigmatic changes are far more complex than in lasik or laser based astigmatic keratotomy. In cataract surgery with TORIC IOLs, the parameters required are - a) refraction , b) corneal anterior astigmatism, c) Posterior corneal astigmatism, d) IOL alignment , e) IOL tilt which induces astigmatism with Toric as well as non Toric IOLs, f) effective IOL toricity at corneal plane which can be calculated but not measured. In the editorial in JCRS volume 44 Issue 10, October 2018, Abulafia and other authors proposed the term ACTUAL POSTOPERATIVE REFRACTIVE ASTIGMATISM (at the corneal plane) to understand astigmatism change.
The concept of Total SIA is no doubt a novel addition in the world of astigmatism correction with TORIC IOLs. What remains to be seen, its acceptance, and the ease of calculation through SIA calculators. Keep in mind, a vast majority of surgeons and optometrists are still on the old SIA magnitude of an average of .5 diopters. How the Total SIA will shape up, will depend on a large extent to the shift of this mindset.

I feel good because…I know who I am.
I am not speaking of the roles I am, like mother, daughter, volunteer, sister, event planner, friend… I am talking about the bigger part of knowing who I am.
I am a child of God
“We are not human beings having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having a human experience.” Some of you may have heard these words before, but these words were spoken by a French philosopher, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.
It’s disappointing to me how many times I have forgotten who I am in this life I lead. Then, I take a walk with nature, sit in adoration or look at my children and I am reminded of the miracles all around me. I am reminded in each friend who reaches out to me during this time of hardship that God is in each of them fulfilling the purpose God created them for. I am reminded that God loves me and with each day, I have a purpose to fulfill. He invites us all to live a life filled with love. He invites us all to confront our own inner brokenness and out of that, we are humbled in growth.
He wants us to surround ourselves with people who love us and are not jealous or try to break us down; people who build us up in life and truly know and want what is best for us. Surround yourself with people who value honesty, integrity, morality and service.
Proverbs 12:20 – He who walks with the wise grows wise, but a companion of fools suffers great harm.
At times, we all struggle with who we truly are. We want to be successful, make a mark in this world, be famous, leave a legacy, make money and we may want power. However, I believe the important question we need to ask ourselves is this…
Who did God create me to be?
Many times, I set out in a direction doing one thing, but then God leads me in another direction. I surrendered and allowed prayer and meditation to lead me in the right direction, that doesn’t mean I didn’t feel sorry for myself or get angry, but I didn’t give up! I surrounded myself with people I knew loved me, who wanted what was best for me and who helped me see through all of the suffering that what matters in life is being what God created me to be.
We have a lot of great examples of men and women who have been led to their vocations and made service a part of their job. Bono the lead singer of U2 has delivered some impactful lyrics in his music over the years. He didn’t stop at being a famous singer, he took the gift of music that God gave him and excelled because of his hard work and went on to co-create the ONE campaign, a clothing company that strives to stimulate trade with poverty-stricken countries. He also co-founded its’ sister organization, RED, which partners with iconic brands to raise awareness about the AIDS crisis. His RED organization has raised $350 million to fight AIDS across the world.
Angelina Jolie might have given up one of the best-looking husbands out there however, she used her God given gift of acting and went on to use her vocation as a way to make good in the world. She has drawn so much attention to global issues such as refugee rights, and has embarked on field missions since 2001. The Jolie-Pitt Foundation is dedicated to helping extreme poverty, protecting natural resources and wildlife, and has contributed to Doctors Without Borders.
The third icon I want to bring up and have blogged about is Saint Teresa of Calcutta (Mother Teresa) who was first a teacher, but felt called by God for something greater. She was called to live in the slums helping those who needed her the most. She founded the Missionaries of Charity, a religious order of women dedicated to serving “the poorest of the poor.” Her charity has grown to well over 4000 sisters and thousands of volunteers all over the world.
Oprah Winfrey has said many times, we all can’t be famous, but we all can be GREAT! This is done by excelling in your vocation but never forgetting what we were put on this earth for. We all get so busy in our lives that we miss opportunities. There are chances every day in our profession where we can do great in our job all the while still serving others. Maybe there is a family needing some extra prayers and you pray for them in between conference calls. Maybe there is someone you know who has been going through a tough time and you surprise them with a meal. There might be someone struggling and you send them a card or pick up the phone.
Whatever it is, you do it even when they might not know you did it.
After finding out I had cancer, I realized God was leading me in a different direction. I found myself in prayer a lot and thankfully, he led me to a greater calling which was to start a nonprofit, Living in Abundance. I would set out to gift other women with the “Abundant Pocket Hoodie” so other patients would know I’ve been there and that I care. I wanted them to feel served in this difficult time.
Instead of cancer getting the best of me, God changed it around and helped me use cancer as a platform to do good in this world. It fulfills me knowing when I gift a cancer patient with an “Abundant Pocket Hoodie.” I am serving them which gives me joy and I believe that equals success.
Another reason we may struggle at times with knowing who we are might be because we are called to ALWAYS do the right thing.
That means doing the right thing even when others don’t know you’re doing the right thing. For example, you unload your grocery cart and take it back to the storage area; yes, it is another step but it’s the right thing to do. You may catch yourself tempted by another person to do something hurtful to someone else like gossiping or cheating them and in the end, you are cheating yourself. I can’t say I have ever met an evil person, but I have met people who have done some pretty evil things. This is clearly not who God created them to be. Thus, they don’t know who they are.
When someone harms you, revenge may consume you. Believe me…I have been there. But, just do the right thing and the right thing will lead you to peace. We are all faced with doubt at times, but when we find peace in our lives; we know we are doing the right thing.
Please keep me in your prayers today as I head in for my reconstruction surgery which should take 2-3 hours. It is one more step towards healing, I will have the same restrictions as I had after the last surgery; but I have been told the recovery is much easier.
I leave you with the same words Mother Teresa had hanging on her wall while fulfilling her vocation God called her to. Mother Teresa believed we are all children of God and we all can choose to do the right thing.

Critical Infrastructure Protection
WESCO VALUE ADDED SERVICES
WESCO is more than products. Partnering with key suppliers and industry experts, WESCO offers a full suite of service solutions that help select, customize and assess various products, equipment and processes on your campus.
Turnkey Lighting Services:
WESCO Energy Solutions (WES), a division of WESCO Distribution. Inc., is an innovative Solution Provider of interior and exterior lighting offering energy audits, design, upgrades, integration and installations. Providing this allows members to utilize a company that has more than 50 years of experience to audit, design, and install an energy efficient lighting solution on their campus or facility.
New Construction Lighting Review:
When designing a new building, it's important to understand the specific lighting requirements for all spaces. WESCO, WES and our supplier partners can help customers design an optimal new construction lighting system to save energy, reduce maintenance, inventory, procurement costs, improve productivity and meet environmental standards. WESCO also provides LEED and green strategy expertise to new construction projects.
Data Center Assessment:
Data Center assessments offer an overall health checkup of critical power and cooling systems, catalog existing infrastructure, and identify operational efficiency issues. Recommendations are provided to optimize the existing Data Center based on industry best practices, taking into account future growth projections.
Network Closet Assessment:
Network and communication closets are dynamic areas within a business. Constant moves, additions, and changes occur and often there may not be the proper equipment in place to streamline configurations to ensure maximum availability. The assessment team examines environmental and critical infrastructure conditions and provides recommendations to increase overall closet effectiveness.
Power Distribution Services:
When clients need scalable, customized solutions for power distribution, this set of services can meet their requirements. WESCO experts design and integrate electrical distribution equipment, low voltage and data assemblies, energy management and lighting control systems into a single Integrated Facility Systems (IFS) assembly. This expertise can extend into retrofit applications when new equipment is preferred or required.
Power Quality:
Process and administrative computer requirements today demand high quality power with few, if any interruptions in service. With increased costs for electrical service a complete system power factor and power quality audit is a wise solution. WESCO can provide enhanced power quality solutions through Eaton Engineering Services, Eaton Electrical, and Powerware. As partners, WESCO and Eaton meet with the customer to discuss how this solution for power quality can improve system efficiency, lower repair and operation costs, and improve equipment life. After meeting to determine all elements and scope of work, a complete power factor and quality audit is performed. This includes work on the electrical system and equipment to enhance system quality and efficiency. We will not only provide a report of recommendations, but also provide the equipment and service to implement recommended improvements.
Process-Streamlining:
Applying LEAN concepts such as value stream mapping, cost/time studies, process value assessments, space utilization and error-proofing to existing processes helps customers identify opportunities and potential solutions for quality and productivity improvements. A customized supply chain strategy for addressing existing barriers and waste within a process flow is delivered to customers, helping them achieve their goals and objectives. We can leverage our experience with KAIZEN’s , with several of our black belt certified process experts, to conduct onsite reviews of material management, and vendor consolidation options. This can help a school or agency streamline their internal processes.
Product Standardization:
Using the customer's inventory data, WESCO learns more about the manufacturers currently involved throughout their supply chain to prepare a complete comparative analysis. A dozen different types/styles of an item may be reduced to two or three choices. Details of the study are submitted to the customer for review and ultimate selection of the most appropriate manufacturer to meet their specification and value requirements.

These feelings, and the associated discomforts, are becoming all too common with the “human-doing” experience. Furthermore, this followed by the automatic response to numb the pain, abandon responsibility, distract ourselves from the experience, and/or avoid the issue altogether, all lead to prolonged confusion, mistrust, resentment and unhappiness. And this negative feedback loop ends up reinforcing the exact experience that we are trying to escape in the first place!
We are here to tell you that, if you have a willingness to do the work, we can provide you with the skills, tools, and ultimately clarity, you need to take the next steps towards the life you really want to live.
Change your experience from “human-doing” to “human-being” TODAY!
why this retreat
is different ?
The ability to hear real feedback, and to recognize and confront your own hindrances that keep you from thriving, is not easy. However, if you are eager for real change, and are willing to engage with the process, then this retreat is for you.
This retreat involves building a set of habits and practices that develop an expanded awareness of the drivers of our thinking, our emotions, and our behavior. This discovery can offer greater clarity and direction in terms of manifesting a purposeful pathway into the future - a destination that supports greater meaning, positive emotions and increased well-being.
Our model combines a creative and full spectrum approach through embodied practices that include Yoga, Ayurveda, Somatics, and Mindfulness that all support living well. It is a holistic practice that places how we are being (human-being) in the forefront.
The R&R Retreat offers nourishing practices that will support you in seeing the power of using conscious choice to interrupt old habits, break down perceived barriers and open yourself to the possibility of living more aligned, connected and healthy. We will explore:
ways to prevent and heal many of the imbalances that lead to dis-ease such as human vulnerability and social judgement; two common causes of suffering.
WHAT THE RETREAT WILL LOOKs LIKE:
The R&R Retreat is Peace Retreat’s signature retreat where you can decide how best to spend your days while retreating – designing the right experience for you.
You can choose to rest and relax on your own, or to join some or all of the daily all-level yoga classes, a variety of workshop sessions, explore daily living and wellness practices, receive expert guidance unique to you (private Ayurvedic Session), and much more.
Although we will be exploring meaningful matters, we also offer a dynamic balance of fun, learning and relaxation.

James Madison’s Montpelier in Virginia sports some very attractive interpretive signs that looked so good, I had to figure out how they were made. With a bit of prodding and poking, I discovered they were printed plastic attached with Velcro to a sturdy wooden frame. Very clever! The signs are great looking even after a couple years outside.
Peggy Vaughan, Vice President of Communications and Visitor Services, generously shared that the three signs cost about $900 total: $90 for each 30″x 40″ PVC sign and $210 for each base. The content, design, and bases were created in-house (yes, Montpelier is fortunate to have a graphic designer and master carpenters on staff) and the signs were printed by FedEx Office (formerly Kinkos). This sign was created using Adobe Indesign, saved as a pdf, and printed directly on PVC–the image isn’t as sharp but they last longer outdoors than the alternative method of laminating a printed image onto PVC. Peggy said that, “The big advantage to these signs for us was that they are relatively cheap, and because everything around here is always changing, we did not want to spend $2,000 on a proper museum sign, as we had in the past, that would be out of date before it wore out. And, frankly, even if things don’t change at your museum, your messaging should change from time-to-time to keep up, don’t you think?”
If you’re looking for more ideas for signs at historic sites, I’ve collected dozens of images from places around the world—good, bad, and ugly—on several web albums. Please note that one sign may serve several purposes (e.g., directional AND identification), so look in other categories, too.

First, we have the Chicago Bears vs Detroit Lions, then the Las Vegas Raiders vs Dallas Cowboys, and finally the Buffalo Bills vs New Orleans Saints. Let’s dive into these games individually and try to cash out on Thanksgiving day.
Chicago Bears vs Detroit Lions @12:pm EST
These NFC North rivals have taken the field against one another nearly 200 times, with the Bears owning a 103-75-5 edge and having won six of the last seven meetings. That includes a 24-14 home win in the most recent matchup on October 3, 2021, as a three-point favourite. The Bears are coming into this week after suffering a 16-13 defeat to the Baltimore Ravens. In comparison, the Lions are still searching for their first win of the season.
When these two teams lock up, tightly contested games usually follow. Both teams could be playing their backup quarterback in this contest, with injuries hampering Fields and Goff. If that is the case, the upper hand will go to the Bear’s backup veteran, Andy Dalton, over the Lions’ backup QB, Tim Boyle, who was Green Bay’s third-string QB earlier this year. The Bear’s have been showing fight these past few weeks and have the better, more experienced QB. Look for the Bears the get the victory over the winless Lions on Thanksgiving.
Las Vegas Raiders vs Dallas Cowboys @4:30pm EST
The Las Vegas Raiders have lost their last three games, one being on the road to the New York Giants as they go into the Cowboys’ AT&T Stadium on Thanksgiving, searching for a win. In contrast, the Cowboys are 1-2 in their last three games as they suffered an embarrassing defeat to the Kansas City Cheifs last week.
I’m going with the Cowboys for the bounce-back win after last week’s terrible performance. The defence wasn’t too bad last week, but the offense was hard to watch. I look forward to seeing the Cowboys put together a complete game this week and defeat a rattled Raiders team. The Raiders couldn’t do anything right last week against the Bengals, going 1-for-7 on 3rd downs and committing two turnovers.
Buffalo Bills vs New Orleans Saints @8:20pm EST
This matchup comes with two average offenses on paper, with the Bills ranked number 14 in DOVA and the Saints ranking number 15. But we don’t have to see it on paper to know that Josh Allen and the Bills could put up 40 points in any given matchup, same going for Sean Payton and his offensive schemes. That being said, these two teams both own elite defenses on the opposite side of the ball, with the Bills ranked number 1 and the Saints ranking number 6.
The Bills are the better offense, but they haven’t played like it. Now they’ll have to try and better in a chaotic road environment. Still, I have the better confidence in Bills’ QB Josh Allen over Saints’ backup QB Trevor Semian. I’m going with the better & healthier team, the Bills to get the win on the road.Humana Inc. to Present at the Inaugural BofA Securities Home Care Conference:

Looks like the 'splash screen' at start-up is not functioning correctly (all white). For the rest now working correctly but would like to see it working perfectly again.
You can also try a Factory reset first.
And can you check if its posible to redistibute the latest update to his device.
Asked my team to review the logs but could not find any issues from our side.
@kbaetens
Our 2nd Line team has pushed a scrip that will repair the installed Navkit(firmware). Please connect the device to MyDrive Connect and let the jobs process.
The device might reboot during this time.
Thank you, Vikram
@VikramK : how do I run this script you refer to in this post? Can every Rider 550 user run/access it?
A manual push of the script should only be required is the device is not able to self repair itself by reinstalling the firmware.
Have you tried the recovery mode- ?
Regards, Vikram
When starting my device, I get the blank screen. Hence, I never get to see whether white text appears or not (I get a blank screen that I cannot interpret until the device is entirely switched on and I toggle the on switch a few times to get the interface).

In reply to @VikramK: how can I get in recovery mode when the display is blank after a reset? I've followed the guide in the video, but do not manage to start the recovery procedure. The device just reboots, does not go into recovery mode.
To give an update on my situation: I have managed to get the white text on my screen after restarting while holding the power button, but pressing the power button three times once I see the text does not get me into recovery mode (I do not see the "wheel" and after connecting the cable my device just starts).
I do keep getting the white screen issue though, every time the device has been in sleep mode for over an hour or so. Need to turn it on and off twice before I can use it.

The three clicks of the Power button are 1,2,3 as quick as that....
Probably all 3 in around a second.... There is a knack to getting it right....

I'm still experiencing the same white screen issue as described by @kbaetens above.
Any additional help would be greatly appreciated.
I tried to restart the unit however the unit displayed the black screen with the icons to show that the unit should be connected to a PC . I did this and the MyDrive started and I received the 'MyDrive is recovering 100%....' however in then shut down as did the 550 and then tried to boot again. The 550 showed the TomTom logo and the MyDrive connect on my PC then shut down and immediately rebooted, then shut down in quick succession and continued on this cycle.
With the cable disconnected, I held down the 550 off button until the 'drum roll' and kept it depressed until the black screen with the white writing appeared, I then pushed the button 3-times before reconnecting the cable. I received the same message from MyDrive (recovering device) then it went on to start and shut down repeatedly as it did earlier.
Any advice as what to do next would be very much appreciated.
I click the button 3 times after the screen with the white text, but i do not get the "wheel" and after connecting the cable my device just starts. When i connect to MyDrive it boots and closes in a non-ending cycle.
Has anyone found a solution?

Probably best to wait until Monday.... @VikramK or @lampard the Forum Moderators should pick this up 'and If required' can push a script to repair the device....

“First settled in the 1860s, Africville was a thriving African Nova Scotian community nestled on the edge of Halifax Harbour. In the 1960s, its buildings were destroyed and residents displaced to free up land for Halifax’s industrial expansion.
Today, the Africville Museum stands in a replica of the church that was the emotional heart of Africville. Inside, audio visual kiosks, pictures, descriptive panels, and artifacts tell the story of the Africville community by commemorating the injustice of this destruction and celebrating the strong community spirit that still endures to this day.”

PARIS, October 21, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:
Vivendi (Paris:VIV):
This press release contains unaudited consolidated revenues, established under IFRS, excluding Universal Music Group (UMG), which, due to the distribution of 60% of its share capital in September 2021, has been deconsolidated, leading to the adjustment of past figures. The adjustments to previously published data are presented in Appendix II.
For the third quarter of 2021, Vivendi’s revenues were €2,476 million, compared to €2,170 million for the same period in 2020. This 14.1%6 increase was mainly due to the growth of Canal+ Group (+€87 million), Havas Group (+€106 million) and Vivendi Village (+€29 million). It also includes the impact of the consolidation of Prisma Media since June 1, 2021 (+€75 million).
For the first nine months of 2021, Vivendi’s revenues were €6,870 million, compared to €6,291 million for the same period in 2020. This 9.2%7 increase was mainly due to the growth of Canal+ Group (+€195 million), Havas Group (+€135 million) and Editis (+€108 million). It also includes the impact of the consolidation of Prisma Media since June 1, 2021 (+€104 million).
Review of recent events:
UMG: Success of Euronext Amsterdam listing Universal Music Group N.V. (UMG N.V.) relating to the admission to trading and official listing of its ordinary shares on Euronext Amsterdam.
On September 21, 2021, the shares of UMG N.V. started trading on the regulated market of Euronext Amsterdam. Based on an opening share price of €25.25, UMG's market capitalization was €46 billion.
Following this transaction, Vivendi still holds 10% of UMG N.V.’s share capital.
Agreement between Vivendi and Amber Capital regarding Lagardère
On September 14, 2021, Vivendi entered into a conditional sales agreement with Amber Capital to acquire 25,305,448 Lagardère SA shares held by Amber Capital at a price of €24.10 per share.
As announced on September 15, 2021, Vivendi completed, on September 28, 2021, the acquisition of a small minority of these shares, i.e., 620,340 Lagardère SA shares, held by Amber Capital for €15 million. As of September 30, 2021, Vivendi holds 27.64% of the share capital and 22.14% of the theoretical voting rights of Lagardère SA.
The acquisition of the remaining Lagardère shares held by Amber Capital is expected to be completed by December 15, 2022, following receipt of the approvals required by the applicable regulations in light of the take-over that may result from the mandatory public offer triggered by this acquisition. Pending such regulatory approvals, in consideration for the pledge of the Lagardère shares held by Amber Capital, Vivendi paid a cash collateral in an amount corresponding to the value of these shares, based on the price of €24.10 per share, i.e., €595 million.
Should this acquisition be completed, Vivendi will hold 45.1% of the share capital and 36.2% of the voting rights of Lagardère, exceeding the 30% share capital and voting right thresholds in Lagardère. As a result, a mandatory proposal for a public offer at the same price for all Lagardère shares not yet owned by Vivendi would be filed with the French market authority (Autorité des Marchés financiers) in accordance with applicable regulation.
Share buyback program
Between August 2 and October 15, 2021, Vivendi repurchased 39.0 million shares, i.e., 3.52 % of the share capital, for a total amount of €464 million. As of October 20, 2021, Vivendi directly held 59.7 million of its own shares, i.e., 5.38% of the share capital.
Canal+ Group
For the first nine months of 2021, Canal+ Group's revenues amounted to €4,249 million, an increase of 4.8% compared to the same period in 2020 (+5.4% at constant currency and perimeter).
Revenues from television operations in mainland France amounted to €2,290 million, up slightly compared to the first nine months of 2020 (+2.5% at constant currency and perimeter).
Revenues from international operations also increased, rising from €1,590 million for the first nine months of 2020 to €1,633 million for the first nine months of 2021 (+4.5% at constant currency and perimeter).
With movie theaters reopening and its TV series performing well, Studiocanal’s revenues for the first nine months of 2021 increased significantly, from €229 million in 2020 to €326 million in 2021 (+38.6% at constant currency and perimeter).
During the third quarter of 2021, Canal+ Group announced it had renewed the broadcasting rights in France to the English soccer championship in its entirety for three additional seasons, starting with the 2022-2023 season. Canal+ Group is also continuing its international development by acquiring the exclusive rights to the Premier League in its entirety in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where Canal+ Group is the leader in pay-TV, starting with the 2022-2023 season.
During its new season conference on August 31, 2021, Canal + Group announced the launch of two new channels in France: the documentary channel Canal+ Docs, with a particularly attractive theme in the pay-TV market, and the children's channel Canal+ Kids, designed specifically for 4-12-year-olds. On the same occasion, Canal+ Group also announced the simplification of its offers in France. Since September 9, 2021, subscribers have been offered a choice between an enriched general offer (Canal+) and two thematic offers (Canal+ Ciné Séries or Canal+ Sport).
On September 20, 2021 Canal+ Group also announced the planned acquisition of 70% of SPI International, an international media group operating 42 television channels and various digital platforms in more than 60 countries.
On September 22, 2021, Canal+ Group entered into a partnership with A1 Telekom Austria via its subsidiary nowTV, to develop a new content offer for the Austrian market.

On September 30, 2021, Canal+ Group and Editis launched Nathan TV, the first French-language educational channel in French-speaking Africa.
Havas Group
During the third quarter of 2021, Havas Group’s business activities continued to experience a very strong recovery compared to the same period in 2020, outpacing the second quarter of 2021. Havas Group’s net revenues8 for the third quarter of 2021 grew organically by 17.8% (a favorable baseline compared to the third quarter of 2020, which was affected by the health crisis), following growth of 15.8% in the second quarter of 2021.
All the geographical regions recorded excellent organic performances for the third quarter of 2021, with positive contributions from all divisions: Creative, Media and Health & You. Europe and North America were the biggest contributors, each posting double-digit organic growth (+18.4% and +15.5%, respectively). Asia-Pacific and Africa (+12.3%) and Latin America (+41.1%), also reported satisfactory performances.
For the first nine months of 2021, Havas Group revenues were €1,638 million, representing an organic growth of 11.6% compared to the same period in 2020. Havas Group’s net revenues8 were €1,568 million, up 8.2% compared to the first nine months of 2020, and breaks down as follows: organic growth of +10.8%, contributions from acquisitions of +1.3% and an unfavorable foreign exchange effect of -3.9%.
Havas Group pursued its targeted acquisitions policy by acquiring majority stakes in Agence Verte (a France-based agency specializing in CSR communications) and Nohup (a leading Italian digital transformation agency).
Havas Group is approaching the end of 2021 with confidence, thanks to a sustained level of business activity, with many new business wins, including Unilever (Media division, for France and Spain), SNCF (Creative) and a significant additional budget in Health communications.
Editis
For the first nine months of 2021, Editis’ revenues were €602 million, an increase of 21.9% at constant currency and perimeter compared to the same period in 2020.
This sharp growth has been mainly driven by a buoyant market environment since January 2021. However, this performance is not solely the result of a favorable basis of comparison with the first nine months of 2020 and the first lockdown in France, given that Editis’ revenues increased by 16% at constant currency and perimeter compared to the first nine months of 2019.
In the third quarter of 2021, Editis' revenues fell slightly 0.8% compared to the third quarter of 2020, which had recorded exceptional growth following the mid-May 2020 release from lockdown. Revenues for the third quarter of 2021 rose by 9.5% compared to the third quarter of 2019, which benefited from the school curriculum reform for the second and third years of high school.
Editis is very well represented in the GFK 2021 Top 20 with 8 titles (compared to 6 in 2020 and 4 in 2019). Among these titles, Rien ne t'efface by Michel Bussi published by Presses de la Cité (which recorded exceptional sales with 16% growth compared to the previous year's title), 1991 by Franck Thilliez published by Fleuve Editions, Le Crépuscule des fauves, volume 2 of the series 9 by Marc Levy (Robert Laffont) and Bernard Minier's La chasse (XO) stand out.
Several of Editis' new literary releases are included in the selections for the major prizes. Two books are in the second selection of the Prix Médicis: Tous ceux qui tombent by Jérémie Foa (La Découverte) and Mon mari by Maud Ventura (L'Iconoclaste) in the fiction category.
Two books are in the running for the Renaudot Prize: Murnau des ténèbres by Nicolas Chemla (Cherche Midi) in the fiction category and Dans ma rue y avait trois boutiques by Anthony Palou (Presses de la Cité) in the non-fiction category.
Finally, two books are part of the second selection of the Prix de Flore: Mobylette by Frédéric Ploussard (éditions Héloïse d'Ormesson) - which has already won the Prix Stanislas for the best first novel - and Mon mari by Maud Ventura (L'Iconoclaste), which has just won the prize for the first novel.

Certain Prisma brands posted significant growth: Voici +24%, Gala +24%, TV Grandes Chaînes +22%, and Femme Actuelle +13%.
During the first nine months of 2021, Prisma Media’s revenues were €219 million, up 17.4% compared to the same period in 2020 (pro forma).
On September 15, 2021, Prisma Media acquired EPM 2000, which owns TV magazine Télé Z.
For the first nine months of 2021, Gameloft’s revenues reached €184 million.
Asphalt 9: Legends, Disney Magic Kingdoms, Dragon Mania Legends, March of Empires, and Asphalt 8: Airborne generated 51% of Gameloft’s total revenues and were the five-best-selling-games in the first nine months of 2021.
Gameloft’s gross margin9 increased by 2% and reached €129 million for the first nine months of 2021. The successful launch of its games on the Apple Arcade subscription platform and the excellent performance of Gameloft for brands3, whose gross margin increased by 22% over the period, enabled the company to achieve this business growth.
Gameloft launched three new games in 2021 on Apple Arcade: Song Pop Party, The Oregon Trail and Asphalt 8: Airborne+, which joined Ballistic Baseball, released in 2019.
For the first nine months of 2021, Vivendi Village’s revenues were €61 million, compared to €34 million for the same period in 2020, up 78.7% (+79.2% at constant currency and perimeter).
This positive trend is particularly evident in the third quarter of 2021, which saw a 4.4-fold increase in revenues compared to the same period in 2020. Live performance activities have gradually recovered over the period, with a pronounced public appetite for these events. This trend is reflected in a sharp increase in the ticketing business, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom. Several festivals organized by Olympia Production and U-Live were held in France and the United Kingdom during the summer. Artist tours are resuming, and L’Olympia should return to near pre-confinement occupancy levels in the fourth quarter of 2021.
CanalOlympia opened its 17th cinema and entertainment venue on October 1, 2021, in Pointe-Noire, in Republic of Congo.
During the first nine months of 2021, New Initiatives, which brings together Dailymotion and the GVA entities, recorded revenues of €60 million, compared to €44 million for the same period in 2020, up 34.8% at constant currency and perimeter.
For the third quarter of 2021, Dailymotion's premium content audience continued to grow (+56% compared to the third quarter of 2020), and still represents over 80% of the total audience. This growth was driven by the signing of new partnerships (Unify with the Doctissimo, Marmiton, Au feminin and Les Numériques brands in France, Netmums in the UK, Alfemminile in Italy and GoFeminin in Germany as well as Olympia Verlag with the Kicker brand in Germany) and the summer sports events, notably the official presentation of Lionel Messi to PSG on the Canal+ Sport and L'Equipe channels.
In September 2021, Dailymotion reached its record level of programmatic sales, strongly driven by the partnership with Google DV360.
GVA is a FTTH (Fiber To The Home) operator that has been operating in Sub-Saharan Africa for four years and is already present in six countries on the continent. Specialized in the provision of very high-speed Internet access, GVA covers a market of 850,000 homes and companies.
GVA is expected to continue its strong growth in 2021, supported by an ever-increasing demand for very high-speed broadband in Africa.

While hiring for a residential cleaning in Brookfield can be fast and affordable, some people find that thoroughly cleaning their homes themselves is therapeutic. If you are in the latter group and want to tackle the cleaning task yourself, these DIY tips can help save you time and strife.
Get Prepared
Gather all the cleaning equipment you’ll need and place it all in a bucket so it will be easy to carry along with you. Having everything with you will prevent unnecessary steps and wasted time running back and forth. Place an all-purpose cleaner, window cleaner, cloths, paper towels, duster and other basic cleaning supplies in your bucket to carry along with you as you move from room to room.
Start at the Far End
Start the spring cleaning in the room that is furthest away from the exterior door used to enter and exit your home. Odds are that you will be going in and out often during your spring cleaning to empty trash, take items to the garage, etc. If you start near the entrance you can track dirt that can undo the work that you’ve already accomplished.
Right to Left
Methodically working your way around a room can save you time and makes sure that you don’t miss any areas. Start in the right hand corner of a room and work your way around the room from top to bottom. Open windows, take down curtains for laundering or dry cleaning, sweep screens, wash windows, frames and sills, remove contents from drawers and wipe down the inside of each drawer.
Dampen a cloth with an all-purpose cleaner and wipe down light fixtures in the room, switch plates, door frames and baseboards. Dust furniture, wall art and other fixtures. If you have not cleaned out your closets in a while, this is a great time to tackle that task as well. Finish off the room by cleaning the floor, sweeping/mopping/vacuuming your way backward out of the room.
Hallway
If your home has a hallway, clean the main rooms first Finish with the hallway, again cleaning fixtures, furniture and decorations as you go. Once finished, clean your floors working your way out of the hallway.
Bathrooms
Start at the furthest part of the bathroom and clean as you go out once again. Using a safe disinfectant spray in your drawers can help mitigate any leftover grime from bathroom items. Discard any expired or old items that will not be used. After returning the rest of your other products clean your mirror, light fixture and wash your window if there is one. Save washing your bathroom surfaces for the end, with your floors being the last step.• To refresh your knowledge of the definition and types of consent
• To be aware of the elements required to ensure that a patient’s consent is valid
• To understand the considerations that are necessary when a patient does not have the mental capacity to consent to treatment
Consent to treatment is a common, albeit complex, aspect of nursing practice. Over the past few years, laws have been strengthened to provide increased recognition of patient autonomy. This has meant that there is a greater onus placed on nurses to understand how consent is obtained from patients, the elements required to ensure any consent is valid, and how to proceed when it has been determined that a patient does not have the mental capacity to consent to treatment. This article explores some of the legal considerations that nurses should keep in mind when seeking consent from a patient.

Los Angeles Kaiser Malpractice Attorney
If you’ve suffered an injury due to medical negligence from a doctor or hospital in the Kaiser system, it can be very difficult to hold them accountable and make sure you receive the compensation you deserve. If you find yourself in this disappointing situation, you need an attorney who has specific experience with the Kaiser Foundation. Fortunately, Dr. Bruce Fagel has a tremendous amount of experience handling Kaiser malpractice cases. Call 800-541-9376 for a free consultation with Dr. Fagel today.
What Is Kaiser?
Kaiser Permanente consists of three different entities: Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, and Permanente Medical Groups. The Kaiser Health Plan includes more than 10 million members throughout the United States. If you’re part of the Kaiser healthcare system, you are required to choose hospitals within the Kaiser system.
Why Are Kaiser Claims Difficult?
Medical malpractice claims relating to a Kaiser doctor or hospital cannot be litigated in civil court. Policyholders are not permitted to sue Kaiser directly and instead have to go through a process called arbitration (resolving the issue outside of court). By being a part of the Kaiser healthcare system, you are bound by a contract requiring you to go through arbitration. You might not even be aware of this contract until you’re in a situation where you find yourself looking into filing a medical malpractice lawsuit. It’s important to note that if you are a Kaiser member, you are bound by their arbitration contract regardless of where your healthcare is administered.
How Does The Arbitration Process Work?
When you file a claim against Kaiser, the claim is arbitrated by the Office of the Independent Administrator. You and your attorney must submit a demand for arbitration. In this demand, you must include the following:
- 1. A statement describing your injury and why Kaiser is responsible;
- 2. How much compensation you’re seeking;
- 3. Your name, phone number, address, and the same information for your attorney; AND
- 4. The names of all people you believe are responsible for your injury.
The administrator is required to send each party a list of 12 randomly generated arbitrators to choose from. Each party then has 20 days to decide and reply with their choice. The administrator will then select an arbitrator based on the selections of the parties involved. Within 60 days, the arbitrator is required to hold an arbitration management conference. At this meeting, deadlines are set for mandatory settlement meetings and the arbitration hearing date is scheduled.
If the parties are not able to come to an agreement, the arbitrator will hold a trial. The goal of this arbitration is to have the case resolved within 18 months from the time the demand letter is received.

Gainesville, FLIt stops here!
by Marie Marshall
President Harry S Truman looked around the Oval Office. His eye took in the rich, red drapes, the deep carpet in the same shade, the mahogany of the furniture. He glanced over each shoulder – right, left – to take in the Stars-and-Stripes and his own Presidential standard, and reflected that the room was still very much to the taste of Roosevelt his predecessor. How could it not be? FDR was such a dominating personality. He asked himself whether he had the courage (or the energy, or the time…) to redecorate.
Perhaps at this moment he doubted himself a little, but Truman was indeed a man of character. He looked down at his desk. Yes, here was the new Truman Presidency, ordered, workmanlike, symmetrical – that’s how he would be. A place for his pen, a place for his presidential blotter, a place for everything, yes everything was in order, so why was he frowning?
“Something is missing,” he thought.
His frown deepened when he caught sight of something he had been trying to avoid looking at. A tarpaulin had been laid on the carpet, and on that was the carcass of a freshly-killed white-tailed deer, a fine male with a single bullet hole. It was a gift from an eager, young White House aide who had heard that the President liked hunting. In that the aide had miscalculated – Truman shot grouse, not deer.
The President got up and walked round to the front of his desk. The carcass would not go away of its own accord, it had to be dealt with, a decision had to be made and it was the Commander-in-Chief who had to make it. No one else would make it for him.
“What the hell use would there be in a President who knew how to skin a damn deer?” he asked aloud. The walls of the Oval Office echoed his rhetorical question. He looked down at the white-tailed buck, then to the empty space on his desk. His frown melted. An idea formed in his mind and he made a decision. He lifted the Presidential phone and spoke to his secretary Matthew Connelly.
“Matt,” he said. “Get me the Presidential Butcher. And while you’re at it, get me the Presidential Carpenter and the Presidential Signwriter too…”

Although my job title is something like “Senior Developer” the role could be described as “getting stuff done to make it easier for other people to get stuff done”, “automating a lot of processes”, “optimisation and simplification of code and architecture”, “grunt work”, “low level debugging”, “mentoring”, “being a sounding board”, “adding test coverage”, “devops”, “DBA”, and of course “writing code”.
If your company gets big enough you need people to do this stuff. Someone to remove code, simplify processes, sanity check ideas and changes, put things back together that shouldn’t have been taken apart, pay off some of the technical debt to stop it getting out of control.
Software development, at the low level, is just moving data around. All the layers of abstraction we add on top and around it obfuscate that. If you understand the layers, and can get through them when required, you can better fix the problems. I guess amongst all the aforementioned things, “being able to get through the layers” is another part of the job description.
So here is how my week looked as a senior developer. I have added copious footnotes to try explain some of the terminology. Note that this largely relates to work time, but I ended up adding other times during the week I interacted with software/hardware that required some debugging. Also note that I’ve obfuscated/redacted some information.
Wednesday
Today started with some testing of recent changes I’d made to fix double encoding of non-ASCII characters1 in messages we were sending out using AWS’ SNS service2. Partly this was down to the rather odd format required (stringified JSON wrapped in JSON?3) but also the usual case of “character encodings go through several layers and one or more of them does the wrong thing, so go and find which layer is doing the wrong thing and fix it. Iterate until you have fixed all the layers, or fix it such that the layer you can’t fix ends up being fixed by association”.
Such is the nature of these kinds of bugs, it appeared that we weren’t quite doing the right thing, but upon testing from end to end, it worked. So it was merged and deployed. All of this took about an hour or so.
Next I looked into why one of our production server was crashing under very specific circumstances. This was related to a caching issue4, and as we had recently modified our cache to allow larger values (objects, essentially) to be stored so that was a potential avenue to explore. The issue could be easily replicated on our DEV environment so I decided to start with the low level approach5 - as the server was crashing with a SEGV I assumed it would be relatively easy to get the core dump6 and see exactly what was going on.
Sure enough, after having located the core dump, I could run it through
gdb7 to get a back trace:
Core was generated by `... Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. #0 0x00007f1dbf4e911e in XS_Cpanel__JSON__XS_DESTROY () from .../auto/Cpanel/JSON/XS/XS.so (gdb) bt #0 0x00007f1dbf4e911e in XS_Cpanel__JSON__XS_DESTROY () from .../auto/Cpanel/JSON/XS/XS.so #1 0x00000000004c6d12 in Perl_pp_entersub () #2 0x000000000043f875 in Perl_call_sv () #3 0x00000000004cb652 in S_curse ()
So this was a problem in some low(er) level C code, something that I could look at but would take an awful lot of time to fix and would most likely introduce other issues. Since this was an issue that needed fixing now I tried some debugging within the code, starting with adding some log statements. The issue fixed itself by adding logging, thus was a heisenbug8. Action at a distance.
Since the logging was actually useful stuff, and it fixed the problem, I left it in as the “fix” and documented that in the commit message. Alas, that action at a distance caused other action at a distance and was picked up by the CI server9. I took another approach, and ended up turning the encoder attribute (the thing causing the SEGV) into a plain variable10, which again had enough action at a distance to fix the issue and not break other things. This was all documented in the commit message, and the investigation and fixing took in the region of three hours. To fully fix the issue could be a matter of days or weeks, and needs must so the quick fix won11.
The final big task of the day was updating our IP lookup data12. We use IP2Location for this, so we have to update our DB files ever few months (ideally once a month). I have scripts in place to automate most of this, but for this time we were moving to a more comprehensive DB format, which would give us extra information like latitude and longitude. So there was the additional task of tweaking the code using the DB to return that information, updating tests, and testing.
The additional task, which takes the most time here, is updating our base production images13 to contain the DB files. Since the DB files are several hundred MB in size, we don’t deploy them (this speeds up the deployment process) - the code assumes they’re already available on the server. The reason for this is to do with the auto-scaling nature of our production environment14, and having to sync a large file as part of the spin up of new instances slows down the scaling. It can also add extra cost due to (cumulatively) transferring hundreds of GB of data, which isn’t necessary if you just stick the file on the base server image (the AMI).
I should probably look into this again, to see if it’s still necessary, and automate more if I can. I may just be able to put the file on the network share15, which would not require new AMIs. During the process of these updates I realised the library I maintain to parse these DB files was a bit behind the official one16, so I updated and released that as well. All of this took about two or three hours with some interruptions in between.
In between all of the above I managed to review and merge a couple of pull requests on some open source libraries I maintain, and released those.

Addendum: I spent almost an hour in the evening trying to get our TV to work with Netflix. The TV could get a network connection but was unable to resolve the Netflix servers. The same thing was happening for YouTube. The attempts to fix it included “turning it off and on again” (several times). Restoring it to factory defaults and reconfiguring the network setup. Rebooting the router. Trying to update the software over the network. No luck. Tomorrow I may try again but use the USB port to update the software.
Because the TV is both figuratively and literally a black box it was impossible for me to see what the root cause of the network issue was. The debugging information is minimal to empty, and the error messages meaningless. The Netflix app itself had slightly better information, which revealed it might be something in DNS18 but that made little sense since my other devices (using the same router) could resolve fine.
Thursday
This morning was getting something done that we’ve been meaning to do for a while: enabling websockets19 in one of our apps. The ducks we needed to get in a row for testing this were:
- getting a non self-signed SSL certificate for our DEV environments20 and having that installed as part of the creation of developer VMs
- tweaking our nginx/apache21 configs to allow proxying of requests to
wss://
- testing this against our staging server, which is closer to our production environment22
- deploying this stuff to production and then figuring out how to make sure our load balancers didn’t cause problems for the websockets23
This took most of the morning. It’s actually mostly trivial stuff, but there’s the approach that this should be automated (creation of the certs) and updating the configuration files in the development, staging, and production repositories24 so that it’s all done once and usable through the rest of the development team without having to repeat any setup
Given the aforementioned “ducks in a row” I spent the afternoon looking at some higher priority bugs from our other app. This turned into just looking at one bug, which is probably best explained via the commit message25 (some information redacted):
paginate the tenant balances report page: /foo/bar/XXX this is a little complicated - the current queries use a group by clause in different ways and the way this works is we get all tenants for the agency in question (so 3,940 for agency XXXX) then filter out in the nested foreach look - so we *always* do 3950 queries when this page loads even if we don't display them all we can't add pagination to the initial query due to the way the nested query will skip certain tenants, so instead if *and only if* this is the html version of the report we have to splice the array returned by the first query to get the correct "page" of results for display this is very much shoehorned in, and in fact it does change the display such that we will now show tenants for those delete properties where the tenant balance is zero - it's questionable whether or not this is a regression given the page seems to show a load of redundant / useless information anyway: when you load the tenant list for agency XXXX you see 422 records, the tenant balances page shows 3,052 rows of which many have a balance of 0 (why not just skip them?). now we show 3,940 this seems to be the most reasonable trade off between having this page take forever to load in the interface (and hammer the db with several thousand queries) or have it load in a few seconds and show a bit more information. perhaps we can add some filtering as a next step to skip zero balances and/or inactive/archived tenants?
To explain more - this is some very old, very overloaded, very complicated code lacking any automated test coverage, which started as a report in the early life of the platform. It has reached the point, after many years, that its original implementation doesn’t scale well but the time to rewrite it isn’t worth the investment26.
So the least invasive thing to do for the time being was to add some pagination27, which couldn’t be done in the queries due to their disparate and complex nature so instead was done in the code. Initially i thought this might be some query optimisation work, and indeed one of the queries was still
using temporary28 but I couldn’t factor that out without reducing the number of rows returned.
I’ve already made a few tweaks in other parts of this code over the years (as I said, it’s very overloaded) and it feels like it is reaching the point of throwing it away and starting again. But, again, needs must and there are other higher priorities.
In between this there were a couple of queries and minor interruptions. The most interesting one was a colleague wanting me to demonstrate squashing their commits down in a branch that I had reviewed29 - this was a branch to add some feedback to users when they put incorrect data in forms, but the work had been done as a background task over a number of weeks due to other higher priority changes.
The result was the changes were, conceptually, quite simple but had ended up as many many small commits. In the review I suggested rebasing the commits30 to combine the related changes, since really it only needed to be three or four commits. The problem we had is that, reasonably enough, my colleague had been keeping their branch up to date with the main development line31 and when running the interactive rebase we would get all those commits pulled in from the main line rather than only the ones we wanted to squash down.
I didn’t want to risk conflicts and/or lost work so suggested instead that they branch off of the main line again and then cherry-pick32 their commits into the new branch then rebase that new branch. I’m still not sure of how to handle rebasing a branch that has been kept up to date with the main line, and I recall doing this myself successfully several times in the past but couldn’t see it working here. Any suggestions are welcome33.

Addendum: I popped into the gallery after work as Sophie’s computer had not been able to send/receive any email through her gallery account for a couple of weeks. After some debugging the problem seemed related to Windows/Outlook and not the remote end or settings - the same account could be accessed and send/receive email fine from her iPhone34, and no details had been changed. A ping of the remote server35 from the Windows command prompt showed the network was fine so the reasons for it failing to send/receive was unknown. No errors, just a never ending spinner. More black boxes. I suggested Sophie update the operating system and try again.
I didn’t look into the issue with the TV tonight, and instead we plugged the Apple TV box into the TV and watched Netflix fine through that - another case one device being able to speak to the remote end while the other couldn’t.
Friday
Friday started with some more testing of the websocket changes from yesterday. This was deploying the changes to our staging environment, where they looked good, and then our production environment36. We realised it wasn’t going to work in our production setup, because of the load balanced and auto-scailing nature of the system, so we ended up reverting the changes37. This was a couple of hours work, which involved some research and confirming our suspicions about the architecture issues.
I also spent some time responding to feedback (making tweaks) on a review of the pagination changes from yesterday. There wasn’t much to do here, and the main issue was an off-by-one bug38 under certain circumstances (a good catch!).
Today we installed the new AMIs (related to the IP lookup data from Wednesday) so cycled the production instances. I kept one eye on this while doing other small things. While running some tests for those other things I noticed that new versions of VirtualBox and Vagrant were available39, so since I didn’t have anything pressing I took some time to update my local versions and test them with our development build scripts. The development build is fundamental, and I take the approach of rebuilding my development environment quite frequently40.
I want a developer to be able to go from checking out the necessary repository to having a working development environment in a matter of minutes. Although this is generally the case, trivial little updates to the various tools involved can interrupt this41. Since we use the same stack through all our apps (consistency is a good thing) I started afresh and rebuilt the base image, built a VM, and then ran the entire test suite. All good, and took about 2 hours of work/checking.
At the end of the day I updated my work Mac to v10.15.3 of the operating system. This was somewhat overdue and what pushed me over the edge was the machine running slow enough to become a frustration. This took about an hour.

Addendum: There was a common pattern to today’s work - updating stuff. All the time. Sometimes this is what the job can feel like, and as the number of dependencies goes up the time spent updating these dependencies seems to compound.
Saturday
Not a work day, but I was in the gallery all day, and that involved some software wrangling such as posting to Instagram and Facebook, sending out a mailer with Mailchimp, and updating the website with details of the next event.
The website is built using github pages + Jekyll42, which makes factoring out common stuff, putting snippets together, and pushing out changes nice and easy: I edit a plain text markdown document then commit the changes and push out to github. The site then is up to date in about 1 minute. I can easily preview the changes by running
jekyll locally.
The only lacking thing is localisation, since the site needs to be in both French and English - I checked a couple of years ago and there wasn’t a simple (as in: as simple as my current setup is) way to do this. I may check again soon.
Sunday
Not a work day, but there was some interaction with broken software - we booked a table at a place in Lausanne, through Tripadvisor, which resulted in a confirmation SMS being sent. That told us to install an app to see the details. So I installed the app, registered (making sure to use the same details are linked to the reservation) and: nothing. The app failed to link up the parts so I couldn’t see the confirmation for the reservation.
The place was only a five minute walk from out hotel so we just wandered along anyway, and all was fine. They had received the reservation no problem.
Monday
I took Monday off, as we went to see live music in Lausanne the night before and I didn’t want to get back late then have an early morning. Plus I had other stuff to do in Lausanne. Also today I didn’t interact with any broken software, other than playing some A Link to the Past Randomizer, which is intentionally broken to make it more interesting43.
Tuesday
Today was half/half DBA44 and development work. I caught up a little bit on emails, as it doesn’t take much to get a backlog. These emails related to reports on batch scripts45 - we have a daily report that shows us anything that might need looking into. This is far more automated than it used to be, and the level of noise has been reduced by several orders of magnitude after I recognised a typical anti-pattern in reporting46.
Other emails related to our database backup process - we do get automated backups from AWS but we don’t just rely on that and also make “off site” backups47. This process is automated and part of it makes a small extract, which we primarily use in our development environment. If the database structure changes you need to also change the extract script so it knows what to do - if you fail to update the extract script it will send you an email to complain that you didn’t update it (but will still complete as much as it can).
Another DBA type thing was reviewing a change of the removal of 44 tables (including benchmarking some schema modifications against a representative data set). You read that correctly: forty four tables. This is the nature of one of our apps, it’s grown organically and there still is a lot of cruft and dead code that can be removed. I have been taking a “slowly slowly” approach. The change looked good, and the tables were actually empty so there was minimal risk involved in removing them (there were no longer any references in the code or elsewhere).
Finally, after lunch, I started writing some code. At least, writing a not insubstantial amount of code. This was one of our long term projects to convert a legacy app into a more modern one48. We are fortunate in that we can do this piece by piece, taking one page at a time and converting it. So I started looking at the current implementation, references to it, requirements, and sketched out (in my head) how this would work for the new implementation.
Since we have done this for other pages before, we have an established process in place. And indeed, since the new system is better factored some of the pieces are already in place. It’s likely I will spend the rest of the week completing this task, “writing some code”, amongst the various other tasks that interrupt me.

AWS is Amazon Web Services, which runs most of our live infrastructure out on the web. SNS is one of the services that makes it easy to send notifications to users of our mobile application. ↩
JSON is a serialisation format designed to make interprocess communication easy, which looks something
{ "like" : "this" }. The service in question wraps that in more JSON so we need to escape the reserved characters for the inner string:
{ "something" : "{ \"like\" : \"this\" }" }, which I find quite annoying. ↩
“There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.” – Phil Karlton ↩
Normally I would start at a higher level, possibly try a bisect, or sprinkle some debug statements here and there - but this the process crashing, which meant a core dump, which meant I could quite quickly find the likely culprit. ↩
Core dump - a file that contains the state of the program and its memory contents when the program crashed. Extremely useful for doing a post-mortem. ↩
gdb is a debugger that we can examine said core dump with. ↩
A bug that shows a behaviour change, including fixing itself, when you attempt to debug it. ↩
A Continuous Integration server is the thing that runs all (or most) of the tests against your changes whenever you push them out to the remote repository. It means you can find things that you might have broken, even though you assumed that your changes wouldn’t. This all assumes your test coverage is good enough. ↩
Essentially this went from being a “strongly typed” attribute on an object to a dynamically typed variable (something you can do in Perl). ↩
The behaviour was happening in a third party module, so even if the fix was quick there it would need to go upstream and be fully regression tested before it would be applied. Such is the nature of Perl’s testing ecosystem we comprehensively test changes against many different operating systems, distributions, versions, etc - and since this was in the lower level C code it would need more testing. ↩
Converting an IP address into a geographical address (as near as can be estimated). ↩
Servers in our production environment appear as load dictates, sometimes we have a few, sometimes many. So we need to start them up from a base “template” image - when we make some updates we need to update that template. ↩
Some of the code is synced across when new servers appear, but if we need to sync large files then that can slow down the time from a new server starting to it being available to serve. So we try to avoid sync of large files. ↩
Some files need to be shared across servers, so these are available from a “common” disk. We may or may not eventually move this to S3. ↩
I forked the library a few years ago as it had fallen out of maintenance (such is the nature of Perl support these days). They started updating it again recently. ↩
I have a shortcut
git timesheetthat will show me my last 24hr (or four days, or one week) of commits. Handy for the daily standup. ↩
DNS is the thing the resolves a hostname () to an IP address so we can actually communicate with the server. When DNS fails, or gives wrong/outdated information then we end up trying to speak to the wrong thing (or nothing). ↩
Websockets are something that allow a channel to be kept open between your browser and the server, so updates can appear on a page without having to have a refresh. ↩
Up until now we haven’t been too bothered about this, but best practices and actually wanting a more representative development environment means this point is a good one to actually get on and do this. ↩
nginx/apache are the kind of “front door” applications that direct traffic to the right place. They can server some assets but send other requests to the downstream application running on the box/elsewhere. We use nginx in development to emulate the load balancers that we use in production. So nginx -> apache -> our app ↩
The staging setup runs on AWS so has a load balancer, web server, db server, meaning it’s much closer to how the production servers are configured/setup. ↩
Historically websockets could be problematic in load balancing as they need to be kept open and point at the same server. If your load balancer is doing the right thing, distributing load, then that can interfere with that. At least, that is my understanding. ↩
We store as much as possible in git repositories - not just code, but configuration files, deployment scripts, infrastructure setup, development environment setup and bootstrapping. Store everything in repositories, there should be very few exceptions. ↩
I often write comprehensive commit messages. I’ve blogged about this before. ↩
This is a report used by a very small number of users, and it would take a few days (if not longer) to rewrite into something more maintainable. But really we would prefer to just throw it away. Code is a liability. ↩
Pagination - instead of showing n thousand results, show twenty results and then allow the user to view the first/next/previous/last page of results or filter down more. ↩
A temporary table means the db sever has to put the results from the first bit of the query somewhere and then filter them, rather than just filtering on the results from the first bit directly. If you see a query with this in its explain that’s usually a good candidate for optimisation, but the nature of this query meant I couldn’t factor it out. ↩
-
Rebasing commits could be translated as “tidy up, combine, and simplify the record of the changes” ↩
Keeping your work up to date with the main development line is good over a medium to long term change as you avoid problems when the time arrives to put your work back into the main line. ↩
Basically replaying their changes but without the “keep it up to date” bits, since the new branching point would mean it is already up to date. ↩
For some reason I thought
git rebasetook more flags than it actually does. ↩
Apple’s black boxes tend to work better than other black boxes. ↩
pingis a very basic “can I actually reach this server over the network, and will it respond to me”. ↩
Don’t deploy on a Friday? We handle that on a case-by-case basis and this change was non-impacting so good to roll out and “test” in production. ↩
Some information here. On reverting the change - although it was non-impacting we prefer that code/config that is not used not be present. Code is a liability. ↩
Off by one bugs are common, and easy to make, as we count from zero when programming (for the vast majority of stuff we do). ↩
The tools that we build our development environments (servers) with. ↩
At least once a week, often once a day. ↩
When I first arrived the development build was mostly a manual process: creating a VM and then running through a script to install dependencies and get the app up and running. If you were reasonably well versed in Linux and the command line (and the various dependencies should anything diverge from the script) this would take about one day of effort. All this stuff is easy to automate, so that’s one of the first things I did and now it takes about 5 minutes. ↩
-
I am considering giving a technical talk about this sometime in the near future. ↩
DBA: DataBase Administrator. We are (maybe still) hiring for this role. Get in touch ↩
Automated batch processes that take a while to complete, a lot of which run overnight given the nature of the payment industry. ↩
“e-mail all the things” is a massive anti-pattern. “e-mail one or two things” is manageable. ↩
“Off site” as in “out of the AWS infrastructure” ↩
An iterative rewrite of the application over several years done in small steps, with each change regression tested and deployed to production - after a while the old code is then removed. ↩buying price in Chinese

But seven weeks in, we have fallen in love with the whole experience. Reading timeless books to my kids is by far my favorite part. It never fails, but by the end of a book my kids all look at the end and the back to see if there’s a sequel we can grab. Homeschool doesn’t have to try to be public school because they are completely different. I think as a new unexpected homeschool mama, that’s been the greatest lesson of all. I don’t have to try to re-create public school because I’m giving them something that public school just can’t be. Both are beautiful. I hope someday when my kids are telling their kids about the year 2020, they’ll remember all the extra snuggles all the laughs and all the things we learned snuggled up cozy in our tiny RV taking a much needed break from the crazy world.” —Melissa N.
Melissa N. is just one example of the thousands of families who opted for homeschooling for the first time ever in 2020.
And it’s not too late to salvage this school year!
In January, hundreds of moms are pulling their kids out of virtual learning misery and homeschooling them instead. Make 2021 better than 2020 by taking charge of your children’s education. Homeschooling is actually easier than plodding through virtual school!
Still in Public School or Using Virtual Schooling? Switch to Sonlight
If your children are still in public school, deciding to homeschool is a big adjustment. But if you’ve been struggling with virtual school through your public school, you’re no stranger to being flexible! You’ve had to flex your way all the way through 2020. You probably feel like a pretzel from all the bending and non-stop adjustments!
In 2020, thousands of families switched from public school to using Sonlight. And while none of these parents said it was easy, most of these parents told us how surprised they were at actually how doable homeschooling with Sonlight is.
Nearly everyone says it’s easier than virtual schooling! And, maybe more importantly, it’s more enjoyable! All the stresses of logging in, juggling devices, and dealing with constantly changing expectations just melted away when they took the reins and opted to homeschool.
Gobs of parents are now saying things like this:
“My only regret is that I didn’t do this sooner. My son is so much happier, and together we have pulled more productivity and enthusiasm out of him than any teacher he has previously had.” —Sarah.
“Our family feels so much freer now. My daughter believes she’s actually smart and my son is finally engaging in stretches of independent play.” —Tracy N. A.
“The flexibility that we get from homeschooling is great. The Sonlight [Instructor’s Guide] IG makes our lives easier. I do not regret making the decision to homeschool with Sonlight.” —Cristy J.

But I Have to Work. I Can’t Homeschool
If you’re working from home, you may be surprised at how doable homeschooling is! This is what two working moms have to say:
“This is our first time [homeschooling]. I work full time from home. I love the flexibility we have to be able to do school at any time. We are currently in week 3 and have had no major issues. I was worried about how I would be able to work and teach, but the kids (4th & 10th) have been very good about working around my schedule. The IG tells me everything I need to do for daily lessons which makes everything stress-free for me. I was really worried at first but now I have gotten more comfortable with the IG and how everything is set up. My 4th grader and I can get through her full curriculum in about 4 hours and we set read aloud time after dinner. This was the best decision we made. No more tears of frustration for our 4th grader!” —Jenny C..
Already Homeschooling? Switch to Sonlight
If you’re using another curriculum but aren’t content, consider the advantages of Sonlight. You can choose from a 4-day week or a 5-day week. You get a complete package with a detailed daily schedule in your Instructor’s Guide along with all the books, maps, and timeline that you need.
The best part? These books you read together foster cherished times of family bonding. The characters in the books become your friends!
Sonlight isn’t just a curriculum. It’s the start of a vibrant home library and a family culture of reading.
End-of-the-year Clean Up with Sonlight
Imagine ending the homeschool year with Sonlight and tidying the curriculum shelf. As you move each book to long-term storage in your home library, your children will remember the good times they had in each fictional or historic setting, reliving the memories they forged with each character. These books are beloved, and your kids would never let you get rid of them!
Contrast that happy scene with the end of the school year without Sonlight. There’s a feeling of “good riddance to this school year” as you toss out the used workbooks, put the textbooks in the for-sale pile, and pitch the countless worksheets into the trash. There’s no warm feeling of family closeness or connection to the characters and places you studied. It’s just another clean-up task to do.
Textbooks and workbooks don’t generate warm feelings. But Sonlight books do.
Sonlight is truly a unique curriculum. It’s about experiencing the power of story with your children. It’s an education—a fine education—and yet it’s so much more. If you want more for your children, Switch to Sonlight and save up to $50 through Jan. 31, 2021.
You can teach your kids at home! A well-planned curriculum makes it so easy, and you can trust that you are giving your kids all the academics they need.!If you feel isolated, all alone, or work out of your house, come out TONIGHT and meet your fellow event professionals face-to-face.

- Starring Rajinikanth in the lead role, Annaatthe hit the big screens on Nov 4, 2021, on the occasion of Diwali.
- Within hours of its release, several piracy websites including Tamilrockers, Isamini and Telegram channels leaked the movie for free download in HD quality.
Reopening of theatres and cinema halls to 100% capacity is big news for the entertainment industry. The festive season is at its peak and the industry is hoping for a big turnaround after sustaining huge losses in the last 18 months due to the pandemic. However, piracy websites seem to have other plans. While the audience is still reluctant to come out and watch movies in theatres, piracy websites are only adding to the misery of the industry.
Movie piracy websites are at work and their latest victim is Rajinikanth starrer Annaatthe. One of the most anticipated movies hit the big screens on Nov 4, 2021. However, Tamilrockers and several other piracy websites leaked Annaatthe full movie online in HD quality.
Within hours of its theatrical release, Annaatthe has been leaked on other popular piracy websites like Movierulz, Kuttymovies, and Isaimini. Not only piracy sites but several Telegram channels have also illegally leaked the Rajini starrer for free download.
Well, this is not the first time a Bollywood or south Indian movie fell prey to these piracy sites. These days, piracy websites leak almost all movies. These leaks are causing huge losses to Bollywood as well as the South Indian film industry. Some of the big movies south movies leaked this year are Drishyam 2, Krack, Jagame Thandhiram, Karnan, and Sarpatta Parambarai.
‘Annaatthe’ is a box office winner
Rajinikanth starrer has garnered negative reviews from critics. Most of the critics have penned it down due to poor writing, predictable story, generic action sequences and melodrama. Even netizens on social media are also criticising the movie for various reasons.
Despite poor reviews, Rajinikanth’s star power has created havoc at the box office. Annaatthe earned Rs 34+ crore on its opening day in Tamil Nadu, a new record. Only Rajini can do this with an average movie.
Annaatthe movie details
Written and directed by Siva, Annaatthe is an action-entertainer starring Rajinikanth in a lead role. The movie has a very predictable story.
Kaaliyan (Rajinikanth) is a village president fondly called Annaatthe (Elder Brother). His cousins (Meena and Khushbu) fight with each other to marry him. But, he falls in love with another woman (Nayanthara). Kaaliyan has a sister named Thanga Meenakshi (Keerthy Suresh) who gets married and shifts to Kolkata. She faces some unknown threats in Kolkata and then Rajini comes to her rescue. Keerthy Suresh plays Rajinikanth’s sister in the film, while Nayanthara is seen as his love interest.Description

Decades ago, Dr. Louk Andrianos didn’t picture himself serving as a consultant on the Care for Creation, Sustainability and Climate Justice for the World Council of Churches, a key Season of Creation partner.
Andrianos thought that maybe he’d stick to the sciences and spend a career working in biology or agronomy.
Dr. Louk Andrianos
But the Season of Creation Steering Committee member has found a way to blend both his faith and the sciences to help Christians around the world care for creation.
“I feel called by God to do this… I think God wants me to work for these kinds of activities, ecumenical care for creation and especially work for the whole of creation,” Andrianos said in the latest Global Catholic Climate Movement podcast.
“I was guided, I would say, by the Holy Spirit of God to do this. I had no idea at the beginning what would be the best way that God can use me. I was just giving myself as I say always, when I pray, I say, ‘God, use me as I am your creation, so you know best.’”
Listen and subscribe to the GCCM podcast below:
Andrianos, who grew up in Madagascar, has a Ph.D. in Sustainable Development Sciences and was the head of the Institute of Theology and Ecology at the Orthodox Academy of Crete in Kolympari, Greece.
He also worked at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the Foundation for Research and Technology – Hellas.
The scientist has found that science and faith can work well together.
“These two things go perfectly to give us a full fullness of the understanding of the world and to make us progress and to have a more sustainable life,” he said.
“For me, God is the perfect scientist who knows everything. What we know is just a dark shadow, a small shadow of God’s love and God’s knowledge.”
On the podcast, Andrianos also talked about the upcoming ecumenical Season of Creation, the annual celebration of prayer and action for our common home that will take place from 1 September through 4 October.
He shared why he’s particularly inspired about this year’s theme, “A home for all? Renewing the Oikos of God,” and what overall excites him about the ecumenical celebration that sees the world’s 2.3 billion Christians unite.
“The Season of Creation is an occasion that we express our unity in Christ,” he said.
“The important thing for me also is that the Season of Creation is dedicated to a season for prayer. And prayer for me is the most important tool to change the world and to change human beings.”

Yesterday I wrote that Tesla represents the first step in the inevitable decline of the automobile as an object of desire. Taking its place: computing, of course, which lives inside cars now. And not just computers, but also the culture of computing. One of the benefits of buying your electric car from a quirky, tech billionaire whose other hobbies include private rocketry, subsonic pneumatic freight, and planetary exfiltration is that some of those quirks find their way into your vehicle as inside jokes and easter eggs.
For example, the newly released Tesla Model X apparently contains a Bioweapon Defense Mode button that configures the vehicle’s air filtration system more aggressively. It should be useful “if there’s ever an apocalyptic scenario of some kind,” according to Tesla Motors founder, CEO, and quirky billionaire Elon Musk.
While not all of its quirks are quite so zomboid in nature, Bioweapon Defense Mode is hardly the first example in Tesla vehicles, such as the volume control seen above. Some others:
After entering Ludicrous Mode—the car’s bonkers acceleration booster—you can hold down the button for a clip honoring Space Balls, whose Ludicrous speed was the inspiration for the feature:
You can change the car displayed on the Suspension settings menu from a Tesla Model S to the submersible Lotus Esprit from The Spy Who Loved Me:
(Apparently it’s a favorite of Musk’s. He even paid $1 million for the prop in the hopes of converting it into a working submarine.)
The earliest software easter eggs were inserted by programmers as rogue signatures, usually because corporations didn’t want to acknowledge the work of individuals. The Model S tips its hat to this lineage, too. Press the Tesla logo on the display screen, then hold the lower right corner to display a photo of the development team:
Given the gravity of automotive conveyance, I’m not sure I want a billionaire making jokes inside my vehicle. But that might be an old-fashioned worry. Cars have been run by computers for a long time, but now computation is becoming visible within them. Easter eggs are a customary and even expected feature of software. It’s no surprise we’d find—and even want—them in automobiles.An idyllic holiday cottage in the heart of Lustleigh on Devon’s Dartmoor

At the ceremony the Minister of Education, Patrick Faber gave his opening remarks. He noted that this year will be different and challenging due to the new measures that persons must adapt. The new academic school year is all about distance education learning during the Covid-19 pandemic. Minister Faber outlined some of the things the Ministry will be doing to assist teachers and students this time around.
Hon. Patrick Faber, Minister of Education, Youth, Sports and Culture: “I know this will be a school year filled with anxieties, doubts and uncertainties but I want to assure you that the Ministry of Education will do everything in its power to ensure that students are meaningfully engaged in distanced education and that health, safety and students’s welfare are our priorities. Let me share some of the things we are implementing to ensure the success of every student. Students at the pre primary and primary level will have access to free workbooks filled with activities to reinforce the topics taught. Each school will develop a lending library and give story books to each child with guided questions. The National Library Service is also making it possible for parents to borrow about four books over a four week period. We will develop a literacy corner on the Ministry’s Facebook page. The objective of the literacy corner is to encourage daily reading and writing. Teachers will model how to read to and with your children. We will develop model lessons at the various levels with easy to follow research based strategies that parents can use to facilitate learning. Teachers will provide ongoing support to students and parents. Schools are advised to develop a communication plan with parents. Parents I implore you to use this channel of communication.”
Love News reached out to primary schools to see how their first day went. We spoke with the Principal of the La Inmaculada RC School, Lenny Umana who told us that they will be meeting with parents today and tomorrow about the new measures being implemented.
Lenny Umana, Principal, La Immaculada RC Primary School: “We followed all the guidelines that we could put in place that’s temperature testing at the entrance, hand washing and also social distance markers to assist parents and guide them. Our teachers also came well protected with their hand sanitizers, their face masks, their face shields an even gloves because we had to handle some signatures and exchange of pens and paper so we tried to prioritize in the safety of our teachers and our parents alike.”
Reporter: You said you’re meeting with the parents today and tomorrow ?
Lenny Umana, Principal, La Immaculada RC Primary School: “Yes we are because it’s a large population at our school so we have to make sure that we do not have so many people at one spot for any given time so we have spread out the distribution packaging at different hours throughout the day between today and tomorrow. The packages for this month, the month of September includes what we call the learning recovery package which is actually encompassing everything that we have done in third term and ensuring that before we move on our children at La Inmaculada have grasped the concepts of third term. We have also tried to bridge a gap by making sure that our parents join a gmail account through Google classroom for their children so that we can help guide these children during the weeks along with the packages that they have in hand. It cannot go full force because we need to understand that not all our students can get connected especially that high school also use the internet in the house hold but at least twice a week we’re going to try to come on line and give that first hand support to our students through the Google Classroom platform but then we have also closed in the gap by ensuring that all of our parent are online with us via a Whatsapp or via our La Inmaculada School app. So we have three mediums that we will be reaching out to children.”
La Inmaculada School has enrolled 950 students for this school year and according to the Principal there have been some concerns coming from parents and teachers.
Lenny Umana, Principal, La Immaculada RC Primary School: “The greatest concern is ensuring that none of us catch the virus. My teachers are having a challenging time because we need to understand that teachers are also experiencing new changes, things that they are not used to so at adapting to the new kind of technology, going into platforms and linking different things into their little pages, creating their little Bitmojis and what we would call the online classroom setting is not easy and teachers that would take maybe a year to come online have done that in a matter of two weeks. It has been challenging but it has not been impossible. It has been frustrating but we are managing and we are taking the first month of September as a test run to see how best this can work, this is an extra giving to our children. The other side of it is the parent you know I understand that most parents work, we’re going through challenging times and they will practically doing I would say 50% of the work at home to get their children on target along with us so I could imaging their frustration trying to do their job plus also do the job at home of helping to guide their children. So in both ends we can see that yes there is challenges ahead but I am sure that with effort and team effort they give me 50% our school will give the best they can make it 70% if possible and try to find a way forward.”2020/8/14 · This lateral file cabinet is spacious enough to keep large documents but it is also compact enough to fit smaller offices.

It is not the first time Qualcomm has not released open source drivers for their Adreno chips. Jean-Baptiste Quéru was asked back in November of 2012 why there was a lack of AOSP and factory images for the Nexus 4 when Qualcomm initially refused to release their open source drivers for the Adreno 320 that the Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro had. After months of frustrations and being blamed for the lack of driver releases, the leader officially stepped down from his post. For those who are unfamiliar with the AOSP, they are the open source branch of the Android ecosystem. AOSP builds are compiled with open source drivers and without manufacturers releasing open source drivers, people cannot build pure AOSP builds. AOSP is critical for the Android development community as it provides the pure Android builds which proprietary builds will eventually be based on. The modding community relies on it as they can take the source code and modify them for their own builds. A side-effect of this is that the new Nexus 7 (2013) model may never see a factory image released by Google. These factory images are stock images that are used by people to perform a full reinstallation of their Nexus device in the event that their modding endeavours go horribly wrong or they just want a completely fresh start on their devices. Qualcomm's hesitation in releasing the much needed Adreno GPU drivers and having Jean-Baptiste Quéru stepping down are major blows to the Android open source community.

Q&A: Greg Lynn on Architecture’s Early Flirtations With the Computer
The Canadian Centre for Architecture and Greg Lynn uncover the early history of digital design.Broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae [Pursh] Britton & Rusby) increases and dominates rangelands following disturbances, such as overgrazing, fire, and drought. However, if cattle can be forced to graze broom snakeweed, they may be used as a biological tool to control it. Cattle grazed broom snakeweed in May and August 2004–2007. Narrow grazing lanes were fenced to restrict availability of herbaceous forage to force cattle to graze broom snakeweed. They used 50–85% of broom snakeweed biomass. Mature broom snakeweed plant density declined because of prolonged drought, but the decline was greater in grazed lanes. At the end of the study, density of mature plants in grazed lanes was 0.31 plants · m−2, compared with 0.79 plants · m−s and summer-grazed lanes. The cattle were not able to use the large volume of new broom snakeweed plants in the spring-grazed pasture. They did reduce the number of seedlings and juvenile plants in the summer-grazed pasture. Intense grazing pressure and heavy use did not adversely affect crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum [L.] Gaertn.) cover, and it was actually higher in the summer grazed lanes than the ungrazed control transects. In moderate stands of broom snakeweed, cattle can be forced to graze broom snakeweed and reduce its density without adversely affecting the associated crested wheatgrass 2009Should we put numerical attributes in the dimension table or in the fact table? Numerical attributes are static attributes of an entity but they are numeric, not string. For example: interest rate of a swap and weight of a product.
I usually follow the textbook approach and put them in the dimension. But for measures and attributes of OTC derivative instruments, we should be putting them in the fact table.
The fact table contains daily (and intraday) valuations, such as price, market value and the “Greeks”. An interest rate swap usually has a fixed leg and a floating leg. For example, receive 0.886% pay EUR 3m + 0.567%. So we will get a fixed interest rate of 0.886% and pay our counterparty the rate of EURIBOR 3m plus 0.567% (currently EURIBOR 3m is -0.329%).
These two attributes (the 0.886% and 0.567%) are part of the interest rate swap contract and are fixed for the duration of the contract (until maturity). When it reaches the maturity date, the contract ends and if we want to extend it, we will normally make a new contract, with a new SEDOL. Hence these 2 attributes are essentially static attributes (they are called receive interest rate and pay interest rate).
Because they are static they should be put into the dimension, which in this case is the security dimension or instrument dimension, rather than the fact table, which in this case is the instrument valuation fact table.
But I recommend putting them into the fact table for 4 reasons:
- Incorrect business judgement (a simple “sweep all” rule, and if we are wrong then it’s not too bad)
- Bytes
- Floating
- Calculation
1. Incorrect business judgement
There are many types of OTC derivative instruments, e.g. Interest Rate Swaps, Credit Default Swap, FX Options, Equity Index Swap, CDS Options, Asset Swap, Total Return Swap, etc. There are about 15 of them, each with different numerical attributes. So in there are about 50 or so numerical attributes.
We could sit down with the business and categorise these 50 numerical attributes into two:
- A measure or fact: meaning they are potentially changing every day
- A dimension attribute: meaning that they are static and never change
But the business judgement could be wrong. Something which they think is static could be changing. Here are some of those 50 attributes and imagine you sit down with the business categorising them into the two categories above:
Strike price interval, put option premium, strike price, intrinsic value, market value, fair value, time value, put call ratio, put call parity, recovery rate, expiration value, underlying asset value, fixed interest rate, floating interest rate margin, nominal amount, notional value, pay duration, pay/receive spread, pay/receive margin, credit spread.
In addition to the input from the business people, it can be useful to check the source system for historical changes. Does the value of that column/field ever changes? If yes, how often?
If we miscategorise them, there are two things which can happen:
a) A measure is miscategorised as an attribute
b) An attribute is miscategorised as a measure
Generally speaking, b) is fine but a) has quite serious consequences, because a) means that 1 instrument in the instrument dimension can have 100 rows, even 1000 rows. And if we have 300,000 instruments (covering both active positions, and non-active positions), the size of the instrument dimension will be very big, 300 million rows, making it slow.
The reason an instrument can have 1000 rows is that the attribute is actually a measure. We think it is static, but it actually changes every day. Or even several times a day.
On the other hand if an attribute is miscategorised as a measure, that attribute will be put in the fact table. And because it is numeric, it does not take a lot of bytes, even if it is repeated every day.
So to be safe, if you are not sure, put it as a measure in the fact table. The setup of an instrument can take a few weeks, particularly if it is a swap. During this period there is a continuous update on the instrument rows. If we have 20 numerical attributes for a swap, during this few weeks period we could have 20 rows because on day 1 only 5 attributes are setup, on day 2 another 5 is setup, on day 3 another 5, and on day 4 they change the attribute setup on day 1, and so on. So the whole thing can take 3 weeks, producing 20 rows. If it is in the fact table, a) we will only get 1 version a day, and b) we are preventing the instrument dimension from ballooning into many millions of rows.
2. Bytes
Numerical attributes take up much less bytes / disk space compared to textual attributes. Therefore, it does not slow things down if we put numerical attributes in the fact table, compared to the risk of miscategorising them into the instrument dimension, which will cause the dimension to “explode”.
3. Floating
If the attribute value is 0.00352281 and it is a float in the source system, it can be stored as 0.0035228100000000001. And it is possible that the value in the following day is 0.0035228100000000000, just because of the rounding in the floating point processor. Perhaps it is derived from a calculation of A/B. And if it changing from 00001 to 00000 then to 00001 again the next day, we have a phenomenon called “Flip Flop”. Flip Flop is where a dimension attribute keep changing values (usually twice a day) because it is updated from 2 different systems. This causes the number of rows in the dimension to “explode”.
4. Calculation
The last argument is that numerical attributes might be required for calculation, for example column1 divided by column2, or column1 + column2 + column3. If all columns involved in the calculation are stored in the fact table, we will be able to perform the calculation without joining the any dimension. We just need to filter on the partitioning date of the fact table, which is very fast.
Conclusion
I am not advocating to store all numerical attributes in the fact table for all cases. Only in the case of OTC instrument, I would recommend putting the numerical attributes in the fact table, because of the 4 reasons above.
But for most cases, usually the best approach is to put the numerical attributes in the dimension. For example: the dimension of a product (the width, length and height) and the weight of a product. Yes they do change from time to time, but not daily, hence we want to record these changes as SCD type 2 in the product dimension.Today in Toronto: Garrison Movie Night, Jen Mann, Heat + Milk Lines, Dress Rehearsal for an Execution

Anglo American PLC (LSE:AAL) has appointed a female chief executive for the first time to run its South African iron ore business as it restructures its top commodity branch management. The change comes at a time when mining continues to be dominated by men despite efforts by some companies, including the BHP Group, to increase the presence of women in their boardrooms. Mpumi Zikalala, the chief executive of De Beers, will become chief executive of South Africa’s Kumba Iron Ore Ltd., starting January 1, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.
She replaces Themba Mkhwanazi, who will take over as head of the bulk commodities division following the departure of Seamus French. The appointment comes after Anglo American appointed Natasha Viljoen as CEO of its platinum-group metals business, Anglo American Platinum Ltd, last year.
Ruben Fernandes, CEO of Base Metals, will assume responsibility for the iron ore and nickel business in Brazil, Anglo has announced. He will also oversee the Quellaveco copper operation in Peru, although it is still awaiting commission.
Zikalala, 42, was appointed head of De Beers’ South African and Canadian operations in 2019. She joined De Beers in 2007. Although she lacks bulk commodity experience, her background at Anglo and extensive management experience and technical qualifications in engineering offset all of investors’ immediate concerns, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence commented.
Chinese demand for high-grade iron ore from Kumba has made it one of Anglo’s most profitable assets. Its shares fell 2.1% in Johannesburg on Tuesday, extending its decline this year to 23%. This will ultimately be a turnaround operation for Zikalala.
While Kumba benefited in recent years from rising prices, Zikalala faces the challenge of finding new deposits to expand the open-pit Sishen mine in South Africa’s North Cape province.
According to the World Bank, the pullback in prices is the result of persistent oversupply, owing to weak demand from China’s steel-producing sector and the depletion of iron ore inventories by Chinese factories. Prices have risen slightly in recent weeks, but are still only a fraction of their May 2021 peak of $229.50.
Trade in iron ore makes it the second-largest commodity market after crude oil, and Australia has a significant share of these markets, accounting for more than half of the iron ore market by exported sea. Australia’s Pilbara region is one of the largest deposits of iron ore in Australia, and major investments were made to ensure that production and processing costs are low. Magnetite ore has an established presence in global production and contributes to Australia’s EDR iron ore with established operations such as Savage River in Tasmania, Sino Iron in Pilbara, and other magnetite deposits in Western Australia and South Australia.
The slowdown in the Chinese economy is taking its toll on iron ore supply. Commonwealth Bank of Australia found that Australia’s maritime supplies fell in its most recent measurement, while China’s iron ore stocks contracted for two weeks in a row. Chinese stocks of iron ore and steel manufactured products, which were built on the expectation of a large stimulus package, have materialized and are running out, exacerbating downward swings in prices.
Iron ore has taken on a role as a global proxy and indicator of economic health, competing against copper. The reason for this is the growing interest of investors in steel raw materials, because they are linked to the industrial economic cycle and China is the world’s largest consumer, acting as a global economic driving force.
Given the ubiquity of steel – steel accounts for 95% of the world’s metal production – iron ore, the raw material from which steel is made, will likely always be a critical piece of the mining industry’s output.
Many meteorites contain large quantities of iron ore, and modern society relies on metallic ores to supply industry, infrastructure, and miners in search of new ore. Iron is used in glass, fertilizer, and solid-fuel rockets and was used in the space shuttle before it left Earth’s atmosphere. The challenge for steel production is to produce iron ore that enables sustainable growth while reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the production process itself.
As Kumba begins its trek to a turnaround, Zikalala will have an uphill battle to contend with. However, optimism over economic rebounds post-pandemic as well as an ambitious infrastructure spending bill in the United States could see demand spike again along with iron ore prices.
The recent turmoil caused by Evergrande’s debt crisis has also thrown iron ore prices into the middle of a volatile storm. The Chinese government will likely look to settle the issue and assuage investors’ doubts to reestablish stability for the steel industry which is the primary driver of iron ore prices.

Abstract. From basic physical assumptions we derive a simple linear model of the global CO2 cycle without free parameters. It yields excellent agreement with the observations reported by the carbon dioxide information analysis center (CDIAC) as time series of atmospheric CO2 growth, of sinks in the ocean and of absorption by the biosphere. The agreement extends from the year 1850 until present (2013). Based on anthropogenic CO2 emission scenarios until 2150, future atmospheric CO2 concentrations are calculated. As the model shows, and depending on the emission scenario, the airborne fraction of CO2 begins to decrease in the year ~ 2050 and becomes negative at the latest in ~ 2130. At the same time the concentration of the atmospheric CO2 will reach a maximum between ~ 500 and ~ 900 ppm. As a consequence, increasing anthropogenic CO2 emissions will make the ocean and the biosphere the main reservoirs of anthropogenic CO2 in the long run. Latest in about 150 years, anthropogenic CO2 emission will no longer increase the CO2 content of the atmosphere.

W. Weber et al.is about 37°C, physical activity generates an excess of heat in the body as a by-product of muscular work. Typically, only about 25% of total energy is used for motion, while the other 75% is lost through heat production. Under hot environmental conditions, significantly more heat is generated in the body than is required to maintain normal core body temperature (especially during prolonged endurance exercise). This causes the body temperature to rise even further, which inevitably leads to a drop in performance or even a complete need to stop if individual limits are exceeded.
To acclimatise the body to the heat, athletes are often advised to train for at least two weeks in a climate similar to that expected during competition. If this is not possible (especially this year due to the Covid regulations), the use of a heat chamber can be used as part of the acclimatisation process.
In preparation for the Olympic Games in Tokyo, the LIHPS had set up an individual heat acclimatisation protocol for Christine Majerus (FSCL) and Stefan Zachäus (FLTri) in the heat chamber of the High Performance Training and Recovery Center at the Coque. Typical training sessions in the heat chamber are usually conducted at 35-40°C and last around 45-60 min. Considering the short lead-up to their respective competitions in Tokyo, the additional stress on the body due to the heat needs to be carefully considered.
Scientific research suggests that the resulting acclimatisation is based on the following physiological and mental adjustments:
- Reduced mineral loss and higher sweat rate to improve cooling;
- Increased blood volume to better dissipate body heat to the periphery accompanied by a decrease in heart rate;
- Improved heat tolerance at the cellular level (e.g. increased formation of heat shock proteins);
- Improved cognitive and perceived heat tolerance.

Hase Safety Group.
Automated industrial trucks come into their own wherever recurring transport tasks with standardised transfer stations and homogeneous load carriers are required. A high degree of flexibility is ensured by scaling with additional trucks, different automation levels and adjustable routes. One excellent example of this is the expansion of Hase Safety Group’s automated warehouse, which uses high-performance automated trucks from STILL. Route optimisations and automation of incoming goods checks are also used to help improve performance. With the market for work safety clothes rapidly expanding, there is also a need for more warehouse capacity. Hase Safety has made its warehouse fit for the future by expanding the capacity to 10,000 pallet locations and introducing automation technology from STILL.
Growth trajectory at Hase Safety
Over the course of its 80-year history, Hase Safety Group AG, based in the town of Jever in north-western Germany, has focused on the manufacture of work safety clothes. To this day, the company still has its sights firmly set on growth. In line with this, the company recently decided to expand its premises. The new building will house logistics areas, an innovation centre for client training, product development and a showroom.
Theodor Wagner, President of Hase Safety Group AG explains: “This is the only way we could meet the growing demand for new products. Greater turnover of goods for our customers throughout Europe also requires more warehouse capacity, plus efficient and economical warehousing.”
More automation means more productivity
For short journeys, the various items are packed in boxes and, following ABC analysis, stored on pallets according to type in the narrow aisle warehouse. All AGV’s (Automated Guided Vehicles) navigate using rotating laser scanners, which constantly measure distances to installed reflectors, enabling them to move safely and autonomously. Three MX-X iGo systems Very Narrow Aisle Trucks and four EXV-SF iGo systems high lift pallet trucks from the latest generation were each fitted with the iGo systems automation kit from STILL. Standardised components, controllers and interfaces turn the forklift trucks into high-performance AGVs.
In incoming goods, the boxes with new items are collected from shipping containers via telescopic conveyor belt. Logistics employees then put the boxes on pallets using vacuum lifting aids separated according to type and send these to the incoming goods positions. Manual scanning of the storage locations and the items triggers the IT system to perform storage tasks automatically. Project and IT Manager at Hase Safety, Maximilian Engels, explains further: “We have worked with STILL to automate many of the processes in incoming goods. As well as the new AGV, the newly programmed route optimisations also help to improve performance.”
With automatic storage, EXV iGo systems high lift pallet trucks collect the pallets of separated materials in incoming goods and take them to the contour check. If they pass, they are transported by the EXV to the narrow aisle warehouse where they are then stored in the assigned storage locations by MX-X iGo systems turret trucks. If goods are being retrieved, the process works in reverse with the MX-X transporting the relevant pallet to the transfer point. This, in turn, is then collected by the EXV and either transported to the delivery shelf of the manual order picking warehouse or directly to the HGV’s shipping points. Once the storage/retrieval jobs are completed, the AGVs return automatically to their waiting positions for the next job.
“One consequence of the route optimisations is that fewer transport jobs are required, which means the AGVs don’t need to move around as much. This has also significantly improved safety in the warehouse. Despite the coronavirus pandemic, and thanks to the close collaboration between our team and the project managers at STILL, we were able to successfully reorganise the software and hardware for our automated warehouse. As a result, we are now extremely well equipped to deal with all future challenges,” summarises Engels.
Service directly on site
STILL has built a wide network of service technicians throughout Germany and abroad over the years. If a forklift truck develops a fault or maintenance is required, a service technician is always available to attend on site in no time. Sales adviser for intralogistics systems and project manager from STILL’s Bremen subsidiary, Lars Lemke, expands on this point: “When we sell trucks, our customers always have easy access to service technicians who are specially trained in our automated products. Stefan Schuster is one example of this, having provided consistent support for Hase Safety’s automated warehouse right from the start. In doing so, he has gained further knowledge of the various expansion stages.”
Autonomous charging of truck batteries
The modern photovoltaics system, which covers an area of more than 10,000 m2, supplies green energy for charging forklift truck batteries. “The AGVs drive autonomously to their charging stations to charge their batteries. There is no need to connect a cable and the trucks are charged through floor contact alone. This is another plus point, as the AGVs can now charge their own batteries overnight without any additional personnel required,” says Lemke.
One-shift operation still possible
The shipping containers from Bremerhaven are not only delivered all day, but also at night. Theodor Wagner explains: “By reorganising our automated warehouse, we can now store goods during the evening and overnight without personnel being present. This is a key requirement for the new processes. Despite the increasing demand on the market for work safety clothing, the new system allows us to continue with our one-shift operation.”
Narrower aisles for MX-X iGo systems with telescopic forks provide greater storage density and more capacity
All MX-X’s are fitted with telescopic forks in comparison to turret trucks with swivel traverse forks, meaning the aisles at Hase Safety can be significantly narrower. The storage density and capacity are both higher as a result.
Maximum flexibility in the scalable automated warehouse
Thanks to the scalability of the automated warehouse, additional AGVs can be introduced quickly and flexibly to deal with increased capacity requirements. The fact that the AGVs can be operated by hand for certain warehouse processes underlines just how flexible Hase Safety’s warehouse is.
Summary
The modern distribution centre with the iGo systems automated warehouse from STILL is ideally equipped for future requirements. Thanks to the system, the preferences and requirements of major customers can be met and the products delivered throughout Europe promptly and on schedule. “For over 30 years, we have been relying on STILL as a partner that can quickly turn our ideas into a reality. We started automating our logistics systems as early as 2010. In recent years, we have been constantly expanding our automated warehouse and this most recent project has brought it in line with the state of the art. With STILL’s long history of automation experience and expertise, not only in planning and design, but also with the final implementation of the solution, they have always provided us with the best possible support,” summarises a satisfied Theodor Wagner.Welcome for All: Supporting LGBTQ Refugees at Home and Abroad
1:00:45.Letters: Letting bikes into wilderness would cripple protections
As usual, Utah Senators Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee should be ashamed of themselves for their career-long war against the conservation of America's public lands. Their latest Trojan Horse is called the "Human-Powered Travel in Wilderness Areas Act, S.3205." It's an attempt to cripple protections for American Public Land Wilderness Areas to allow mechanized travel. I imagine Teddy Roosevelt is turning over in his grave.
By allowing bikes in all wilderness areas, the Lee-Hatch legislation would undermine the 1964 Wilderness Act that was enacted to protect America's wild lands from growing mechanization. In truth, 95 percent of the United states is open to mechanized travel. In other words, bikes are currently allowed to go just about anywhere. Even the slightest modicum of respect for the wild minority of 5 percent would argue in favor the preservation of federally protected wilderness areas and against S.3205.

Anthony, Jordan, and I reviewed our algebra word problems. We discussed how x amount of oranges plus 16 pieces of fruit equals 42 pieces of fruit, and that when you subtract the 16 pieces of fruit from the total 42 pieces of fruit you get 2 pineapples (the moral of this story is read your word problems throughly). After that we had a lesson on how to write a literary response. Then came lunch. Todays lunch was quite philosophical, what i mean is Jordan, Anthony, and I were playing a game where we tested our knowledge of one another.It was quite serious until Jordan asked a philosophical question that we expanded upon until we had a very adolescent-esque universe. but we were brought back down to earth when we had our grammar work shop and we analyzed a sentence from great expectations by Charles dickens. after that we had a lesson on how to use the library database, and everyone got frustrated because the database was not letting us access the documents.

Saint Mary's College
Saint Mary's College implemented a print accounting system for all computer cluster
printers beginning in the fall 2006 semester. The software we use was originally called PrintLimit,
but is now called PaperCut.
With the with the increase in submitting assignments and papers digitally during the COVID-19 pandemic and the move to remote learning,
it has become apparent that Saint Mary’s students and faculty CAN operate in a digital environment.
The Student Government Association views this as an opportunity to promote greener initiatives by decreasing wasteful printing
and lessening our environmental footprint.
Beginning with the 2020/2021 academic year, Saint Mary’s students will be provided with an annual $50 quota that translates to
approximately 500 black and white sheets of paper, which is a 50% decrease from the previous printing quota.
This decrease is intended to make Belles more conscientious about printing sheets of paper in an effort to make our campus more
green by eliminating waste and unnecessary printing. (Student Government Association, July 20, 2020)
All Saint Mary's students will be given a $50 credit (500 black and white pages) for printing
each academic year. An individual's unused quota, either from the provided quota or additional
quota purchased via print cards, will be carried over from year to year
until a student graduates or leaves the College.
A student will only have to pay for
printing if this initial $50 quota is used up during the academic year.
Students will be able to purchase additional print quota through print cards
available in the ResNet Office, B11 Cushwa-Leighton Library (hours are posted
at).
Cards will be available in $5, $10, and $20 denominations.
Students must bring their student ID cards with them to purchase print cards, and their purchases will go on their student accounts.
There are no refunds, returns, or exchanges on print cards.
Students will be charged 10¢ per page printed. For example, if a student prints out an
eleven-page document, her account will be charged $1.10 for the printout.
When a student prints a document double-sided, her account will still be charged 10¢ for each piece of paper that is printed. For example, if a student prints out an eleven-page document double-sided, her account will be charged $0.60 for the printout.
The majority of printers in the computer clusters and classrooms on campus print double-sided by default. Single-sided printing is available only on the Trumper LaserJet 2 and Spes Unica 336 LaserJet printers.
There is a color printer available in the Trumper Computer Center.
Trumper is accessible 24/7 when classes are in session.
Students will be charged 50¢ per page printed on the color printer.
Student groups on campus will not be provided with free printing. Student groups that
wish to print using the group's account (rather than have students' personal accounts
charged for printing) will need to purchase print cards. Any student
group that has a Saint Mary's e-mail account or web page can use that same account for
printing once print cards have been purchased. If a group has purchased print cards and
has entered the necessary information into the group's PrintLimit account, they can print
using their group's username and password when prompted to have the group's account charged
rather than an individual's account for the print job.
For tips on how to help reduce your personal printing costs in the clusters, including
instructions on how to print documents double-sided, printing multiple PowerPoint slides
to a page, and how to print multiple pages on a single side of a piece of paper, please
visit the
Clusters FAQ at.
You should see a pop-up window appear automatically with your PrintLimit quota
when you log into a cluster or classroom computer.
Cluster Consultants and ResNet Computer Consultants do not give refunds for printouts.
Refunds will only be given if there was a known printer problem at the time you were printing,
and refunds will be given at the discretion of Information Technology staff.

Refunds, if given, should not be expected to appear on your account immediately.
You can also request a refund through the PrintLimit website at.
Log in with your Saint Mary's username and password, click Recent Print Jobs in the left column, and click on the
request refund link next to the job you would like to have refunded.
Enter a reason for the refund request, then click Send to submit the request.
Refund requests must be submitted within 24 hours of the failed attempt to print.
Requests submitted after 24 hours have passed cannot be honored.
When a printer becomes jammed or is otherwise unable to print, jobs that are sent to the printer
but are not printed are usually refunded automatically, with no refund request necessary.
You can check if a print attempt was refunded by visiting.
Log in with your Saint Mary's username and password, click Recent Print Jobs in the left column. In the right column, the
print job will indicate if it has been refunded.
Refunds for unintentional printouts (PowerPoint slides printed one per page, blank pages, multiple copies, etc.) will
NOT be given.
Refunds will also not be given if the print job is cancelled at the printer.
Exceptions will be made if a Cluster Consultant,
RCC, or Information Technology staff cancelled the print job because of a
known printer problem at the time you were printing.
Cash refunds for unused printing quota, either from the provided quota or additional quota purchased via print cards, will not be given.
To purchase additional quota, please use this form in the ResNet Office after being directed to by an RCC. There are no refunds, returns, or exchanges on print cards, so please follow these instructions carefully.

PPC advertising offers a solution to the troubles of marketing. We’re going to explore a little bit about pay-per-click advertising (PPC) in this article. Specifically, we’ll dive into some information about white label PPC management service, and why it’s a good idea to get some help from the pros.
What Is White Label PPC?
To start, let’s take a little look at what PPC is in general.
The term stands for “pay-per-click,” and the name refers to the manner in which you’re charged for services. Once your advertisement is out in the world, you won’t pay for anything unless the content is engaged with.
That could mean a like, comment, subscribe, share, or some other metric of success. While it’s just sitting out there in your audience’s feeds, though, you won’t have to pay a cent.
Rates for engagement vary across platforms, but the fact remains that you can set a budget and the costs will never exceed what you want them to. We’ll get back to this idea in a moment.
PPC services exist on social media sites and search engines. It’s not a stretch to imagine that there will be more platforms to use PPC on in the future, but search engines and social media are where most of the action is right now.
The ads you produce are the “sponsored ads” or posts that you see in your feed or search results. From a business perspective, there are a lot of factors about pay-per-click that are extremely valuable.
Let’s take a look at some of those benefits:
1. PPC Is Cost-Effective
As we mentioned, the costs of pay-per-click are precisely related to the value you get from the service. It doesn’t cost anything to set up an ad account, find an audience, or send your content out into the world.
That whole process comes free of charge. The only time you’ll pay is when someone likes what you’ve posted and engages with it. Even then, the cost you’ll face is minimal.
That payment model is sort of revolutionary, considering you used to pay exorbitant amounts of money for ads that might not even work. Something that makes the situation even sweeter is that your ads will only be displayed to people who have a good chance of being interested.
2. You’ll Reach Receptive Audiences
The next piece of the puzzle is that social media and search engine platforms hold onto a great deal of personal and demographic information. The fact that people use social media so much lends itself to those social media companies cultivating a pretty good idea of what users like and don’t like.
Further, they have a good idea of what they are like. That data allows you to identify a clear target audience and market your content specifically to them.
Have you noticed that a lot of the advertisements you see on social media are related to things that you have actually expressed interest in? The only times you see random advertisements are when the companies putting them forward have massive budgets and can afford to washout the ad space for a while. The same goes for politicians running for office.
When it comes to products and services, though, the ads we see tend to relate directly to us.
What’s even better is that, not only do you reach people who are interested in you, but you also reach a high number of them. A limited marketing budget can expose your brand to thousands upon thousands of people.
Keep in mind that your ad, even if it isn’t engaged with, is seen. 10,000 people might see your ad and only about 500 engage with it. That’s still a lot of free exposure, and the sales funnel takes a few exposures for someone to engage with you in some cases.
As you boost your budget, you’ll only be exposed to more and more individuals.
3. You Can Get a Little Help
The process of creating really effective PPC ads can be challenging. You might be able to throw an advertisement out there and have a little success, but it’s possible to really see some returns on your investment.
There’ an art to creating an ad campaign, researching keyword terms, finding an audience, sorting out a content schedule, and having an idea as to how the campaign fits into the broader plan of your business goals.
Those things are made a lot easier when you work with a skilled team. Further, professionals can ensure that your PPC campaign is “white label.” White label digital marketing practices are those that follow the best practices and guidelines of search engines and social media sites.
Penalties for running a shoddy campaign can be harsh sometimes, and a lot of business owners don’t even know when they’re slipping up. Working with a white label PPC company can help you avoid those pitfalls and experience a whole lot of success.
Figuring out the particulars of a campaign can be very technical and difficult. For example, keyword research is involved in ad placement and content creation. Identifying optimal keywords coming out of your target demographic requires that you find the right audience, explore their habits online, and dissect the different keywords that might work.
It gets a little tricky, and it’s sometimes best to get a helping hand.

phenomenal
it just makes everything sound better and it is so easy to use and experiment / play around with. I love it
T. Spielmacher
Huge upgrade...
Cutting age versions of a vintage studio classic. Totally worth the $99 sale price for such easy professional (and beautiful) results. UA does it again!
M. Walker
bigger !
I was well happy with the first LA 2 but the new collection really is better. It's bigger and smoother more analogue i guess, sounds more expensive and that can't be a bad thing. Great on vocals, bass and room mic's. I can't recommend the LA-2 Collection enough really pleased.
F. Martinsen
Awsome
This is the most amazing LA-2A plugins thats out there. Its just like playing with the real thing. Its a must have for vocals. I also bought the new 1176 package and those are also amazing. And i also saw the new Pultec, this is only getting better and better. Keep up tthe good work. :)
B. Jefferson
Covers my LA-2A plug-in needs, completely.
After purchasing the 1176 Collection and loving them, I knew I had to try these when they debuted. I already had all of the most popular LA-2A emulations from other developers, as well as the legacy UAD plug-in. I often mixed and matched between the various branded plug-ins and the legacy UAD LA-2A but always felt like it was only 75% "there". However, every since getting these I almost exclusively reach for them no matter the source, if I want a LA-2A plug-in on an insert. I really love these. While they may not always sound drastically different, these cover all of my LA-2A plug-in needs and come very close to what I know of the sound of my hardware.

Teletronix® LA-2A Classic Leveler Collection - it's good!
Hello! Teletronix® LA-2A Classic Leveler Collection loved it! I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of compression - good breaks MIX. It is a pity that requires a lot of resources on the chip UAD (UAD Solo on about 25%)
Good luck!

Game Changer
This is the best analog-style compressor plug-in there is. Makes things sound tight, warm, focused, colorful, and analog. Just beautiful..
S. Haney
best plugin to emulate distortion on compressors
I have tried loads of plugins, and although they can get pretty close like the waves version, once you start ramping up the gain, nothing comes close. To me this is what makes these character compressors so good to work with, you can use it almost like a reverb to get a certain spacial air to your program material, like drums or vocals, and this plug in delivers in spades! The price is amazing for what it can do.
S. Hughes
LA-2A heaven
I already had the original UAD-2 LA-2A that came bundled with the Apollo, and never considered the merit in buying it again as the new Classic Leveller Collection.
So glad that I ended up getting it though. Completely different beast.
UA has outdone itself this time and I feel they've perfected this classic box at long last, and while they were at it, they modelled three classic versions of this DREAM box for audio pros in the know.
I just used these for the first time on a session this week, on lead vocals, guitar, and even bass in the final mix, and that same track for Gold Record artist Noel Parlane is now already playing on air in Ireland, Germany and New Zealand and getting great responses from Radio officials.
That says it all.
N. Pitloglou
The holly "Three"
After purchased the LA-2A Classic Leveler Collection, I spent many hours trying to find which one sounds better. The point? Each one has its own magic depending on the usage. For example on different singers I found that I had better results with different revisions of LA-2A. Is it complicated? No. It's creative! Amazing colors, amazing compression.Highly recommended!
D. Dipietro
How many LA2's do you need?
My inclination was to skip this since I already had the stock LA2. Why do I need more versions of a compressor I've already got. Then of course with the 14 day trial I decided to experiment. Throwing the Gray faced on a kick I recorded for a punk band and changing the emphasis control was all I needed to convince me it was worth the money. That control alone is worth the price for me.
I put the LA2 on everything low end and the emphasis control is now a necessity and the stock LA2 gets very little use.
J. Chaney
Very nice indeed
Look, Feel and Sound ! the GUI just takes you in with all the quirks of the real thing. its elegant across the board. Much better than waves with color options and cpu power. Just get it and stop thinking about it.
M. Linda
Great
Great on vocals, great on bass. Really major step from the old UAD L2-2A plugin.
M. Arias
Excellent
It is a great improvement compared with the previous LA-2A

Investigations on the rolling bearing cage dynamics with regard to different operating conditions and cage properties.

The dynamic behavior of a cage can have a significant influence on the performance and the noise of a rolling bearing. In case of an unstable or high-frequency cage movement, vibrations are transmitted to the adjacent machine elements and the environment, which can influence the operating behavior of the whole system. In addition, a loud noise can often be perceived, which is referred to in the literature as cage rattling or squealing.
In this paper, characteristics of different cage movements are investigated using multibody sim-ulations and experimental investigations. For this purpose, essential properties of the fundamen-tally observable cage movement types “stable”, “unstable” and “circling” are presented. The cal-culated cage dynamics and the type of cage motion are used to show dependencies between the operating conditions and the resulting cage movement such as inner ring rotational speed, bearing load or cage characteristics such as pocket clearance. Based on the simulations, inter-actions between the input parameters can also be determined. The results are used to identify operation-critical conditions and cage properties that lead to high cage dynamics. Finally, a comparison between the results of the multibody calculations and optical measure-ments is made. The optical measurements are performed using high-speed cameras. Reference markers fixed on the cage and digital image correlation allow the evaluation of the kinematics as well as the deformation of the cage. These results are compared with the simulation data to ensure a high quality of dynamics simulation.Published by Universitas PGRI Adi Buana

And the peace I give is a gift the world cannot give. So don’t be troubled or afraid.”Jesus – John 14:27
Okay, friends. I’m not much for having a video of me singing and playing guitar “out there.” But, a number of people requested so here it is, pulled from Sunday’s on-line worship.
Background: Several years ago I was asked to write an updated arrangement of the classic “Jesus Loves Me, This I Know” children’s song. I tried to reinterpret the chords as if James Taylor was playing guitar. Then I wrote new verses, simply sampling a lot of the classic favorite hymns everyone has memorized in their heart.
Consequently, all the sentiments from hymns such as Rock of Ages,Amazing Grace, Precious Lord, Hark The Herald Angels Sing, All Creatures of Our God and King… and more… are right there, just below the surface of the song.
Here are the words; credit, me. Then you can listen to the video from Sunday worship. I didn’t miss too many notes so I won’t be seriously embarrassed.
Enjoy, and feel free to share if it touches your heart. – DEREK. Hark the herald angels sing; all creatures of our God and King. Be thou our vision, precious Lord; a mighty fortress is our God. Yes, Jesus loves me; yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me; the Bible tells me so.
That was really amazing! I love the chords you chose along with those lyrics, it was very beautiful!
Thanks so much. I love the opportunity to do stuff like this once in a while.

Furthermore, making an application for a loan from a bank or credit score rating union could end up slamming your own get also lower!
That’s why folks with bad credit typically move to no credit score assessment lenders. They are lenders whom, whenever may have suspected, cannot check your credit rating before providing you financing. For somebody having poor credit, a no credit check loan feels like exactly the pass! (When it comes down to complete download on no credit score assessment loans, check out the OppU help guide to No credit assessment financial loans right here.)
But if the thing is that a lender that is advertising “guaranteed approval” for their no credit score assessment loans, you should be cautious; because “guaranteed endorsement” is certainly not a real thing. And guarantees similar to this were a hallmark of predatory loan providers that may let you fall into an unending period of obligations.
What is sure acceptance?
Let’s perhaps not overcome around the bush. Assured endorsement was a myth.
In theory, guaranteed approval means that, no matter what poor your financial situations tend to be, this company will provide you money if you sign up for they.
The situation here is that just isn’t therefore. a lender that provided around debts to anybody who sent applications for one could not in operation very long. All lenders involve some variety of minimum guidelines that potential customers need to see.
Of course, the regular for some loan providers is extremely low. Most of the time, all you need to apply for financing from them are a functioning bank account. It’s usually true for payday loan providers, just who make use of a postdated check to “secure” your loan. So check out here long as you has a free account and a pulse, they’ll gladly lend you funds.
But if you’re an associate of 1 associated with the nine million everyone people that dont have a bank account (titled “the unbanked”), then you definitely still wouldn’t be able to get financing from all of these people.
Simple endorsement? Sure. Assured affirmation? Nope!
Promising “guaranteed affirmation” was a risk signal.
The main reason that predatory no credit score assessment lenders advertise “guaranteed acceptance” is easy. They gets your own interest, and it will get you to visit her post or walk into their particular store.
Advertising “guaranteed acceptance” is similar to those click bait websites content that end with “and you won’t believe how it happened next.” It’s a tactic receive the focus and also to enable you to get in door.
While prices are high enough, predatory loan providers may be able to generate income whether or not a lot of consumers cant pay the total loan back.
Preventing the debt pitfall: the reason why capability to payback is really vital.
Most of the time, a promise of “guaranteed affirmation” will come from a payday loan provider. They’re loan providers offering temporary, no credit check financial loans, usually demanding only a postdated check made over to all of them for your quantity loaned plus interest.
Predatory payday loan providers rely on your failure to cover the mortgage in the first place. Rather, they want you to either roll the loan over or repay immediately after which straight away remove a new onealso acknowledged “reborrowing.”
In any event, folk wind up taking out fully mortgage after financing, each and every time having to pay more profit interest, and do not acquiring any nearer to paying down the main. It’s a vicious routine of loans, with no end up in picture.
Plus it’s in addition the anchor associated with payday credit markets. Per research from the customers Financial defense agency , 75 percentage of payday loans fees result from consumers who take 10 or maybe more pay day loans in one single 12-month years.
Predatory lenders like these victimize people with bad credit ratings whom don’t have numerous additional options. It’s not that they disregard a person’s power to pay, it’s that people just who flat out can’t pay for these financial loans make for their utmost, many profitable users.
They are types of loan providers that will market with promises of “guaranteed endorsement.”SBM Offshore, one of the world’s largest suppliers of FPSO vessels for the offshore oil and gas industry, has been ordered to pay 7.0 million CHF (around USD 7.6 million) for bribery in the 2005 – 2012 period.
A year ago, SBM Offshore said that three of its subsidiaries in Switzerland had received a notification from the Bundesanwaltschaft (Public Prosecutor Office) in Bern.
The notification concerned a suspicion that from 2005 till 2012 the three subsidiaries failed to take all reasonable and necessary organizational measures to prevent the commission of acts of active bribery of foreign public officials during the said period, SBM said.
“On this matter, the Swiss public prosecutor has now issued an investigation termination order and a criminal penalty order against the three Swiss subsidiaries, requiring them to pay a total amount of 7.0 million CHF (c. USD 7.6 million),” SBM Offshore said Tuesday.
Erik Lagendijk, Chief Governance, and Compliance Officer said: “The fact pattern and compliance shortcomings prior to 2012 that led to the Swiss penalty are also covered by the legacy resolutions the company concluded in the Netherlands (2014), the United States (2017), and Brazil (2018).
“The termination of the investigation and penalty now also close this old issue in Switzerland on a full and final basis. Today and for many years now, the company has been implementing substantial measures to ensure that it operates with integrity and fully in line with laws, regulations, and with its compliance standards. These measures were also recognized by the Swiss Public Prosecutor Office.”Prep 20 mins • Cook 20 mins • Serves 4.

Close to 6.29 lakh homes are either completely stalled or languishing under heavy-delivery delays across the top 7 cities. At least 71% (approx. 4.49 lakh) of these delayed or stuck units fall within the price-sensitive Rs 80 lakh budget range, according to an ANAROCK study.
The overall value of the 1.74 lakh homes which are totally stuck across the 7 top cities currently exceeds Rs 1,40,613 crore. 66% of these units fall in the price bracket of under Rs 80 lakh.
The Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing (SWAMIH) fund has come to the rescue of several projects, while the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) has also ‘adopted’ some others specifically in NCR.
Stalled Projects – City-wise Data:
# NCR has the maximum stalled stock of close to 1,13,860 units (approx. value Rs 86,463 cr) or 66% of the total across the top 7 cities. Of the total stalled units in the region, 50% is in the mid-segment, followed by 24% in the affordable segment, 20% in the premium segment and 6% in the luxury category.
# MMR has 41,730 totally-stalled units (approx. value Rs 42,417 cr) or 24% of the total affected stock. The maximum stuck stock in MMR is in the luxury category (37%), followed by 22% in affordable housing, 21% in the premium segment, and 20% in the mid-segment.
# Pune, the other major Western market, has a 6% share of stalled units (worth approx. Rs 5,854 cr). Pune has 52% of its stalled stock share in the mid-segment, 26% in the affordable segment, 15% in the premium segment, and 7% in the luxury category.
# In the Southern cities, Chennai has no stalled projects. Hyderabad and Bengaluru together have 8,020 stalled units which is a mere 5% share. The approx. value of stalled projects in these two cities is Rs 5,788 cr.
# In Bengaluru, of the total 3,870 stalled units, 44% are in the mid-segment, 32% in the premium segment, 17% in the luxury category, and just 7% in the affordable housing category. In Hyderabad, of total 4,150 stalled units, 55% are in the mid-segment, 28% in the premium segment, 9% in the luxury category, and in the affordable housing segment.
# Kolkata has a mere 150 stalled units (valued at approx. Rs 91 cr). All stalled units are priced >Rs 80 lakh.
The Larger Palette – Stalled & Delayed Projects
Altogether, close to 6.29 lakh homes are either completely stalled or languishing under heavy delivery delays across the top 7 cities. At least 71% (approx. 4.49 lakh) of these delayed or stuck units fall within the price-sensitive Rs 80 lakh budget range. Just 18% fall in the premium segment, and another 11% in the luxury category.
Launched in 2014 or before, the total value of the currently stuck/delayed housing stock exceeds Rs 5.05 lakh crore. Nearly 28% (approx. 1,73,730) of these units are completely stalled.
City-wise Data:
# NCR has overtaken MMR with a 52% share of the stuck/delayed stock, the highest in the top 7 cities – approx. value Rs 2,49,540 cr.
# MMR reduced its overall share with several projects getting completed in the last year. Currently, it has 28% of the total affected stock – approx. value Rs 1,52,105 cr.
# Pune, the other major Western market, has an 8% share of stuck/ delayed units – approx. worth Rs 29,390 cr.
# In the Southern cities, housing projects are mostly on track. Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai together have just 11% of the total delayed/stuck units, with Chennai comprising a mere 2% – approx. value of delayed/stuck projects in these three cities is Rs 56,420 cr.
# Kolkata has a 5% share valued at Rs 17,960 crore.
Commenting on the same, Prashant Thakur, Director & Head – Research, ANAROCK Property Consultants, said, “For our earlier 2019-end tally of stalled and heavily-delayed projects, we had considered projects launched in 2013 or before. Now, more than one-and-a-half years later, we have included projects launched in 2014 as well. Thus, there is a rise in the numbers – as of H1 2021-end, we have nearly 6.29 lakh units that are yet to be completed across the top 7 cities.”
“Previously, NCR had a 35% share of total delayed units (in 2019). However, its share has now increased to 52% as several projects launched in NCR in 2014 are also included. There are many possible reasons, including COVID-19, funding issues, and litigations. The decrease in delayed units in Pune and MMR is remarkable – from 16% and 36% by 2019-end to 8% and 24% by H1 2021-end,” he added.
City-Wise Budget Segmentation
Of close to 6.29 lakh delayed/stuck units, close to 39% (approx. 2,47,930 units) is in the mid-range segment where units are priced within Rs 40-80 lakh, followed by 32% (approx. 2,01,350 units) in the affordable housing segment (priced <Rs 40 lakh). Premium homes (Rs 80 lakh to Rs 1.5 cr) account for 18% (approx. 1,11,050 units).

They usually are utilized by customers to assistance settle several plastic card bills due to the fact personal loans tend to have more affordable mortgage rates than other charge cards. They may also be used being a car legitimate property rumours, because they have changeable rates of interest and terms. Take into consideration the interest rate pace you need to to carry a personal loan, here are several easy methods to make use of them sensibly.
Primary. Loans are available from many options, which includes credit unions, finance institutions, the federal government and no-benefit groupings including the Masters Affiliation as well as the Joined Way. The phrases are often a lot more favorable for credit rating and banking institutions unions, though the minute rates are not necessarily improved. You need to look around, notably review prices from finance institutions and banks with online creditors. On the net lender companies have the luxury of delivering far more competitive rates, that will actually give you an edge in excess of people you will see inside standard economical sector. Having said that, the expenses utilizing these facilities might counteract this benefit.
When you need to borrow a lot of income, what you can do will likely be substantially decreased for those who opt for a personal cash loan from a standard bank or bank. This is why it may well often be advantageous to search for easy from one of those companies to purchase a more substantial invest in, say for example a residence. When you can easily show that you’re capable with this total and you happen to be able to shell out the dough without having defaulting onto it, you can get those personal loan.
It is best to properly shop around between banking institutions and lending institution, if you decide to borrow money. Bank loans can even be readily available by way of some other sort of banking companies, despite the fact that they are larger in awareness compared to the ones listed here. Many people want to use substantial interest cost savings accounts to help them cope with their loans. You will are apt to have to distance themself your hard earned cash monthly and pay back fascination on it, even though great attention financial savings accounts can be found from other banking institutions. With often sort of loan provider, the transaction words will probably be for a longer period, so you should look at this before signing up for almost any loans.
Some people consolidate higher desire personal debt through out a personal unsecured loan to get rid of bank cards along with other excessive-interest debts. Nevertheless, unsecured loans generally have a very extended settlement expression. When you have a choice, you should always discover the cheapest payment amount you will discover for ones financial obligations. The long term you adopt, the bottom interest rates you’ll pay, after you pay off the financing. Most cards come with low interest rates if you eliminate them in whole, but you might take a look at other choices to lower your payments.
If you have low credit score, maybe you have issues safe-guarding the very best personal cash loan rates or terminology. You might need to exploration loan providers to compare rates. Loan merchants use different factors to determine which consumers to provide consumer credit and those to say no. Low credit score can severely injured your chances of locking down a personal unsecured loan. You might have to repay an improved rate entire as a way to financial the new expenses, and also shell out late charges on your personal loan.
When you finally make your study, start contacting numerous creditors regarding bank loan needs. Be sure you focus on what sort of security you would like to use in the credit. Many financiers would require that you have a thing needed to risk-free the money. You may be able to discover personal loans without having equity demands, however. It is essential to compare diverse creditors to ensure that you receive the best monthly interest probable.
Combining debt is an excellent technique to improve your credit rating scores and find reasonably priced loans. You will end up on the road to creating a sturdy monetary groundwork, by paying off large interest debt. You may also opt to re-finance to scale back the amount of time expected on the recent mortgage and reduced your monthly installments. Bank loans are fantastic for starting new consumer credit and increasing your particular particular predicament.

28th January 2019
Today’s recruitment and retention strategy from the DfE is a welcome step in tackling a challenge that has cast a long shadow over the sector. It is premised on a suprisingly humble admission that there needs to be “an adjustment of focus, recognising that greater attention must be given to ensuring that teaching is a profession where people are supported to stay and thrive”.
It also finally admits, that although more teachers are being brought into the profession, this influx is insufficient to match the current exodus and increase in school age population.
In her accompanying blog Alix sets out the key elements of the new strategy.
Meanwhile, in this blog I want to look at:
• the strategy’s four key pillars;
• their potential to affect change; and,
• how to maximise the impact of the proposed approach.
Pillar One: Climate
“The wider context in which headteachers operate can create pressure that leads to excessive workload that distracts teachers from teaching”
The impact of workload on teacher retention has been highlighted time and again since our 2015 ‘Why Teach?’ report.
Pillar One is a clear acknowledgement that the climate for teachers in our schools needs to improve and I particularly like the recognition that demands on teachers need to be aligned to their intrinsic sense of purpose:
“Teachers have told us that they like to work hard when they can see the difference they are making. When their efforts align with the moral purpose that brought them into the profession, when the support and professional development they receive helps them do their job better, when they feel their work supports pupils to progress – then teachers love the work they do.”
The commitment to a single trigger for intervention should help with this, reducing the need to second guess where the next threat is coming from and giving school leaders a bit more space to do what they know is right. Maintaining a period of greater stability will also be welcome relief after the Govian years of constant change. However it is hard to see how much stability there can be when a new Ofsted framework is about to be introduced.It is hard to see how much stability there can be when a new Ofsted framework is about to be introduced. Click To Tweet
On the other hand, it’s a shame to see that the strategy has stopped short of a more bold move that has been gaining increasing traction recently: three year averages in league tables.
It’s a call we made in our Testing the Waters report and which has also been made by the Education Select Committee, the NAHT and the Head Teachers Rountable .
The move would still allow Ofsted and/or the DfE to look internally for any worrying fluctuations in year-to-year results above a sufficiently high threshold triggering a monitoring inspection if necessary. However, it would ensure that headlines are not distorted by noisy data, cohort effects, small samples, underhand tactics hot-housing of exam year-groups.
Pillar Two: Early career support
“Not enough early career teachers receive the high quality support they need to build the foundation for a successful career.”
It is high time that we improved the development opportunities offered to NQTs.
You cannot stuff everything you think teachers should know into a one-year training programme. Additionally, for many teachers, it’s only once they start teaching full-time with responsibility for their classes that they really start reflecting on and developing what they do.
High quality mentoring and development throughout their first year after qualifying is therefore key and it’s great news that the government has recognised this by committing to:
“an entitlement to a fully-funded, 2-year package of structured support for early career teachers linked to the best available research evidence – alongside funded time off timetable in the second year of teaching and support for mentors “
It goes on to recognise that:
“additional funding is needed to support the roll-out of the Early Career Framework (ECF) reforms – this opportunity will be entirely lost if it is not adequately resourced or it becomes an additional burden on schools.”
It remains to be seen whether the multi-year commitment to £130 million of new funds will be sufficient for schools to take the big steps involved in delivering on these commitments. Furthermore, although the pledge to fund mentors’ time is encouraging, success in this area depends on there being enough teachers available to cover the timetable.
Schools will therefore need to be creative in sourcing support for teachers progressing through the ECF, perhaps from recently retired or semi-retired teachers, or from skilled teachers wanting to progress pedagogy-focused roles. Some MATs already use central, subject specialists in such roles, however the government will have to ensure any new funds can be used flexibly so that this is possible.
Money talks
Money talks, and it’s therefore good to see that today’s strategy pledges:
“a major shift in the incentives for new teachers by introducing phased bursaries – with staggered retention payments to encourage good people to remain in the profession, as well as to join”
Rebalancing incentives towards retention rather than solely recruitment is key, particularly for teachers in their late 20s and early 30s, who flee London in pursuit of better housing and family life. Furthermore, given the important role played by housing, it’s also good to hear the government state that:
“We know that housing is an issue for teachers in areas of short supply. We will explore whether there is demand from teachers for new homes on surplus school land. If there is clear and sufficient demand, we will work with the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) to explore whether an extension of permitted development rights is needed to speed up such developments.”
We raised this issue and shared examples of solutions in The Talent Challenge but the DfE should now push MHCLG to expand key worker housing/affordable housing schemes.
Curriculum resources
High quality curriculum materials are also part of Pillar 2, something teachers may greet with ambivalence; many enjoy the creativity of developing their own resources and I remember that using anyone else’s materials was anathema to me as a teacher. I looked forward to writing each of my new schemes of work. However, it was a huge amount of work and is not really sustainable. It is also questionable how well-placed beginner teachers are to produce the best materials.
I’d hate to see any teacher thinking they had to use off the shelf materials in prescribed, one size fits all ways. However, having access to good materials, permission to use them without feeling like a sell-out, and the skills to adapt and deploy materials appropriately would considerably reduce workload.
Pillar Three: Building an attractive career offer
“A career in teaching does not always adapt to the expertise and lives of teachers.”
The DfE’s commitment to improving career pathways and flexible working came as music to my ears given that both have been key themes in our recent work. The new strategy includes support for job-share matching and a particular focus on teachers who want to continue as classroom specialists by developing “specialist qualifications to support clearer non-leadership career pathways for teachers that want to stay and excel in the classroom.”
The strategy also states that:
“in order to ensure that all teachers are supported to benefit from the opportunities for career progression, these reforms will sit alongside our significant broader efforts to improve diversity and create opportunities for all teachers.”
If this is going to happen in a fair and accessible way, access to opportunities must not be too dependent on school leaders as gatekeepers. We have found that teachers from under-represented, minority ethnic backgrounds are desperate to access career development but sometimes miss out when managers do not put them forward for opportunities.
Teachers therefore need opportunities to apply for development programmes independently of their line managers opening up progression, beyond ‘the usual suspects.’
Localism
Challenging areas sit at the heart of today’s strategy including a commitment to ensuring that:
“the strongest opportunities for career progression and professional development exist when working with the children that can benefit the most.”
This geographical focus is important given that ‘Why Teach?’ showed the highly local nature of recruitment and retention, with teachers tending to pick schools near them, or moving to areas which they have a connection to.
Schools therefore need to think about how to target local potential teachers. Meanwhile those seeking to recruit people from further afield need to sell the area, not just the school. I set out four tips for school leaders on this front here, and I’m really glad to see the government offering to support this by:
“partnering with schools, MATs, and local authorities in challenging areas, to develop attractive “local offer” packages to increase teacher recruitment and retention locally”
Pillar Four: Make it easy
“The process to become a teacher is too complicated and burdensome.”
Last summer, one of my friends asked for advice on how to get into teaching. I know quite a lot about teacher recruitment and ITT and even I struggled to help her navigate the different providers and programmes.
I think it’s a good thing that there are different routes available to suit different circumstances and preferences, but a smorgasbord of options is no use without a clear menu to guide choices.A smorgasbord of options is no use without a clear menu to guide choices. Click To Tweet
I’m not sure what the government has planned in terms of its “new one-stop application system for initial teacher training (ITT), which will be easier to use and designed to better meet the needs of potential trainees.” However, something of this sort is certainly needed.
Finally, today’s strategy pledges to make it easier to ‘try teaching’ through a “Discover Teaching” initiative. Many teachers were sceptical about this idea when the idea was trailed early in January but that’s a mistake. I was astonished when researching ‘Why Teach?’ just how many teachers had stumbled into teaching by accident and gone on to love it.
With strategies like today’s, the proof of the pudding is always in the eating. However, overall I think it looks like a very promising plan.“The proof of the pudding is always in the eating but today’s DfE strategy has the makings of a very promising plan.” Click To Tweet
I’m also really pleased to see that the huge volume of research that has taken place in the field in recent years has clearly helped shape what the government is doing. This will ensure it is properly evidence informed, and I’m glad that our work has been part of that.

“2019 has been a year of record-setting growth for Philadelphia’s travel and tourism sector,” said City of Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney. “Not only are travelers streaming into our city and generating tax dollars and jobs, but they’re also looking outward to explore new horizons throughout the world.”
PHL saw growth in both its domestic and international passenger segments, increasing volume domestically in cities like Bentonville, Arkansas, Las Vegas, Key West and Myrtle Beach while adding new routes to Berlin, Edinburgh and Dubrovnik internationally.
“Philadelphia is competing in an increasingly global economy, which is why a highly connected airport is critical to our continued growth and economic development efforts,” said Philadelphia Commerce Director Harold Epps. “PHL’s connectivity enables us to maintain direct outreach to our international business partners in order to attract new investment and talent for our city.”
The City of Philadelphia’s Division of Aviation owns and operates both PHL and Northeast Philadelphia Airport (PNE), which also saw a year of growth with 75,856 plane movements, a 29% increase year over year. PNE is a general aviation airport, specializing in private transport and the recreational flying component of aviation, as well as the manufacturing or building process of those aircraft.
“It is an honor to lead the outstanding teams at PHL and PNE during this record-breaking year,” said Airport CEO Chellie Cameron. “I am grateful to our more than 21,000 employees, representing partners across airlines, concessions, government, tourism and business, for their dedication to providing the world-class experience and connectivity that our passengers deserve.”
“PHL is going through a tremendous evolution, with a focused vision on connecting Philadelphia to the world,” said PHL Airport Advisory Board Chair Hal Yoh. “Our inclusion of stakeholders throughout the greater Philadelphia region is a testament to our commitment to further success and growth.”

“I can’t see that street sign. I must have developed farsightedness.”
Knowlege is power. Being more informed about your eyes can help you keep your peepers safe and healthy! So we have compiled a list of common optometry medical terms, check them out below:
- Myopia is another term for nearsightedness, which means you can see objects clearer at a closer distance. Hence the name nearsighted.
- Farsightedness is a medical term used to describe someone who can see objects better at a further distance.
- 20/20 vision is a measuring tool for visual acuity. A person who has 20/20 vision is able to see what a normal person should be able to see at 20 feet of distance. The first number indicates your distance in feet from the chart, and the number after the fraction indicates which distance a person with normal eyesight could read at the same distance. For example, someone with 20/80 vision is able to see clearly at 20 feet of distance, while a person with normal vision would be able to see clearly at 80 feet of distance.
- Strabismus is used to describe eye misalignment. Someone with this eye condition may have one or both eyes that are uncoordinated and result in eyes turning inward, outward, upward, or downward.
- Color Blindness, which is an umbrella term, is generally incorrectly understood as being unable to see color, and only being able to see in black or white. This is a form of color blindness; however, it is not the most common type. Those who are color blind, generally have varying levels of difficulty seeing red, blue, or green light, which affects how they see other colors.
- Diabetic retinopathy affects the retina, which is positioned at the back of the eye. The retina has light-sensitive cells, which are referred to as photoreceptors. Individuals with diabetes can develop retinopathy when the retinal blood vessels are damaged. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetics are at risk for developing retinopathy.
If you are unsure of anything being discussed by your family eye doctor, speak up and ask more questions! It is important to be actively involved in your eye exam because it is more than just an updated prescription. It is also a chance to assess the health of your eyes. And remember if you think something is wrong with your eyes, err on the side of caution and see your optometrist sooner than later. You only have the one pair for life!

Additional video from WSAV showed protesters marching and chanting, “If we don’t get it, shut it down” and “What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now”:
Pentland was charged with third-degree assault on Wednesday and reportedly detained in the Richland County jail where he was issued a personal recognizance bond, according to the Associated Press (AP).
The video clip of the initial incident was posted online Monday and showed a man, identified as Pentland, telling another man to leave the neighborhood:

“Walk away right now. You need help? I’m happy to help you,” Pentland told him.
“Pretty sure you were the aggressor, buddy,” a woman out of the frame commented. Moments later, the man tried to move toward her and Pentland appeared to shove him back.
“You better walk away,” he told the man. “You walk away, you’re talking to my wife right now,” he stated.
“You either walk away or I’m going to carry your ass out of here,” Pentland continued, and asked him where his house was located.
“Sir you’re acting like a child, move on. You picked a fight with some random young lady that’s one of our neighbors. Get out of here,” the woman out of the frame said, adding, “All I heard was you fighting and her defending herself.”
Another person asked the man for his name and said, “Come on, you don’t want no trouble,” as he appeared to leave and the video ended.
If convicted, Pentland faces up to 30 days behind bars and a $500 fine, the AP report concluded.

Following the races, l got a chance to ask him some questions.
Q: Who is Brynjar SkjÃ¦rli?
I am 24 years old and live in Lillehammer, Norway. I have been studying economics and last year became the editor of langrenn.com, one of Norway's most popular XC Skiing websites. Despite studies and work, I regard myself as a XC ski-racer.
Q: When did you start ski racing and have you tried other sports?
I have skied and raced since childhood. I played soccer when I was a little kid, however I had absolutly no talent for it. I also competed in Track and Field until I was 16, – participating in most every discipline at young age, but mainly running later. I am still doing some running competitions as a part of my summer training.
Q: Where do you place in Norwegian ski competitions?
I did not do well this year. The highlights were a silver medal in the relay and 17th in 30km skate race at the Norwegian Championship. My best result ever in the Norwegian Championship was when I was 21–12th in sprint and 14th in the 15km pursuit. In the Norwegian Cup (similar to Nor-Am), my best result is a 4th place when I was 23.
Q: How many hours are you training per year?
Up to this point around 600 hours.
Q: Do you have a coach or are you self coached?
I have one person who helps me and with whom I discuss training, but mostly I make my own training decissions.
Q: Do you work out with other skiers in a club or do you train by yourself?
It's all about myself, but that doesn't mean that I train alone. I live
in Lillehammer, and there are a lot of skiiers, and I occasionally train with some of them.
Q: How serious are the other skiers in Lillehammer?
We have about 40 cross country and biathlon skiiers who are seniors and are more or less full-time racers. Some of them even have medals from this year's World championship.
Q: Are you like many Norwegians a “classic specialist”?
I like skating as much as classic
Q: Why do you ski race?
Because I like the challange. I like to train, being out in nature, and I want to see how fast I can be.
Q: How can you afford to ski race? Do you have sponsors?
Up until now I have been living on my student loan and a small grant you get from the goverment (for a while) when you are a student. That income source has now “expired,” so now I will have to work part time in order to support my ski racing
Q: Do you have ambitions to ski World Cup races?
Yes.
Q: How many competitions do you do every year and how many of these are marathons or World loppet type races?
I do about 25 races every season. This year, I have competed in three long races: Finlandia, Engadin skimarathon and the Norwegian birkebeiner.
Q: How did you do?
Finlandia was bad. I don`t remember exactly but about 25th. I was 31th in Engadin, about one minute behind the winner (I have a 7th place there from a few years ago). In the Birke I finished 10th.
Q: How did you hear about the Spring Series in the US?
Friends had participated in past years and had really enjoyed it.
Q: Which races did you do in the Spring Series?
They were all held in Hancock, Michigan. I competed in the 10k skate, 10k classic puirsuit, sprint skate, mass-start skate and sprint relay classic. I finished 2-1-18-2-2
Q: What was the length of your trip and what did it cost you?
We were in the US for about 11 days and the airfare from Norway was
about $645
Q: Did you travel alone?
No my girlfrend, Anja Rynning Veum travelled with me.
Q: Did anyone sponsor your trip?
No, but the organizers gave us excellent accomodations in Hancock – thank you!
Q: What did you think about the races and the competition?
The races was very well organized and the grooming was good – there were no problems. The race courses were as good as the best I have ever raced on. The competition was also good and there were many participants in each race.
Q: Any suggestions for the organizers on how to attract more Europeans?
First suggestion would be run the races one week later, so that all the important European competitions are done. We had to skip the second part of the Norwegian Championship because of this trip.
Second suggestion–I am sorry to say–but money is always attractive!
Q: Would you come back and do more races in the US?
I hope so, I really do!

Read the full report at Fox News..Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a noninvasive procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain, may help relieve symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in veterans, a study in the Journal of Affective Disorders has found.
Michelle R. Madore, Ph.D., of VA Palo Alto Healthcare System and colleagues analyzed data from 770 patients who had major depressive disorder and received at least one TMS session at any of 27 Veterans Administration sites from October 2017 to March 2020. Of these patients, 68.4% also met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD. The researchers defined an adequate dose of TMS as 30 sessions over the course of six to eight weeks. Among all patients, 340 received an adequate dose of TMS.
The researchers used the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the PTSD symptom checklist from DSM-5 (PCL-5) to assess the patients’ mental health before and after the study period.
Among the 340 patients who received all 30 TMS sessions, scores on the PHQ-9 dropped from a mean of 18.34 before treatment to a mean of 11.29 after treatment, suggesting an improvement in their major depressive disorder. In this group, 245 had also met the criteria for PTSD at baseline with a mean PCL-5 score of 52.67, indicating moderate PTSD severity. After TMS, the mean PCL-5 score in this subset was 33.74. Furthermore, 113 (46.1%) of these patients no longer met PTSD criteria.
“These data demonstrate the importance of delivering an entire TMS treatment series,” Madore and colleagues wrote. “Future studies will need to evaluate the relationship between the number of sessions required for optimal outcomes; however, since remission is the goal of antidepressant treatment, patients can be empirically recommended to receive six weeks of TMS.”

Tonyon received a distress call from a good Samaritan that one prominent chief is trying to sell two transformers at Ekeki Yenagoa, the Commissioner alerted the members of the police force whose quick intervention foiled the illegal sale. When the chief was caught in the act the buyer and the driver absconded leaving their truck behind,” the statement read.
The Commissioner applauded the effort of the whistleblower and pled with the public to speak against transformer vandalism and theft.
“When the transformer’s armoured cable or oil etc, gets stolen the people suffer directly, hence we should protect electrical facilities in our neighbourhood.” he added.

Article is closed for comments.Run an online news search for stories about back pain and you will discover something interesting: there are lots of people claiming that many different things helped eliminate their pain. You might be tempted to believe that most of the stories are nonsense. But consider the possibility that they might all be absolutely truthful.
A dozen different articles proposing a dozen different methods for addressing back pain might actually be legitimate. How can that be? It all boils down to the root causes of back pain. When you understand just how many things can create pain in the back, you begin to understand why there are so many different treatments for it.
Back Pain Is Easy to Come By
The cybersphere is littered with articles talking about back pain because the pain itself is so common. In fact, back pain is one of the most frequently heard complaints in doctors’ offices. The pain doctors at Weatherford, Texas-based Lone Star Pain Medicine certainly see their fair share of back pain patients.
They say that back pain is easy to come by; lots of things can cause it. For example, lower back pain is often caused by strained muscles and ligaments. Those muscles and ligaments are strained by physical activity. How do you treat such back pain? You start by identifying the physical activity that is causing it.
If Lone Star is treating a patient whose job includes copious amounts of manual labor, there may be questions of whether that patient does a lot of heavy lifting. And if so, educating the patient in the proper way to lift safely might solve the problem once and for all.
Yoga, Weightlifting, and Exercise
Believe it or not, back pain can be the result of being out of shape. Remember that your spine has to support the entire weight of your upper body. Being out of shape only makes its job more difficult. A lack of physical fitness accompanied by excess weight means even more stress being put on the spine.
What is the solution? Getting in shape. Doctors might recommend yoga to stretch out the muscles and help strengthen them. They might recommend weightlifting to strengthen back and leg muscles. They might suggest general exercise to shed the extra pounds and take more stress off the spine.
Spinal Injections for Chronic Pain
While most cases of temporary back pain are minor, there are times when chronic pain is the result of something more serious. A good example would be a condition known as facet joint syndrome. Facet joints are the joints in the spine and are that which give the spine its flexibility. Facet joint syndrome occurs when these joints begin to break down, thereby causing pain when bones make contact.
A spinal injection is a remarkably effective treatment for facet joint pain. An injection can do a number of things. First, it can bathe the targeted area with pain medicine that offers immediate relief. Second, it can reduce inflammation for more long-term relief.
One-Size-Fits-All Doesn’t Apply
The thing about back pain is that there isn’t a single cause. Likewise, there is no one-size-fits-all treatment that offers every patient significant pain relief. Doctors have to look at every case of back pain based on its own merits. What works for one patient may not work for another.
In the end, everything you read about seems to work for back pain only because there are so many conditions that cause pain. In reality, what you are seeing are a handful of treatments that work on different types of back pain.GET INSPIRED

Other than Queenstown where Luxe Travel Insiders will see breathtaking scenery of fiords, glaciers and turquoise-blue lakes, New Zealand has many other gorgeous spots in the country to explore.
One thing that Luxe Travel Insiders won’t find lacking in New Zealand is majestic, natural landscapes. Luxe Travel Insiders will realise how many different shades of blue lakes, rivers and seas can come in. Sit by the seaside enjoying the cool sea breeze under the sun and just around the corner to admire majestic mountainous landscapes.
Wine lovers can head to Napier in Hawkes Bay, which is famous for its wines and there are many wonderful wineries that are worth a visit, and the best time to visit is in February and July. Aside from having great wines paired with delicious food, Luxe Travel Insiders can join in the celebrations for the Art Deco Festival, where Luxe Travel Insiders can participate in vintage car and railcar rides, or enjoy old-fashioned cocktails and afternoon tea in one of the region’s Art Deco buildings.
Made up of 144 islands, The Bay of Islands is another must-go destination known for its stunning beauty and history. Enjoy the beauty of the area by joining one of the daily cruises, chartering a yacht or taking a kayak out into the sea. While on the water, Luxe Travel Insiders will be able to see the thriving wildlife including penguins, dolphins, marlin, whales, gannets and much more.

Attraction Strategy Students,
This is your temporary training hub, allowing you to download past trainings, free plug N play landing pages and funnels. At the core, you'll at least need a Thrive Themes Membership to download your free landing pages and funnels (#1 below).
Thrive Themes Membership is currently $19 a month. That's 100X times the value when you learn what you get and almost 5X cheaper then programs like Clickfunnels. This page you're on was built with Thrive Themes and I use it for almost everything we do in our business. -- Get Thrive Theme Membership here.
Inside our FB group I walk you step-by-step in building the technical foundation (what every online business needs). Watch our trainings every week to get the password to gain access to this page. --
The 3 Essentials to Start an Online Business
Less than $70/month - $840 bucks/year...
If you can learn how to make just $1 you can learn how to make $71/month and continue profit.
Landing Page Builder Setup - $40/Month
STEP ONE: Get a domain name - $1/month
Domains are not optional like they are for Clickfunnels. Even with Clickfunnels, I recommend using your own branded domain name. Moreover, you'll need a domain name when creating a self-hosted website. To avoid issues I've run into in the past with other domain name providers we use NameCheap -- Pick your domain name here <--- Discounted when you use my link.
STEP TWO: Get Hosting - $20/month
Hosting is the only caveat to going WordPress vs Clickfunnels. This means you have to pay for the real-estate your landing pages use on the web sort-of-speak. I live and die by the hosting company called WPX.net ($21/month). They are a little more expensive than most, but you want your home built on a solid foundation. -- Get hosting with WPX.net here.
STEP THREE: Landing Page Builder Installation - $19/month
I teach my students how to build their own home (Self-hosted WordPress website) - the central connection to their online business. This is critical considering I teach you how to also use it as one of the best landing page builders on the market. Thrive Themes Membership has everything you need to do this. It's absolutely the most important tool you'll need in order to move forward with most of our trainings and free downloads. --
After acquiring a lead your email list works as a holding tank to continue marketing to them, where they grow to know, like and trust you through your products and story. The average list owner shoots for about $1 per subscriber per month. So 1,000 subscribers per month can easily equal $1,000 dollars. The money is in your list. We use Active Campaign. -
Link Tracker - $20/Month (Two Week Trial)
No matter what business you're in you need a link management tool. This is primarily to track who clicks what and how, along with instantly redirecting traffic without actually changing, editing and re-uploading new links. The amount of time you save using a link tracker makes this tool one of the essential 3. We use Build Redirects. -
Free Resources
Ebooks, Documents, Cheat Sheets, Tools, etc.
-- Grab My Free Insightful Traffic Formula (eBook)
This ebook will give you perspective when beginning to build an online business. It also talks about my free and paid method to help you start making money right away. This income stream will be extremely helpful once you're ready to start buying the 3 essential tools (above) to support your business.
-- The Profit Cycle Blueprint
The Profit Cycle Blueprint will help you understand the basics when it comes to setting you sales funnels. These sales funnels are really the core component of all successful online businesses. In this course Anthony outlines for you the entire blueprint, plus he shows you how to start generating revenue and commissions from your very own Profit Cycles! It complements what I teach you in the training hub (once we get to that week) very well.
-- Password Manager
This has been the best thing for me since sliced bread. Seriously! I never have to worry about wasting time on those silly forgot password links. Also, if you aren't already using a password manager, you're probably using the same few passwords on many different websites or you've got notes or spreadsheets with all your passwords written down. Both of those are terrible for your online security. This will fix all that.
-- Get Russell Brunson's "Traffic Secrets"
This isn't entirely free as you have to pay for shipping and handling. Regardless, I include his book here because it's one of the best resources out there that talk about not just getting traffic, but getting evergreen traffic. That's traffic that works year round and isn't dependent on a platform or product that can easily be here one day and gone the next.
-- Get Video Speed Controller"
This one tool right here has saved me hundreds of hours in time that I didn't have to spend watching a video. Don't get me wrong, I love videos and know they can be essential to our way of life these days. However, if I can watch an hour long video in half the time and still understand everything then that's an extra 30 min in my day I can spend doing something else you know what mean?! So when you get "Video Speed Controller" using Chrome you can speed through just about any video with easy to use buttons that overlay it.

To download these plug N' play funnels you'll need Thrive Themes Membership and Active Campaign.

The Pokémon TCG has outdone itself with its latest release, Sword & Shield – Fusion Strike. Fusion Strike, which was released in November 2021, is the largest expansion that the Pokémon TCG has ever released with a whopping 264 cards before Secret Rares. The set is partly based on the Japanese expansion Fusion Arts but also adapts several key Japanese promo cards as well as cards from sets like Eevee Heroes that were left out of that set’s English equivalent, Sword & Shield – Evolving Skies. Sword & Shield – Fusion Strike is notable for its focus on the Mythical Pokémon Mew and Gengar VMAX, as well as its introduction of a new Battle Style to the competitive TCG with Fusion Pokémon now joining Rapid Strike and Single Strike. Now, let’s take a journey through the best cards in this staggeringly large set of Pokémon cards.
Ah, man! I love when the Pokémon TCG does this. When I did my first Sword & Shield – Fusion Strike opening, it was the day before the setlist was posted online. The Pokémon Company sent me a booster box and Elite Trainer Box to open right here on Bleeding Cool. I always go for the booster box first because it’s a thrilling, marathon of an opening. Also, the Elite Trainer Boxes come with a guide that has the complete set list… and isn’t it more fun to just dive in somewhat blind? I remember going through the set and realizing halfway through that I was pulling two entirely different versions of Vulpix. It made me begin to search to see if we were getting two Ninetails, too, and lo and behold! The artwork here is beautiful, with both Ninetails, in particular, standing out as incredible illustrations of this Pokémon. Ninetails has been a staple of the TCG since Base Set, and I’d clock these two pieces as some of the best artwork we’ve seen for this iconic Pokémon.
Next time, the spotlight on Pokémon TCG: Sword & Shield – Fusion Strike continues with more cards from the set. You can follow this spotlight series by clicking our Fusion Strike tag.Empire State building goes dark in memory of Orlando victims
In the wake of the attack by a heavily armed assailant, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that all flags would be flown at half-staff
New York’s Empire State Building went dark while the spire of One World Trade Center lit up in the colours of the gay pride flag in memory of the victims of the Orlando massacre.
The symbolic move yesterday came as the United States mourned the 50 victims of the worst mass shooting in modern US history, gunned down at a gay club in the Florida city.
In the wake of the attack by a heavily armed assailant, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that all flags would be flown at half-staff in the largest US city and that security measures have been strengthened, in particular around places associated with the LGBT community.
De Blasio told reporters that the shooting that also left dozens injured was “against our values.”
He said there were no credible threats directed at New York City.
But “you’ll see a lot of additional police presence on the streets of the city,” he added, stressing: “No city in the world is better prepared to stop terror, to stop hate.”
Hundreds of people gathered yesterday evening in Greenwich Village to reflect on the violence and leave flowers, candles and letters beside a sign reading “Stop Hate.”
The Tony Awards, which honour the best of Broadway, opened in New York dedicated to victims of the shooting, the deadliest terror attack in America since September 11, 2001.And The Remedy flips the same old gameplay on its head.

- Bitcoin is facing resistance near the $62,500 and $63,000 levels.
- The price is now trading above $62,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.
- There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $62,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).
- The pair could start a fresh rally if there is a clear break above $62,500.
Bitcoin Price Faces Resistance
Bitcoin price started a downside correction below the $62,500 and $62,250 levels. BTC declined below $62,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.
It tested the $60,600 zone. A low is formed near $60,644 and the price is now correcting higher. There was a break above the $61,500 resistance zone. Bitcoin surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $64,325 swing high to $60,644 low.
It is now trading above $62,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $62,250 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $62,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.
The first major resistance is near the $62,500 level. It is near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $64,325 swing high to $60,644 low.
Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com
A clear break above $62,500 resistance may possibly call open the doors for a fresh rally. The next major resistance sits near the $63,500 level. Any more gains might lead the price towards the $64,000 level.
Fresh Dip In BTC?
If bitcoin fails to clear the $62,500 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. An immediate support on the downside is near the $62,000 level.
The first major support is now forming near the $61,500 level. A clear close below the $61,500 support could open the doors for a move towards the $60,500 level. The main breakdown support is near $60,000, below which the price could accelerate losses.
Technical indicators:
Hourly MACD – The MACD is slowly gaining pace in the bullish zone.
Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level.
Major Support Levels – $61,500, followed by $60,500.
Major Resistance Levels – $62,250, $62,500 and $63,500.So the discussion setting in WordPress can seem overwhelming. But there really is not a whole lot to worry about on it. These are the settings:
- Default Article Settings
- Other Comment Settings
- Before a Comment Appears
- Comment Moderation
- Comment Blacklist
- Avatars
This is how I have my site set up. And this is how I actually recommend setting up the your back-end. Now, the one that is really a judgment call is the “Before a Comment Appears” one. I let people comment and I don’t have to approve the comments. That will stay that way until such time that people spam my comments or leave rude and disrespectful comments. The rest of them are pretty self explanatory.
Default Article Settings
Attempt to notify any blogs linked to from the article. – This is when you put links in from other blogs and website. This setting allows them to know that you back-linked to their article. And shows that you have shared their information. That is a good way to show other blogs that you are supporting them.
A great way to follow up with that is to personally email them and let them know that you have linked to a specific blog post of theirs. Other bloggers appreciated that.
And when you email them you can include the link to their blog and sometimes they will actually share it on their social media posts and maybe even in their newsletter which will get you more views.
This is a great article that talks about pingbacks or trackbacks. It is an article from WordPress.org and goes into detail about them. Much better than I ever could. And I find it great to know which blogs are sharing my information.
The last one in that section is allowing comments on articles. I keep that clicked for the reason I want people to comment on my posts. They can ask questions and also leave their opinions or any helpful tips they have found that work for them. I think that keeps it fresh and also even the season pro doesn’t know everything.
Other Comment Settings in the Discussion Settings
It is a good idea to have the author of a comment put in email and name when submitting a comment. It cuts down on spam comments and also you can go and reply on their blog if they have one. You can also follow up on comments on your blog privately. I found this is a good way to get people to know that you truly do care about them that you take the time to respond to their questions and comments. I have even gotten customers from doing this. Because of the help I’ve given them privately. Always post in the comments under questions that you have followed up to their questions via email so that it shows that you do respond.
I don’t ever require that people be registered to my site to add a comment. I wouldn’t get the comments I do on my various other sites if I did this. People like sharing their experiences. But don’t want to fill out a form just to comment.
Now, the next option to close comments on articles older than is totally up to you. And after showing the clip of the Discussion Settings I am unclicking that for this site because this is not time sensitive so there is no reason to close comments on these articles.
And now onto cookie checkbox. There is no need to use this one. From the last time I checked it doesn’t work the way it is suppose to — what I mean by that it doesn’t save the users information for the next time they comment so they just have to keep entering it anyways. And you don’t need another pop up or check box on your site that does nothing productive or your site.

Mountain Dew is a popular citrus tasting soda pop that is produced by PepsiCo. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world. In fact, it IS the fourth most popular soft drink in America.
The inventors originally made this citrus soft drink to be mixed with whiskey. That’s why they named it “Mountain Dew.” In 1964, Pepsi bought the formula. Pepsi would then make the drink into a worldwide success. The Pepsi Company would also have fun creating new flavors of Mountain Dew, including Code Red and Pitch Black. Pitch Black was released during the Halloween of 2004.
One of the flavors in Mountain Dew is orange juice.
This gives the soft drink a tangy, yet smooth flavor. In Japan, the drink has tangerine juice rather than orange juice.
In Canada, it was not caffeinated until March of 2010 — before that, there was law that disallowed adding caffeine to non-colas. In 2010, non-cola beverage makers were allowed to add caffeine to their products. Health Canada spokesman Stephane Shank said that while they’re not making it mandatory, the feds are urging pop makers to put the amount of caffeine in their products on the label.
Unlike so many other carbonated beverages, “The Dew” is considered a soft drink with some nutritional value. A soft drink (also called pop, soda, coke, soda pop, fizzy drink, or carbonated beverage) is a non-alcoholic beverage that typically contains carbonated water, sugar and flavoring.
There has not been a major new Pepsi product for over ten years. The natural Pepsi Raw soda drink is a new direction for the Pepsi Company. This new carbonated soft drink that does not have artificial ingredients is being introduced by Pepsi Cola.
It has such natural ingredients as cane sugar, coffee leaf, natural caramel coloring, apple extract, grape tantric acid, natural gum Arabic and sparkling water. In comparison, the ingredients of regular pop include high fructose corn syrup, sugar, artificial colorings, phosphoric acid, caffeine, citric acid and natural flavors.
Today, Pepsi’s giving away millions of dollars to fund ideas that will refresh the world!

The first slogan for this highly caffeinated beverage was “Ya-Hoo Mountain Dew. It’ll tickle your inards”. The Mountain Dew commercials even featured a cartoon hillbilly. The original Mountain Dew song is of Irish origin…
At the foot of the hill there’s a neat little still,
Where the smoke curls up to the sky,
By the smoke and the smell you can plainly tell
That there’s poitin brewin’ nearby.
For it fills the air with a perfume rare,
And betwixt both me and you,
As home we troll, we can take a bowl,
Or a bucket of the Mountain Dew
Now learned men who use the pen,
Have sung the praises high
Of the rare poitin from Ireland green,
Distilled from wheat and rye.
Put away with your pills, it’ll cure all ills,
Be ye Pagan, Christian or Jew,
So take off your coat and grease your throat
With a bucket of the Mountain Dew.
They call it that good old Mountan Dew,
And them that refuse it are few.
I’ll hush up my mug if you’ll fill up my jug.
With that good old Mountain Dew.

Write your own reviewanalysis The eyes of many of the world’s early technology adopters have been glued to their screens for the past week as almost every consumer technology vendor of size (Apple being a notable exception) has announced ground-breaking new products at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.
This year, companies at the event have focused heavily on two categories of products; next-generation smartphones and tablet devices designed to mimic the success of Apple’s iPad, with both new types of handheld devices being predominantly based on Google’s Android mobile platform.
The only problem for Australian consumers is knowing which ones will actually come down under — and which will remain just a twinkle in a US or Asian executive’s eye.
Companies like HTC, Samsung, LG, ASUS, Acer, Sony Ericsson, Lenovo and Dell have all announced new products at CES; but so far none of the companies have confirmed plans to launch their new products in Australia. When Delimiter contacted the local representatives of the multinational technology giants this week asking for any local pricing or launch details, the almost universal response was: “It’s too early to know”, with local plans not yet having been finalised.
However, based on the specifications of the products concerned, and the current composition of the Australian market, it’s possible to make a few guesses. Take this article as it is intended; not as gospel, but as informed speculation about what Android-based mobile phones and tablets will hit Australia in 2011 that were displayed at CES.
US networks
The first thing that an informed observer needs to understand about this week’s wave of Android announcements coming out of CES is the constitution of the various mobile phone networks in the US. The reason for this is that — unlike the Australian mobile market — US telephone networks differ radically in the technologies that they use to deliver wireless services. If you buy a device suited for Sprint, for example, there is absolutely no guarantee that it will work on AT&T’s network — and a high likelihood that it won’t. broadly not used in Australia), as well as the EV-DO/CDMA standard which Telstra has canned. Likewise, Verizon also uses CDMA, although, like all of Australia’s mobile networks, it is gradually moving to the Long-Term Evolution Standard.
AT&T’s network is closest to Telstra’s Next G network, using the 850Mhz spectrum and the HSPA line of technologies, although it also uses the 1900Mhz spectrum. T-Mobile also uses the 1900 and 1700Mhz spectrum bands ‘4G’ for fourth generation — although in many cases Australia’s ‘3G’ networks are not far behind them, or in some cases (hello, Telstra) are in front with our ‘3. Of course, there are very sparse technical details currently available about which types of networks the devices we’ll detail below do support. As we warned above, this article constitutes speculation.
Tablets
Perhaps the highest-profile tablets launch in the burgeoning tablet category at CES was Motorola’s Xoom tablet (pictured, above), as it is the first known device to use version 3.0 of Google’s Android platform — also known as ‘Honey×800 resolution screen and 802.11n capability. The bad news, however, is that the tablet is headed to Verizon’s CDMA/LTE network early this year, with ‘4G’ connectivity coming in the second quarter, meaning its network support in Australia on current specifications may be difficult to predict. appears likely that there will be a number of high-profile Android tablets launch in the Australian market before the BlackBerry maker can get its product into local hands.
With this bad news out of the way, however, there is a lot for Australians to be optimistic about with the wider range of Android-based tablets on show at CES this year.
Dell launched a 7″ version of its Streak tablet at the show, a device which the company has already confirmed will be on sale “globally” and will be upgradable to Honeycomb. With Optus selling the initial 5″ Streak in Australia, there is a likelihood the tablet will hit local shores sooner rather than later. And a 10″ model is also on the way. The Dell Streak 7 will launch on T-Mobile in the US.
Samsung’s 3G-enabled Galaxy Tab was criticised for its $1,000 price tag when it launched in Australia late last year, despite the device being a worthy competitor to the Apple iPad, but we can’t see any reason why the company won’t discount its new Wi-Fi-only Galaxy Tab if and when it hits local shores eventually.
The above products are probably best described as the ‘hero’ products in the tablet category, which are very hotly anticipated. However, a range of other manufacturers — Lenovo, ASUS, LG, Acer, Sharp, Fujitsu and Panasonic all demonstrated tablets at CES. Odds are that at least a couple of these companies will launch tablets in Australia in the next year.
In addition, we wouldn’t be surprised to see both — whose network is not dissimilar from that of Telstra, is planning to launch a stack of new high-end Android phones over the next year — including models from manufacturers like HTC, Samsung and Motorola.
The newest high-end Android phone in Australia is HTC’s Desire HD, an update to its popular Desire model which launched late last year on VHA. However, Samsung now looks to have a strong competitor to the Desire HD with its Infuse 4G (pictured, right), which features a 4.5″ launched CPI, 1GB of RAM, a 960× — while it was received positively in Australia — is due for an update, and the Xperia Arc announced at CES would fit that bill perfectly. With a striking concave form factor, a 1GHz CPU and a screen size of about 4.2″, the device will be available “globally in selected markets” — and, we’re betting Australia will eventually be on that list.
Like Motorola, LG has lacked a really high-end Android phone in Australia. This gap could be filled by the Optimus Black — a phone with an innovative new type of ‘NOVA’, and Verizon also picked up the HTC Thunderbolt and the LG Revolution. But the phones above are the ones we’re most interested in, and at the moment, the most likely to come to the Australian market, in our book.
It’s not likely that Australians will get a really good peek at our smartphone and tablet line-up in-country.
What tablet or smartphone devices launched at CES are you looking forward to seeing in Australia?

T-Mobile’s 3G network is not compatible with anyone else, the downlink is 2100MHz like the rest of the world but the uplink sits in 1700MHz (as opposed to 1900). Most of their phones support the normal 2100 as well as Europe/Optus 900 though.
I’ve been using the AT&T Captivate (their Galaxy S version) on Telstra quite successfully, I imagine the Infuse 4G would be the same. 4.5″ is big I think :p
Ah, good detail Matt, thanks for adding this. I had tried to find out how precisely it worked, but the documentation online is obviously not perfect.
Excellent summary and speculation Renai. I’ve been trying to keep up with the mountain of product announcements and coverage coming out of CES, but it’s a full-time job just reading and watching it all from Google Reader, let alone taking all that information and trying to predict what might hit Australian shores. Have you slept this week? ;)
I think like most people I’m excited by the Atrix 4G. Sure everyone’s doing Tegra 2 these days, but 1GB of ram!!, a tightly packed 960×540 QHD screen (perfect for even down-scaling of 1080p video content for geeky home theatre nuts that care about such things) and of course it’s stand out feature; the ability to dock with and power a full netbook style system! (amongst a variety of other planned docks).
More than the phone itself, I’m just excited about what this technology represents. In the not too distant future I don’t think it’s unreasonable to envision a world where mobile chips are powerful enough, and solid stage storage is cheap enough, to have a mobile phone power be your primary computing device. Yes it sounds a little insane, but just look at how fast things are moving. The device that you then carry with you everywhere simply docks with any purpose built dock, HD screen or peripheral you are closest to at the time. Different GUIs (or even entirely different OS’s) could be made to switch on instantly depending on what particular dock your mobile computing device is plugged into (desktop style UI at the office, home theatre interface in the loungeroom, stereo/GPS UI in the car etc).
This is where I see companies likes Microsoft failing hard. While Apple is kicking arse with the iPad and other companies are busy building great portable products around Android, Microsoft are still trying to tell us that cramming their desktop Windows 7 OS onto a slate (that needs a battery the size of a small car attached just to run it) is the best way to make tablets. They then simply put some shallow skin over the top of a power hungry non-finger-optimised system.. Sounds just like what they tried to do with Windows Mobile 6 and look where that got them..It took an entire re-imagining of their mobile OS (admittedly a good re-imagining!) and now they are an an entire generation behind.
Anyway, I’m rambling, but the point is, I’m way more excited about the future of mobile computing than I am with anything happening on the desktop. The innovation and the rate of change we’re seeing in the mobile arena is astounding.
I am hoping that our mobile broadband and mobile internet packages will be able to keep up with the demand for this devices over the next 18 – 24 months. This is certainly where our Telcos will be making their money.Citing reports of students holding a “Christmas sale” of sensual photos and videos to raise funds for distance learning-related expenses, Senator Win Gatchalian urged the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Cybercrime and the Philippine National Police’s (PNP) Anti-Cybercrime Group to intensify their probe and crackdown on these activities.
According to a news report by The Philippine Online Student Tambayan (POST), a news portal on the student sector, some students use #AlterPH, #AlterPinay, and #AlterPhilippines on Twitter to sell their photos and videos. These students use what they earn to buy gadgets for their siblings and pay for internet bills. A Christmas bundle, which contains an array of photos and videos that sometimes reveal the face of sellers, is sold for as low P150.
Between March 1 to May 24 this year, there were 279,166 cases of online sexual exploitation of children (OSEC) recorded in Metro Manila, a spike of 264 percent from the 76,561 cases recorded from the same period last year.
“Nakakabahalang dahil sa mga suliraning dinudulot ng pandemya, ang ating mga kabataan ay nahaharap sa matinding panganib na maging biktima ng pang-aabuso at karahasan. Pinagsasamantalahan ng mga masasamang-loob ang pangangailangan ng ating mga mag-aaral at dapat itong labanan ng ating pamahalaan,” said the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Basic Education, Arts and Culture.
Gatchalian added that DepEd, on its part, should boost its child protection program, noting that the ‘Child Protection Committees’ (CPC) in schools are mandated to identify learners who may be experiencing abuse and exploitation. CPCs are also expected to report cases to government agencies and non-government organizations.
Gatchalian seeks a stronger government crackdown of trafficking. Senate Bill No.1794, which he filed, proposes that in cases involving child trafficking, regional trial courts can authorize law enforcers to conduct surveillance and record communications and information involving persons charged with or suspected of trafficking. The proposed measure also mandates internet service providers (ISPs) to install available technology, program, or software to block and filter any access to any form of child pornography.
Gatchalian also filed Senate Bill 735 or the Human Trafficking Preventive Education Program Act, which seeks to orient Filipino children and youth about their rights, government protection measures, and the dangers posed by different forms of trafficking.
The senator is eyeing a law that would provide every learner in the country with a laptop and access to the internet. A provision under the bill, which has yet to be filed, will eliminate the need for learners to resort to desperate measures that may meet their current needs and will only cause psychosocial concerns and personal issues in the long run.Hoist The Sails in Brittany!

There is plenty of airports nearby La Trinité-sur-Mer, therefore we will no suggest one arrival method.
Tips for your arrival:
1) The closest train stop is in Auray. The name of the train stop: Gare d’Auray. It is 14km away from La Trinité-sur-Mer and local buses will take you there.
2) The bus stop in La Trinité-sur-Mer is just opposite the marina.
You can use these websites , to find the details about your personal arrival method to the marina.
Note: It even may makes sense to fly to Paris and take the high speed train TGV to Auray and then local bus to La Trinite.

Why am I automatically opted in? If the new ‘feature’ was really awesome you could let me know about it and you know I’d sign up. But Twitter knows that many users will never opt in because it’s another annoying email. They also know that most users will just keep deleting it and not unsubscribe. This means they can show investors that XXXX people want and get our digest email, here are the numbers.
It’s just like showing off your pageviews to advertisers. They look awesome but really don’t mean much to advertisers. If I was an advertiser I’d rather be with a site that had less pageviews but more people clicked through on my ad and started paying me for whatever I do. One day they will wake up to this and pageviews will be seen as a stupid metric.
Investors are rarely going to ask if the email numbers actually mean anything about engagement.

According to scholars, the number 6 represents many things: responsibility, gratitude, honesty, sacrifice, integrity, service to others and … money. The number 7 implies spiritual development, enlightenment, inner wisdom and intuition. Together, this number (67) symbolizes a solid financial position for the future and by virtue of this request, the future of Chester County OIC.
In lieu of our 41st Annual Awards Celebration (cancelled due to COVID) or birthday chachkas (always appreciated but how many chachkas does one need), please join in celebrating this auspicious occasion by extending the favor to CCOIC. Your gift will benefit our students directly. Students like John C:
Before John joined the CCOIC GED program on August 10th he attended a two-year trade school. Upon graduation, he received what he was told was a “high school diploma”. When attempting to apply to college, he discovered that the trade school was not accredited, so his diploma was not accepted. This brought John to CCOIC. He shared his goal of attending Delaware County Community College to get an associate’s degree in the area of machine and tool/die cutting. He’d been working in the machine industry for years and eventually wanted to get a degree in mechanical engineering. When he first started attending classes, he mentioned-hour days he cut his class attendance back to 2 hours per day. This did not deter him from his goal. He earned his GED on October 16th, 2020. John’s placement test for the mechanical engineering program at DCCC was scheduled a week from that day.

#Joyce Chester 67 for Chester County OOn days like today, this quote comes as a timely reminder.
It’s not always easy to treat others as we want to be treated. On the contrary, I think that human nature quite regularly leaves us feeling vengeful and angry. We retaliate against those who have hurt us, continuing a cycle of hurt, with each person feeling like the injured party, and the cycle doesn’t stop until one person has the insight to see what is happening and pull away.
When I was being hurt or mistreated, I used to find myself reacting in one of two ways. I usually either retaliated, and tried to get revenge on the person who hurt me- leaving myself feeling angry and upset, and perhaps liable to do something I’d later regret- or else I’d sit there silently and take it, allowing people to walk all over me, without acknowledging their abuse or asking them to mend my ways.
After I started working on this mitzvah, I found that it was harder than I thought to treat others the way I wanted to be treated. I didn’t want people to allow me to hurt them, and nor did I want to be hurt, but finding a way to react to conflict which didn’t endorse either response was difficult.
Nowadays, when I am hurting, I evaluate my relationship with someone. I ask myself if they are a part of my life; if they make me feel good; if I truly like them; and if they elevate me spiritually. If they do, I try to use dialogue to work through these issues. I explain that I’m hurt, rather than seething silently, and if necessary, I ask for someone else’s advice. If they don’t do any of those things, though, and they simply make me feel nervous or unhappy, I try to disengage.
Pulling away from a negative influence is terribly difficult. They might be a relative, or someone I love despite their bad behaviour; or maybe I’m just used to associating with them. But I try to remember this quote and I know that as long as I let myself be drained and hurt by bad people, I won’t be able to be “good in the eyes of my fellow man”.
The journey to contentment is a long one, and I’m by no means there yet. But whenever I visualise this quote, and act on it, I find myself a step closer to my goal.
5 thoughts on “On Treating Others Kindly”
Treating your fellow the way you, yourself, want to be treated is not a Jewish concept for a simple reason that we are all different, and the way you want to be treated, i.e. what is “pleasing” to you, to quote Pirkei Avos, is not the same that will be “pleasing” to me, or to another person, etc. Pirkei Avos does not implore us to treat, but rather to “love your brother as you love yourself.” Based on that love, one will surely find empathy to treat others the way they desire to be treated. The trick, of course, is to love yourself first, without becoming egocentric. For that purpose, Pikei Avos also directs us to perceive every Jew as a Tzaddik. It certainly doesn’t mean that he is, in fact, a righteous person, but we are commanded to approach him as such, until he does something to disappoint us. If that happens, you are doing an absolutely correct thing by simply pulling away. We still do not have the right to label any Jew as a “bad person,” but we are not obligated to deal with them or even to listen to negativity issued from them.
I am so glad that you guided by Pirkei Avos!

Most certainly! However, If I love chocolate, it doesn’t mean that I have to force-feed it to everyone in sight. What if someone is allergic to it? The Midah of empathy means trying to understand others and subsequently treat them the way THEY want to be treated, without doing to them what’s hateful to you. It’s a fundamental philosophical difference between viewing people as distinct individuals and perceiving them as identical sheep, to paraphrase Bertolt Brecht.

my news feed, and unable to respond. On Thursday, after reading one of the many articles about the Planned Parenthood tapes, I had to tune out Facebook and the news and the chatter for the rest of the week because I was in tears, and I didn’t have time for that. I had to prepare for the fourth night of Bible study, where we teach the cross to children. This is the third year where I have found myself in the exhilerating, and somewhat terrifying, position of preaching the Gospel of God to little people. And it is preaching. There is no exegetical study. There are no little anecdotes. Kids are a strange breed. They don’t need the trappings, and you have to keep it simple. It leaves you with nothing between you and sharing God’s Word in a way that will make it totally real and tangible for kids who are facing the struggle of growing up in a world of plenty, and plentiful depravity.
It requires focus. It requires allowing yourself to see the Scripture with fresh eyes. To suspend your disbelief as you walk through paper rocks, dip your hands in plastic buckets on water colored plastic sheeting, and dip your finger in paint to place a mark on a paper covered cross that usually sits outside in the weather. Kids don’t need all the bells and whistles we seem to require as adults. Instead, they need for you, the person speaking to them, to step into the story of God, and let yourself feel the reality of those things that happened millenia ago in the here and now. Thursday always makes me cry. It’s a hard thing to look in the beautiful faces of these cherubic 5-12 year old kids and tell them they are sinners. That the things they will do in their lives will break God’s heart. I speak to them of being mean to siblings and friends, not listening to their parents, and other sins that children commit, mostly because they don’t yet understand what sin is. And at the same time, I am sure they hear in my voice the ache I have for them knowing that some day those sins won’t be so innocent. One day, they will no longer be cherubic little children, they will be wilfull adults, some of them wandering far from God. They will be lost and alone, their souls torn either by their own sins, or by the growing evil of sin in the world around them.
It may seem a little cruel to preach sin to little kids like that. But, I have found, and apparently so have the writers who create the VBS curriculums that I use as a basic guideline for what I teach, that there is no way to share with children the beauty of the cross without first sharing and helping them to understand the heart break of the need for the cross. This year Friday was even harder, because I made a little girl cry. Friday was the power of God to love us forever, and talk of heaven. But, again, when we speak of that immense and unimaginable glory of living in God’s presence forever, we cannot really share the beauty of it without acknowledging the pain we will face and are facing in the here and now. We live in a world where people die, people starve, friends turn on each other, wars wreak havoc. We live in a world where people calmly sip wine as they discuss dismembering babies before they are born in a way that will let them sell the body parts when they are done. How can we hope to share the hope of victory and glory found in the Gospels and Revelation if we do not acknowledge the fallen state of our current world? How can I look in the face of a child and expect them to take me seriously when I offer them that hope without helping them know that God is with them in their pain, even though the pain is still present?
All these things came back to me today, now rested and recuperated from doing my best to keep my brain silent and let God speak last week, now after having had a day to put my office back in order and start to return to some semblance of order out of the chaos of summer in the church. Another video was released today. I haven’t watched it, or the others. I don’t really have to to know what it shows. But, it reminded me of the heart wrenching tears I had to let flow and then set aside last Thursday afternoon before leaving. It reminded me that God did not say to remain silent that day, He only told me I needed to focus elsewhere for that moment. It reminded me that I had read in that article something that needed to be spoken, more so now after a week of being reminded that our children need us.
There was a man in that article who claimed to be a Christian abortion provider. He made a statement that compared the leader of Planned Parenthood to Christ and the way the crowd turned on Him from Palm Sunday to Good Friday. I cannot speak to the evil in the hearts of men and women who’s only God is self or money or convenience. I cannot speak to the depravity present in those who do not live in the state of grace that convicts us of sin, helps us repent and allows us to walk with God covered by the forgiveness offered in the blood of Christ. They are lost, and my heart breaks for the evil they do in the world, but it also breaks for them because that evil is destroying them as surely as it is destroying others. I will not speak to those who are so given over to evil that they glory in washing in the blood of babies rather than being humbled and washed in the blood of the Lamb. My heart is hard toward them, but they are revealing themselves to the world at an alarming rate, and God will deal with them when the time comes.
I will however speak to this man, and all the other like him, who profess Christ with their lips and betray Him with their hearts and actions. These are the things this Christ you claim had to say about.”
To these people who speak blaspheme as they compare Christ cruicified to unspeakably sinful men and women, I would also add these words of Christ..”
Christ crucified bore the fruit of a resurrected savior and redeemer. The hope and salvation of a world lost in sin. The fruit of Planned Parenthood, and all those who promote baby murder dressed up in pretty language is clear: piles of dismembered little ones, torn to pieces, sold for parts, and whatever is not useful thrown on the trash heap. Examine the fruit and repent, lest you be cut down and thrown into the fire.
Pray always and glorify the Lord.WHICH PART OF THIS ANCIENT PRAYER FROM ST. PATRICK SPEAKS MOST TO YOUR SOUL TODAY?
I rise today
in power’s strength, invoking the Trinity
believing in threeness,
confessing heavens of me,
God’s ear to hear me,
God’s word to speak to me,
God’s hand to protect me,
God’s way before me,
God’s shield to defend me,
God’s host to deliver me:
from snares of devils,
from evil temptations,.
*As quoted in George G Hunter’s The Celtic Way of Evangelism (pp.49-51).
I’m inspired by Patrick’s discovery of God’s power and support in creation… a natural revelation. I love the poetry of “lightning’s quickness” and “rock’s fixity”. But it doesn’t stop there like most New Age nonsense… He fills that discovery with the knowledge of Christ- who is all around him.
Personally I love the part where he starts doing the Christ … me and labels nearly every possible area around inside and near him. I love this best for the sentences where he describes how others talk of him. It is not about him, it is about Christ. However he is not so counter-humble as to say that he is not a part of it. when others talk of me I hope Jesus is on their tongues and in their minds.Production Operator

Abstract
Objective: The aim of the study was to review the role of hormone therapy in menopausal patients with breast cancer and gynecologic malignancies.
Methods: We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) using a combination of keywords and database-specific subject headings for the following concepts: menopause, hormone therapy, and cancer. Editorials, letters, case reports, and comments were excluded, as were non-English articles. Additional references were identified by hand-searching bibliographies of included articles. The searches yielded a total of 1,484 citations. All citations were imported into EndNote X9, where they were screened by the authors.
Results: In breast cancer survivors, systemic hormone therapy is not recommended, whereas local low-dose estrogen therapy may be considered after discussion with the patient's oncologist. Among endometrial cancer survivors, hormone therapy is considered safe in low-risk cancers but should be avoided in high-risk subtypes. For survivors of epithelial ovarian cancer and cervical cancer, hormone therapy can be considered, but should be avoided in women with estrogen-sensitive histologic subtypes.
Conclusions: The risks of hormone therapy should be assessed on an individual basis, with consideration of age, type of hormone therapy, dose, duration of use, regimen, route, and prior exposure. Systemic hormone therapy is not recommended in breast cancer survivors, whereas vaginal low-dose estrogen appears safe. Hormone therapy may be used by endometrial, cervical, and ovarian cancer survivors with low-risk, non-estrogen-receptor–positive subtypes.
Introduction
Patients with breast and gynecologic malignancies who have undergone surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation leading to early menopause may seek hormonal treatment for their vasomotor or genitourinary symptoms, with the added benefits of bone and cardiovascular protection. It is important to understand the effects of hormone therapy on the breast to determine the safety of hormone therapy (HT) in breast cancer survivors, and to understand the safety of HT in patients with endometrial, ovarian, and cervical cancers, all of which could potentially be hormone sensitive. In this review, we will focus on HT in these subgroups of patients to help guide providers to make sound recommendations about the safety and efficacy of HT.

How can you implement Diwali marketing ideas to boost sales during Diwali? Here are some tips and tricks you can prefer:
Diwali Marketing Idea-1: Emphasis on your target consumer
When you are planning your Diwali sales strategy, try to engage customers firmly in mind. Who are the consumers that are truly buying and responding to your offers during Diwali? Fascinatingly, working in contradiction of the general belief, it is only the men who purchase the most in Diwali shopping, based on an investigation by SEMrush; and, it is exposed that above 50% of Diwali buyers are between the age groups of 25 and 34.
It similarly claims that, what consumers invest on during Diwali, an eCommerce pie chart with 22 % people followed by tourism and grocery items up to14%. This data is convenient for selecting which services and products to add to advertisements and social media campaigns.
Diwali Marketing Idea-2: Customized your deals
Email marketing is the prominent holiday marketing network for approx. 60 percent of businesses. Prepare your email list for the festive sales. You can split your buyer list into teams with similar interests and choices. By creating it, you can modify your text for each team. With the help of this technique, you’ll receive so many responses from your potential consumers. Separating them through demographics will provide you with some data about your customers’ age group, and you can wisely manage the deal for each team to improve sales. Viewing the topographical position, you can create special deals customized to particular cities if your marketing influence reaches several places. For, think of, the festival of Diwali differs based on the topographical location.
Diwali Marketing Idea-3: Start using the social media platform
Nothing can take attention like bold, colorful product images, and several social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram are the best platform to display them. If you purchase some gifts products or home decoration items, put some eye-catching photographs on your social media sites related to your products, you can even add an internal link to your webpage. Be sure to publish frequently during the weeks gearing up to this Diwali, providing gift ideas.
Diwali Marketing Idea-4: Add special discounts
Each year, discounts are the focal point of all Diwali promotions. Some popular possibilities to think for your business can be benefited for like, Diwali-special buy one get one offer, discounts for new buyers like, purchase worth amount 1000 then you will get 30 percent discount on your first purchase! This way you can effortlessly vend the products that no one wants to purchase the item by packing them with more noticeable products.
Diwali Marketing Idea-5: Spread your product range all over the world
If you are facing trouble in selling your products then try to add gifting opportunities in your present situation of items. For example, if you vend ornaments, you could organize an event to explain your latest offers on the special occasion of Diwali, and put some discounts on it! The target buyers for such an event would be commercial buyers, and they may purchase in wholesale to offer these to their potential customers. What is significant is that you only need to put some internal links among your products and Diwali gifting idea.
So, spreading your product range all over the world for Diwali won’t be a worthless idea. And, it might even capture the attention of visitors, which can benefit your business!
Diwali Marketing Idea-6: Advertise your products on an e-commerce platform
Advance technology makes our lives much easier than before. Many businessmen prefer to use E-commerce platforms because it is considered a lifesaver for many businesses throughout the whole pandemic, and during the festive season, you can even influence them.
Advertise your items or products on Flipkart, Amazon, or Snapdeal is the best method to boost sales by attracting more buyers and finding insight into your target buyer’s buying tendencies. Preferring the information insight these sites give you, you can regulate what products are getting more attraction when your potential customers prefer to buy. You can even practice these insights to notify your upcoming portfolio and sales ideas.
Diwali Marketing Idea-7: Start using the digital payments method
Giving your buyers several methods of payment choices creates their shopping experience more satisfying and confirms you have a firm torrent of money coming into your business throughout the month.
You don’t need to worry because these outflows automatically move to your bank account and can be followed digitally, creating enough information on your revenue and investments that financiers use to measure your economic stability when you request a business loan.
Create a PayTM Business account, Google pay Business, PhonePe, Amazon Pay, or any other UPI-linked payment application, which is simple, fast, and suitable for buyers.
Diwali Marketing Idea-8: Provide your buyers some specific festive offers
To gain new customers without any efforts, add some significant festive offers on products that will be trending, as Diwali is coming nearer to you. For instance, everyone loves to decorate their homes and businesses with nightlights and diyas on the special occasion of Diwali. So, you need to be sure before vending those products and think of giving special offers to your potential buyers who purchase several cartons of candles a specific discount must be there on those items.

• Entry will open in the next few weeks. You will find the links here but you will be transferred to the club’s website.
• It is intended that this event will be the World Championship. It will not become the Europeans.
• It is intended that the event will go ahead based purely on Italy’s ability to welcome visitors safely and without quarantine on arrival.
• Quarantine for sailors returning home will not be reason to cancel unless this is so widespread as to make the event unviable.
We realise these are hard choices but the decision has been taken that it is perhaps better for the class to continue to hold World Championships whenever, and if at all possible, whether or not some members are restricted from attending.Personally, I hate it when a freelancer or company, especially in the WordPress realm, has no personality or human touch to their website or brand. It feels stiff, corporate and unwelcoming.
Nowadays, more companies are realizing this and it shows me that I’m not the only one who feels this way. The team behind Gravity Forms (the WordPress form builder I’ve used since 2013) has realized this and recently made a big push to “humanize their brand.”
I’m super excited to bring on James Giroux, their community experience manager, who shares their content marketing plan and recent endeavor to put a more human and personal touch on their brand.
While Gravity Forms is a leader in the WordPress community and a legit company, the lessons James shares and what they’ve learned applies to us as web design freelancers and small agency owners as well.
I hope this conversation gives you the motivation, encouragement and proven tactics to personalize your own brand and website!
P.S. It’s one of the quickest ways to differentiate yourself from your competition 🙂

Episode #148 Full Transcription
Josh 0:14
Hey, friends, welcome into the podcast. This is episode 148. And I’ve got a fun and special episode coming up for you here because in this one I had the opportunity to interview James Drew who is the community experience manager with Gravity Forms, Gravity Forms, if you’re new to WordPress, or the web design game is an incredible Form Builder. It is the form builder that I have used since I think 2013. I’ve been using it for a very long time. I love Gravity Forms, I still use them and what’s really cool.
Josh 0:47
Recently, Gravity Forms decided to quote and you’ll hear about this with James here, humanize their brand. And this is really, really important. I’m actually going to be talking about this more coming up the importance of humanizing your brand and putting a face to your business. So it doesn’t look like well, something that’s a robot or something that’s to corporate II, there’s so much power in this now it’s a lot different. When you’re a freelancer, and you have your image on your website, then a company like Gravity Forms who has a team of remote workers all over the world.
Josh 1:17
So the cool thing about this is that Gravity Forms hired James to come in and start a podcast and video show called Input. And I was actually privileged to recently be on input on episode five. So after that call, I had such a great time talking with James, I said, Hey, man, would you like to come on my show. And I’m personally really curious and interested in Gravity Forms and their approach about this idea of humanizing their brand and adding some personality to it.
Josh 1:45
So what we do in this episode is essentially talk about the content strategy that gravity had forms with creating this new show for their brand and what they’re doing with Gravity Forms to separate themselves from their competition. I found this chat to be completely and utterly fascinating. I love hearing about strategies like this for particularly bigger companies. Elegant Themes, because I’m a user of Divi. I’ve always been fascinated with how they’ve kind of added human like a human touch to their brand. And it’s one reason I’ve stuck with Divi and remained with elegant themes as my primary theme, and, or Divi as my theme. And Gravity Forms is up to the same thing.
Josh 2:22
So it was really cool hearing from James on what their strategy is, and how they’re going about interviews and community and engagement and doing this podcast to increase awareness about their brand, but also to learn and to really make some really good connections. So I think you’re going to find this fascinating as well should go without saying that if you are interested in doing some sort of interview series or podcasts for your company, your business, I highly recommend it, it really is such an amazing opportunity. And this episode will give you a lot of confidence and help you empower to do that if you’re interested.
Josh 2:56
Now, one thing that is really going to help your business completely unrelated to doing an interview series is building recurring income. And if you didn’t know, but I have a website maintenance plan course. And the new version of this course version 2.0 is out. Now I’m so excited about the new version of this course, I think it’s the best work I’ve ever done quite personally for a course.

If you have not yet signed up for the course and you are ready, and you are like okay, I’ve got to get some stable income coming in. Join my website maintenance plan course today.

Josh 4:07
James, welcome onto the podcast, man. So great to have you on.
James 4:12
Good. So glad to be here. This is awesome. Thank you for having me.
Josh 4:15
We were just talking about before we went live here, you’ve been up we’re recording at 2:30pm Eastern, but you’ve been up since 5am. You’ve had a long day because it’s actually the the kickoff of Gravity Forms, kind of new initiative to engage their audience and it’s called input. And I’m really excited to have you on because you’re the host of this show called input which is a video and podcast audio show. By the time this episode comes out, I will have been on so I was really excited to have you on my show, to kind of talk about this and to talk about this idea of how to create content with whatever that content looks like to help build community and engagement to eventually sell a product or Service cuz I know I have a lot of students that are interested in this. And we’re all not Gravity Forms like a huge plug in in the market. But no matter what it is, I’m sure the same principles apply. So all that to say super excited to have you on James, do you want to start off with just letting everybody know first where you’re based out of? And what do you do as the host of Input?
James 5:18
Sure, yeah. So I am based out of Kingston, Ontario, Canada. So that’s sort of the halfway point between the capital of Canada, which is Ottawa and the capital of Ontario, which is Toronto, the largest city in Canada. So about halfway between each and that’s on the eastern side.
Josh 5:39
Yeah, I was wondering your Eastern New York time, or if you’re a central, which would be like,
James 5:43
New York time for sure. Okay. Yeah.
Josh 5:46
Gotcha, gotcha. And when, when somebody you know, they hear about your role with input, what do you what do you tell them? Do you? I know, you are what, I guess your official title was community experience manager, right? That’s right. Yeah. What do you say you do, though?
James 6:02
Well, when people ask me, it’s a great question. And I think it’s one of the things that most excited me about one. Well, it was the thing that most excited me when I got offered the job here was they said, We want you to come in and humanize the brand. So we want you to come in and help us, you know, put some faces to who we are and what we do here at Gravity Forms. Because for many, many years, we’ve been an iconic product and iconic plug in, or many WordPress professionals, but nobody’s really known who we are as a team where our culture, our values, and what it means for us. So that was a big part of what drew me to Gravity Forms. And what drew me to this role was this opportunity to sort of like imagine for a company that’s as iconic as Gravity Forms to think well, how do you humanize a brand like that? How do you? How do you rebuild or establish that connection between product and community? So that’s a big part of what I do. And then the other side of my role is on the marketing side is coordinating and connecting with our community of third party add on developers as well.
Josh 7:16
Okay. Fascinating, man. Well, again, I love it. We talked when you interviewed me for the input show, I told you that I’ve been a Gravity Forms user since I think 2013 is when I started using it. So I’ve been I was, I guess I’m an early adopter, but I definitely used it, more of it in its infancy. And I’ve seen it, you know, go through all sorts of innovations and versions. And I still use it today. It’s my main contact form. It’s the main contact form that my agency uses. So to hear that they want to humanize the brand and add more personality and community to it. Of course, that fires me up because that’s what I’m 100% about. I didn’t know who was behind Gravity Forms, until you released the first episode with the founders, which Funny enough, we’re recording this on the the day of the launch, which is why you’re so tight.
Josh 8:06
So I did get to most of the episode, and man, it’s just so cool. It’s it’s just so freakin cool to hear from the people who are behind it. Because when you think of Gravity Forms, I don’t know what everyone who is listening is thinking. But if you’re a user, you might wonder, is this like one developer in a basement? Or is this like an agency of 75 people that is in San Francisco? Or are they scattered abroad? Who knows? So I think it’s so valuable to do that to add that personality. So really, really excited to see what this you know, ends up becoming. I’m actually curious, before we dive into, you know, the reason they wanted to do this and the strategy behind it, what is your background? And how did they end up getting in touch with you? How did this opportunity come about for you, James?
James 8:53
Oh, well, I have been in the WordPress ecosystem for about 10 years and started out running my own agency doing websites and things I actually was a brand designer or a logo designer that was sort of my first kick at things I was like, you know, I want to get out there and you know, do logos for people, but I launched my freelance business right around the time 99 designs kicked off. So instead of sort of getting those rich, you know, brand contracts that I was hoping for all of a sudden I was competing against these, these marketplaces that were doing really well and so became almost a bit of necessity to get into WordPress, right and to get into website design. And I’ve been doing it for a few years before that in some of the the jobs that I did, but in 2012 I went full time and really sort of decided to go for it and do the agency thing and the freelance thing.
James 9:55
From there after a couple of years of doing that and working with a couple different communities in the theme space. I went to press Dominic’s, which is an event in the WordPress ecosystem many people may know and met some people from Envato there and ended up, you know, just through seeing tweets going back and forth from some people hearing about a job to become the WordPress evangelist at Envato. So that was really when I went from a bit of an unknown or anonymous WordPress user, to somebody with a bit more profile and got to travel around the world. Going to conferences for WordPress, we created a number of our own conferences internally, really working with independent business owners, independent creators across a wide variety of industries, you know, video, audio, photography, all those different kind of creative industries. And just yeah, really hearing their stories, celebrating their successes, navigating being a you know, the representative of Envato, marketplace environment to a bunch of independent creators, is kind of another way to look at that is very similar to how app developers view the App Store. So you can imagine it I remember, just a little
Josh 11:15
Yeah, a little tricky to navigate my gosh, yeah. I mean, I remember being a user of it, you know, for the marketplace. Yeah.
James 11:22
Yeah. So So you know, from there after, you know, working with Envato for a number of years. Funnily enough, the same person that actually was in the Twitter conversation about the job at Envato sent me a link to the job posting for Gravity Forms, they’re looking for somebody to kind of come in and they were looking for a video first person, somebody to come in and do video, okay, because they had decided from a content point of view that that’s that was the direction they wanted to go. And my background was in interactive multimedia and graphic design. So I’ve done some video work in the past. And when I came in, and sort of at first it was, I wasn’t sure if this was the right role for me, I was like, All things sorted. Really 100% Sure. Until, until you, you meet people, but I went into my first interview, I can remember walking out of that interview, and just being like, Oh, my goodness, this is like, it was like love at first sight kind of thing, or like me and the hiring manager at the time Mark, like he and I would just hit it off, right? And it was just like it was meant to be what was was always
Josh 12:35
Just gonna say, what was the love at first sight? Was it the role was it the feeling of the people, the company at what What gave you that feeling like this is a good fit?
James 12:44
It was, you know, like, I was working at Envato. And Envato is a great company. But there are a lot of competing priorities when you’re working in a company that big. And one of the things that really intrigued me about Gravity Forms was that they had a similar community feel, and that they had a group of independent add on creators who were out there doing the same kind of thing. So that was familiar territory for me. But again, it was this whole idea of like, taking, taking these bits that I was doing, and I felt I was getting good at, you know, like, you sort of start to feel like you’re becoming not just not just, it’s not just guesswork anymore, trying to figure out what to do. But like you come into a situation go, actually, I know how to solve that problem. I’ve done that before. So there’s a bit of confidence there in that. But then it was balanced on this other side with this challenge to humanize the brand to do video to, to think about what we could do in that space to to bring the culture and the values of Gravity Forms and rocket genius into the world of WordPress, and what would that look like? And what could we do? Also, after one interview, I was like, I remember saying to my wife, I was like, This is it. I gotta take I can’t not go here. So yeah. Then a couple weeks, you know, the deal was done. And yeah.
Josh 14:12
Very cool, man. And I’m kidding. Maybe this would be a better question for them. But I’m curious if you know, was there something that happened that made them realize this is a priority? Or is this something they wanted to pursue as far as humanizing the brand?
I think Gravity Forms has been quite lucky. They’ve always been kind of like low and slow, like, good barbecue. – James
James 14:26
Yeah. So interestingly enough, I think Gravity Forms has been it’s it’s been quite lucky, in that its growth has matched WordPress growth so organically, it’s been able to just grow at the same pace. And by delivering a great product and a great user experience and a solid foundation for professionals to be able to build on. They’ve just been able to grow by being good, good citizens in the community and good citizens in the wider ecosystem. But I think they hit a point In 2019, where they realize that their approach and one of the things you’ll see actually in the first episode, they’ll talk a little bit about this is that they never wanted to be the kind of company that was aggressively growing. And so it was, they didn’t want to, you know, build it up quick and then sell it, sell it off or, or anything like that. They’ve always been kind of like low and slow, like, like good barbecue.
Josh 15:24
I love that I want a great analogy. I want my companies, I want the tools that I use just to be like a nice barbecue, low and slow and take your time. Yeah,
James 15:34
That’s it. And, and so they got to this point, I think, where they realized that, that approach or or this, the slow nature of what they were doing was actually getting the way of them being able to deliver on some of the promises and some of some of the things they wanted to do. And so they began to reach out and look for people to come in and do different things. And actually, they had had another person doing some community work and development work. And he actually decided he’s an add on developer, so he went off to go and do that. And so they had these two kind of things that they were hoping to find, filled in two different people, a video person and a community person. And because of my background, and my experience, I was able to come in and fill both of those shots. Yeah. And, and bring that experience alongside all of that. So I think that’s sort of what sealed the deal for them. Yeah.
Josh 16:31
Oh, yeah, that’s really cool. And it is funny. And the reason I’m really excited to see, you know, this show come to life and to expand not only the Gravity Forms, and the people behind it, but the users like myself and the community. But it’s interesting, because you really get a sense of who the company is like the actual people. Because, again, going back to what I said earlier, I don’t know what you think about Gravity Forms, whoever’s listening to this or watching this, but you might think it’s like, you know, some super jacked up entrepreneur who’s, you know, all gung ho and is really high stress and high strung, but they’re all like, the coolest down to earth dudes, that first interview that you posted, I’ll make sure we link that in the show notes. They’re just normal guys. Like, I would probably see them at a barbecue joint. And, you know, if I found that they were Gravity Forms, I’d sure we’d have a beer and hang out and talk for a little bit like, it really is cool to find out who is behind some of these bigger brands.
Josh 17:28
So I’m really excited to see that come to life. But here’s the kicker. Here’s the question for you to kind of kick off that content strategy. How what were the initial discussions about like what to actually do? Because you want to humanize the brand, want to add video, but then it’s like, okay, I’m sure you guys went through this, which is, alright, what avenue? Do I want to go down? Like, do we want to do blogging? Do we want to do pure, like video type series? Do we want to make a podcast? Should it be audio and video? Should it be like, a monthly video? You know, like, should it be tutorials? How I guess, what were the initial talks of what the content strategy should be? And how did you guys settle on and input?
James 18:09
That’s a great question. And I think from from my perspective, I have my own view. And happy to share a little bit of that and strategy here. So if you think about Gravity Forms, and the the ecosystem that we have, we have a core product, right, Gravity Forms itself. And we have an incredible user base around that and add ons and you know, just a whole network have of tooling there. But it’s still something that can be intimidating for new users, because of how much extensibility there is, and how much power there is even just in a core product.
James 18:51
So when you look at that, and when you look at at some, you know, growth strategies and things like that, we know that one of the most important things we have to do as a product company is continue to acquire new users, we have to figure out how to keep that, you know, network effect, or that brand value continuing to expand and grow into audiences for a number of reasons. But the way that I look at it is, you know, you want when you’re a professional, and let’s say, you know, like you’re running an agency like I do, and in my agency, I used Gravity Forms as well. You’re always thinking, what tooling am I going to install that’s going to stick with a user from the start through their growth? Yeah, right, and expand with them so that I’m not constantly going back and having to rethink tooling and rebuild things and do all that kind of stuff, right?
James 19:50
Like if I can, if I can give them one tool, it’s actually going to deliver for them over and over and over again and grow with them. That I’m actually doing them a favor as as well as myself a favor because I’m not having to go in and constantly build things. Great point. So that’s the approach that exists with Gravity Forms. But in order for that to work well, and for the company to continue to grow, it needs to be able to add new users to that and do that.
James 20:17
So the content strategy for Gravity Forms calm is very much about new users and bringing them in, once they’re in, then it becomes about how do we, how do we help them, figure out what’s available to them, because you don’t know what you don’t know. And so with the size of Gravity Forms, add on ecosystem, we have this opportunity to solve way more problems than most people realize, you can do pretty well, anything with Gravity Forms, if you’re collecting any kind of data. Or if you’re looking to do any kind of automated workflow with your content or with what users are doing when they interact with your website, you can do that with Gravity Forms, or Gravity Forms, and one of the add ons that exists.
James 21:03
So you know, retention became a big part of that. So I’m getting to our strategy for for input. But you have to, you have to understand that’s the foundation, the foundation is helping Gravity Forms. So we will do and we continue to do things through our primary channels like gravity, anything Gravity Forms, branded, will be tutorial driven, and new user driven, and supporting existing users and providing them with roadmaps on how to build things to to get the result that they’re after.
James 21:37
But if you look at what’s going on with WordPress right now, we are seeing a, in my opinion, we’re seeing a generational shift between the pioneers, the founders of WordPress, and those those tinkerers knew how to get stuck into the the PHP and the code and to build it themselves to this next generation of users. And remember, WordPress is what 18, 19 years old now. So people who were born the day WordPress is born are going to college and they’re getting, you know, they’re getting ready to enter into the work world. And, and we’ve seen that shift coming because even even as a, you know, community and an open source Foundation, we’ve we’ve been anticipating this, which is why Gutenberg exists.
James 22:24
And beside editing experience exists, because in order for WordPress to continue to grow, and to continue to democratize the web and make it accessible and open for everyone, we need to make it easier for more and more people to actually use the tooling. And so this generational shift that’s happening is a move beyond the WordPress developer, the WordPress tinkerer, to somebody who really for them, it’s just a platform that they sell their merch on, or they, you know, blog out of, or they create content through, or they leverage to build relationships with their customers. And because of that, they don’t care necessarily about all the other bits, right? They just want tools that work for them. They want them to be easy to use, and they wanted them to be easier to expand and, you know, grow with their business.
They want to hear success stories. They want to know about, you know, what it means to live WordPress as a lifestyle. – James
James 23:18
So that’s really where the strategy for input comes in and why input exists the way it does, it is not necessarily targeting the core WordPress audience that you might think what it’s doing is what strategically and where my head is out with it is that I really believe that this new audience out there that is starting to use WordPress as a tool rather than as you know, that that guy who was always able to open the hood to the car and check the engine and know what’s going on, is that we have this opportunity to really take WordPress mainstream. And and when I say mainstream, what I mean is, we’re a $600 billion a year industry that is mostly engineers and professionals. Imagine what we could do if we could expand to the everyday person to those people that are out there with no desire to learn any of that, but they want to hear success stories they want to know about, you know what it means to live WordPress as a lifestyle.
Josh 24:21
So it’s interesting, really what you’re talking about there, James is target market and you’re looking at your demographics very carefully. I’m sure there was a lot of data result type of research that was you know, conducted there. And I imagine that you guys looked at your customers from when it started, maybe like the few years after which is probably when I came on board with it. Because I was I mean when I use gravity forms it was neck and neck with a few other builders I just happen to really like Gravity Forms and it stuck with me.
Josh 24:56
Same thing like you mentioned earlier, it was just such a reliable product and even though I tried other builders at some point other form builders, I always went back to Gravity Forms because it was always more reliable. It was at the best support the best add ons. And that was huge for me. But now it is interesting because we’re like phase three, it sounds like with customers. And you’re exactly right. And I’m a Divi guy, I use the Divi Theme by Elegant Themes, I think they’re similar. Being that I’ve been with them and really follow them closely. They are definitely looking at both the professionals, the experts, the developers, but also the Diyers. And the people who are fed up with Squarespace fed up with Wix wants something that they control, but is also easy to use. So I imagine that played a part in this, the width. So that’s really interesting. But my next question would be why a name that is not Gravity Forms centric. So why not? The Gravity Forms podcast? What? What’s up with input? And I’m just playing devil’s advocate, as somebody who might say, how is that related to Gravity Forms?
James 26:00
Well, it, it’s a bit of a play on words. Because if you think about what a form is, it’s a collection of input fields. So they didn’t the input was it’s loosely tied that way. But, you know, if you expand it out a little bit, and just think about, you know, input, it’s, it comes down to, I think my personality a little bit, and a lot of and I have to be honest, a lot of this is driven by me and my personality and how I think and process. But, you know, I, I always believed that stories are the most valuable thing we can share. as content creators, that story is evergreen, it’s the kind of content that lasts long beyond your time, in any role, or, or in anything that you do. And when I think about stories, I think about not just not just the surface level, but I’m always curious about what goes into actually making that happen.
James 27:04
So you think about like some of the stories that we’re going to tell on input. You know, we’re, I did a, an interview with a recording artist, right? Like a major label recording artists who’s got millions of records sold and talking to them about you know, like, so tell me how, what’s the process of getting signed? What’s, what’s it like to, to grow a fan base, right? And who does what in in the band? And what’s the band dynamic, like, like, the kinds of questions that are always skipped, when they do a face to face interview, like a TV interview, like you always get the fluff, but you never get the inner workings, right. And I’m, I’ve always been like, you know what, they don’t just go from like, somebody sitting in their garage, making music to all of a sudden, you know, debuting and having their first records on, there’s a lot of hard work that goes into that. And no matter what creative industry you’re in, no matter what industry you’re in, there are steps that we skip over when it comes to how our success or how we got places. And I think, for me, like input is digging into that you’re getting the story.
Josh 28:18
I love that man. It’s so important. And I think that is one of the best ways to humanize both the company itself and the users. And I often when I think about story marketing, and I know story brand is really popular Donald Miller’s book, and I’m a big fan of that framework. I’m a big fan of anything that is going to dive into the why in something. And that really is what story marketing is it addresses the why, instead of just the what. So for Gravity Forms, I’m sure it would be easy to have a marketing page that is like, here’s what Gravity Forms is, and here’s what it does. But what is even more powerful. And whether this is used on the same page, or completely separate is a y type story Case in point, my story.
Josh 29:01
Would it be more intriguing for somebody to see a form builder that, you know, you can see how it sets up and what kind of fields you can add in the add ons. Or if you hear Josh say, I’ve been using Gravity Forms for nine years. And it’s been like the solid rock for my business. And it’s never let me down. Personally, that is going to resonate with me so much more. So I think it’s a great point. I hope that’s just a practical example of how stories can really make marketing just so much more powerful. And I hope everyone realized this too. This applies to any type of service you’re doing, which is why it’s so important to get testimonials and case studies and bring the story out of those results. So I love that is that kind of one of the main underlying things you were focused on was like the results but not in like a data driven type of standpoint. But yeah, that story and that human type of approach when it comes to results?
James 29:56
So it’s an interesting question, and it’s one the team has been challenging me on as well, because I think it’s like, you know, like, that’s the most natural step you could think of right is that you want to have content that’s going to help you convert for your today business where I have been pushing back. And one of the things I think is important for anybody who’s in business to think about is not just your business of today, but your business of tomorrow and your business of the future. And how are you setting yourself up not not to necessarily reach your audience that you’re grabbing right now with your existing marketing? But what is the audience that you see coming up, that you need to be starting now to think about attracting? So you know, full side editing is brand new Gutenberg is still relatively new, there’s enough people out there with the classic editor, for example.
Josh 30:47
And I still love the classic editor more than Gutenberg. Yeah.
James 30:51
So we still have a little bit of time where the way we we’ve continued to do it will be enough. But But for us, I think and my strategy here is to go, what’s the audience that’s coming up? What are they doing? Where where are they at? What’s something that’s going to be attractive to them? And how can I grow an audience there and build trust with them, even if I don’t have a natural connection yet, between the stories or all of that, and, and some kind of conversion to a Gravity Forms user? What’s important is that we’re doing both, right. So as I said, we still have Gravity Forms, branded channels, we have tutorials, and all different kinds of content across our blog, and our YouTube channel and social media. And input, the reason why it’s branded as it is, and the reason why it’s different, is we’re looking at the next audience in the WordPress ecosystem, or the next audience in the web, and saying, How can we be attractive to them? How can we go after them while also still being relevant? And, you know, great consumable content? For those who already love and use Gravity Forms? Yeah.
Josh 32:03
And when it comes to this next audience, the I’m gonna put my kids these days had on it, did you do any, like, actual measure, like data measured research or anything like that? Or was it more of just a common sense approach to content like, kids these days, like stories, and they like the why, and they like somebody that they’re gonna trust? Whether it’s an influencer? Or I mean, I imagine that came into play with wanting to be video and podcast. But yeah, like, how did you? I guess the question is, how did you determine, you know, who that up and coming audience is?
James 32:41
That’s a great question. And I think that data is something anyone can get, it’s not something that is reserved for big business. So no matter what size your your businesses, or even if you’re just a solo printer, or a freelancer, anything you can do to dig out some data is important. So we did a big customer survey with our existing customers, to get some demographic data to get some user data to find out who our core customer of today was. What we discovered is that a lot of them are in that developer professional space. A lot of them have been using the product for three to five years and five years plus.
Josh 33:24
I think I have this I think I remember getting that now that I just flashed back that I think I remember getting an email and I’m sure I’ve sent in like, Yeah, I’ve been using it for this long, you know?
James 33:33
Yeah. So so we knew who our today audience was very clearly because we could see that. And you’re and some of it, of course, is also gut and looking at trends and what’s going on and saying, you know, like, the way I looked at it, I was coming in and I’d done a little bit of research on my for myself on Instagram and trying to build up my own personal brand on Instagram or whatever. And I can remember looking at the WordPress world and where WordPress happened in terms of social networking, and it’s still on Twitter. Twitter is not where the audience of tomorrow is, right? They are on Instagram, they’re on tick tock. They’re on YouTube, right.
James 34:16
And so you’ve got this video first content approach versus a text, first content approach, which I think is where a lot of things are. Even audio audio only is great. But we’re starting to see this rise in podcasts, especially over the pandemic. It’s been great, I think, for the podcast industry. But we’re also seeing now a lot more podcasts going look, I’m already creating the content, why don’t I just film it, put it on YouTube, repurpose it and repurpose the same content. So and then you look at all of these channels now and everybody’s doing video. So you know, even even though Twitter doesn’t have a ton of video, you can still get video on there. And Instagram is the same with IG TV and you got? Yeah. So So I think it’s going, okay. You know we’ve, from from a data point of view, we know who our existing audiences, we know where they are, and we know how to talk to them. And to create content for them, we’re going to keep doing that to the best of our ability. But for tomorrow, we want to start looking at what can we do in the space to actually be attractive to a new audience?
Josh 35:22
Gotcha. And, of course, I’m a huge fan of the long form interviews. And I think our talk was well longer than probably what most of your episodes will be that that’s not a shocker though, for anyone who’s been listening to this podcast for a while, because I like I like to go deep. And I, I, I hate surfacey quick, mainstream media type conversations. I don’t want a five minute clip that was scripted, and outline, I want just real talk. And I think a lot of people are like me, and I’m totally finding that with this podcast. The cool thing is, when it comes to repurposing content, if you do a long form interview, you can always cut it down and repurpose it in different ways. Is that kind of what your idea is with starting with, you know, a half an hour 45 minute, whatever talk that’s both video and audio? Is your idea, James to then you know, me, I don’t know, if you have it all planned out now. Or if you’re just gonna see how it evolves, and then maybe, you know, sprinkle in a two minute video for IG TV or a video for Facebook or a video for a tick. I don’t even know I don’t use TikTok. I don’t know how that works. But it is that kind of the the idea, the approach that you have?
James 36:29
Absolutely, it’s, you know, like you said, if, if you’re if you’re making something, if you’re creating something, you’ve already done the hard work of coming up with the idea. You’ve done all the the the work of of actually recording it, and you want to give yourself as many options as possible. So you know, and it’s, it’s an opportunity, not just for the moment, right, like you think about, we’ve just launched this episode with the founders of Gravity Forms, got a 40 minute episode. And in there are a bunch of great nuggets that we can repurpose, and reuse so that that content lives on long beyond the, you know, the bump of the initial premiere of the episode. And I think that’s the value of it as well. It’s really actually being smart about how you are building content, and your content strategy as well. And thinking, not just for today, but like I plan to use this content for months and months and just pull it out when I’m going I don’t have a post today for Instagram. And let’s put that up, right. Yeah, you know, do that kind of thing.
Josh 37:32
That’s kind of one thing I’m working on with this show. Because I think your episode, let’s see, let me look at this sheet here. It’s probably good. It’ll be in the 140s. Oh, a lot of episodes to pull from now, they’re not all interviews, a lot of those are solo episodes. But I’m still able now to like I referenced them all the time. And they’ve been great legions for my courses and a lot of cases because I’m like, I am doing free master classes and trainings and more intentional funnels to courses in higher ticket items, but podcast that dives into, you know, my web design process, that’s a half an hour, it’s free. That’s a great like, Hey, check this out. This will give you a good idea for this and and what a great Legion that has become for me.
Josh 38:12
So I’m finding and I think you’ll find this too. This is a good principle for everybody. When you take the time to invest in this content, whether it’s an interview, or a solo podcast, or a tutorial on YouTube or whatever, you can absolutely refer back to it months, even years down the road. And then yeah, you can always repurpose it. And I’m actually considering maybe this probably isn’t something I personally have time for. But maybe Nathan, my editor, Nathan, I’m going to talk to you right now. And maybe have him or somebody go through and pull some of the top like like episodes and tips and make a compilation or do some things that can really highlight some of the you know that certain topics that we’ve gone over.
Josh 38:53
So there’s all I mean, look, there’s all sorts of avenues for this, it is slightly overwhelming. I guess one question I have for you, James is how do you avoid the overwhelm of what you can do with content? Because this is this is also something that is very paralyzing for people. They’re like, Okay, I’m going to start, I’m going to do it. And then they’re like, ah, what am I going to do? Like, I don’t know, should I do a YouTube channel? Should I just do social media videos, I just do a podcast, Should I do a written blog? How do you avoid, you know, all these different options? And how do you take it one step at a time when it comes to creating content?
James 39:29
Oh, I’m, I’m fairly structured that way. My wife and I, we often joke because we approach problem solving or creative creativity in the opposite way. I start out with figuring out what my end result is. And then I work back from that. And she just starts with, you know, like something and then figures it out as she goes, we both end up finishing at the same time. But how we got there is very different. I tell that just to say that that’s sort of my approach to it. Thinking through content. And it’s it may work for people who are who think like me, but may not work for others.
The first thing, the best thing you can do to avoid that paralysis is to plan out and get some content under your belt before you ever launch it. – James
James 40:06
But the best thing that I can say when it comes to that is number one. And I haven’t, you know, like, there’s lots of advice out there. So that’s why I’m pausing. You know, take this with a grain of salt. Don’t start right away. The first thing, the best thing you can do to avoid that paralysis is to plan out and get some content under your belt before you ever launch it. So to give you an example, I’ve been filming for two months, before we even launched our first episode, because what I wanted to do was get a sense of the flow of content for our channel, sort of piece together, conceptually and thematically at a high level where the content was going. And I’ve done a few things. And I’ll give you a couple of practical examples of what I’ve done.
James 40:06
So the first thing I did was I said, Okay, what are what do I want to operate in seasons? Right? And I said, Yes, because I want to start date, and I want to end date. So I want to have that arc of content. And then I started thinking, Okay, well, within that, what are some things that I can do to not have it be the same thing every week? Like, how can I spice it up a little bit. And I watched a bunch of YouTube channels. And there’s one channel that I really love. It’s called Jolly. And it’s these two British guys. One, it’s a British guy who speaks Korean, and his best mate. And the two of them, they just get on, and they do really silly things. But what I love about it is they have these sub series of content.
James 41:46
So they’ve got an arc of content, you know, all around trying foods from around the world, they have another one, where they drive around in a limo in London, and introduce their friends to Korean food, right, and they have another one where they go online, and they try to buy the most random things, that’s super entertaining for me. But what they’ve done is they’ve actually created these, these amatic, sort of like sub series within their content stream, that gives enough variety for people, but also allows them to be creative as well. And so I think for me, that’s, that’s been really helpful.
James 42:19
So with with input, what we’ve tried to do is, we have a 23 Episodes Season, which is a standard season in the US North America, right, from a TV point of view, we’re aiming for half an hour, because it’s the length of a normal TV show, or a average commute from home to work. And the the themes that we we’ve got are things that we can really lean into, and we can go out and source guests and do content that actually is quite intentional. Yeah, that’s another big part of it. And, and so by doing that, we’re actually able to approach each episode with confidence. And the last thing, and I know, I’ve been talking about this for a while, so I know,
Josh 43:05
I can see a question right on the tip of my tongue.
James 43:08
It’s, you know, like, I can see the question, but this is also important is that start with one channel, and create great content for that primary channel. And then if you’re ready, or if you can, if you’ve got capacity, you can expand out from there. So we decided early on, we were going to be a video first show. So we were going to be a YouTube channel, that was our number one thing, and we knew we were going to go to Audio. Cuz we could do that literally, at the same time, when we export our video, we can just split out the audio, and do that. And there’s very little extra work on top of that.
James 43:48
And from there, then it was like, Well, if you want your YouTube channel to be successful, you’ve got to promote it. So we picked a couple of key channels that we knew would work for us. But our content was able to almost create itself, because the core of the content was the YouTube show itself. Right. And from there, we already knew what we were going to do on social media, because it was all related to whatever that episode was for the week. So in you know, introducing the guests talking about the topic, you know, whatever you’re doing a preview clip, all those kinds of it’s just it basically wrote itself. And so it made it easier as a content creator not to get bogged down in the pressure to be looking week to week. But it allows us to actually thematically look at things to write content to be strategic about our guests, and to create content that we hope will be relevant to our audience.
Josh 44:38
That’s great. A couple big points that I took out from there. One was to really plan and strategically think through launching something because this is the other problem and it kind of goes against my initial gut feeling which is just just do something, get it out there. But the problem with that is if you’re not somebody who was used to doing something consistently, you’re likely going to start and then about two months later, it’s just gonna fall flat. Or if you don’t have a most what’s most important with content is a content strategy for like continuing to create it. That’s why it doesn’t work out. That’s why so many podcasts start and then they fade or YouTube channels start and they fade.
Josh 45:19
Case in point, when I started this podcast, it was at the end of 2019. I had thought about starting this in the summer of 2018. But I knew I was still in the right in the middle of creating a lot of different courses, I was still running my agency along with it. And I knew as much as I wanted to dive into the podcast, I just, I did not have the bandwidth for it yet. I knew I was going to get there. But I also knew, I think, because I didn’t have all of the courses I wanted created. I realized at this point, I think it’s more beneficial for me to make really amazing kick ass courses. And then once I’m done with them, or far along with all my main courses, then I can go more heavy on content marketing. And that’s really mainly what I do right now.
Josh 46:05
I’m in the process of revamping courses and adding lessons and adding new ones eventually, but mainly what I do on a week to week basis as content marketing through podcasts, and I’m reinvigorating my YouTube channel. And there was another good lesson you mentioned there to Chris Watts was to just choose one channel, and then figure out the places that are going to be the best ROI. Because this was kind of the second big point that I took out from that. And that is if you try to do a YouTube show, and podcasts and tutorials and promote them on LinkedIn, and Tik Tok and Instagram and Facebook and Twitter, it’s that so much to do at once, you’re likely just going to face so much overwhelm, you’re not even going to do it.
Josh 46:45
So it’s so much better to just focus on like one channel, really grow that. And if you want to, you know, whether it’s email marketing, or one social media channel that you like best, just pick a couple channels to help promote that. That’s what I did. And I can say in full confidence, that’s what really helped me avoid the same type of overwhelm, is I actually, I started with YouTube, and I just did YouTube videos, which helped me build my authority and in my name, and, you know, get a lot of people into my courses. And then I took a little bit of a break from doing constant YouTube videos and launch the podcast. And now I have strategies for both that I’m able to do both at the same time simultaneously. And I don’t feel overwhelmed, because I have a good feel for both of them, I have my processes in place. And I can, you know, do those consistently.
Josh 47:32
So all that to say, that’s kind of the way I, you know, approach my content game. And it sounds like you’re, you know, you really took a lot of those lessons to heart. And I think that’s what a lot of people should think about with their own content is sticking with, you know, one or two channels that you’re comfortable with that you know, well, or that you’re excited about. And then just do it consistently or have a have an end date, what you mentioned there with the seasons, that’s great. And when I started my YouTube channel, one of the best things I did was I gave myself a 12 week deadline, I said, I’m going to do a new tutorial once a week for 12 weeks. So there was an end in sight. And I can’t tell you how beneficial that was for me because it ended up being a lot of work. I was new to tutorials. But at the end of that 12 weeks I accomplished it, it was a huge boost. And then I felt really comfortable to do that consistently. So I don’t know if you have any thoughts on that. But that’s definitely what I applied to the content.
James 48:30
Yeah, the other the other side to that is it helps you avoid scope creep. So when you think about your content, and what you’re doing, there are a ton of great ideas that you haven’t thought of yet, that are just waiting there for you to pick them up and do them. And it’s so tempting when you don’t have a plan or when you’re just going week to week to pivot before the right time or to jump into something and follow that that rabbit trail. You know, I was in a Congress I was in a in a meeting yesterday with my editor Dustin and he and I were chatting and and it’s it’s interesting because he’s actually seeing a bunch of these episodes. So he’s seeing the themes and these arcs of of conversation and story that are starting to peek through.
James 49:17
But he’s thrown out ideas and we’re spit-balling ideas now for season two going we already know and we’ve we’ve got confidence in season one that we’re going to be able to deliver the content that we want and do it well that we can actually start planning out and thinking about how this great new content is going to be for season two and and so it actually it frees you from having from the from the tyranny of the urgent right of thinking everything has to be done right now and your great your your greatest ideas the one that that’s your latest idea. Well that’s not necessarily true finish finished strongly idea that you had that you started with and then go on to the next one and you’ll see yourself grow I think from strength to strength.
Josh 49:56
Oh definitely.
James 49:57
Build upon.
Josh 49:58
Yeah, and it tends to get better and better. And then even from the, as the host from the standpoint of like producing stuff. It’s funny because before we went live, you were like, you know, you the anxiousness of launch day on anything is it always takes so much out of you and I let you know before went live. Luckily, that fades after, you know, for me it was about in between 20 and 30 episodes I used to get like so anxious and nervous when it was episode last day because I was like, Oh, I hope everything goes right. I hope it’s well received. Now that I’m 140. And I don’t even really I don’t really think about it does become like a muscle you just get used to. And I think that’s true for anything in life.
Josh 50:36
But once you once you build that confidence step by step, it really does, it goes through every aspect of content marketing, because suddenly, it I think it’s this is a really important point to it’s okay to feel out of your element or a little nervous or uncomfortable when you’re doing certain content marketing, because you haven’t done it yet, or you haven’t done it to that level. Like, I was nervous when I started my podcast because I got really good at doing videos and tutorials. But a conversation is a whole different ballgame. And it’s as you’re probably finding out a couple months into it. It’s extremely draining, to do a really good interview, isn’t it weird?
Josh 51:16
Like you wouldn’t think it, it would be that draining, but particularly when for us, it’s not just like a random conversation. This is an intentional conversation with what is hopefully an end result with this topic. It is very draining. And the good news is I can tell you this and full confidence here, James, doing this for almost two years now, it doesn’t take near as much out of me as it used to, like, I filled my schedule up the first couple months, I did my podcast, and I was like, I’m wiped, I can’t even focus on anything else. Cuz I’m done right now after this interview.
Josh 51:50
But it I say all that to say you build a muscle, and this goes with anything, it’s like building a website, the first couple times, it’s terrible, but then you do better and better the more you do it, it’s like anything you get better. And that that confidence and that, you know, quote unquote, muscle building for that really does filter through everything because suddenly you’re interviewing better without having to think too hard about it. This interview, we don’t have show notes or an outline that we’re basing this off of I just, I’m curious and I I knew the end result for this episode, which is know how to create good content that’s going to help, you know, build community and sell a service and product.
Josh 52:27
So I don’t, I don’t really need to have like a list that I see a lot of podcasters do and I think that’s okay, at first, maybe to have a you know, a direction to head to but it does get easier. Production gets, you know, you get used to the tools you get used to how you distribute it. So I just wanted to say that because I think it really is important to remember that when you start something the first couple months are going to be a little rough or a lot of work. But it does get easier and consistency becomes easier. Have you found that even a couple months in I mean, as Have you started to turn that corner yet? Or is that going to be Season Two that you’ll turn it?
James 53:03
Um, well, you know, anecdotally I can say that I’ve had, I’ve had a little bit of experience doing the video thing. A couple of years ago, I was on tour for Envato doing something we called Euro tour. And I decided that I was going to be a travel blogger throughout the whole thing. And, and then so you know, create content and post them sort of every day. I don’t know why I thought I was going to be able to do that while also traveling from city to city and doing actual physical presentations at conferences, meetups, but then I tried it but I can remember the first time I pulled out my camera in the airport in Toronto and like, you know, like doing the whole like Casey Neistat vlog thing, you know, running around being like, I have to get over this fear of being on camera, this fear of being you know, out there and and and on. So that was a good experience. And you know, by the, you know, two days, three days in I was fine. And I would just talk to the camera walking down the street. I remember doing that in Amsterdam, just whipping out the camera and walking down the street in Amsterdam and everyone’s just sort of like another one you know. Yeah.
Josh 54:15
And that’s that’s also a good point, James of just trying something out. Because yeah, while I’m a I’m a big fan of somebody committing to something there is. There’s a lot of room to just try something out to really see what you think about it. Case in point. Before I launched my podcast the earlier that year beginning of 2019 I created a little almost like mini video podcast series it was a nine part series about scaling a Divi web design business. And that was almost my trial run to like, see like okay, how do I interview Do I like this? I know it’s not going to be perfect but how I feel about this because it was both the video show and the kind of an audio type podcast.
Josh 55:01
Although it wasn’t actually a podcast, it was mainly just the video. But I say that to say I did nine episodes, interviewed people. And I found out that I actually really liked this I got even just a nine episodes, I got better and better each one and I got more comfortable. I was less nervous, I started asking better questions I stopped saying, and right and so and a crazy amount of filler words, I still work hard at that. But it definitely helped me with some of that. And and that was really the genesis of feeling confident to do this podcast. So again, just all to say there’s a lot of room for just trying something out to write to see what you think and to see if you’re good at it.
James 55:39
Well, I think yeah, that’s that’s one of the reasons why I said as well, like developing seasons, or having a start an end date, means you don’t have to commit to something indefinitely. That’s scary, right to think that, you know, like, you’ve got to do something for forever, or you you sort of commit to it and build up all that stress. I will say, one of the one of the neat things about sort of the way that I’ve been doing it is because we knew we were going to be launching on a specific day. And we had a bunch of people we already wanted to interview and stories we wanted to tell and share. We were able to do it out of sequence.
James 56:17
So the founder episode actually isn’t the first one I recorded. It’s actually maybe the fifth or sixth one that I’ve recorded. So it’ll be interesting as these other episodes air to see if people can figure out which one was the first. The first is also funny, because I recorded I had to record it twice. Because the first time we recorded it, I did it without having headphones in. And so there was this huge, like echoey reverb feedback going on to the whole thing. I felt so bad when I had to go to I go to my guest and say I’m sorry, I can’t get an extra hour of your time. Yeah, to re record this, which was actually really good. Because I was so nervous in that first one. I’m almost glad it was a throwaway episode because, you know, the second time around, I was like, Okay, no, I you know, like, I was so nervous to even talk. Right? Like, I just let them talk. I would I would interject a question. And as, as it’s gone on, I’ve started to go no, it’s okay for me to have an opinion. It’s okay for me to share my own thoughts, my own stories here. And so yeah, absolutely. As you go, you will, you will figure out after every episode or after every engagement with your content, what you liked about it, what you want to change or what you might want to try to in the next time around. Yeah, and that’s that’s a fun, creative adventure as well.
Josh 57:36
The the sequence is definitely interesting. I, my episodes jumble around pretty frequently, I don’t record one episode, and then launch it and record another one I did at first about the first 75 episodes. That’s how I did it. But more recently, because I’m so far out, I’m generally about a month and a half to two months out on podcast episodes now, which is great. It’s awesome to be at that point. Because that means I can take a month off and doing podcast interviews about one takes a while to get to that point. But it is interesting. I tried to keep them in sequential order. Now just because I’ve caught myself saying things that are out of order. And it can be a little confusing.
Josh 58:13
But it is interesting that that’s an option. You could go either way you could do things in order, or you could do things completely randomly, or and one of the best, I think most important things to remember with content now, whether it’s YouTube, WordPress, blog, podcast, whatever, is you can bulk record. And you can like you can have two days a week where you record interviews and do content, you can schedule it out, and then you can take a week or two off. I do that all the time. This is honestly why I have my week set up to where I only generally record on Tuesdays and Wednesdays sometimes Thursdays. But those are my recording days. And I’m able like if I’m a couple months ahead, I don’t have to record podcasts. Like I’m doing quite a few podcasts this week. The next like three weeks, I don’t think I have any podcast interview scheduled. So I hope that’s freeing for people to remember, just because you do a weekly show doesn’t mean that you need to actually record once a week you can you can do them in bulk and then release them whenever.
James 59:14
That’s been a huge win for me. And I think it’s interesting. You know, when when you because I’ve known that I’ve I was going to be doing this show for about five or six months before we actually sat down and started doing it. I was able to take a look at how other people were doing it. And I read a lot of you know, people like people’s stories of how they started their podcasts and how they started their YouTube channel. And I picked up I tried to consume as much as I could on the strategy, the tech the approach to content creation as I possibly could try to develop a system that would work well for me and one of the things that I saw on a show that that I was watching was They, they took two weeks and they filmed, you know, an inside an entire season for them in two weeks.
James 1:00:05
I went, Oh, that makes a ton of sense a thoroughly half an hour episodes, right, you know, maybe record for an hour, then you get eight hours in eight episodes in a day kind of thing, right or, or five if you if that’s too much. But think about that, like you could get 10 episodes done in in two days. And that’s 10 weeks of content. That’s, you know, that’s, that’s incredible. So that was really freeing for me, because my big worry, and it still is is, you know, the tyranny of the next episode, like it’s coming, you know, the next episodes coming in launch days around the corner and not wanting to get stuck in a spot where I was throwing out bad content, because I didn’t have anything else. And I was worried about, you know, like the algorithm or whatever it is about, you know, like trying to make sure I was consistent. I think that’s important. But I want to do that from a place of energy and quality as opposed to a place of desperation.
Josh 1:01:00
It’s a good point, the quality versus quantity thing is something that I struggle with big time I’ve I’ve fluctuated with the amount of podcasts I do per month. And then now that I’m implementing YouTube, I’m debating on at the end of 2021, maybe just going to one podcast a week, because right now I’m doing about six a month, on average, I like to sprinkle in some solo episodes. So I’m kind of trying to bait the bait on, you know, what’s working to make sure it is quality. And same thing with the YouTube videos i i try to stick to one a week. But I’m not going to be shy about maybe having a couple weeks off if I make a really good bigger video.
Josh 1:01:30
But again, the beauty about all that is you can record a lot and create a lot and as a couple weeks or a few weeks, and then that can last you for several months, potentially. So that’s a really important point. Because I think a lot of people as busy business owners think there’s no way I have time for content marketing. But this is actually something I told an old realtor client of mine. And it blew her mind. I was like, what if you wrote, you know, if you wanted to do one pie, or one blog posts every couple of weeks, what have you on a Friday, took a few hours and just wrote, you know, three or four articles will suddenly barring the distribution and some tweaking, there’s like two months of content for you right there.
Josh 1:02:15
And she was like, Oh, I didn’t think about that. So I don’t need to like every Friday, literally right? I could do it like in a bulk of time. I was like, yep, that’s exactly how I do it. And it’s a really, really freeing thought. And it’s it’s honestly comforting for me to remember that. Because it’s so easy to fall in the trap of like constant continuous content. But the fact is consistency and and the amount of time somebody gets to hear you. And if you hit them on these different channels, it really does build that trust and authority. So all really good points. I’m curious, as we’ve kind of get putting a cap on this conversation. What is the plan for, I guess, quote, unquote, measuring success of this channel? I imagine it’s not going to be about the number of views necessarily, but are you going to, you know, over the rest of 2021. And in the next year, do you foresee maybe just looking at me I’m sure that factoring into sales will be a part of it. But are you going to look at the the type of community and the responses that you’re getting? Well, what’s what’s the measuring of success look like with this channel?
James 1:03:20
I have? Maybe not, unsurprisingly, a three to five year plan for the channel. Because again, I like to plan and think and prep in advance. But you know, we don’t know yet. What audience is going to be excited about input. So another good reason for us to have a separate brand is what if it fails? What if it doesn’t work? Well then it’s easy to kill without having to kill off Gravity Forms, right? Like it doesn’t negatively impact our core product and our core brand it allowed we have this freedom to spin something up to test it out, see if it if it finds an audience and then and then burn it off if it doesn’t.
James 1:04:08
But you know, like, I’ll let you in on the strategy and and I don’t know if I should but it’s probably okay. But but you know, we don’t we don’t know yet what what the audience is going to be so so right now for I think the next six months to the to a year it’s let’s see, if we can grow an audience and how big of an audience we can grow. Can we create some stickiness with a following and cannot begin to fuel its own growth? Can it begin to grow itself organically, whether that’s through algorithms through search through recommendations through, you know, sharing across social, like, let’s see what it can do that way. And if we can get to a place where we’re confident that it can sustain itself from a growth from an audience growth point of view, then it becomes a question of okay, how then do we Like what steps we want to take to generate revenue, not generate profit, but generate revenue? Can we get it to a place where it’s generating revenue?
James 1:05:08
If we can do that, whatever that that monetization strategy looks like, right now that could be connecting it directly to Gravity Forms calm and selling, you know, products and licenses, but maybe not, maybe it’s something completely different. And so we want to be open to whatever that could be. And then from there, if we can generate revenue, then it becomes okay, how do we then make it profitable? How do we get it from, from just bringing money in to streamlining things or cutting away things or starting things that are going to actually help it go from just generating something to generating enough that it’s actually profitable and sustainable in the long run?
Josh 1:05:45
Well, the really cool thing about a podcast and a video show, and I’m not sure how far you’ve thought into this, or whether you’re expecting this, but this interview right here is an offshoot of me coming onto the show, and you interviewing me? And I don’t know, have you anticipated that. So like, you’re able to talk to my audience and audience about this, you didn’t have to run a Facebook ad to reach them, you didn’t have to do any sort of other marketing, you just came on my show.
Josh 1:06:11
That is one of the biggest benefits with doing any sort of interview or YouTube show podcast, whatever is you immediately expand your network. It’s like networking groups. And this is, this is something that I learned early on, when I joined a networking group, it wasn’t just those people who were my clients, it was who they knew. And that is the beauty about podcasts and video shows is, not only are the guests that you’re bringing on, are you going to influence and be able to, you know, to gain from but suddenly, they may want to have you on their shows, and they may want to promote input and in you best believe when my episode drops on input, I’m going to share it and then suddenly my audience is looking at it.
Josh 1:06:51
So there’s definitely a trickle down effect that is very unique with podcasts. It’s one reason I love podcasting is I’ve seen it work like this. It’s like, I’ll hear somebody will join one of my courses. They’re like, Oh, yeah, I heard you on, you know, somebody else’s show. And then that’s how I came across you. And it’s amazing. I love that because it’s like, organic, real marketing that yes, it does take time, but it’s it beats running, you know, targeted ads that can be sometimes really expensive. So I’m curious to see how that’s gonna pan out for you guys in season one and onward.
Josh 1:07:26
So I’m really excited for you, man, I again, I was kind of curious about what the end goal was, it sounds like it’s, you know, a little bit open ended with kind of seeing how it goes, which is great because you can pivot, tweak things if need be, or see how it responds the cool thing and I’m going to make a prediction for you guys. I think it’s going to be pretty big because I know when Elegant Themes when they were really promoting Divi, they launched divination, which was a story driven, user based show and I was on that it really piqued my interest with the community of Divi. I think that’s kind of what you guys will probably experience with Gravity Forms to is, you’ll get a lot of different users. And as you will know, been in the WordPress world for so long. It’s such a generous and giving type of community I could see it spreading like wildfire. So
James 1:08:15
I hope so, you know, the flipside to the good is, is you’re always nervous about, you know, the critiques and how it’s actually going to be received. I think it’s launch day for me. So funnily enough, we got a dislike on our video.
Josh 1:08:31
Oh, that’s gonna happen that I know, I saw I saw the thumbs down. So I, when I looked at that, I looked at it pretty quickly, because I was excited to see what the first couple episodes are going to be like. So I think I saw on Facebook that you guys mentioned the first episode was out. So I looked at I think there was like, you know, maybe 30 some views at the beginning and you’ve already got a thumbs down, I get the same thing if that’s one thing that I realized with YouTube in particular, it’s kind of one reason I love audio podcast, they can’t like or dislike an episode. YouTube is brutal. And you could you could make a video, and you could be the most helpful person with the most kind message and you could just have the utmost care and genuine, you know, love for somebody in the world in some douchebag is going to give it a thumbs down.
Josh 1:09:19
It just It always happens whether it’s a troll was just a sarcastic person thinking they’re being funny, whatever it is. So I don’t know, I say that to say don’t worry about that. And in fact, I learned pretty early on with my YouTube channel. If I don’t get a few haters. I’m probably doing something wrong. i You got to get a few haters in there. And then you know, okay, my channel is actually getting some traction because now there’s some people who are either putting spammy links or some sort of, you know, troll type of message. So, in a weird way, that’s actually a bit of a measure for success as the more haters you get, you’re probably getting 10 times as many people who really love it so
James 1:09:54
Well that is one thing you’ll see I I’m I’m fine with it only because the The dislike actually came before the episode premiered. So it was not even, they hadn’t even seen the episode, they were just being funny. I would not be surprised if it was somebody from Gravity Forms just being cheeky and actually do this, like just for the just for the fun of it. But now they’re not like they’re not that bad. So
Josh 1:10:19
One of my one of my mentors is Pat Flynn. And he’s a really well known entrepreneur, and he went live during COVID, every day for a year. And I would tune into some of his live streams. And it was always funny, because the minute he would go live, he’d get like two or three thumbs downs. And a couple of times people would say, like, who’s giving a thumbs down? And even Pat said, he’s like, Oh, that’s to be expected, you know, like, it’s not anything I’m worried about. Because because he’s used to, you know, he’s had to develop a lot of fixed game, which he was actually on this podcast in Episode 100. And he talked about dealing with trolls, and how to get over them to not take it personally.
Josh 1:10:58
So yeah, didn’t mean for this conversation to go there. But I definitely am interested in doing a whole conversation on dealing with trolls or a whole episode about that, because I’ve definitely had to learn to get some thick skin and just not respond. Sometimes I just had to tell myself, Josh, don’t respond. It’s not worth it. Let it go and keep on creating good content. So good stuff, James. Well, awesome, man. Well, hey, I’m so pumped for you. I was going to ask where you’d like people to go. I don’t that’s probably not a shocker. But you know, input is is the channel? Do you want them to go to a certain website? Do you want them to go to View to where would you like my ons to go to find out more about the show?
James 1:11:36
I mean, you can find Input. If you search really hard on Apple, and Spotify and YouTube, so probably the best place to go is just welcome to input.com. And across all the socials at Welcome to input. So we try to keep it really simple that way and make it easy for people to find it.
Josh 1:11:54
Beautiful. Yeah, we’ll link that in the show notes. Just last question for I’m curious, what are you most excited about with this whole endeavor? Is it like a personal growth thing that you enjoy? What what are you personally super excited about it? Or is it just seeing it come to life after months and months of work and in planning?
When I was getting started, I was brainstorming, like what this content would be, initially the idea of connecting creativity with purpose. – James
James 1:12:15
You know, I have to give a bunch of props to Gravity Forms, because they did not put a lot of limits or restrictions on me and my thinking about this, like, you know, you can get started relatively cost effectively, but I wanted to go big. And the amount of money that they poured into me and into this, to make it possible has been huge. But even more than that. One of the like, it was interesting, when when I was getting started, I was brainstorming, like what this content would be, initially the idea of connecting creativity with purpose, that’s our tagline for input, that was actually a separate show, that was going to be my own personal thing.
James 1:13:02
And, and I can remember I walked into a meeting with with my manager, Mark, and I were, you know, just doing our one on ones like we normally do. And at the end of it, we’re talking about concept for the show and what it might be and where it could go. And I said, you know, I just want you to know, I’ve got this idea to do these stories, you know, that are both inside and outside the WordPress ecosystem. And like, my personal mission is to connect creativity with purpose. But if I could do this, with the blessing of Gravity Forms, how I like that, that would just be amazing. You just let that mean, you said why not? Yeah, right.
Josh 1:13:44
Cool.
James 1:13:44
And why not? And that was really the birth of input, because all of a sudden, it was like, you know, like, I think we all do this, we put barriers in front of ourselves, like, although never go for that, or oh, you know, this could never happen or that they might, you know, like even asking for, for the kind of lighting that I wanted to get for the studio or the microphone, I want to get, oh, that’s just going to be too much. But what I have found with Gravity Forms is that they’re so supportive of letting they’re like they hire and they trust their team. Right, they hire well. And then they trust their team to do things and and for me, it was like, like, every time I put that barrier in front of myself, you know, I talk it out with my managers nervous but it’s just ask, and they’ve, they’ve been amazing.
James 1:14:32
And so for me to have their blessing to do that. What I’m most satisfied about is what the audience will get is authentically me and authentically Gravity Forms and that marriage of the of our cultures together. There’s me through and through and because of that I’m that much more passionate about it. I’m that much more energized. You know, I will Work a Saturday like I did a couple weeks ago to build a website in a day so that I could have an RSS feed right? Like, I will do that because this is as much me as it is Gravity Forms and. And so that’s yeah, that’s what’s what I’m most excited about with this is being able to see that come to life and come to fruition.
Josh 1:15:18
That’s awesome, man.
James 1:15:20
Yeah,
Josh 1:15:20
I meant to ask you this. I was gonna ask you this after we we signed off, but I’ll just keep it rolling here. How are you planning are how have you got guests? Because that’s a whole different strategy as well. I know when people think about doing interviews, it’s Metasys. Earlier, but yeah, the the question is like, what’s the strategy for getting guests? Do you have a certain strategy? Or is it been more organic or user base? What does that look like?
James 1:15:46
Yeah, so again, because we start from a position of planning, or I start from a position of planning, I already know the topic. So because I know the topic of every episode for the 23 episodes in our season, I already can it for me, that’s really helpful in narrowing down the type of guests that I might go after. So but sometime, but it’s different. So I’ve had my episodes, I still have some blank spots. So if you are somebody who’s in the agency space, and you want to be on the show, you can go to welcome to input com and sign up. But but the strategy has been start with my network, start with people I know.
James 1:16:26
And I was really surprised about the kind of people that I knew, like I had published authors in my network, I had radio broadcasters, I had TV hosts, I had, you know, agency executives, I had amazing freelance content creators in my network. And so I started there and then filled in all the slots, I could and then as we started doing interviews, all of a sudden, my guess would start saying, Oh, actually, I know so and so yeah, you should let me introduce you to them, because that they would be a great fit. And I think as I shared the vision for what input is, with every guest, as they come on, I was take a few minutes just to sort of talk about what the show is about. They, you know, like, they’ve been really eager to introduce me to people. So that’s, that’s how I got Steven Christian, the lead singer of, you know, Amberlynn to come on, because he was a contact with another guests. And it’s like, Whoa,
Josh 1:17:22
I just probably back in high school man. Amberlynn.
James 1:17:24
Wow, tell me about it.
Josh 1:17:26
It was like what like, this is this is from like, my history, like, I like
James 1:17:31
That it got me through my 20s Kind of. That’s funny, you know, like, it’s so interesting, like, how that’s happened. So part of it is that, but my big challenge, and I think this is a challenge of the pandemic, this is a challenge of where the world is at right now is that my personal network is not nearly as diverse as I wish it would, could be or is, and so that the kinds of voices are the voices that rise to the top or the voices that are the most likely to promote themselves or, or be promoted. And often they look and sound like me, and, and so for me that the biggest challenge has been trying to find voices from underrepresented groups. And really make sure like, we get lots of women involved, and lots of people of color, and people with different backgrounds and abilities to come in and tell their stories and be part of it. So that for me right now is the hunt. That’s the hard part is finding diverse voices to be on the show. The rest of it’s fairly easy, like I could fill it up with, you know, white guys till the cows come home. But I want to show that’s more representative of who we are, as, you know, a community of people as a world. So
Josh 1:18:51
Yeah, well, the organic thing about all that no matter, you know, what the what the diversity looks like, like once you get one guess again, it’s like the networking effect, they likely know a ton of other people. And then that’s it. That’s how you get opened up to so many amazing people. I know. Trying to think back the way I got on the show, I didn’t ask to request to be on the show. I talked to gravity forms about getting a special affiliate page done for my audience. And then I forget who I talked to was like, You know what they were like, you have a really cool channel going on here. You should talk to James. He’s doing a show for Gravity Forms like a YouTube type show. And I was like, perfect, let’s do it.
Josh 1:19:28
So it is so interesting, the different ways you can get connected. But I think your point of having a more strategic approach for certain types of guests, you know, whether it’s story driven, and the thing, the reality is, too, you don’t want the same type of stories over and over, which can happen in the in the WordPress realm. So I think that’s really cool. It’s interesting. Let me look real quick at the schedule. Let’s see, we’ll be so just a few episodes before you. I had an entrepreneur who I think Walter is in his maybe 70s. So to have him on the show and he is a guy of Color, like a very different type of guest for my show. But wow, did he give some of the most amazing business advice for my audience as somebody who’s gone through decades of entrepreneurialship, which is really cool.
Josh 1:20:13
So it is really cool to see, you know, a whole different set of stories come to live in. The reality is everyone does have a different story. So even if there are similarities, I think the fact that you keep it real, and you dive into those deep topics, that’s when it gets less surfacey. And more real. So yeah, man. Well, I’m super pumped. Well, to avoid this becoming a two hour conversation, James, I know you’re worn out. You’re beat understandably so after a huge launch day, but I’m super pumped for input. We’ll have all these links in the show notes. Thanks so much for your time today, man. And I’m really looking forward to seeing how this thing shapes up for you guys.
James 1:20:47
Thank you, and thank you for having me.
Josh 1:20:49
Awesome, James. Cheers, man.,… Keep ReadingAre you interested in strengthening the existing bond you have with your children? One of the best ways to do this is by examining your past/existing relationship with your father. Regardless of the nature of relationship with him, or if it was good or bad, you can still use it to improve your own bonding and parenting techniques.
As generations gradually develop down the line in families, behaviors are also passed down. If you can take the time to identify the behaviors being passed on through your family, you can essentially choose the ones to pass down to your youngsters.
Reinforcing and Passing Down Good Behavior
You can start by asking yourself what your father ever did that made you feel as though you were loved and appreciated by him. As ideas and memories come to you, write them down. Even if only 1 or 2 events come to mind, be sure to record them. Examples of questions to ask yourself are, “Were you ever greeted by your father in a way that made you feel nice? Did he make an effort to do things with you? What types of things were done? Did he show you how to do certain things, or allow you to assist him with things he needed done?
As your list grows, it will prove useful for improving your parenting technique. Adding these affectionate behaviors to your own parenting style will help your children feel valued and loved.
Avoiding and Putting a Stop to Bad Behavior
There is a second part to this exercise that might be a bit more difficult. On another list, you will write down things your father did that made you feel bad, unloved, and/or forgotten. The purpose of this exercise is not to dredge up bad memories, but to help you avoid these same behaviors in your own parenting habits.
When making this list, think of times when your father may have spoken to you in an unwanted tone. Perhaps there were times when you felt he was being cruel rather than disciplinary. Write every negative experience down that comes to mind.
As your list grows, re-read it and tell yourself these are things that you would never do to your child. Think of specific ways in which you can avoid this type of treatment. For example, maybe you can speak in different tones or discipline in a way that is free of cruelty, yet full of love. Your memories can be a wonderful point of reference, rather than just old wounds. This is how pleasant childhood memories are made after all.
Being a Great Parent
One of the most prominent questions in parenting is, “How can I be a better mother/father?” The answer is quite simply, “Always give the best in yourself to your child.” There is a whole world of experiences you can share with your child inside yourself, and perhaps you never knew until now.
The idea is to love with everything you do. Each time you speak to your child, make sure what you’re saying is being backed with a soft undertone that tells them they are loved and valued.
It is possible for any parent to completely transform their relationship with their child just by changing behaviors and replacing them with better, more positive ones.
In the distant future, your children will also likely pass down these good, positively reinforced behaviors as well. In a way, you are not only helping your children, but also children in generations down the line in your family.A commemorative postage stamp on the Birth Centenary of DVG, a Kannada writer and philosopher, author of Mankuthimmana Kagga and Marula Muniyana Kagga :

Manage episode 293067920 series 2631806
This week the US sent its highest-level official to Libya since 2014, a move it says is a signal of its increased commitment to resolving the country's crisis. The visit comes as Libya’s new Government of National Unity seeks to set the stage for a national election in December. This remains a challenge as foreign backed troops, mercenaries, and militias are still present in the country, despite calls for their removal. Expert Aya Burweila joins The Greek Current to talk about the challenges facing Libya's unity government, the destabilizing role of these militias, and Turkey’s refusal to withdraw its foreign mercenaries. We also look at the steps the Biden Administration is taking to support the political process in Libya.
Aya Burweila is a Libyan expert from Benghazi and visiting lecturer at the Hellenic National Defense Academy. She is also publishing, together with Dr. Ethan Chorin, an upcoming volume on Libya titled Libya in 2021: What Went Wrong, What Comes Next.

- Holmes repeatedly takes the Fifth Amendment in one deposition from 2018, but says in the other she was the “ultimate decision maker” at Theranos.
If Elizabeth Holmes testifies in her own criminal trial, videotaped depositions may be a clue of how she'll fare on the stand.
Twelve days after she was indicted on fraud charges, Holmes, the CEO and founder of Theranos, sat for a nearly four hour deposition in which she hardly answered any questions. But in the depositions, which were part of a lawsuit and an SEC investigation into the company, Holmes did say she was the ultimate decision-maker at Theranos, a theme her legal defense team is trying to downplay in her criminal trial.
The June 27, 2018 videotaped deposition, obtained by CNBC, was in connection with a late stage investor lawsuit against Holmes, her blood-testing firm Theranos and company president Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani.
"I'm going to follow my counsel's instruction," Holmes repeatedly told attorney Reed Kathrein, who represented the investors who sued Theranos, in Berkeley, Calif.
"She was one of the calmest witnesses I've ever had," Kathrein told CNBC in an interview earlier this week. "Of course, she didn't answer any questions, but I've never seen someone keep the composure, the steadiness and the eye contact the entire time. Even while I'm making some pretty harsh accusations, she never broke into a sense of anger."
That investor lawsuit was settled. While the terms were kept confidential, Kathrein said his clients were paid back the money they invested.
In the deposition, Holmes wouldn't even acknowledge that it's her when she is shown her October 2015 appearance on CNBC's "Mad Money."
As prosecutors wind up their case in the next few weeks, the looming question is whether Holmes will take the stand in her own defense.
Her lawyers have signaled that she intends to accuse Balwani, her former boyfriend and top executive, of controlling and manipulating her. Unsealed court filings allege Holmes claims Balwani sexually and emotionally abused her, which she claims impaired her judgement at Theranos.
Balwani has denied the allegations.
"Ms. Holmes is likely to testify herself to the reasons why she believed, relied on, and deferred to Mr. Balwani," lawyers for Holmes wrote in a February legal filing that was unsealed.
Taking the stand could help humanize Holmes who sits upright with a notebook in front of her and is sometimes seen whispering to her lawyers inside the courtroom.
She occasionally glances over to the jurors who are on her left and will often look back to her mother, Noel Holmes, and several friends who occasionally sit on the bench behind her. The face mask Holmes is required to wear in court has hidden any public display of her emotion.
But testifying in her own defense could run a major risk.
"Most white collar defendants do not take the stand," Danny Cevallos, an NBC News legal analyst, said. "That's because most have at least some credibility issues. A good defense attorney knows that if your client takes the stand and loses credibility, the case is lost."
Sometimes the best defense is simply a deflection.
"It shouldn't be a hard lift for Elizabeth Holmes to use the government's evidence to try and foist blame onto Sunny Balwani," Cevallos said. "After all, the government's prosecuting Sunny too. So the judo move for Elizabeth is to use that evidence directed at Sunny herself and essentially say Sunny is the only criminal here."
Cevallos cautioned at the end of the day the jury will want to hear Holmes' side of the story.
"There's no silence louder than the silence of the accused in a criminal case," Cevallos said. "Everybody in the jury wants to hear from Elizabeth. But that's why the judge will instruct them that they cannot take the defendants silence either as ambition or hold it against her."
Balwani's attorney, Jeffrey Coopersmith, declined to comment. Attorneys for Holmes did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.
Holmes and Balwani have pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. If convicted, they each face up to 20 years in prison.
Cevallos points to the terabytes of documents, text messages and emails in the case that the defense can attempt to use as a source for evidence rather than Holmes testifying.
Kathrein agreed that Holmes would likely not take the stand in her own defense unless her attorneys think it's a last resort.
"It would be a disaster for her to testify," Kathrein said. "She's charming but she's kind of all over the place in the SEC deposition. She says she doesn't remember, she makes admissions and she never blames Sunny. So her whole defense of blaming Sunny would crumble."
Kathrein referred to another deposition conducted by lawyers for the Securities and Exchange Commission over three days in the summer of 2017.
In that deposition, which was also videotaped and obtained by CNBC, Holmes was more forthcoming answering questions ranging from what she told investors about the capabilities of the blood-testing technology to Theranos' financial projections. However, she also said she didn't know the answer when she was pressed about specifics relating to information given to the high-profile investors.
"Did you review projections, financial projections, that were sent to Rupert Murdoch?" SEC attorney Rahul Kolhatkar asked Holmes in the deposition. "I've seen them," Holmes said. "I guess, before they were sent out to Mr. Murdoch, did you review those projections?" Kolhatkar asked. "I don't remember, but I've seen the documents," Holmes replied.
Holmes settled the SEC lawsuit, agreeing to pay a $500,000 fine and not serve as director or officer of a public company for ten years. As part of the settlement, Holmes neither admitted nor denied the allegations.
A key answer during the SEC deposition came during questioning about the Theranos contract with Walgreens.
Asked if she were the decision maker at Theranos and if she signed the contract, Holmes told SEC lawyers: "I did. I signed many of the Walgreens agreements. I don't know if I signed all of them. And yes. I mean, I'm the CEO. I'm the ultimate decision maker for the company."
Legal experts say that sworn testimony may come back to haunt Holmes if she does testify.
"The risk in calling a defendant is that if the jury finds even a tiny portion of her testimony to be dishonest, they will likely consider her completely dishonest," Cevallos said.
Referring to the Latin phrase Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, Cevallos said "a liar in one thing is a liar in all things."

★ What Happened with the Filibuster. The Republican minority blocked several of President Obama’s judicial-court nominees, Senator Harry Reid on November 21, 2013 invoked the so-called "Nuclear" option and changed a 200 year hallowed Senate rule, meaning a simple majority vote will suffice for all nominees except for the Supreme Court, a rule that was implemented almost since the inception of the Country, over some 220 years ago.
★ Why Democrats took this Historical Adverse Action. As of March 2013, President Barack Obama has nominated over two hundred individuals for federal judgeships. Of these nominations, Congress confirmed 181 judgeships (173 during 111th & 112th Congresses and 9 during the 113th Congress. Of the outstanding 87 Court Vacancies, 25 Nominees were pending Congressional review and 62 were awaiting Presidential nomination.
★ Our youth, and those under 50, are becoming very concerned with our Government’s leadership, not being truthful, particularly with the promise of ObamaCare… "…if you like your Health Care Insurance you can keep it, Period. (With no ifs ands or buts.) and… if you like your Doctor you can keep your Doctor, Period. I guarantee it…" so said President Obama with his speeches selling ObamaCare to the Public.
★ 42 Months after the passage of ObamaCare, with the LAW being implemented, with over 5.5 million Americans receiving Health Insurance Policy Cancellations, dictated by the Law directly, as subsequent Regulation virtually eliminated any chance of the "Grand Fathering" of existing Health Care Policies. As of the 3rd week of November, 2013 there have been 5,518,000 American Families that have received Policy Cancellations due to ObamaCare.
★ For all Americans, the failure of the
✔ObamaCare Web-Site is just the "tip of the proverbial Iceberg" as the failure the simple registration of Folks looking in the Web-Pages, after taking
✔ 3 years to develop a WebSite that doesn’t work, at a
✔ ObamaCare WebSite Cost taxpayers over $600 million, is frightening start. Turn the Page forward a few months, how will the GOV be able to
✔ Dispense Health Care
✔ Approve a Medical Bill, if the GOV system cannot even take preliminary Registrations. These failures also include that
✔ObamaCare Policies have Monthly Premiums that are about 80% higher than their plans, the
✔ ObamaCare Co-Pays for Doctor Visits are increasing 400%, from a $25/visit to $100/visit, the
✔ ObamaCare Deductibles are increased from say $1000/year to over $4000/year.
★ Contradiction with the Facts. Seemingly, the Obama Administration could hardly complain about political partisanship when 62 of the 87 present judicial vacancies, over 71% of them, have not even been named nor nominated by the president.
★ Republican Senate Minority Reaction. This "is a false fight" is likely the reason that Senate Minority Leader, McConnell stated publicly that this sudden, significant, and historic "Rule Change," that was in effect for several hundred years, was in effort to divert attention away from the devastation affecting over 5 million American with the "roll-out" of ObamaCare. And in 2014, another 50 million American will also loose their existing Group Policies in compliance with the ObamaCare Law.
★ Editorial Remark. In the next weeks and months, notice the Administration’s Talking points used to refer to the ObamaCare act, this will suddenly change to the "Affordable Healthcare Act" a seeming paradox in its the face, as
(A) ObamaCare is Not Affordable (because for Millions of Americans monthly premiums are increasing by 80% or more, coupled with increased deductibles like to $4000/year or more, increased co-Pays from say $35/Doctor visit to $100/visit, decreased or elimination of access to Your Doctors, Cancellation of your chosen Insurance Plans, the reverse of which was promised by Obama since 2010, and
(B) ObamaCare has little to do with Health Care, other than destroying one of the best Health Care systems in the world, albeit the system it could be improved, without the total destruction of the delivery-system, and patient-doctor relationships.
★ Current Problem. As of July 30, 2012, six.
★ Many of the nominations expired with the adjournment of the 111th Congress, but all were renominated in the 112th Congress with the exception of Robert Chatigny. NPR commented on the pattern of delay for certain nominees in an August 4, 2011 article, stating that "Some of the longest waiting nominees, Louis Butler of Wisconsin, Charles Bernard Day of Maryland and Edward Dumont of Washington happen to be black or openly gay".
★ The nominations of Day and DuMont were eventually withdrawn. Senator Grassley commented more nominees could have been confirmed had President Obama respected recess appointment precedent by not making recess appointments while the Senate is in session. Although President Obama has never used a recess appointment to appoint a nominee to the federal bench, he had appointed some executive agency officials in January 2012.
★ Invocation of the "Nuclear" Option by the Democrats of the Senate: As a response to the blocking of several of President Obama’s nominees, Sen. Harry Reid on November 21, 2013 invoked the so-called "Nuclear" option by changing the Senate rules; This means with a simple Partisan majority vote of 51 votes of 100, will suffice for all nominees to be confirmed, except for the Supreme Court. This rule was implemented over 220 years ago.
★ This rule-change is referred as being "Nuclear" in that is represents total destruction of "biPartisanship, as there are no incentives to bring over any of the minorities members for a Vote on the matter at hand. In other words the Majority party can pass any such measures with only 51 o their Party Members, eliminating much of the "Debate" that has been considered very important in crafting better decisions and legislation. AND, since this hallowed 200 year-old (Rule 22) has been changed, watch-out, as the Majority Party can now pass other rule changes with only 51 votes of the Majority Party.
★ What is Rule 22? Rule. Rule 22 about 100 years ago, initially set the minimum requirement for ending debate at a 2/3rds (generally 67 votes) of those “present and voting.” When debate is stopped in this manner it is known formally as enacting “cloture.”
★ Some 60 years Later the Senate modified the cloture requirement, lowering the number of Senators needed to End debate to 3/5ths of those “duly chosen and sworn” (60 votes generally). Because enacting cloture is the only way to stop a filibuster, and because the minority party "almost always" has the 41 votes to sustain a filibuster in the Senate, Rule 22 is widely considered the most important standing rule in either the House or Senate.
★ Some More History..
★.
★.
★ In sum, consider this, it may be that the current Administration’s nominations are just so "far-Left" that consensus and bipartisanship has been very hard to swallow even for moderates in both political parties.

You may also want to check to see if your local service offers more than just the standard commercial carpet cleaning prices that are listed above. There are two basic types of cleaning methods, and many companies offer more than just one. First, encapsulation cleaning is when hot water extraction is used to remove soil and stains from carpets. Second, dry cleaning is when the carpet is vacuumed only, without the use of a wet cleaning solution. With all of these different cleaning methods, there are many differences in costs, depending on which method is chosen.Implementing healthy habits in the workplace is the cornerstone for improving productivity, concentration and ensuring long term health and wellbeing.

VideoVideoLil’ Man loves him some waffles. And pancakes. Pretty much anything hot that he can have slathered in butter.
Recently the awesome folks over at Nicole’s Natural’s offered me a canister of their gluten-free waffle and pancake mix to try out. We’re not a GF family due to allergies or sensitivities, but I love trying new products, especially new breakfast products!
What I really liked about these waffles is that despite being Gluten Free, they cook up super crispy. They contain brown rice, corn meal, and GF oatmeal, all of which gives the waffles an amazing texture. Even when I re-heated some the next morning in the toaster oven, they stayed crispy, as if I just made them!
Each 22 ounce canister makes about 8-10 waffles, depending on your waffle iron size and how thick you like your batter. I got 12 waffles out of the mix, but I added a little extra milk because the batter was a little too thick towards the end of the bowl.
All you add to the mix is water (or milk of your choice), melted butter or coconut oil, and eggs. It’s easy peasy.
Nicole’s Naturals Mix:
- Is Gluten-, Wheat-, Dairy- and Soy-Free (but definitely not taste-free!)
- Contains 150 calories per serving
- Has only one gram of sugar (much less than other mixes that contain upwards of nine grams per serving) and two grams of fiber
- Is independently tested at less than five parts gluten per million, far below the FDA regulation of 20 parts per million for products labeled gluten-free.
12 waffles is a bit much for the three of us, so after we had eaten, I cut up the remaining waffles into quarters, let them cool and put them into a freezer bag. The next morning we enjoyed them again after a quick trip through the toaster oven.
San Diego Residents can find Nicole’s Natural’s at the following stores:
- Keil’s Food Store – Jackson
- Keil’s Food Store – Clairmont
- Krisp Beverages and Natural Foods – Downtown San Diego
- Harvest Ranch Market – Encinitas, CA
For those not in the immediate area, you can find this fabu mix online at Amazon or at.
I was given a canister of Nicole’s Naturals gluten-free waffle and pancake mix at no charge to facilitate my review, however I was not financially compensated for my review.Today I am here with Fabio Holanda. Fabio is one of the main guys with Brazilian Top Team, he is the owner of BTT Montreal in Canada. Fabio’s favorite position in Jiu Jitsu is the Kimura. Fabio has taught his way of finishing the Kimura to a lot of famous MMA guys, he even taught it to the world-famous George St. Pierre. Fabio has had a really good career in Jiu Jitsu as well and today he is going to show us how he finished the Kimura from side control below, also you can check out my breakdown of the technique below.
Breakdown of How to Perfect the Kimura by Fabio Holanda:
Guys I really enjoy this position, I made a seminar at Fabio’s school a few years ago and one of the things I asked him was how to finish the Kimura from side control. I have always had a very hard time with it but once I saw his details my Kimura got way better.
Some of the things that really helped me that Fabio showed was the fact that he places so much weight on the shoulder. This really helps to pin your opponent, I also found that when I bring their elbow really high like Fabio showed above it helps me a lot.
One of the main things Fabio does that is very important is once he gets the Kimura grip, he always puts my hand on the ground. It is not just that he puts my hand on the ground, Fabio also puts all of his weight on my shoulder which makes it very difficult for me to move and the Kimura becomes hard to escape. After that he pulls my elbow high almost above my shoulder and then it is really easy to finish.
I think these little details are what make Fabio’s Kimura the best. These are the kind of details nobody else shows
and they are important when you are going against a tough guy. Anyways guys, I hope you enjoyed, also, don’t forget to download my free E-Book here. I really think this can help you with your bjj!
Also, check out my DVD “Battle Tested Pressure Passing.” When I do my seminars this is what so many people ask me about and in this DVD I give all of my entries, and tricks to finish the passes! OSSSSSSCaffe: Marriott Renaissance M Street Hotel
1143 New Hampshire Ave NW
Washington, DC 20037
(202) 775-0800
Caffe is the name of the coffee concept boutique coffee shop located within the Marriott Renaissance Hotel in the West End of NW Washington, D.C. This was the first of several shops opened in the last three years that exclusively sell Illy coffee and their designer products (namely their fancy hand painted espresso cups/plates and pods). Although not my first choice for espresso in most cases, every time I’ve had a cup of Illy at this M Street location, I have been thoroughly pleased. The dark, complex and caramel-like finish of the typical Illy espresso is a proven winner. The true to form syrupy crema that commonly accompanies a well made Italian espresso consistently shines through here and, based on third-hand accounts, their cappuccinos are also well-made.
This is definitely not a place to sit down and work, eat a meal or chat for too long with friends. Keeping in the typical Italian espresso bar tradition, there is only a standing counter along the windows of this petite shop where one is able to down their drink and continue on. Not too linger friendly here. Not to worry, just a quick walk through the into the adjoined restaurant (also part of the Marriott Renaissance Hotel) and you can begin an entirely separate dining experience.
In short, although this is not a place for much more than a quick coffee on the go – it is a quality coffee drinking experience and is worth a stop if you’re in the area and desire a quality made coffee drink. The iced latte I had here in Summer 2010 was probably the best I’ve ever had. Try getting a simlilar experience across the street at Starbucks — simply unheard of.
I like the cup (seen above) so much that I asked to purchase it. I was pleased to find out that they happily sell the cup/plate/spoon sets used for a little under $10.

Our.
While computer scientists are concerned about the increasing computational demands on computing capacity, storage, and communications – which are reaching the limitations of physical laws in terms of reliability and economics, social scientists have not yet been able to fully grasp the social and ethical implications of the existing computing paradigms and the implications of big data and automated decision-making systems. The question is not only how far the automation of governance will (and should) develop with the powerful new computing alternatives, such as quantum, bio-inspired, and crowd computing, but what the socially destructive consequences of big data and automated decision-making systems already at work in contemporary surveillance-based capitalist societies are. We can already witness discrimination against the less affluent and less powerful parts of the population in several domains, e.g. in insurance, education, and employment including the crime and security domain. Furthermore, we can witness distortions of democratic processes, such as general elections. Similar to the mass-scale emotional contagion of Facebook users in a now infamous experiment, millions of individuals have been involved in a sort of “political contagion” for various political ends based on social network data, as revealed by the Cambridge Analytica whistle-blowers in 2018.
The crime and security domain
Automated decision-making processes strongly infringe upon fundamental liberties in policing and criminal justice settings as these actors have been granted a monopoly over the use of physical force. In the centuries of the post-Enlightenment era, very nuanced legal concepts and procedures have been designed to regulate the use of this force – we can trace this all the way back to Beccaria’s seminal treatise On Crimes and Punishments from 1764. What is at stake with automated decision-making processes based on AI is the very foundation of the legal procedures and concepts designed to regulate the use of physical force. Today, law enforcement agencies no longer just operate in the paradigm of the ex-post facto punishment system based on manifested criminal acts. They instead employ ex ante preventive measures based on assumed psychological states. For instance, the notion of a “sleeping terrorist” in post-9/11 German anti-terrorist legislation is a prominent example involving such “algorithmic” identification of a “target”. The law criminalised remote preparatory criminal activities (and was subsequently struck down by the Federal Constitutional Court).
When law enforcement and intelligence agencies stockpile data – or outsource the harvesting of data to internet or telecom behemoths in exchange for a lenient regulatory regime – for profiling purposes or to predict the place and time of future locus delicti commissi, the boundaries between the concepts of a “suspect”, an “accused”, and a “convict” begin to dissolve. When predictive policing software uses crime statistics on all types of crime, petty and nuisance crime gains more attention than “white-collar crime”. Low-level crime might help PredPol predict mapping coordinates for serious crimes, but this comes at the cost of “a nasty feedback loop”. The focus of police is disproportionally devoted to minorities, which as a result are “over-policed”: with an increased focus on specific groups, the police discover more crime and in turn more data is generated to amplify the need for policing. Financial crime or other white-collar crime committed by the affluent financial elite then disproportionally falls under the radar compared to the scale of the damage resulting therefrom.
In criminal justice settings, criminal courts and probation commissions are also increasingly using AI decision-making tools to predict the future crimes of those awaiting trial and parole, or to predict unwillingness to collaborate with authorities in bail and parole procedures. For instance, the Arnold Foundation algorithm, which is being used in 21 jurisdictions in the USA, uses 1.5 million criminal cases to predict defendants’ behaviour. Similarly, a study of 1.36 million pre-trail detention cases conducted by Stanford University scholars purports that a computer can predict whether a suspect will flee or re-offend better than a human judge.
Data sets and algorithms are human artefacts. Automated decision systems may thus severely magnify human errors and flaws. Similar to “flash crashes” in algorithmically enhanced finance settings or “high-frequency trading”, when 99% of a share’s value can be wiped out in a matter of minutes, automated decision systems can disproportionately send certain groups to prison. Relying too heavily on automated calculations of risk can set in motion a vicious circle of bad decisions and exacerbate and magnify existing social problems.
For instance, in a detailed assessment of the COMPAS recidivism algorithm, ProPublica discovered how the system is biased against black individuals. In fact, several scholars have warned how “automated governance” or “algorithmic governmentality” can lead to “social sorting on steroids”. This has already encroached on fundamental liberties, such as the right to non-discrimination. It will inevitably reproduce inequality as data is collected from societies that are divided along economic, racial, gender, and ethnic lines. In criminal justice settings, AI is undermining the equality of arms in judicial proceedings, as well as the right to a fair trial, i.e. the right to a natural judge and the right to an independent and impartial tribunal. In balancing fairness and efficacy, the constitutional framing of liberal criminal procedure has always inclined to fairness: it is better to let ten criminals escape prison than to sentence one innocent person to jail. This has long been one of the main distinction between authoritarian and democratic political systems.
From democracy to “algocracy”?
The mentioned Facebook experiment regarding the massive-scale emotional contagion of its users clearly demonstrated how powerful tools induce mood and sentiment. The recent Cambridge Analytica case showed how powerful tools also exist for inducing “political contagion” as to the public at large. “Automated justice” is thus only part of a wider trend towards “automated governance” that can distort democratic processes. What is at stake with the advent of automated decision-making tools based on AI is the rule of law, which is slowly being substituted for by the “rule of the algorithm”, as well as democracy itself, which may be replaced by “algocracy”.

Dirty IndiansI was upstairs tidying my sons room when my mother called me, “Kavita, where are you? Uncle Shahid will be coming soon. I need your help in the kitchen.”Uncle Shahid was not a real uncle. He was my father’s old business partner. My father passed away a few years ago. My mother had a fondness for Uncle Shahid. He was a close family friend and now that my father was no longer with us he had become closer to my mother. He had helped my brother get a job when he was struggling and my mother was very grateful to him.I went down to help my mother in the kitchen. I said, “Everything seems to be done. Why did you call me?”I sounded petulant as I did not like my mother constantly ordering me around as my mother seemed to have everything in hand and she did not need me there. But I soon realised why she asked me to come down, “I wanted to talk to you before your uncle arrives. It has now been over 5 years since your divorce and you need to think about a new marriage. Your son is growing up without a father figure. You are not getting any younger at 30. Shahid bhai knows people and you need to make a good impression. He may be able to introduce you to someone.”My mother had a habit of constantly reminding me about my divorce. My ex-husband was a gambler and an alcoholic and I was happy to be divorced. But in the Indian community I was now a pariah and considered damaged goods. Men were not interested in marrying someone with a c***d and a trouble maker ex. I simply had too much baggage and no one was interested in a marriage yo me.I had initially been a bit depressed and put on a lot of weight but now I was getting my life back together. The hardest part was living with my mother again. My mother was traditional and she constantly reminded me of my need to be married.I didn’t miss marriage as much as I missed the sex. My ex was a good for nothing loser but I had really enjoyed the sex when he could get it up and was not too drunk. I now had to rely on my vibrator for my orgasms but I missed a hard cock pounding into me. Enough of that. I didn’t want to get worked up as it was not gonna change anytime soon as men did not have much interest in me.I told my mother, “Men do not want the responsibility of a son that is not their own. It is simple I will not be getting married any time soon.”My mother shook her head, “Do not lose hope. Now go set the table. He called to say he was on the way.”I would actually settle for a good hard fuck and let go of the martiage idea just for one night but it was hard to find a man who would be discrete enough for that.Uncle turned up 30 minutes later. He was beaming with a smile as he saw me and my mother. He hugged us both as he greeted us. He asked about my brother but I explained he was already out.Uncle Shahid was around 62. He was still very active in business and had many endeavours going on at any one time.He was a short pudgy man but he had charm on his side. His wife had passed away a few years ago and I noticed a change in the way he looked at me since then.I sat him down at the dining table. My mother was in the kitchen finishing the dishes. He looked over at me and said, “Kavita. How is Arun? He must be 8 now?”I smiled at his caring nature, “Yes. He is very good and well behaved. He is asleep now as it is his bedtime.”He said, “You were always a good c***d. If he is anything like you he will grow up to be very sensible. How are you keeping? You look very good. You have lost a lot of weight in the right places. What is your secret?”He looked me up and down as he said this. There was a lecherous vibe to his look but I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I also liked being flattered and he was certainly charming. I said, “I have started yoga classes and I have been taking new diet pills.”He was looking again but this time his eyes rested on my breasts as he said, “Well I must admit it is certainly working. You are positively stunning. It is a shame that you are not married. It is such a waste to see you not being fulfilled.”I did not know what to make of what he said but it was more than just a simple compliment, I just replied, “men do not want the responsibility of a c***d.” It seemed to be an easy excuse.He said, “You need to find a real man.”I did not have time to ponder the meaning as my mother came out with dishes. I went into the kitchen to help bring in the last few dishes. I felt my breathing really laboured pendik escort as I was in the kitchen. My exchange with Uncle Shahid had got me all flustered. I steadied myself and went back in.Uncle Shahid and my mother were laughing as I joined them. The conversation did not seem to have the same tone with my mother in the room but I kept catching Uncle Shahid glancing over at me.My mother then caused me great embarrassment, “Shahid bhai, can you help Kavita find a husband? I have tried everyone but I simply have had no luck.”My mother made me sound like a lost cause, which I probably was. Uncle Shahid then said, ‘I am always looking out for Kavita. She is a beautiful woman. She tells me she started yoga. You know I need to do some yoga. In my old age my body needs to stretch but I do notwant to go to a class. Kavita can you help me?”I liked how he sensed my discomfort and was able to change the topic. I replied, “Yes. I have learned a lot and I am happy to share it with you.”He said, “Why don’t you come this Saturday and you can show me what I need to do.”I readily agreed, “Yes Uncle Shahid I will come on Saturday.”He said, “You can now call me just Shahid. You are a grown woman.” He was looking at my chest as he said this but luckily my mother did not notice.Shahid left shortly after. His attention on my breasts made me self conscious. After I stopped breast feeding my son my breasts lost their firm shape and sagged. But since I had started taking the diet pills they returned to the previous firm shape. My bra size also increased to double E cup.Before I went to bed I went to the mirror and undressed. I unclasped my bra and my breasts fell into view. My skin was a dark brown. Another reason my mother put down to me not being able to find a man. My nipples were a deep dark brown. A dark chocolate colour. I started cupping my breasts as I felt their firmness. I began squeezing gently as I thought back to tonight. I imagined Uncle Shahid looking at my body with my breasts exposed with his lecherous eyes. Is this what he really wanted to see everytime he looked over at me? Was he talking about my breasts when he talked about losing weight in the right places?What did he mean by it is a “waste”. What is a waste? The fact that a man can not enjoy this body. Am I wasting this body by not sharing it with a man?What did he mean by a “real man”? How do I find a real man? What would he do? Bend me over and fuck me till I scream his name? Is that a “real man”?I was rolling my nipples between my fingers as my orgasm was building. I had never been so turned on by just playing with my breasts.Was he a “real man”? How would he fuck me? Would he spank me? He was old enough to be my father. Why was I having such lustful and filthy thoughts about him?I was so turned on and I collapsed to my knees as I came from just playing with my breasts. As I came I felt a white liquid spray from my breasts.I used my fingers to bring it to my mouth and it was breastmilk. I could not believe what was happening to my body. My body should not be producing milk. I should not be having these dirty thoughts about Shahid bhai.I went to sleep in a confused state. He was my father’s best friend. He was too old to be interested in me and I should not be thinking of him.That night my dreams were filled with lustful thoughts. In my dream I was being ravaged by a much older man. I was committing truly depraved acts and he was truly using my body. My pussy was burning with desire by the morning. My breasts seemed to create more milk the more turned on I was. This was embarrassing as I should not be producing milk anymore. But I loved the feeling of my breasts being so shapely. I had to make somr changes and I bought a breast pump that day. I was also wearing padding under my bras. The padding caused my breasts to seem even bigger.It was Friday night and I was thinking about seeing Shahid. The thought of being on my own with him was driving me crazy.I needed to masturbate just to keep me sane. I know he liked to look but I also know that he has always been very respectful so he may never actually do anything.I wanted to tease him to try and see what his limits were. I usually wear a t shirt and leggings for yoga. It is a women only class and I never really thought about what I had to wear. I wanted to tease him today so my clothes would be important. I wore normal clothes to his house but I took some white escort pendik leggings which seemed almost see through when stretched and a sports bra which would show my ample cleavage.When I turned up he was in just shorts and a t shirt. He gave me a hug as he greeted me and unlike last time he kept the hug a little longer and I felt the unmistakable feeling of his penis against my stomach. After my recent thoughts I did not need his penis so erect and in such close peoximity.He saw my gym bag and asked, “Will you need to be getting changed?”I said, “Yes. I need to wear something more comfortable. Where can I get changed?”He motioned towards the downstairs bathroom, “You can get changed in there. And I will be in the main living room. I have set the room up for our session”I went to the bathroom and got changed. The feeling of his throbbing erect penis had already got my breasts excited and milk was starting to produce. Luckily I had added extra padding this morning. I added a few more tissues to prevent any issues. I was wearing a black thong under my leggings. I wanted to make sure he saw it all and I was sure he would.I went back in a little nervous. He looked at me and he was open mouthed. As he stood up to greet me his erection was clear to see. The look had the desired effect.He commented, “You look amazing. The yoga has done wonders for your body. You are simply stunning. Take it easy on me, I am not a young man anymore.”We both sat on the floor in the sitting pose, “Don’t worry I will keep it simple. Just follow what I do.”I went through the simple stretches. Everytime I lifted my arms his eyes were drawn to my breasts. I then started to do the slightly more complex stretches. I was worried about diving into the planks and downward dog. But if I really wanted to tease him I needed to show him my downward dog.After about 20 minutes we were working up a sweat. I then said, “Uncle…Sorry I mean Shahid. The next few moves are quite difficult and straining. Do you want to just look?”He seemed to be glad to have the break. I went into my first plank. I could feel his eyes on my body. My breasts would be hanging down.I then moved into a downward dog. This was a hard pose to hold but I knew how my ass would be presented to him. He was looking intensely.He said, “This position looks to be the toughest. I think you are right. I may not be ready for this. Do you mind if I have a closer look at the position?”I replied, “Please look. It is important to understand the position so you can do it next time.”He got up and came behind me. He held my bare hips and ran his hands down the side of my legging covered legs. He then said, “It is a shame you are not married. Your body is being wasted.”As he said this his cock was pressing against my covered backside. It was those words again “wasted” and “shame”. I did not want to leave them just hanging in the air, “What do you mean by wasted?”He was gently grinding his penis into my ass. It was a subtle movement and nothing too obvious. He then took me by surprise, “Your body must be enjoyed by a man. It is a shame because you are made for breeding. Your good for nothing ex husband never appreciated what he had.”There was no ambiguity left by his comments. We both knew what he meant, “But no one will marry me now. My mother has tried for years.”My legs were struggling to hold on but his penis thrusting and grinding into me kept me going, “Your mother has been looking at the wrong men. You need a strong man who can take the responsibility of you and your c***d. A woman has needs and you need a man to take care of them.”I was close to cumming, “But where do I find such a man?”I could not hold any longer as I had a leg trembling orgasm and fell forward out of breath. The feel of a real cock against my body was too much.He helped me back up to a seated position. I felt him touch my breasts as he did so. I hoped he did not notice the padding.My collapse had lost the conversation, “That seems like the toughest position. Next week we can try together.”I liked him behind me in that position. But I was looking forward to the next week. I went to the bathroom to change into my normal clothes.My leggings and thong were plastered to my skin as they were soaked through. My padding had been soaked through in my sports bra. I made do with tissues. I was glad to have a change of clothes.As I left we hugged again but this time he squeezed pendik escort bayan my ass in a confident manner. Our relationship was beginning to change.It had been a few days and I had not heard from him. I could not stop thinking about our yoga session. It was the first time in a long time that I had an orgasm by a man. Did he even know? Was he even interested?It was Wednesday and there was not even a message. As I was getting into bed I decided to message him if he would not message me;-Kavita: Hi. I just wanted to check you are still free for yoga on Saturday?He did not reply straight away. I was sat looking at my phone screen waiting for his reply.It came after what seemed an eternity but was only 30 minutes.Shahid: Yes, definitely. I have not had a work out like that in a long time. I enjoyed it.I finally had his attention and I replied straight away.Kavita: I really enjoyed it too. You picked it up quickly.Shahid: I am not as good as you. Especially when you did the downward dog. You looked good enough to eat. Where are you?What did he mean by that? He was making so many strange comments recently.Kavita: I am in bed. Can I ask you something?Shahid: I am in bed also. Do you want to sleep? It is late. You can ask me anything.Kavita: i do not want to sleep. I just want to talk to you. Can you talk or do you need to sleep?Shahid: I can not sleep when I have a beautiful woman wanting to talk to me. Ask me anything.He knew how to compliment a lady.Kavita: What did you mean by my mother is looking for the wrong men?Shahid: Your mother is looking at young men. They are too immature for a woman like you. You need an older man.I had never thought of an older man before as marriage material. Maybe that is where I was going wrong. But recent interactions with Shahid had made me consider an older man in a sexual way.Kavita: I had never thought about an older man before. Do you wear your shorts and t shirt to bed?I regretted that message. He will be wondering why I was interested in what he wore to bed.Shahid: No. Unfortunately not. I sleep naked. A habit I have now developed. What do you wear to bed?That answer had certainly increased the temperature in my bed. My free hand immediately went to my breast and began teasing my nipple under my nightie.Kavita: I am wearing a silk nightie. It is red. And a red thong under it. I eagerly anticipated his reaction.Shahid: You looked hot in your yoga outfit. But you sound incredibly sexy right now. Your body is being wasted. You need a man to use it.There was no hidden meaning any more. He was saying what he meant. Every time he talked about my body being wasted made me yearn for sex. It made my body hot. My free hand was now in thong as I fingered myself. My milk was leaking into my nightie. He was driving me crazy with lust.Kavita: What did you like about my yoga outfit? Just be honest and I will be honest.Shahid: I liked your big tits and deep cleavage. I liked your black thong. You didn’t need the leggings as they were practically see through when you stretched. What did you enjoy about the yoga? Your turn to be honest.He was not holding back with his messages. I could ruin him by showing these messages to anyone. But I was more interested in keeping his attention and now it was my turn to be honest.Kavita: My orgasm when you were grinding against me in downward dog. My first orgasm by a man in over 5 years. What are you doing right now?Shahid: I am stroking my cock thinking about your big tits and juicy pussy. How many fingers are in your cunt right now?He was not holding back anymore. His labguage drove me crazy. I could not believe he said the c word. How did he know I was fingering my pussy? Kavita: One finger. How big is your dick? Send me a picture.Shahid: Add another finger and thrust harder. It is 7 inches. If I send a picture it will be yoir second orgasm by my cock in less than a week.I inserted two fingers as my pussy. My pussy was squelching as I fingered myself harder.Kavita: Please send it xxHe finally sent and I came burying my face into the pillow to muffle screamsI kept reading the messages and came multiple times until Saturday finally arrived.I carefully chose what to wear again. I wore black tights over my red thong this time. They were thinner and more see through than the leggings. I kept my same sports bra.I arrived at the same time and he was in the same attire as last time. Shorts and a t shirt.He hugged me but this time he groped my ass more freely. I went to get changed. When I came out of the bathroom I paid close attention to his reaction. His eyes were so intense on my legs and thong which was clearly visible.

I was learning to drive when the Sandra Bland case happened. Bland was pulled over in Texas for not signaling in time. The situation quickly escalated when she would not get out of her vehicle and the officer threatened to use a stun gun on her. Three days later? Bland was found dead in her jail cell.
This was the first time I feared the reality of being a disabled black kid in a nice car with braids down to my waist, learning to drive on Long Island. This was the first time I realized my skin color could lead me to be the next Sandra Bland.
I never got my license.
As the video that Sandra Bland took of her arrest comes to light four years later, a new hesitance arises. Why would a ticket for a traffic violation lead to a suicide? Why did it take four years for this video to be publicly released? Why did Waller County jail fail to provide adequate mental health training, or perform timely checks, or do any of the other million things that could have prevented the death of an outspoken black advocate with epilepsy?
I too, like Sandra Bland, am a disabled black activist. Even with an education behind me and living as a writer in New York, I am still as afraid today as I was in my late teens, if not more so.
I am not afraid to be black, but I am afraid that my blackness will be seen as a target. My fear isn’t irrational. The same fear guides and directs the actions that the majority of black people take.
We all have heard the warnings from our fathers, mothers and aunties. We all know: Drive slower in the Deep South, don’t drive around primarily white areas alone at night, don’t engage with the police if you can avoid it, don’t sag your pants, don’t talk “too black,” don’t sell loosies on the corner, don’t wear a hoodie, don’t walk around your own neighborhood with Skittles and Arizona Iced Tea. Don’t. Don’t. Don’t.
I belong to a culture of preventing my own death through hesitation and careful planning, tip-toeing around whiteness and the police, not rocking the boat. I don’t have a choice in the matter. Yet sometimes, those preventive methods fail. It is a horrible, restrictive way to live, to be constantly afraid because of who you are.
It is a trauma that black bodies before me felt, even as they lived their lives to try to prevent that experience for my generation. I know I will likely have a conversation with my future sons about the police, the same conversation my brother Collin had, the same conversation my father had, and my grandfather had.
In my first interaction with the police at age 13, I was dismissed as “trouble” when I tried to report sexual harassment. As two white police officers told me that I was “well developed” for my age and that’s likely why an older man tried to touch me, I realized that I was part of a communal blackness. Not the deep-rooted heritage of cookouts and culture, but rather the collective fear based on how the outside world perceives us at first glance.
I haven’t trusted the police since. I don’t know if I ever will.
Nearly all young black boys have a conversation with their parents about how to deal with the police. Nearly all black people drive differently in the South. Nearly all black people fear becoming Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice, Philando Castile or another martyred someone who died because of their blackness.
Don’t bring attention to yourself, and most likely you won’t die. This is the norm of being black in America, and it’s fucking exhausting.
That exhaustion changes our life. Hearts racing when we see police or decline to engage with white women who will weaponize our race as a threat, we have to navigate blackness in a world designed for whiteness. My success will always be attributed to affirmative action by white people, my failure will always be blamed on my blackness. No matter what, in a white hegemony, I cannot win.
I am tired of making my blackness palatable to white individuals, the police and the world. I’ve been tired for years. My future children will be tired, my brothers and sisters are tired, and my father as well.
There needs to be major, systematic reform so that black children, black women, black people with disabilities, and black men are no longer being killed by police, white supremacists and neighborhood watchmen without accountability. The least we can do is #SayHerName. For Sandra Bland, for the countless other black bodies that have been snuffed out by a culture that devalues our lives, for the countless black children to come, we must demand change.

Abstract
OBJECTIVE The aim of the present study is to compare the survival of patients attending diabetes centers with that of patients exclusively consulting family physicians.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The study was carried out in the frame of the Verona Diabetes Study, a population-based survey of known diabetes prevalence with a subsequent 5-year mortality follow-up. A cohort of 7,488 diabetic patients were identified on 31 December 1986 from three diﬀerent sources: a drug consumption database, family physicians, and diabetes centers (one for children and one for adults). As of 31 December 1986, 3,288 patients in the entire cohort exclusively consulted their own family physicians, while 4,200 patients also had periodic examinations at the diabetes centers. The life status of the diabetic cohort was ascertained on 31 December 1991.
RESULTS Compared with the nondiabetic population, diabetic patients seen only by family physicians had a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 1.62 (95% CI 1.51–1.74), while patients attending both family physicians and diabetes centers showed an SMR of 1.44 (1.34–1.54), the difference being statistically significant (P = 0.017). The 5-year survival probability, estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, was 0.76 (0.75–0.78) in patients seen only by family physicians and 0.81 (0.80–0.82) in patients attending the diabetes centers. Multivariate analysis by Cox regression model showed that attending the diabetes centers was an independent predictor of survival even after adjusting for sex, age, and therapy of diabetes. The relative risk of 5-year all-cause mortality amounted to 0.83 (0.75–0.92) in patients also attending the diabetes centers with respect to patients consulting only family physicians (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS These data on patients' survival indicate that diabetes centers play a crucial role in diabetes care. As a corollary, an integration between primary-care physicians and diabetes centers is strongly recommended.

Food
There was a lot of time spent figuring out what we would have. For starters I went for the Bell & Felix pulled brisket chilli nachos with sour cream and salsa. Mr EmmaEats went for chicken satay skewers, peanut sauce, warm noodle salad with pickled chilli. Both the dishes were lovely, I really thought that the chicken satay was beautifully presented. The nachos were lovely and very indulgent, whereas Mr EE said his satay was lovely and light, he is still going on about how amazing his dish was.
For mains I had debated over getting the sweet potato and chickpea tagine or one of the specials, pork loin with black pudding mash and a cabbage, bacon and mustard cream sauce. As I was tossing this about in my head, Richard (the bell in Bell & Felix) said if it was him, he would go for the special as I could come back and have the tagine anytime. So it was decided, I went for the pork loin. Mr EE went for the breaded haddock goujons with pea puree, lemon mayo and french fries. Both our main courses were delicious, everything on my plate worked so well together and the black pudding mash was awesome. My only complaint was that it came out on a cold plate, but that didn't affect my dinner in anyway. Mr EE's haddock was great, that had been my first option but he got in there before me. The fish was perfectly done (and I think I will definitely have it when I'm back).
So next up was dessert, Mr EE decided he was going to be good and just have a coffee but I felt if I didn't have a dessert I'd only be half doing my job (well that's what I told myself), so I went for the salted caramel chocolate brownie and white chocolate ice cream. The chocolate brownie was amazing - the brownie itself was lovely but it was the salted caramel that did it for me. With every bite I would get a hit of the salted caramel and it was just delicious.
Food rating:- 4.5/5.
Service
The service was great, very attentive but not in your face. When I was being indecivise about which main to go for Richard was very helpful but not in a pushy or forceful way. Service rating:- 5/5.
Atmosphere
Whilst I would say that Bell & Felix is a warm, welcoming and friendly place, there is just something that I'm not sure about and I can't put my finger on it. It wasn't overly busy so maybe that was it, maybe it was lacking a bit of buzz! I love the back wall with Bell & Felix written on it, but I didn't take a picture as there were customers sitting underneath it! Atmosphere rating:- 4/5.
Price
So for this post I'm not going to rate the price given that I was invited to sample the food but it would appear that you certainly get great value for money and not only great value but good quality food too.
Last Words
I really like this place, it is such a great spot for dinner. I will definitely be back. There is something very homely and comforting about the food. Before I left I got talking to Richard and we had a lovely chat about Bell & Felix. I wish him and his team the very best with their new summer dinner menu. I haven't been here for brunch yet but I believe they do a great brunch and its so good you may even have to queue for it. Total rating:- 18 out of 20. (I converted the 13.5 out of 15 into a figure out of 20 so it would be in line with all my over reviews).

This is such a cool event space NYC and the atmosphere was equally amazing.On Monday night Cash Money Records mogul BirdMan had social media questioning if he and Kimora were an item when he sent out a photo of the two captioned the "luv of his life". It's looking as if that's not the case when Russell felt the need to be Kimora's unofficial spokes person and shut those rumors down via his twitter account. "She is happily married" to investment banker Tim.
So, what exactly was Birdman trying to do or say?New Patients

Following the lead of Ann Deegan we (myself and your Board of Directors) continued to implement the strategic plan. Our concentration was the introduction of an updated volunteer model. A model that focuses on the time you as a volunteer can commit, what tasks inspire you to assist and when it fits your schedule. The unveiling of the new Volunteer Center on the MSCPA website this month is the culmination of that process. Now your new President Annette Hill and Board of Directors challenge you to find your spot to fill on the Volunteer Center or simply sign up for the “pool.” The pool is for those of us who don’t see a spot that fits yet but definitely are up to a task, just waiting for it.
What else did the year entail?
- Social media presence enhanced
- University student outreach efforts increased
- First virtual board meeting conducted online
- Jane announced her retirement date of June 2017
- ED Succession Strike Force created
- CGMA designation opened for nonCPAs
- Continued tax advocacy at the Federal & State levels
- AICPA/CIMA joint venture vote
- Jane is diagnosed with cancer, has treatment and is in remission all in one board year—She ROCKS!
What’s my biggest “take away” this year?
Our profession is a great one! I mean it wholeheartedly. We have the opportunity to make a meaningful impact each day in our respective careers: public, business, industry, not-for-profit, governmental, education and so many other areas. The heart of what we learn as CPAs is valued and trusted throughout the world. We are sought after for the value we have to offer but we do have to work hard to maintain this position.
That “take away” was driven home for me by the terrific members of your Board of Directors who served this past year. Their commitment to our profession and the CPAs of Montana is outstanding. Thanks to each of them for their nimbleness as we changed up meetings, activities and our volunteer structure. The Directors provided thought provoking input and purposeful active participation which made this year successful. It was truly a pleasure to serve with them.
However, none of these outcomes would have occurred without the team at MSCPA. Jane, Margaret, Jean, Carol and Heidi provide tremendous support every step of the way. We are so lucky to have them!
I was inspired at the beginning of my career by several Past-Presidents of the MSCPA to set a goal of becoming President. The passion they showed for being a CPA and how they translated that passion into efforts aimed at keeping the MSCPA a relevant, supportive professional home for us throughout our careers was what motivated me. This was an awesome opportunity to be a part of that legacy and I am grateful for it. Thank you.

One custom function calculates the FCC Criterion, which was developed by F. Chiesa of the Universite de Trois-Rivieres in Quebec. This function was developed as an indicator of total evolved microporosity in aluminum castings. It has since been applied to other alloys with some success. This criterion is based on the solidus velocity (the speed with which the solidification wavefront moves through the casting) and the local solidification time (the time to cool from liquidus to solidus). Higher numbers indicate more probability of porosity. An example of an FCC plot is shown here:
Another Custom Criterion that is being developed is a gradient calculation for Solidification Time. This has been shown in several cases to be a predictor of hot tearing in some castings. Dendrite Arm Spacing(DAS) in aluminum castings is still another custom criterion.
As these new functions are created, they will be made available to all SOLIDCast users.
Note: A full description of the FCC Criterion and how to use it is given in Unit 41.ADA Compliance

According to the country’s health ministry, 266,760 more jabs of the German-American vaccine were delivered to Kazakhstan last week as part of the purchase agreement signed in October 2021. The first batch of 379,000 jabs arrived in mid-November.
A total of 4,230,000 shots should be sent to Kazakhstan under the agreement.
Earlier this month, Marat Shoranov, the country’s vice minister of healthcare, said the vaccine would be distributed among all regions in proportion to their population size in the same way as other vaccines. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is used to voluntarily vaccinate those in a vulnerable group, including adolescents and pregnant women.
Pfizer-BioNTech, also known by the brand name Comirnaty, became the first vaccine to receive emergency use listing from the World Health Organization (WHO) in December 2020. Each dose of Pfizer-BioNTech contains ten micrograms of messenger RNA (mRNA) that ‘teaches’ cells in the body how to create an immune response to the virus that causes Covid-19. The two-dose Covid-19 vaccine has demonstrated 95 percent efficacy against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and should be administered 21-28 days apart. Since the vaccine requires a particular storage temperature to maintain its quality and efficacy, special refrigeration equipment has been delivered to 16 regions of Kazakhstan.
Central Asia’s largest country has so far authorized Russia’s Sputnik V and Sputnik Light, Chinese CoronaVAC, as well as Hayat-Vax produced in the United Arab Emirates based on Sinopharm technology. In July, the country’s health authorities registered the Chinese Vero Cell vaccine. At the same time, the government purchased 2.97 million doses of the domestically manufactured QazVac Covid-19 vaccine.
As of November 24, 8.7 million Kazakhstanis have received the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while almost 8 million of them are fully vaccinated.
Covid-19 has infected more than 966,000 people and claimed more than 12,000 lives in Kazakhstan since the pandemic began in early 2020. Regions of the country are now divided into various zones — red, yellow, or green — depending on local disease activity.
Meanwhile, coronavirus disease is currently the number one cause of death across Europe and Central Asia, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported on Tuesday that cumulative reported deaths are projected to reach over 2.2 million by spring next year, based on current trends.
“Today, the COVID-19 situation across Europe and Central Asia is very serious. We face a challenging winter ahead, but we should not be without hope, because all of us – governments, health authorities, individuals – can take decisive action to stabilize the pandemic,” said Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe.Alan Hamel was born on 30 June 1936, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, of Jewish descent, and is a television host, producer, and entertainer, best known for co-hosting numerous television shows, including \u201cRazzle Dazzle\u201d and \u201cAnniversary Game\u201d.

Children like climbing on things, especially if there is something attractive up high. Household furniture like bookshelves, wardrobes, storage and entertainment units can be attractive to climb. So too is furniture such as tallboys or home office filing cabinets, where pulled-out drawers can act as stairs for climbing.
If tipped over, the weight of the unit and its contents become a lethal force.
The latest version of the AFA’s Toppling Furniture Prevention Best Practice Guide is now available.Readers in Galolen

out and living in poverty.
The Rules of the road, while traveling through life.
The people in our lives tell us what to do. They have carved in stone a building of laws.
These tribal laws are past down from generation to generation by word of mouth, as this
bundle of yarns roll, it picks up pieces of useful information.
We as children do not believe that these rules and laws are of much good, we rebel,
wanting to learn for ourselves.
Some children do learn in the first years of schooling, some children learn though trial and
error (Tomas is this example).
Dropping out and living in poverty is a good way to learn these laws the hard way, the
way that makes law understandable. You start out by scratching your butt in the woods,
completely lost in your total darkness. Then you learn to wash the crap off your hands.
Then you learn to build a fire for warmth and light, then you build a shelter for the winters
rain and snows. Pointed sticks from the fire for poking and digging in the earth. While
burning clay in the fire, you burn your hand, you are forming clay into tools. You draw a
smile in the flat clay tablet. You learn to bind wooden branches with vines. Sharp rocks
hurt your feet and you learn to scrape or pound with them. You eat whatever is available
and soon learn that some thing brings an ache to your knotted belly. You choose to eat
whatever does not hurt. In the back of your mind you come to understand the lessons
learned in the schools, the language to speak, the tools to create objects, the ability to
decide.
***
While you are learning, the great greedy machine rolls through the green lights. You want
to stop the machine, slow it down a little, teach it to watch for children. The machine
whines and says that it knows about children, as you quickly move the child out of the
way of this steaming breath.
To sway opinions
with voices of light.
A bit of sarcasm for you nostalgia buffs.
It may have been Pleasantville for you, but it was not for Pleasantville for me.

As families struggle under the weight of devastating job losses and economic uncertainty, many are faced with food insecurity. And COVID-19 continues to magnify the struggles this Holiday Season. As a result, our local food pantries are reporting a large increase in the number of households served, many seeking assistance for the first time. The demand continues to stretch their available resources. They need our help.
To help meet the need, FOX 14 and The CW have teamed up with Westco Home Furnishings for the 17th annual Feed the 4-States Food Drive. Westco Home Furnishings is accepting non-perishable food donations at its 11 locations. Your donations will be given to a Food Pantry in each community to make certain they reach those who need it the most.
We’ve also joined with Ozarks Food Harvest, Kansas Food Bank and the Community Food Bank of Eastern Oklahoma to help meet the need this Holiday Season. Monetary donations can be made by clicking on one of the links. When you give to a Food Bank, each dollar donated is stretched to provide up to four healthy meals.
The funds raised by each Food Bank will support the work of helping agencies in Southeast Kansas, Southwest Missouri or Northeast Oklahoma. Our neighbors, families and friends.
When there’s a need, the 4-State area always comes together. We can do it again. 4-States together.Spring Term 1967

Adam Croft is an audio professional working on technical audio implementation and programming for games. He is also a serial entrepreneur publishing books and online courses. In this episode of Getting Work To Work, we talk about Adam’s transformation from being a serial starter who never finished anything to becoming obsessed with completing projects, the value of consistency, his definition of a professional, the two types of goals and why most people should set bigger goals, and the importance of starting where you are.
Several quotes from this episode:
- “No matter where I go, I’m going to have to learn something brand new and just absorb everything as fast as I possibly can anyway.”
- “It’s something different to go and work versus talk about working or romanticize working or have an idea or whatever.”
- “The first time you do anything, you’re going to suck at it. It doesn’t matter if you’re writing or if you’re recording audio or video or photography…”
- “You can’t be on as many [social networks] as you possibly can and be consistent at one time because most people can’t manage a Twitter account.”
- “The idea is that you literally just show up, if you can, every day.”
- “The process of sales is sometimes described as the transfer of enthusiasm from one person to another.”
- “I can’t give you a specific roadmap because everybody’s creative destiny is different when they make art.”
- “Everybody wants the easy way out and the easy way out is to take the hard way. There’s no app, there’s no book, there’s nothing that is going to get you past sitting down and just working.”
- “The goal isn’t how many hits and how many views and how many people commented to me, the actual goal, the only thing I can control in all of that, is if I hit publish or not.”
- “The thing that is separating you from success is time.”
- “Your life starts in a lot of ways once you get out of debt because you don’t have the money stress as much anymore.”

Starting a new job can be very challenging for anyone. It’s never an easy experience, in fact the whole process is very tedious. From the job searching, job application and interview to starting the job itself. Most jobs require additional training before one is hired. These trainings are usually things you weren’t familiar with before, but can help you start up the job with much ease once learned.
Apply for the job training with the mindset that this what you’re going to be doing for a long time.
Pay good attention to the training lessons and try to practice anything learn immediately. Make additional research on the job descriptions so that you won’t be lost in the training. At least you will have good knowledge of what is being taught. One common mistake people make when they go for job trainings is believing they know it all already. Swallow your ego/pride and bend low to learn during a job training. After the training you’re good to go.
Staying motivated daily to do a job.
Motivation to work is something that can be very hard to a lot of people. Overtime, we tend to lose interest to do a particular work because we no longer find reason to go on. Below are ways to stay motivated daily to do your work.
1. Don’t think about your work as hard.
Try to see it as something you need to do to make a living. Without it you won’t eat nor pay bills. Seeing it as hard work will only make your daily bread harder to come by.
2. Set daily goals.
This is very important, as it will give you a challenge for the day. Something you need to work to meet up to. A daily standard. Once you have this goal set out every day you won’t find it hard to work. You will always thrive to meet your daily target no matter what.STARTING A BSUINESS RESIDUAL INCOME CLICK NOW
3. Learn to celebrate/reward success.
When you reach milestones, celebrate them. Reward yourself and/or colleagues. Let your celebrations motivate you to work harder for the next milestones. Rewards and celebrations are well known to motivate even the worst of us to try and do better in our tasks.HERE IS A BUSINESS YOU CAN START LESS THAN A $100.00
4. Read daily.
Learn to read daily, pick a chapter or couple of pages to complete before day’s end. Read it whenever you’re free (less busy) from your work. Once you make this a habit, you will be highly motivated to work daily because there’s always a great read awaiting you before and after work.

It never fails, I just start to feel like I’m getting comfortable in life….I start telling myself to relax and to enjoy the ride. Then the inevitable happens….I get bored! Kayla and I always like our glass full when it comes to life. We don’t handle idle time very well. Not to say we don’t relax, we just schedule it:) We live life with a very intentional purpose.
Below is a list of organizations I’m involved with or have been involved in in the past. Life is just so much more fun when you can be totally excited about something, learning, or giving back. These are the organizations that fill our souls.
North Point Community Church – When we moved to the Atlanta suburb of Alpharetta, we went church shopping. As with every move(we have moved a lot being military), we Google local churches and ask around. North Point kept coming up over and over. At first, it was overwhelming with so many people but we quickly found our people. The children’s ministry may be the best in the US!
Missouri University of Science and Technology – I graduated from this school in 2003 with a BS in Economics. It was such a great experience in my life! It was a struggle, I have very little money…often worked multiple jobs but I made it. I go back as often as I can but it’s never enough. I’ve recently started becoming more involved with the Alumni group.
Think Multifamily – In the summer of 2019, I was having a great problem to have. I always had far more private money than I needed to purchase and renovate houses and we became so fast in selling the homes that investors were asking us to invest their hard-earned dollars longer. I needed a solution and I found it with multifamily apartments. I could deploy private money longer, in larger amounts, and more friends and family could invest.
Gracie Jiu Jitsu – When we moved to Atlanta I wanted to learn a martial art that was the best in self-defense. At the time, I was hoping to travel more with my job to some not so safe countries. It never panned out but I found Gracie BJJ and the local affiliate Tiger Academy in Alpharetta. The Gracie family founded the Army’s Combative’s program and the UFC…so it was good enough for me:) If you’ve never tried it, it’s an amazing workout and might save your life!
Renaissance Periodization – I thought I knew how to work out and diet for performance. Not so much, the coaches at RP have helped me tremendously. Most of their coaches have Ph.D.’s and are athletes themselves. Multiple Olympic athletes have sought their advice.
*Note: We are very active in our children’s school and other activities, due to their privacy we do not post specifics…thanks!Search

High-lighting the sound of the 60''s with a 2011 flavor! AVAIL HOLLYWOOD "DRINKING AGAINI'm looking down towards the Washington Memorial which glories in its own reflection in the waterway which separates it from the Lincoln Memorial. Over to the left is the tragic memorial to those many thousands who gave their lives in the Vietnam war. And way over to the right, just visible through the trees, is the Jefferson Memorial. Any of you who have stood where I anm sitting now will realise what a special place this is.
It's a year since I last sat here, wondering what the next twelve months would bring. I sit here now thinking how lucky I am to live the life I lead, to have the family I love and the partner I will spend the rest of my life with. I look out at the Washington Memorial and see a great shining beacon of optimism. It's inspirational in its own rather abstract way.
I always leave America injected with the free spirit which is so prevalent here. It's as if I've had my annual fix of the "Ameri-drug". If you've ever been here you'll know what I mean. If you haven't, you'll think I'm babbling.
American politicians rarely complete a speech without uttering the words: "America IS the greatest country on earth. Sitting here now, I'd have to agree with them ...

From the defence of Conway to this, "America is the greatest country in the world" There are probably 4bn people in the world who do not agree with this unjustified comment. It is OK Iain, I appreciate some people do not travel that well.
Iain, you need to amend your penultimate paragraph for it to make sense.
I love that spot too - Must head back there soon.
Not sure I agree with your last but, well, not until Wales falls into the sea!
er Iain I think you mean "if you've EVER been here you'll know what I mean"
Gordons currently working on that last point.
Washington was one of the first planned capital cities. Its design, apart from supporting the type of government the US designed for itself was to intimidate visiting foreign leaders.
However only a few hundred yards away is a very different city. Indeed the parks in front of you are not safe.
I can remember listening to local radio out there just past midnight on new years day as they ran a waiting for the first murder of the new year - its was only a few minutes past midnight.
Still the underground doubles up as Nuclear blast shelters - so that's handy.
"America IS the greatest country on earth. Sitting here now, I'd have to agree with them ...
Except for England of course..."
I'd put Australia and Canada up there too.
That England is such a great country means that we don't need Brussels (or Scotland) to run it for us. The next decade must be about taking our country back.
Yes, and I remember that lovely scene when Forrest Gump's childhood sweetheart, Sally, recognises him amd they wade into the Reflecting Pool and embrace. Life sure is a box of chocolates. And America, despite all its acknowledged faults, certainly has good people in abundance who want to make things better. And that's what makes me, an Englishman first and only, think it's the next best thing to Canada over there.
Iain
I too have been moved by the view that you describe and very deeply regret how the last seven years has so reduced America's standing in the world. Change is ahead, thank goodness, but it will take a while fully to eliminate the venal effects of eight years of Bush and his junta.
Now I’m going to take issue with you. First it is ignorant and simplistic nonsense to talk about the “greatest country on earth” be it the USA or anywhere else. Like me I judge that you are well travelled and maybe you have also lived away from home. I lived overseas for much of the period 1980 – 2002, (in mainland Europe, the Far East and the Middle East) and I also travelled widely during this time (more than sixty different countries in fact). This taught me that whilst I am proud of my home country and would return there to live eventually (as I have) I absolutely do not think that it is the “best country” on the planet. It’s the best for me because I am British. It’s where my roots are and I am familiar with and like the culture and the way of life. But I would not arrogantly promote the idea that it is the “best”.
My second cavil is with your use of the descriptor “England” rather than “Britain”. We live in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland – that’s what it says on our Passports. We are British citizens. We are all richer for our historic and constitutional links with our Celtic cousins. Indeed for a man to imply that he is a citizen of “England” rather than of Britain diminishes him. There is nothing wrong with being English and proud of it – see me at Twickenham last Saturday for example! But I am even more proud of being British and find offensive the barely hidden anti Scottish/Welsh/ Northern Irish attitudes that are present in the rhetoric of some who relish in the idea of English nationalism. Long live the Union!
If Abraham Lincoln was and is such an inspiring figure of American folklore, then why were they still hanging blacks in the streets, 100 years later?
How come they have only just got rid of appartheid?
Please note that the black cook at Pearl Harbour was denied the Congressional medal of honour and awarded the silver star.
In itself, that should be overturned.

Which part of Stoke do you live in, Gary Elsby? I'm from Sandyford/Goldenhill. Regrettably! I'm going to move to Shropshire or B0ournemouth when I won the lottery. Thought about emigrating but I'd miss home too much. Though I might live in Canada for a few years, then go back.
Back to home news now, Iain! Outstanding!
If you tried such a thing in the UK you'd first have to dis-regard the litter and the grafitti no doubt adorning the said memorial plus of course you'd probably last all of 2 minutes at that time of night before being set upon by our indigenous youth and having your mobile and wallet nicked with a good few kicks to the head for good measure
Welcome back to Brown's Britain, Iain.
I first visited America last year, going to New York, Philadelphia, and Washington DC. Washington is the most beautiful place I've ever been: we spent an evening wlaking around the places you describe, Iain, and the sun was just setting on a warm, pretty, March day.
I know exactly what you mean, it's a hell of a place.
Paddy Briggs - The US is in someways what England could have been - without Scotland and Ireland.
The love of freedom was from English traditions and indeed the rebels in the war of independence enjoyed support in England as their cause was seen a just.
But then we got side tracked by the British Empire. Shame.
On an aside doesn't this look like a call to remove Gordon Brown by Charles Clarke ?
I would like to add that I am certainly not anti American, but I would prefer that American history is reserved the same right of address, that Americans do unto us.
Too many nice things are written of great american heroes. Abraham Lincoln had many qualities and much should be written about him. He also deserves his place in history and his role in 'saving the Union'.
However, it is total bullshit to suggest that Abraham freed slaves from the slavery that George Washington (freemason) helped to set up.
A person in the great Democratic model is not freed from slavery, when he can not use the same 'bathroom'as a white man.
American Democracy came after the atomic bomb fell on Nagasaki, and about 25 years later, to be more precise. In truth, JFK and Bobby bought the USA into my modern world.
And as you'll notice in the spat between Ted Kennedy and the Clinton's the other day, more is given to LBJ than is usually credited.
I'm not surprised that Ted stuck the boot into Hillary for this slight and I can't blame him for being peeved.
Maybe, Barack Obama would be in town, in 2008, if JFK had never existed, but facts are facts.
Black soldiers were burned alive in 1946 for being black and the rumour still persists that a whole regiment of black soldiers were shot in their own barracks when told they were not being demobbed.
Murder. Denied to this day that they ever existed and therefore not shot.
Abraham who?
Gary
The Tories should be engendering that feeling of freedom the lifting of oppression.
The rising Anti-Americanism in the UK (which Prince Andrew rightly mentioned) is in part a displaced version of english self-hatred.
I became increasingly anti-american during the Bush years and recognize I'm equally guilty of that displacement.
I can't help feeling that the lofty ideals of the founding fathers have never been fulfilled.
Therefore I consider Barack Obama to be an ideal President of the US. He talks a good game but we don't know if he'll follow it through. Indeed he did start his campaign by self conciously linking himself with Abe Lincoln.
US foreign policy tells everyone they should be optimistic about democracy and the sense of the 'global village'. Obama may go some way promoting those ideals inside the US itself.
But I'm guilty of displacement. UK democracy is at least as threatened as US democracy.
The latest threat is summarized by phrases such as: 'MPs should be bugged like everybody else'. The fallacies of which should be obvious.
No, the police shouldn't be able to bug MPs at will without ministerial and parliamentary oversight. Its completely insane.
In our system MPs must be protected from being spied on by government agencies, its a path to tyranny. I'm even willing to risk national security to protect that.
I don't say that lightly as my cousin was killed by Al Qaeda in the Bali bomb.
There is an adage that eventually you always turn into your enemy. I agree with that but would wish to postpone it as long as possible.
The only thing better than sitting on those steps as night falls is sitting on those steps with your arm around someone pretty...
Very nice.
I agree abou the dignified majesty of the Lincoln memorial. Nevertheless, while in the Atlantic Colonies you might not have seen yesterday's Brookes cartoon in the Daily Murdoch. It's the second down on the left:
America isn't all bad. I lived there for nearly three years, but then I have also lied in France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Belgium, and to be honest the US beats the the Netherlands but ranks about the same as Belgium.
Despite all the glamorous cities and opportunities, you don't have to look far to find people living in desperate poverty, far worse than anything in Europe.
They still have the death penalty, despite the number of murder convictions that have been found to be unsafe now that we have DNA evidence.
And the level of intimidation of suspects and plea bargaining in the American legal system, the apparent ability to secure a better outcome in the courts with a high priced lawyer etc. etc. do not inspire confidence.
If you think the US is the second greatest country on earth, then you should get out more.
"I always leave America injected with the free spirit which is so prevalent here."
Provided you're not homeless, black or in need of medical treatment which you cannot afford. You'll then find out that "free" just doesn't exist. You need to put those rose-coloured specs away. The grass is most definitely not greener on that side. You try living there rather than being a tourist for a few days.
America is the freest country in the world and I am its biggest fan. The people who sneer at it are, in the main, people who have never been there and breathed the intoxicating air of liberty there.
They can't imagine what its like and the bile of their petty resentment really is repulsive. Be glad that America exists. If it didn't, we would be living in a different world today and it would have been more like the USSR which, frankly, the British lefts tilts longingly towards anyway.
4:00 pm - I used to enjoy posts like yours because they're so full of bile and were good for a laugh, but, please, you America-haters, find something new to say - especially as everything you write is fantasy anyway.
Iain wrote: "I always leave America injected with the free spirit which is so prevalent here."
You wrote: "Provided you're not homeless, black or in need of medical treatment which you cannot afford. You'll then find out that "free" just doesn't exist."
Hmmmm - how very patronising. The black middle class is very large and is swelling. Obama, who I am sure you adore, is one such. So is his wife. There are millions more. Black doctors, black surgeons, black hospital administrators, black orthodontists, black lawyers,black judges blah blah blah blah blah.
Of course, those are the people who motivated themselves, just like their white counterparts. The white underclass has exactly the same mindset as the black career welfare recipient. Gimme.
Re "medical treatment they can't afford". Can't most people afford "free"?
Have you ever noticed that the streets in US cities and towns are not littered with the dead and the dying? Or do you think they clear them away for when movies are filming street scenes?
Yes, healthcare is very expensive, as it is in England, although the costs are hidden in your NI contributions (which by right you should be able to direct to the healthcare insurer of your choice, but that's another matter). But if you don't have the funds, you will be treated anyway.
If you have an accident or emergency, BY LAW the ambulance has to take you to the nearest hospital and BY LAW that hospital is required to treat you without asking about your ability to pay.
Once out of danger and stabilised, you will, quite rightly, be asked. If you cannot afford treatment in a private hospital, you will be transferred to a county facility. County hospitals in the US are on the same level, or a little better, as the British NHS.
You will be treated.
If you are employed (and don't forget, you're stable by now), you will be asked to sign an agreement to have monthly payments deducted from your salary. They may be small payments, but if you are able, you will have to pay, over a period of time, for your treatment.
If you are not employed and have no assets, you will be treated anyway.
I cannot see what you find so shocking about this.
Verity: “The intoxicating air of Liberty”
Indeed
• The liberty to be turned away from the Emergency wards because you are poor and don’t have health insurance - and then the liberty to die in the street.
• The liberty to use your corporate power to employ children in the third world in sweatshops to make your designer clothes.
• The liberty to ignore the opinions of much of the civilised world and, on fabricated pretexts, to invade countries with whom you have picked a quarrel.
• The liberty to shore up fascist regimes in a bid to promote your own specious ideologies.
• The liberty to discriminate against your own citizens on the grounds of race, colour and creed.
• The liberty to promulgate unhealthy food under clownish brands around the world in the pursuit of profit.
• The liberty to tell the rest of the world that they can go to hell and that you will continue to waste the world’s resources in your 4x4s.
• The liberty to say that despite all this you are the greatest nation on Earth…
Iain
You aspire to be a politician and yet you make the basic mistake of saying that England is the greatest country! Is that what it says on your passport --country of origin ---England? If so, I apologise but mine says Britain.
Verity, I commend you for reading, apparently believing and trying to spread the propaganda. Do you work for the Department of State? It would be funny if it wasn't so damn frightening.
paddy briggs. Thank you.
Verity, I am glad you took the effort to put the silly fool right.
All these people achieve is to show us their utter ignorance and spite.
However you cant exactly blame them for their utter stupidity when the BBC, half our politicians and Americans like Michael Moore keep telling lies, or are just as ill informed.
I have visited the states countless times, and I KNOW exactly what Iain is talking about and he is absolutely correct, in his gut feeling.
The things I dont like about the states are the same things I dont like about the UK.
Which are debt slavery and pointless fascist type rules and regulations. Especially the ones that only achieve a transfer of wealth from the people that worked for it, to the people that printed it, with interest.
The biggest problems the American people have are very much the same as ours.
Which are a vicious greedy dishonest and infinitely corrupt political class. Who seriously hate their own public and treat them with the contempt they believe they fully deserve.
Which very unfortunately they increasingly do.
Paddy Briggs
You make a habit of talking out of your ass and today is obviously business as usual.
The Americans have a saying, and it goes something like this.
Dont point the finger. Because when you do four fingers are really still pointing at yourself.
WE THE BRITISH invented the present capitalist and world trading system and it is us that have benefited from it most.
If you dont like the exploitation of third world children then only buy goods and services that you KNOW are made in your own country.
My goods, for example.
Otherwise you are just as guilty as you accuse the Americans of being. You can also add to that, giving up your pension and your cheap foreign holidays, if you seriously dislike the golden goose so much.
Bullshit is legal and free. But it is still bullshit, however many times it is repeated.
Remember also it is not the American people or government that enslaves foreign people and works its children. It is the governments and the parents of the foreign country that are only to thankful to.
It may not be nice, but if you have a better plan like bringing back the British Empire. I am sure we would all love to hear it.
Verity and anybody else.
I have never been to America but I am related directly to several Americans and have had many American friends.
Sorry about this and all that, but they are all sterile and stupid.
They are so up themselves it is laughable. They believe in lots of big ideas but its all sentimental hogwash.
The declaration of Independence is, next to the Bible and Magna Carta, one of the most important documents in the history of civilisation and yet, like the Bible, few act as if they really believe it.
The Americans are insular, backward artistically and they believe in the tooth fairy, which is what most of their political system is based upon.
They have waged several unsucessful, agressive wars against people they thought would be a pushover, but were not.
They have had heads of state who were lying bastards and all their heroes exist on celluloid.
Their cars are crap. It is virtually against the law in the USA to be poor. Ditto black or Hispanic.
I have Hispanic American friends who fret over precisely what shade of brown they are because, in school, and at workd, it matters. How very very sad.
Nothing but nothing would ever drag me to that terrible place with its plastic culture and its fake hygienically wrapped drinking glasses and its taxi drivers who cannot navigate.
They have elected an idiot who has pissed off two thirds of the rest of the world.
No American can believe that they are not loved and feted all over the world. When I hear an American accent, I run for cover.
They burnt my direct ancestor as a witch in Salem, Mass. I am not going to forgive that one either.
gary
For once Hillary was correct. It took LBJ to get the Civil Rights act passed, JFK couldn't do it and his brother wasn't in a position to do it either.
The Kennedy legacy is one mostly of hype, mostly because the media covered for their warts and blathered about Camelot ad nauseam.
anon 4:00 PM
Ever lived there or are some Guardianista troll ?
I've been here for over thirty years and, for oh so many reasons, you couldn't pay me to live in today's UK.
WW - Sorry your American friends and family are stupid, but there are stupid people everywhere in the world, so I don't think it's anything to do with being American. I won't address your points because you are speaking from prejudice and have no navigation system. You might want to read what Yak40 has to say, though.
Personally, I find many Americans to be articulate, eloquent, thoughtful, well-travelled and very entertaining to be around. The big cities - especially in Texas and the West - are glittery, well-run, well-policed, stylish and wonderful places to live. Dallas has a world-renowned opera company, and the Houston Ballet goes on world tours.
San Antonio (also in Texas) has a huge Mexican-American population, has lots of pizzazz and I never saw any Mexican Americans looking as though they were worried about their skintone. I believe it was the first major American city to vote in a Mexican-American mayor. El Paso is another vivid, lively Mexican American environment. Most of the people on the border are bilingual.
So, I dunno. Just going by this one state, that has a population of around 30m, it is largely law-abiding because the citizens have the right not only to own guns but - this is the best bit - to "carry concealed".
Some deeply stupid states, mainly in the "liberal" Northeast, don't allow gun ownership. But that's what you get when you have what are, in effect, 50 separate countries making up one giant country. People immigrate to Texas from all over America. I don't know that anyone moves to Massachusetts of their own free will.
The United States works because Americans are proud of being American. It's bracing. It's vigourous. It's nice.
verity
People immigrate to Texas from all over America.
Not just America ;)
I don't know that anyone moves to Massachusetts of their own free will.
That's funny, and likely true.
Among the "facts" cited on this thread:
1) Black Americans were being hanged in the streets in the 1960s.
2) George Washington ('freemason') helped to set up the institution of slavery.
3) Hospitals in the US do not provide medical care to those unable to pay for it.
And on and on.
Not the best advertisement for educational standards in your country, I'm afraid.
Anonymous: I'm not quite sure who you complain against.
But I doubt you can pursue your case for injustice against USA history, even in this right wing blog.
Black people were most certainly unprotected in US law over one hundred years after Abraham Lincoln 'freed' the slaves in slave owning states.
George Washington won his war of Independence, but independence for who, exactly?
He was a slave owning freemason, who fought to keep slavery and retain the institutions of slavery and freemasonry apartheid within the Colonies.
It is also noted that the thirst for power by the landed white rich, was always the intended outcome.
Perhaps you know of an president who has never been a freemason or a Ku Klux Klan member (Truman-Grand Wizard?)
I don't agree that hospital care for the poor is neglected.

- Multi-Food Meta Analyses
- Food Specific Comparisons
Most consumers initially seek out organic food in the hope of avoiding pesticide residues, food additives, genetically engineered ingredients, and a long list of other substances that certified organic farmers and organic food companies cannot use.
They do so in the hope of improving their health and/or the health of their children and family members. Others choose to buy organic food to support organic farmers, because of the proven benefits of organic farming on the environment and animal welfare.
Even the U.S. Department of Agriculture has officially acknowledged that organic farming systems lighten agriculture’s environmental footprint, combat global warming by sequestering extra carbon in the soil, and promote biodiversity.
In recent years science has identified another reason to purchase organic food – improved nutritional quality.
A solid body of research now confirms that on average, and across production years, regions, and different soil types, organic farming increases the concentration of a variety of health-promoting nutrients in plant-based foods (fruit, vegetables, grains, nuts).
While a few nutrients sometimes are marginally higher in some conventionally grown plant-based foods (the most common is protein, a nutrient not in short supply in the typical American diet), organic food typically contains higher concentrations of several of the most important nutrients that most Americans need to consume more of on a daily basis. These include antioxidants, vitamins, heart-healthy fatty acids, and minerals.
Organic meat, eggs, and dairy products also offer significant and consistent nutritional benefits. The most important by far arises from the much healthier mix of fatty acids in organic livestock products, compared to conventional animal products raised on high-energy, grain-based rations.
While most major food companies have begun to offer some organic product lines, the majority of their sales and profits still come from conventionally grown foods, and food ingredients. Many in the industry, and most food industry professional and trade associations, fear that consumer interest in, and support of organic food will be “bad for business.”
For this reason, there is no shortage of critical commentary when a new study emerges supporting the nutritional benefits of organic food and farming. In addition, scientists continue to receive support from industry, foundations, and government agencies to take a “fresh look” at the nutritional-quality benefits of organic farming.
Even the strongest runner will tire running uphill. The body of science firmly supporting the nutritional benefits of organic food is large and growing. The results are encouraging, and will eventually shift attitudes in the food industry and government. Hygeia Analytics will follow this debate closely and occasionally contribute to it.
Hygeia Analytics has compiled a large body of peer-reviewed research that documents that many scientists believe that organic food is healthier. This page is a portal for important, large-scale meta-analyses that have taken a comprehensive comparative look at the nutritional quality of organically and conventionally grown foods, as well as more food-specific focused studies.
Meta-analysis is a statistical tool scientists use.
While this body of work has not convinced everyone that organic food is more nutritious, it has clearly moved the scientific consensus in that direction.
If organic farming systems worldwide continue to promote soil quality and biologically-based methods of pest management, it is likely the differences observed in past studies will persist. The wild card in this equation is what will happen to nutrient density on conventionally managed farms.
Some farmers not seeking organic certification are adopting many methods pioneered by organic farmers, and it is possible the nutrient levels in their harvests will trend upward, and even may one day match those on nearby organic farms.
But other conventional farmers are doubling-down on fertilizer and pesticide-intensive methods that will likely continue to erode nutrient levels, adding to the gap between nutrient levels in conventional vs. organic food.

It’s hard to believe that Christmas is already behind us, and the New Year is a few hours away. I hear John Lennon’s words echoing through my eardrums,
So this is Christmas,
and what have you done?
Another year over,
and a new one just begun.
I don’t know how I’d answer that question, but it wouldn’t be a pretty answer.
Call me cynical, but when it comes to the end of the year, I’m usually not moving forward with an eager-eyed sense of anticipation…
I’m usually just a little crippled (if not a lot) by the realization that the past year was not what I thought it would be, and certainly not what I wanted it to be.
And friends, this year is by no means an exception.
Regret, shame, guilt, bitterness,
they’re a close-knit family,
And if you meet one, it’ll introduce you to its siblings fast enough.
And I feel like I’m stuck at a family gathering with the whole gang this season.
Repentance and trust look like the most unreachable and impossible things in the world when you’re in this kind of rut. It feels like God’s asking you to carry a grand piano up a mountain when your legs are both broken.
Not very desirable, not very accessible.
It’s one of those things where you have to experience it to believe it can work.
But when you’re not experiencing that kind of transformation, it looks just as impossible as bringing life out of death.
I mean, that is kinda what it is.
But a couple nights ago, I was reminded of this hymn that I’ve known and loved for a long time.
But this night, it just hit me right in the…
I’ve always thought it funny how it seems you never hear a hymn sung the same way twice. It seems like we can’t decide on which word to sing. Is it “grace,” or “praise”? Is it “Mount” or “Name”? I get that there are different versions of songs, but I always thought it silly how people sang “grace,” instead of praise.
I mean what does it mean? “Tune my heart to sing Thy grace?”
Then it hit me…
My heart has been out of tune.
If I’ve been singing at all lately,
It certainly hasn’t been grace that I’ve been singing of.
What does it mean to be singing God’s grace?
Well, his unmerited kindness to you —
the nothing-you’ve-done-to-deserve goodness and love of God to you;
the everything-you’ve-done-to-NOT-deserve mercy of the Father.
— to make that your song,
to make that your Reason-to-be.
to claim that as your life story.
to be fixed upon God’s colossal, mountain-sized love for you.
Oh God, make that my song.
Your ceaseless mercy calls for it.
Here I raise my Ebenezer: “Hither by Thy help I’ve come.”
And I hope by Thy good pleasure, safely to arrive at home.
Cause Jesus sought me when a stranger, wandering from the fold of God;
He to rescue me from danger, interposed His precious blood.
When your life seems like a mess and a half, it’s hard to look back with any hope.
But here I raise my Ebenezer, my “stone of help,”
just like Samuel did in 1 Samuel 7 when the Israelites finally took the time to get honest with God about their lives, and seek His face after wandering in the scum of sin… only to be attacked by Philistines at their most vulnerable point—but the Lord intervened, and rescued them supernaturally. Good ‘ol Samuel set up a stone there, and called it an Ebenezer, proclaiming “thus far the Lord has helped us.”
So,
here I raise mine…
…I may be a mess,
But I have breath in my lungs,
and a story that cannot be unwritten by the mistakes I make.
God has helped me.
Hither by Thy help, I come.
God’s grace has been faithful to me this far,
and he ain’t gonna stop his grace anytime soon.
and
O to grace, how great a debtor daily I’m constrained to be
But let Thy grace Lord like a fetter, bind my wandering heart to Thee…
Prone to wander Lord I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love…
Here’s my heart Lord, take and seal it,
Seal it for Thy courts above…
Ain’t that the truth.
If there’s anything I’ve learned after being a Christian for 7 years,
it’s that I am never as faithful as I wish I was…
Shame will always have something to chain me to
Regret will always remind me of the past
Guilt will always have something to tear into
Bitterness will always have something to
the accuser will never tire of accusing
and this will always create the potential for me to fall into despair
misery could always become my story
But
By the grace of God, I can beat the family to the punch.
I can say,
Yup that’s me.
I’ve always been prone to wander.
I’ve always been prone to leave the God I love.
I can own up to my crappy mess I’ve made of my life, and say
Lord. Pardon my guilt, for it is great (Psalm 25:11)
God, here’s my heart, contorted as it is
Make me yours
Make this story that’s destined to be a tragedy a tale of redemption.
Draw me out of the mud and mire, and set my feet on a rock.
Give me a song to sing.
I said earlier that from the outside in, repentance looks like the most impossible and painful thing in the world,
But when you’re in tune with grace, all of a sudden you see that repentance is running back into the arms of a Father who loves you—or rather, letting him throw his arms around you.
And that is worth it.
And all I can say is, friends
It is good to be back.
Friends,
as this new year comes,
I pray you’ll come back with me.
PSALM 25:16-18
Turn to me and be gracious to me,
for I am lonely and afflicted.
The troubles of my heart are enlarged;
bring me out of my distresses.
Consider my affliction and my trouble,
and forgive all my sins.
PSALM 40:11
As for you, O Lord, you will not restrain
your mercy from me;
your steadfast love and your faithfulness will
ever preserve me!
Praise be to the nail-scarred hands that crafted such a beautiful redemption.
Amen.Silverstone Composites

- The ability to clearly communicate real-time data to their clients on demand at every stage of production
- Visibility at every stage of the order flow enabling a clear identification of where a task is being conducted, by whom and how long it is taking
- Real-time inter and cross team communications supported by accurate data
- Batching capabilities to support the tracking of multiple parts from numerous orders across the workshop
- Breakout identification allowing operators to recognise an error as soon as it occurs, record live real-time red flags and correct the system immediately
- Realtime client visibility on request
- Having real-time location, process stage and estimated completion time
The Business need
The production of a wide range of complex precision engineered parts at different stages made monitoring and tracking increasingly difficult. The original system Silverstone Composites had in place could not keep up and restricted the company developing and processing increasing orders. Previously engineers were working from paper-based schematics and drawings. They needed a way to completely digitise their process.
With their current systems Silverstone Composites weren’t able to pin point the stoppages in production due to miscommunication, delays in manufacturing and lack of stock availability. TotalControlPro quickly noticed this was an issue. We highlighted to the Silverstone Composites team that being able to visualise these issues would enable all team members to view real time red flags around current orders and react to each situation accordingly.
Stephanie Mitchell, Executive Assistant to the Managing Director at Silverstone Composites shared with TotalControlPro:
“We would really like full traceability from day one so that we know at the end result, if anyone came back to us, we could tell them that it was made on this day, at this time, by this person, with this kit number, so then we can trace it back to where it came from.”
The Solution provided
By facilitating the core functionality of the TotalControlPro software, Silverstone Composites are able to digitise their complete process. The software provides full visibility of the order flow, traceability of resources, job time tracking, monitors batching features and identifies stoppages and breakout issues. The software enables real-time communication both within and between teams. Those in laminating now know the fundamentals being worked on at the cutting station and therefore when to commence the laminating job stage.
The Impact and Results
Deploying TotalControlPro across the whole production floor has opens–up clear communication across the organisation at Silverstone Composites. Teams are now fully informed of every stage an order has reached. This is mirrored by a clear communication with customers that has enabled stronger customer relationships.

The NWS said an EF-0 tornado briefly touched down in Woodmere, Uniondale and Levittown.READ MORE: Police: Young Firefighter Dies In Fire In His Own Westchester County Home
In Woodmere, the tornado knocked down several trees and powerlines. In Uniondale, a roof was torn off a two-story colonial building and thrown onto a nearby house while shingles, insulation and twisted siding were carried into the next block up.
We can confirm the first tornado from yesterday's severe weather event in our region.
An EF-0 touched down briefly in several towns of Nassau County, NY. Read the full report:
— NWS New York NY (@NWSNewYorkNY) November 14, 2021
The NWS said an EF-0 also touched down in East Islip, knocking down a few dozen large trees, and an EF-1 traveled from Shirley to Manorville, where a covered walkway collapsed, a roof was torn off a home and several small planes at Brookhaven Airport were flipped or moved.
Yards across Levittown were laying in ruins Sunday as residents continued cleaning up the damage, CBS2’s Christina Fan reported.
Families surveyed their broken fences and damaged homes and were astonished at how the fast-moving storm caused so much trouble.
“All of a sudden, boom! A big noise and this window come in and a branch. Glass all over the living room floor,” said Ed Warch.
Warch, 88, said he had just received a tornado warning on his phone and was still reading it when pandemonium broke out.
Families told CBS2 there was no time to run and no place to hide – many homes in Levittown were built on concrete slabs and don’t have basements.READ MORE: NYPD: Landlord-Tenant Dispute Suspected In Canarsie Fire That Seriously Injured 2
“I didn’t even think about it because I didn’t think it was really much of a possibility around here,” one man said.
Neighbors said they had to scramble for the next best thing.
“I yelled at my wife to get into the bathroom,” said Tom Ottinger.
“The only other place you can go is the bathroom, in the tub, if that were the case. Other than that, no, just say a little prayer and we’ll go from there,” said Warch.
Luckily, most of the damage was limited to property. On Cornflower Road, families immediately called 911 after realizing a tree fell and trapped a woman in her living room.
“The fire department came, the police came and they were able to get her out in a wheelchair right out the front door,” said Dylan Harrigan.
Families said help arrived as quickly as the storm moved through.MORE NEWS: NYPD Officer Robert Holmes, Wounded In Shooting On Thanksgiving Eve, Leaves Hospital

Millions of Americans might be about to lose health care, potentially triggering a crisis at medical facilities across the nation. The GOP now controls the executive and legislative branches of the federal government. They will likely make good on their promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare.) While Republican lawmakers have consistently promised to “repeal and replace” the law that insured 22 million, so far Congress has offered no plan for insuring those who can’t afford insurance or can’t get covered because of pre-existing conditions.. We anticipate this will have major ramifications for caregivers, and significantly impact the work experience.
Difficult Decisions When Providing Care for Uninsured
Hospitals cannot turn away patients solely because they lack insurance coverage. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTLA) is a federal law mandating the provision of stabilizing treatment in emergency situations and to women in labor. Hospitals that don’t comply can lose Medicaid funding.
Providers are not, however, required to offer anything beyond stabilizing care. No law mandates cancer treatment, extensive diagnostic services for non-emergent medical issues, or other potentially life-saving treatment. The Affordable Care Act provides coverage for preventative care, but that mandate may also soon disappear.
This leaves providers to interpret the law and assess what ethical care demands. Provide too much care to an uninsured patient and you may bankrupt your hospital. Offer too little care, and you could lose Medicaid funding. This dilemma doesn’t even take into account that providers are treating human beings. The stress—and bad publicity—of turning away someone in need can be overwhelming.
High Costs of Unpaid Care
The EMTLA is an unfunded mandate. One recent study found that half of hospital bills go unpaid. Compliance with the law, particularly in poor and disenfranchised areas, can cost hospitals millions. Providers may try to make up for this loss by limiting unreimbursed care only to emergencies, and never providing extra care when the law does not require it.
No provider went through years of school to view their patients as paychecks, but the realities of unreimbursed care can fundamentally alter the patient-provider relationship. Health care professionals may find themselves assessing whether a patient can pay before they recommend treatment, or may adjust their care recommendations based on perceptions about a patient’s finances. Research shows that the uninsured receive fewer health interventions and stay for shorter periods in hospitals.
Worse Health for Patients and Lower Morale for Health Care Providers
When patients lose insurance coverage, they turn to emergency rooms for treatment. This consistently results in lower quality care. Rather than the ongoing monitoring and communication that marks a healthy doctor-patient relationship, patients seeking care in the emergency room receive only stabilizing treatment. They don’t form relationships with doctors and nurses who understand their lifestyles and needs, and they’re unlikely to receive preventative care, weight loss counseling, advice about nutrition, and other medical information that can empower good health.
The cost is high. The uninsured have a 39 percent higher mortality rate. There’s simply no way to quantify the emotional toll on families, friends, and communities of this tragic outcome.
Opponents of government programs to increase health care coverage, including the ACA, argue that the programs are too expensive. Cutting these programs merely shifts the burden. When hospital bills go unpaid, taxpayers and local governments are often forced to pick up the tab. The question is not whether health care coverage should be paid for; it’s who pays. No one benefits when the poorest among us are denied care.

United. Their impressive 3-1 victory at home over the Columbus Crew last weekend included two goals from Charlie Davies in his first competitive match in over a year, and a high-quality defensive effort from the team's young back-line, led by 19-year old rookie Perry Kitchen. United will hope to continue that success at 4:30 PM today on the road against the New England Revolution.
United will be missing three important defensive starters from last week though. Kitchen is on duty with the U-20 U.S. National Team as the teenagers attempt to qualify for the U-20 World Cup, while right back Jed Zayner and central defensive midfielder Clyde Simms will each sit out due to injuries. 2010 holdover Kurt Morsink will replace Simms in the midfield, while Uruguayan international Rodrigo Brasesco and second-round pick Chris Korb will step in on the back-line.
The Revolution are coming off a controversial 1-1 tie against the Los Angeles Galaxy last week. Following that match, Landon Donovan suggested that the Revs were just playing for the draw, but they'll certainly be going for the win today at home.
The game will be broadcast live on Comcast SportsNet.

But why should we trust the judgement of the credit rating agencies? Ever since they gave the thumbs up to subprime mortgages and helped trigger the banking crisis of 2007/8, more and more of their misjudgements have come to light.
The USA is currently being entertained by the Justice Department’s five-billion-dollar lawsuit against one of these agencies, Standard & Poor’s, which is accused of defrauding investors by issuing ratings on subprime mortgage securities that it knew to be misleading.
There is no doubt that the credit rating agencies bear a lot of responsibility for the current crisis, since they certified that very risky financial products were safe investments. The question is whether this was stupidity or fraud.
Either way, clowns or crooks, there is no longer any good reason why these agencies should remain the final arbiters of economic.Viewers know him mainly from the films Fantastic Four, in which he has one of the main roles. Ioan Gruffudd will be on M6 tonight for the launch of the third season of Dr Harrow, in which he plays a forensic pathologist who seeks to find out what happened to the victims he examines. Rather discreet about his private life, Ioan Gruffudd was married to actress Alice Evans for 14 years, before leaving her suddenly last January, along with their two daughters, Ella (born in 2009) and Elsie (born in 2013) . The reason ? Rather incomprehensible, according to Alice Evans, who had shared the bad news on Twitter. “My dear husband, my soul mate for 20 years, has just announced to me that he is abandoning our family as of next week. My two little daughters and I are lost and sad. more explanation, except that he doesn’t love me anymore. ” A brutal choice, that the father of the actor had commented on the magazine Mail Online. “As a family, we obviously know some things. I talked to Ioan and we are, of course, incredibly sad, but I don’t want to go into too much detail. We are very sad, especially for our two. granddaughters. It’s just unfortunate, but these are things that happen, marriages that end. “
Ioan Gruffudd and Alice Evans met 20 years ago
Alice Evans and Ioan Gruffudd had met on the set of 102 Dalmatians, in 2000. At the time, the actress was in a relationship with Olivier Picasso, the painter’s grandson, but her love at first sight for Ioan Gruffudd had led to the two actors’ marriage in 2007, in Mexico, before they became parents to two daughters.

Where do we start? Seriously, where do we start? Should the Arabs continue to focus their attention on removing the barbarous buffoons that have run their countries like private estates for the past half a century? Or do they focus entirely on resisting Western imperialism? I don't pretend to know the answer, but with an Arab world that is unable to speak, or think even, then I begin to lean more towards the path of self liberation first. When you fly in an aeroplane, there are usually little safety sheets which tell you what to do in an emergency. Usually there is a section about oxygen masks, and the first thing you must do in an emergency is ensure that your own mask is on, otherwise you risk falling unconscious before putting the mask safely on your loved one. the motto of this simple exercise is that if you fail to take care of yourself, then you are no good to anybody.
Resistance First?
Those who argue that resisting foreign aggression is the main priority are right, but only to a certain extent. They ignore the reality which is that none of the Arab countries have made any tangible progress with regards to justice for the Palestinian people. In fact these Arab countries which have trumpeted 'the cause' have been the biggest obstacle to justice for the Palestinians: in Jordan they were crushed by the late King Hussein; in Syria, Hafez Assad kept a tight lid on the groups, and his son is shelling Palestinian refugee camps in Lattakia today; in Egypt, Mubarak colluded openly with the Israelis in starving Gaza; in Lebanon we saw the massacres. The list goes on and on. Rather than assisting our Palestinian brethren, our illustrious Arab leaders have only used them as puppets to serve their own goals.
I still think Iran poses the biggest challenge to American hegemony in the region, and I do believe that Hezbullah bloodied Israel's nose in 2006, albeit at great expense. But insofar as an alternative to Western imperialism, Iran and Hezbullah have failed to provide an alternative. Extra-judicial killings, sham trials, the torture of political dissidents, and the violent suppression of protests are all stupid actions which alienate the population, and ensure that nobody wants to live in these little 'havens' that are supposedly safe from Western colonialism. When most of your population are fed up with your rule, it's difficult to convince them that they are 'free' in the big picture when they cannot even demand accountability from those who rule them, or target corruption and inefficient government. For example, a few weeks ago in Tehran, youth were arrested for organising a mixed sex water pistol fight in a park; that is just ridiculous.
Eliminating Dictatorship?
So in the end, it seems as if self reform and the elimination of dictatorship might in fact be Palestine's only hope. There is no point talking about liberation and justice for people when people in Tehran, Damascus or Riyadh are themselves not free and can only obtain justice at the whim of a benevolent (at times) tyrant. What we need is a radical paradigm shift, a break away from the stale nationalistic slogans of the twentieth century, with all the political baggage involved, and a drastic rethink of the way we Arabs view the world, and those around us. Having a free political space where people can think, debate and implement ideas, free from censors, ministries of information and secret police, might be just what the Arab world needs.
Naturally, some people continue to rant and rave about the rising threat of Islamism, as if that term itself denotes some monolithic belief system which is poised to sweep the region. Islamists are part of the political fabric of our countries, and if these countries are to move forward, then they have to work out mechanisms for involving those groups that are committed to a political process into providing practical solutions for the problems the Arab countries face. It's all well for a Salafist movement to rant and rave about returning to the ways of the Prophet, but when they have to play by political rules and deliver economic and social stability to their populations, it will become quite clear to them that a certain amount of pragmatism and flexibility will be required. Then there is the worry of the national armies, which have played particularly destructive roles for the Arab world, and have been especially pathetic in the face of Israeli or Western invasions. These armies have to be reconstituted such that political affiliations should be banned for veterans as well as serving members. Party propaganda should be severely curtailed on official media, and probably limited to election periods, whilst transparency in the party politics and internal machinations would ensure that we won't see another Baath party emerge that will hijack a country.
Ultimate Sovereignty; Where does it lie?
This is all well and good, but in practical terms, the ultimate sovereignty and power has to lay somewhere. Somebody must guard the guardians and ensure that they do not become corrupted by power. Here I believe the solution is simple. Sovereignty must lie with the people, who will protest, take to the streets, and completely wreck the infrastructure of any state which begins to go amok and refuse to abide by the constitution of the realm. Those segments of the population which begin to disrupt the political process should always be involved in the political process. Even if a total gridlock paralyses the country for months, throwing the gauntlet down and bypassing constitutional safeguards must never be allowed by the people. Arabs have historically, before this horrific idea of a hereditary caliphate was imposed, been notoriously difficult to govern. Whether Christian, Muslim or Atheist, Arabs have a long history of selecting rulers who were simply first amongst equals. That tradition is precedent enough for Arabs who are wary of imposing Western political ideologies wholesale, and a good way forward for the region.
Whilst Israel bombs Gaza, Assad is killing Syrians and Palestinians in Syria. This is not the time to equivocate and both actions should be condemned utterly. But we would do good to remember that Israel is only able to bomb Palestinians with impunity because the Arab world is rife with tyranny and oppression. That is something worth considering.Working with Larry has been the best hockey decision I’ve ever made. Before working with Larry, I spent my summers skating every day and working out every chance I could. I never had a plan or reason as to why I was doing what I was doing. It wasn’t until I started working with Larry that I began to see what structured and meaningful off-ice training was for a goalie. Larry did a great job of showing me how training with a plan that is focused around me as an athlete is so important.
For the first time my summer was structured and I wasn’t just busy with a schedule full of hockey stuff. I saw results right away and went into my first season of junior hockey feeling more prepared than ever before. I owe that all to Larry and his tremendous guidance away from the rink.
Thank you for all your guidance and support this past summer!
Before finding optimal goalie the biggest frustration I had with my training was off the ice. I had tried everything from local hockey training facilities to the so-called online experts’ programs. None them worked for me and I often found myself looking for off-ice training to fill that missing link.
My goalie coach referred me to Larry and it has been one the best suggestions anyone has ever given me. From day one Larry’s passion for the position and his knowledge of sports performance training and how it relates to goalie on-ice performance is amazing.
I know Larry was my “off-ice coach”, but honestly, he was a lot more that! He was a great mentor who truly cared about me as person first and was always there to help me.
Thanks for you everything you’ve done!
I wanted to put down in writing what I have been telling goalie parents since my son Zach starting training with Larry, that if I knew the results Larry gets? I would have had my son training with Larry when I first heard about his program two years ago.
Within one month of Zach working with Larry I noticed improvements in his on-ice performance that continue to this day. Not only has my son’s on-ice performance improved, but his habits away from the rink like nutrition, sleep, recovery, focus, and how he structures his day to be productive on and off the ice.
I am so glad our son started training with Larry! It has been well worth it!
The summer pee-wee program was great for our twin boys. With a busy summer playing other sports and being involved in other activities, their favorite one was Larry’s training program.
My wife and I really like Larry’s philosophy of developing an athlete first. Throughout the summer we saw their performance improve on the ice and in the other sports they play. We were so happy to see them having fun and developing in all their sports and activities without having to take them to serval training programs.
Larry has instilled a sense of confidence and responsibility in them that has helped them grow up as young men. We are so grateful to have our boys working with Larry. They are so excited for next summer’s program!
As a goalie mom with a very passionate son in the crease. I’m always looking for positive ways to help my son improve on the ice. When his goalie coach approached us with the opportunity to train with Larry for the summer, we jumped on it. Form the first day my son has loved working with Larry and I’ve seen a huge improvement on the ice.
Larry’s training programs are amazing, and his ability to help me as a goalie parent navigate through the crazy world of hockey has been awesome. Anytime we’ve had a question Larry has given us great advice or connected us with other good hockey resources.
I would recommend Larry to any goalie parent who is looking to give their child an edge on the ice!
My son Parker attended the Optimal Goalie pee-wee program this past summer. Of all the camps he attended, including his on-ice training Larry’s was his favorite. He loves working with Larry and was always excited to go, and disappointed when he had to miss a session.
By the end of the summer, I could see improvements in Parkers agility, hand eye coordination, and his confidence. This was such a great experience for Parker that he is already asking to train with Larry next summer.
I would highly recommend Optimal Goalie to anyone looking to round out their goalies training!13-Year-Old Girl Commits Suicide in St James

The comedian has lost 80 pounds since undergoing gastric sleeve surgery in April, according to In Touch.
The surgery works by reducing the size of the stomach so patients will feel full faster.
“I was such an overeater,” said Lampanelli, who weighed 248 pounds at one point. “Now, I get full quickly - at three, four bites, I have to stop.”
Currently a size 12, the Queen of Mean says, “The size I am right now is the size I was always meant to be,” adding, “I feel so much healthier.”
The 51 year old also recently stopped by “The Dr. Oz Show” to share details about her weight loss.
In an episode to air on Wednesday, People reports that Lampanelli said, “I order food like a normal human being. If I'm out to lunch I'm going to order three courses like everybody else.”
“I'm not going to feel like some kind of freak,” she continued. “So I always order soup, dessert and a sandwich or whatever, a main course..”
how come when i made a comment in support of what water dance wrote about her behavior on the apprentice i have yet to find it., i used no bad words, just the truth. sounds like censorship to me.
Why is this news? I don't care how much she weighs, she's funny and smart as hell- that's what I want to hear about- her new act!
Run it's the News Police.
So did she also shed what was FAR more unappealing - that nasty, ugly, jealous personality that she displayed on the apprentice and does in public as well?? I doubt it. Her REAL ugliness is still there for all to hear. Those who believe that hideously insulting routine she passes off as comedy (where she uses stereotypes to insult the sh** out of everyone and somehow that makes it okay) is just humor are as naive is she is internally ugly.
maybe she'll lose enough weight that whe will melt away to nothing. that would make some of us very happy. just go away lisa.
Where's the after pic? Ahahahaha
So, where's the "after" photos?
Still a racist. But a blonder, skinnier racist.
Gross, she's uglier than before. Didn't think that was possible.
You go girl you look great.Lost 50 lbs. myself since last May the old school diet and exersise.
Great. Another celebrity that took the easy way out to lose some weight. I bet you a Happy Meal that she gains it all back in a year.
I would have respected her more if she actually lost weight the CORRECT way through a healthy diet and regular exercise instead of resorting to surgery. It just sends the wrong message to obese folks (and yes, I used to be one of them before I dropped 100 pounds myself...and still losing through a healthy diet and exercise).
80 lbs lighter and still an ugly disgusting pig!
Weight loss surgery is not the easy way out by any means. I had the surgery in 2007 and it has been one of the hardest things I have ever done. You are forced to change your eating habits and exercise. You get sick a lot. You can't do the things you normally would. It is actually hard on your body. It isn't just let me have this surgery and that's it. It is a life long commitment that you cannot change.
You chose to get fat, so.
Tanya – You said you were forced to change your eating habits? Yes, and if you did that without the surgery you and she would have lost weight anyway. That is the key to weight loss, putting less food in your mouth than is needed and changing your eating habits. That is what they are trying to say. Good luck to you.
Diet and exercise are the ideal solution but not everyone has the time or the money to organize their lives to focus on what they're eating or to join a gym and spend time everyday getting exercise. Sometimes you can be so overweight that you can't even get started on an exercise program to begin with. It's a vicious cycle and surgery is the only way to force you to start losing weight. By the way, the weightloss isn't instant so it's not as quick a fix as you'd think.
In addition, there was a study done that showed people with diabetes improved much better after gastric bypass or other surgery than those on diet and exercise plans. So in extreme cases it's very helpful. I only question using major surgery to solve minor weight issues and that can be a problem.
Weight loss surgery is far from an easy way out-educate yourself before expounding idiotic opinions please.
O.K people, this is REALLY a no-brainer. She is a comedian, that is her occupation. IF you DO NOT like her form of comedy DO NOT watch her.
It really is as simple as that.
It was only time she became truely main stream. Way to raise the bar ...COUGH (snookie) cough
Well, no black guy is going to want her now...
All of you guys trashing her have never met her. She is kind, sweet and lovable and is worth more than her weight in gold.
I've met her and she is still an ugly disgusting pig, who should be flipping burgers
Jon- She's better than you will ever be!
you can't possibly be serious. funny?sweet? just like ann coulter. give me a break. she is cruel and vicious. she has lost most of her fans due to performance and behavior on 'celebrity'. nice girl.
did anyone see one of her discusting routines, she is funny as a train wreck!
That a way girl.....earn the weightloss the old fashion way, surgery!
So wait....she still orders 3 courses......in other words the eating habits haven't changed, that is always a sign of success.
The only reason I am familiar with her being a comedian is from watch comedy central roasts. She is funny but would be even funnier if she dropped some of her (not even a little amusing)extremely raunchy material. Glad she lost the weight and wish her the best. I am sure her act will have new material about her transformation and she looks great!
It's all an act and she get's paid for saying what most of us are thinking. Don't bash her. If she offends you...don't listen....kind of like Mit Romney. He offended so many people yet a lot of them will still vote for him.
So it's better to vote for the Incompetent-in-Chief (Obama, as if I had to type his name lol) instead? Only three type of ppl still support the buffoon: 1) partisan schmucks; 2) morons; 3) perpetual moochers (which often comprise 1 & 2). Thankfully 80 million ppl got to see the empty suit Obama's always been after the debate beating Romney gave him 🙂
That's funny. also recall the automaton Romney pandering to the camera and lying his was through it and backing everything he said off the next day. Small victory.....
You don't think you're a partisan schmuck for swallowing the tea? You are. Yes, you are.
And this is news because?.....
she was fat and America eat too dang much. we all need to be healthy.. great news and I hope the big bone people can learn from this..
What's with her hair? It looks mean just like her. Phyllis Diller was never mean and was a great lady. The times, they sure have changed.
Hi V!
We all love you Lisa, big or small or purple, just keep us laughing!
You can put lipstick on a pig, but in the end it is still a pig! This woman is nasty as - l l e h - in a heat wave! When you are mean and ugly on the inside, You will ALWAYS be ugly on the outside. It just shines through. One almost has to feel sorry for her, and her pathetic meaness.
She's ugly inside and out? You obviously are a moron. It's an act that she gets paid to due. Unlike yourself who is out here bashing her because you're trully just a miserable person.
Could not have said it better myself!
SJ lighten up she's a comedian. Ever sit on the front row at a comedy club?
Ignorance on eating disorders a plenty here, Glad you were born with such spectacular genes, not everyone was. Nonetheless many out there try hard and fail. AND BTW her money means nothing, whether she paid out of pocket or not. You can get your health insurance to pay for most of it, if you follow the procedures to do so.
i clicked this link thinking she had died
oh well
I did too, hoping it was her obituary.
if u cant say any thing nice , stfu
Yeah same here. I was thinking that or maybe one, or many of the many people she has bullied, beat the snot out of her and left her for dead!
She is so mean. Thin or fat, I will never like her. Her 15 min of fame on The Apprentice sealed the deal for me.
she is STILL a beast, and has NO class at all!
SHE IS STIL A BEAST IN THE WAY SHE LOOKS, AND CARRIES HERSLEF LIKE SUCH A BITTER THING.
I KNOW UR STANDUP ROUTUE WELL. IT IS DECENT BUT OFTEN SHE GOES OVER THE TOP CAUSE SHE REALLY IS NOT VERY TALENTED SO NEEDS TO SHOCK AT HER ROASTS ON COMEDY CENTRAL.
IF U WATCHED THE NOW THINNER PIGLET ON THE APPRENTICE, THEN U ARE KNOW JUST HOW TWO FACED AND HORRIBLE SHE CAN BECOME IN THE BLIND OF AN EYE!
LISA R U STILL A LITTLE PIGGY TO ME! beast!
I'm glad others feel personally the same way that I feel about Lisa Lampenelli, that she is ugly down to the core.
It's all a persona like an actress in a movie, if you don't care for it, then by all means, don't watch her shows! No one is forcing you to support her. It's so interesting that the very thing she is famous for (mean, nasty comedy) is the very thing you are doing now – being mean and nasty towards her, lol. Two means don't make a right!
she is not oly jelious of pretty woman but will ATTACK them and make them feel bad cause she may be sharter then some.
UGLY is Ugly no matter what u weight, sorry BEAST. on top of that she is evil and nasty and made a name for herself
by not just being mean but literally SHOCKING cause she is missing the NATURAL BORN TALENT many other comedians have.
Note to ugly woman: dont be mean to people just cause he ulgy and then also dont be mean in general just cause u want to be famous but cant make people laugh without go the 's h o c k i n g' route!
I thought Ms. Lampanelli was brutally funny–until I watched her rageful, hateful, condescending, dismissive interactions with Dayana Mendoza on Celebrity Apprentice. I found her and Aubrey O'Day to be selfish, petty, ugly women and I'm NOT referring to her or Aubrey's physical beauty or lack thereof. The irony is that Ms. Dayana seems to get the last laugh–Miss Lampanelli thought so little of her that she went out and had bariatric surgery to look thinner.
I only saw her on celeb apprentice. she was pretty nasty. seems to me
that she showed her true colors on the show. I wouldn't go to
her show or even watch her on tv. glad she lost weight, she has
to feel better. just too bad they couldn't cut the nasty out of her.
At her age that type of weight loss definitely makes her look older, people lose so much volume in the face by that age, dramatic weight loss really ages them, she is still not thin or toned maybe she will now work on that on her own without surgery, I just hope she tones down her anger and meanness, Ellen has shown you do not have to be an angry nasty female to be funny.
its all part of the show. she is not this nasty mean and hateful person. be careful who you judge.
I wonder if she will be funny now or still just nasty.
I don't care how much weight she loses, she will always be disgusting to me. She is one of the unfunniest grossest comdiennes around. Even Roseanne is funnier than Loud Lisa. And she has the audacity to brag about losing weight and knocking diets. She had most of her stomach removed. How can she brag about that?
now all she needs to do is to get oral sleeve surgery,,make her mouth smaller so she can only speak 3 or 4 words at a time....what a freakin annoying yente....and angry...real piece of work,,not Ass
They can put a band around her waist because she is fat, now put a band over her head to see if that can improve her looks.
The real question is ...Will Black guys still bang her now that she is skinnier?
She will have to settle for us white guys now.
I think white guys passed on that a long time ago ...Billy
So if the operation makes her eat less, couldn't she just have, you know, eaten less?
I know, huh? Life is SO hard for rich people.
Hunger can be a terrible feeling. Without the surgery, if she just ate the amount she is eating now, she would have a constantly gurgly, hungry stomach. The hunger hormones, not to mention the stomach acid, would make her weak and nauseated, and make it hard for her to concentrate. It is VERY hard to fight your body's visceral instincts, whether they be to eat, not to eat, to sleep, not to sleep, etc. The surgery changes your body's chemistry so that you can basically starve yourself without feeling like you're starving. Yes, it is possible to do it without the surgery, but you have to do it more gradually and be much more careful about what you eat, because otherwise your body will fight back. Exercise must be part of the equation too. And it is VERY hard. Talk to anyone who has tried to lose weight for years without success.
Uhh, about that.
Most decent parents teach their kids to deal with hunger until it's time to eat, then to eat, then wait a while until you eat again, instead of just going off 'because u tummy says.' Whether or not you want to throw your body's natural instincts at me, there is still self-control. That is the definition of self-control, pretty much. We're all hungry sometimes, but that doesn't mean we need to forego dinner or what we're doing to eat until we feel full. That's like calling off work because you have a slight headache. It's stupid. Deal with it.
I am not surprised that a fellow who chose to call himself "poopster" is really THIS clueless about eating disorders and clumps it into a self-control generalization. Thanks for being ignorant.
Really CNN? It's getting to the point where you can't say anything anymore. 50/50 as to whether this post will even make it.
Dr Oz has apparently jumped the shark.
Heh. Dr. Oz IS the shark. He's never been good IMO.
Wow she really accomplished something...I mean, paying for that surgery, wow that's quite an accomplishment.
Too bad she can't get a personality bypass.
so true, the things that comes out of her mouth are ugly which matches the outside
No doubt .. I wish some Dr. could remove her NASTY personality.
I'm all for ya, Lisa! I lost over 200 lbs. over 5 years the old fashioned way by changing my eating habits and exercising. Simple things like taking the stairs for 2 or 3 stories when I could, and doing fun things like jumping jacks when I had to wait somewhere. I kind of had an advantage over people that didn't go through the US military. I remembered going through PT (Physical Training) at 6 am every day in boot camp and losing weight there, down to a lean and mean 175. I joined up at 18 years old and 6' 4" tall, but by age 30 I topped out at 427 lbs. After a nasty divorce, I got myself down to 222 where I hard plateaued. I'm now 58, and am still at around 225.
Yes, it CAN be done this way, but I certainly understand that Lisa and her husband needed help with weight loss. I think no less of them for using a tool I didn't have the courage to use. LOVE YA, Lisa! All the BEST to you!
Size 12? I think not.
we love her your just jealous because everyone hates you
And still not funny....
Heavy or not she is a terrible human being. Despise this woman !!!!
now the brothas can hide in the folds...
If she isn't careful, they won't like her any more. Then all she'll have left are the *women who like other women* (OK CNN?).
gee what will i do tonight...talk to a screen oh yea
Now if she can only lose that mouth
yea, after seeing her a few times on the Apprentice I lost all respect for her. If you are mean and crazy on stage you are funny. If you do it all the time, you are just mean and crazy.
I've seen a few of her stand up routines on Comedy Central and HBO, and there were plenty of times I've LMAO. If you're too sensitive to the racist humor that's the calling card of her routine than you could stick to the same old lame comedians like Will Farrel and Adam Sandler who are typecast into the same character in every single one of their family-friendly comedies.
As Howard said, she's screwed more black men then FEMA.
That sounds like something he would say.
That was in response to her joke about Kim Kardashian. She said that "Kim Kardashian has screwed more black guys then sickle cell anemia!" lol
I must say it is quite dissappointing to look at a headline and head to an article hoping to see weight loss through proper nutrition and increased exercise. People are coming out and commending a person on weight loss that was had from an elective surgery...I mean really this surgery should be for a select few morbidly obese people that can't exercise for various medical reasons. However this is an article basically saying. " i am such a gluttonous pig i can't control what i shove down my pie-hole" But now some doctors clamped my stomach shut so now a physically can't eat what I used to.
very disturbing in both the ease of people to get this surgery and that others say "great job!!"
Wow ChicagoRob,
Who the heck are you to decide who deserves help and who dosen't...I guess you are just wiser and better than everybody else and we should all listen to you.
She is an adult who made a decision that involved some risk in order to improve her health and looks. Its working for her...so good for her and its none of your DAMN business.
Who are you to judge who needs this treatment and who doesn't? Do you have a medical degree? A nutritionist's license? No? Then shut the h*ll up. Let smart people decide who needs this treatment, not Chicago dimwits.
I'm with your rob. What is she bragging about? Being able to throw money at every problem to avoid actually working? And to the other comments, if it wasnt any of our business, why would she go on tv and try to get her name out over it? Clearly you respect a celebrity POS too much.
I agree. That's funny, people commenting and questioning if you are a doctor...they surely aren't either. It's certainly easier to defend the "genuinely good" obese people who do this surgery, but that's not the case here. We don't feel sorry for the Lisa Lampanellis...her freakin nick name is queen of mean, hello. if you're ugly on the inside, it doesn't matter what you do to the outside, you're still freakin ugly....So she was a fat ugly person before, now she's a "lighter" ugly person...tsk tsk
ChicagoRob:
Having had gastric bypass surgery about 10 years ago, may I just say that I did try all the other ways ... exercise, Weight Watchers, etc. Obviously, you have never had a severe problem with obesity. For people that think that this is the "easy way out" .... TRY IT!!! Eat the wrong thing – PUKE; eat one bite too many – PUKE; not to mention, certain things that just don't sometimes "sit right" in your stomach.
I have dealt with many, many people that made the "easy way out" comment to me and, let me just say, it would be easier to be fat and eat anything I want. Can't you just give her the kudos for wanting to do something about her weight – regardless of how "easy" you think it might have been!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good for her! It's always inspiring to see someone happier and feeling great.
“I'm not going to feel like some kind of freak,” says the woman who couldnt just eat a bit less and take the stairs once in a while, but had to have 90% of her stomach removed in order to control her gluttony.....
Bob, nice to see you can judge people you don't know personally. You never know what is going on in others' lives, so stop trying to judge others you don't know. At least Lisa took on her problem and seems to being moving forward with her life, now if you'd only get a life too, so you won't be so absorbed in others' lives.
Agreed. Not everyone who is fat is a victim, despite what the PC era tells us. If you have a gluttonous, sedendary lifestyle, you get fat. Bypass surgery wont change an unhealthy lifestyle.
I think its great to take control of obesity no matter what way you do it. However, the comment "im going to order 3 courses for lunch like everyone else" made me laugh. UHHH Lisa....the only people I know who eat 3 courses for LUNCH are fat. That might be the problem.
you can change the weight but you can't change the face.....
Of course you can. They have docs for that too, haven't you heard?
Good for you Lisa! And for you haters, STFU!! She's hysterical!!
Kathy Griffin syndrome. Next comes the facial reconstruction, followed by appearances on every morning talk show, then a disappearance into obscurity.
You know who Kathy and Lisa are. Neither has a clue who you are.
Haters gotta hate I guess.
80 pounds lighter and still not funny.
She lost 70 pounds.
And gained the hairstyle of a 13-year-old girl from 1973.
I heard she's heading into politics..is that true.
lol
The couple of times I have seen her, she just wasn't funny. Maybe there is someone among her 4 fans who cares that shes not funny but lighter. Frankly, it's not me.
Four fans? I know you probably thought that was funny, but the funny part of your comment is how you chose that number because it was the highest number you could count to on your own.
Good for IT. Now has to have the prostate gland removed!!!!
Wow, I'd hit it!
of the weight loss.
White I don't care for her as a comic, I commend her for taking charge. Good for you Lisa!
Yea for her not really news thanks yahoo for wasting my time.
Hey genius, you're on CNN, not Yahoo. And who twisted your arm and made you read the story, then comment on it?
If I,m not mistaken you are the idiot republican with the oh so clever name that i,m sure you will stand right behind that read the article...how bout some of that good ole personal responsibility you people harp on all the time...somebody force you to read this?
By the way, I,m from wv..and a democrat. Byrd got out of ythe Klan....you should too.
You are the a**hole who chose to read it. If you and other haters don't like her don't read anything about her. Its people like you. the narrow minded people who judge people but their looks, and not who the person is. Add what bullies do to people plus emotional and physical abuse, it takes years of therapy to overcome! You haters are all envious of her, because she has made more money that you will. Sp go Lisa
B.U.C.,But Ugly Cow,,not even funny.
and did something fantastic to help herself. I commend her.
She is still a classless crass jerk. don't care fhow much she weighs.
You just don't get her jokes. She's hilarious! 🙂
she's a very funny person..
She should take the weight off of shoulders. That hair... pffff!
Sh
never was a routine...the comic always mean't it–i like her style.
but there is no doubt - i'd do him
She's an 'Insult Comic' that's her routine....
Poor guy, what a train wreck,... I'd still do her!
Now maybe she'll do something about that nasty sewer hole of a mouth hole and all of the disgusting filth it spews.
Now, if she could only lose that big ugly trash-mouth of hers she just might disappear completely!
I lost 110 pounds through nothing but hardwork and discipline. No starvation diets or personal trainers. Just pure guts. It was a hell of a lot of work and a lot of stress and pain on my body to work off 110 pounds.....now I'm at 170 pounds and feel great. When I read stories like this of people who paid a doctor to lose the weight for them or lost a little bit of weight through a starvation diet and they get all this praise it makes me feel cheated. The good guy's always finish last!
Congratulations on your will power, perseverance and success.
Not everyone has that will power. Many of us are addictive in nature and just can't seem to do what you have done.
Take pride in your accomplishment and try not to feel "cheated" by people who have found their own kind of success.
Get over yourself Brad. Just because she didn't lose the weight the way you did, doesn't make it wrong or right. People like you suck.
Brad, strong work. I, too, lost a lot of weight (140 lbs) the "old school" way – diet and exercise. However, I know several people who had gastric bypass, lapband, etc. surgery, and I have watched their successes and failures. There is no "easy" route. People who have weight loss procedures learn pretty quickly that they have to work to lose the weight just like you and I did, and they have to work to keep it off just like you and I did. You shouldn't slam on them or yourself.
My entire life I ate healthy food in reasonable portions and exercised regularly. I never let myself become a fat, disgusting slob like Brad was for the majority of his life, so there was no reason for me to ever lose 100+ pounds and then become a smug @ssh0le about it. Where's my parade?
Gastric surgery (bypass, sleeve or band) is no walk in the park. Nobody or nothing does it FOR YOU. It is a tool (very much like a tread mill, just cause you have one doesn't mean you'll be trim) that some people need to get to a healthy weight. There is still hard work after surgery including dietary control AND exercise. I should know. I lost as much as you currently weigh having had gastric bypass surgery and I'll betcha I worked as hard as you did for it.
I hate to break it to you, but you'll probably gain it back. Studies indicate that only 2% of dieters maintain their weight loss. When you do gain it back, you should look into this treatment.
Incredible. I'm loving how everyone posting here is so unapoligetically hypicritical. "Oh, she's such a horrible person because she INSULTS people all the time and says horrible things about them!"
Uh, pot? I'd like you to meet kettle. Way to take the high road to the unassailable moral ground there internets.
You people are sad and have trite and meaningless lives. Good luck with that.
how do you bite soup?
You are a Hollywood fake now. I have no respect for you.
Did she finally decide she wanted to be with a decent white guy? Though I must add that no decent white guy would want her.
No such thing as a decent "white guy"...oops yes there is, Mitt the Twit!
She is married to a white guy. They have been together for around 7 years.
Eighty fewer pounds of that trashy woman? Not enough.
she's going fo 25lbs..we know the slimmer is preferred nowadays
WOW! No matter what you think of her comedy or the way she lost the weight....the point is she lost 80 lbs.
She is the queen of crude and rude and will say so herself, but have you ever listened to George Carlin, Richard
Pryor or Robin Williams to name a few. Just because she is a woman you blast her did any of you blast the boys for
the same thing? WTG Lisa...haters will be haters no matter what!
She took the coward's route with gastric bypass surgery, which is NOT the healthiest option.
@Frankly Speaking....
Sadly, not everyone sits atop such a high horse as you where it's hard to get food (and apparently oxygen). This is the humand mind and the human body at work. What is easier for some is harder for others. For example, in your case, being understanding of others is a psychological impossibility. That is so unfortunate for you. You're still an @$$, but I understand that you won't get better without perscription medication.
Hey "Frankly Speaking". You might want to get your facts right before moaning. She did not have a "gastric bypass" surgery, she had the gastric sleeve. BIG difference!
so now we have a stupid foul mouthed mean cvnt that's lighter
thats just what I said! she was such a anger nasty pig on the apprentice and now thinner she is just a lighter beast!
she cries half the time on the set!
a crowd on a computer also--lisa is well aware when you have personality you can do anything.
the others asked me to the other site...so thats is where we chat now - i draw a crowd even in blogging.
she's very funny and amazing how she did this–mostly one person.
do we have the "run" from last night?
nothing here.
She took the cheater's way out. Figures, her comedy is stale and she repeats the same stuff over and over. She showed her true colors on celebrity apprentice. Show me someone who lost all the weight by eating right and working out, not someone who modified their body because they have no self control... and I speak from experience having lost 50 pounds. It is a struggle and isn't easy.
Weight loss surgery is anything but easy! That being said, she is a vile, disgusting, sick, unhealthy person and no amount of weight loss will change that.
She only lost 3 pounds a week? You can do that with proper diet and exercise, without the need to risk surgery. She is pathetic.
2% of dieters maintain weight loss. You know that struggle you have every day? Odds are, you'll lose, and gain your weight back. So now would be a good time to stop passing judgement on fatties, oh future fattie!
i love that retort "i bet she has more money and friends than you". yeah she has "friends" because of the money (which she has more of than me but not alot because she is b-list at best). i have a good paying job, real friends, and i am not fat. so she may have more money but i bet i am way happier.
Anyway you look at it, anybody with a foul mouth is repulsive, not matter how good she looks.
I think she is hilarious, and most of her racial humor is meant to be just that, humor. She doesn't do anything different than Eddie Murphy, Richard Pryor or Redd Foxx did, It is blue humor and meant to be dirty and crude.
She's still a fatnasty.
Don't find her funny AT ALL...
It is funny how everyone is saying what a horrible disgusting person she is. I think this speaks volumes for the people leaving the comments, more than it does Lisa.
BINGO!
Her face is still ugly as dogd:~$t!
So she loses 80 pounds. I doubt that changes her overall personality.
Shes a comic? I thought she was a semen depository
She looks much better on the outside, but I can't imagine her changing much on the inside. Just like a pumpkin- smooth on the outside but slimy and disgusting on the inside.
Well God loves her, too bad she probably doesn't believe in Him.
LOL you believe in god
Your god likes it when you pass snap judgments on people you don't know? You must be christian!
She's still fat on the inside.
She is still a rotten individual...
still has no class but an evil spirit
Eighty fewer pounds of her filth? Still not enough for me!
I'd do stuff to her, if only she would ask...
What would you do?
I think the consensus is that Lisa Lampanelli is pretty much despised,
Fat or skinny, she's still crude, obnoxious, and just not funny (unless, of course, you consider racism funny). I saw enough of her "act" on the Bill Shatner roast to know I don't need to know any more about her.
Stomach rumbling...time to dump.
At least she's still fugly.
She was never funny. 80 pounds less unfunny seems to be good.
What IS funny is how all the comments are just saying how unfunny she is lol.
She is a world class CUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNT
*
I miss my fat, obnoxious, Black banging BIOTCH !
This sad woman is a head case. Worse, she's a hack.
Still ugly on the inside and that can't be changed, it's who she is.
still a bowser
So true! Ugly on the inside.
One of her best lines ever: "Betty White is so old the grand prize on her first game show was FIRE.....:"
Still ugly, just less ugly
I think MORE ugly actually...
She is uglier than ever. It does not matter how much fat this sack of filth looses, she will always be a subhuman worthy of back alley rape and a shotgun to the back of head, face down in a pool of her own sick.
Tell us how you really feel. I think you might be holding back.
I am truly sorry for the loss of your manhood. I hope you can find a way to carry on.
Wow, dude!
Who???
Lean and Mean ... Don't bust yer Spleen.
Good for you Lisa. All the haters are probably way over weight and are jealous of you. Stay healthy. So much hate on these sights. WHY???????
Internet culture has devolved into everyone being an asinine dick, you're not cool or special unless people are shocked by your comments
work on her mouth now.... can't stand her and I don't think she's at all funny
I 'll bet she has more friends and money than you. You seem like a putz.
Lazy
Now if she could just lose the ugly fat.
Most raciest person I have ever heard, she slams the white guys and talks about how the black men are better, they can have her. she can go **** herself and all those nasty black guys.
And you're calling her racist??
Sorry, can you repeat that. All I heard was "White Power"
Beg pardon? I can't hear you over your racist tone.
She's been married to a white guy for like a decade. She says all of the self-deprecating stuff about being fat/gross and having to go for black guys because it's a pretty legit stereotype and it's funny. She doesnt dislike whites...she just says horrible stuff to make $$$. Youre right...it is messed up that she does that stuff. But, occasionally, she can actually be pretty funny.
I lost the same wt, In less than 6 mos. by eating 200-250 cal. 3-4 times/ day, only real food, no smoothies , no protein bars, no juicing , etc and never felt hungry one day
REAL Fruits, veggies , legumes, occaational yogurt, nuts, fish IN 1950's PORTIONS
Way to go. Healthy real raw foods – who would have thougth. No magic pills?
I wish that worked for me. Personally, I feel like I am starving when I just eat lean protein and veggies.
Whoa! Didn't take you very long to feel superior. What the cluck do you care how she lost the weight? You seriously want to claim bragging rights?
Well, she screwed herself here.... now even black guys won't be into her anymore.
her face still looks the same
She's still very,very ugly on the inside.A very very rude person
Really! She orders a three course lunch like normal people! Normal people do not eat three course lunches. I didn't like her on Celebrity Appretice, she is mean and she will always be mean. She's probably meaner to herself than anyone else. Address that and she will address her food issues.
I wonder if anyone who watched the Apprentice and saw her bullying Diana (the beauty queen, Miss. Universe) was just pure jealousy? I think probably at least a little bit.
Maybe now that she is thinner she will be the victim of someone who is heavier than her and will know how it feels!
I think it's better to hope this leads to a boost in her self esteem and she stops bullying other women to make herself feel better. Maybe now she'll realize how much she's hurt others and knock it off and apologize.
Are you kidding me? Diana was a worthless undeserving idiot. She needed to hear everything Lisa said to her.
I agree with Jaje. Diana didn't deserve to be there. She was indeed a beautiful girl, but apparently her beauty has not made her have to do anything for herself a day in her life! The only reason why Trump didn't fire her sooner was because of his own connection with the beauty pageants! Lisa was definitely cut-throat and there was probably a little bit of jealousy, I thought that before, and now that she lost 80 pounds leff than a year after that, I definitely think that; but she was a way better team member than Diana.
Now about Aubrey.... don't even get me started!!!!
Lisa was abusive and psychotic on that show. Funny how fat women hate Diana.Everyone has a different skill set. Maybe Diana couldn't do some of the things Lisa did but on the other hand Diana could sell product with her beauty something Lisa could only dream of.
Who cares! Lisa is so boring and not that funny. It was a good thing when she was fired on Celebrity Apprentice.
Riding that sausage instead of eating it. Time to work on that bass-like fish face next.
Where's my finger?
Lisa is 80 pounds lighter? Wow! That's what happens when all the brothas finally get up and go home!
I've never understood why we celebrate when people lose weight after a surgery that essentially limits their ability to overeat. What effort did they actually put forth? It's ridiculous.
As a Nurse I have seen a lot of people get this surgery. Not all people are successful after it because they never learn to eat properly. A Neighbor lost 50 lbs after surgery and now he is 150 lbs heavier than before he started.
The people that get the surgery and are successful actually have done a lot of work.
Some people I have known who have had this procedure haven't lost much weight at all, 25lbs or so. I've known more than one person who died as a result of this surgery. It's dangerous and can be fatal. Bariatric surgery and gastric surgery shouldn't be taken lightly.
is she doing the "you go girl dance" or woomp woomp
I can help her lose 10 pounds of ugly fat very quckly – just cut off her head!!! Hahahahaha
congrats on the loss. I think you are funny, nice to see you get healthier. you'll feel so much better.
i am so happy you did this ..you look fantastic...i just increased my running time 25 minutes..my trainer who is 2 years younger then myself of course doesn't break a sweat when we run together..he can run 4 miles easy!....he was so happy tonight...he said i'm going to be running like i did before..if i can get to 2 miles 3 times a week i'll be very happy!!!
your accomplishment is much greater then mine and you should be so proud of yourself...it must have been alot of work and you are a very strong person! Stay with it..i'm no expert, i have only lost 8 lbs..i do know the drive in running is slowly coming back!!!! my trainer wants me to start running in public again...nooooooo not ready....when i was 23 I looked good..
now...i gotta get this 20lbs off before running in public!!! LOLOLOL
I wish to poop in her mailbox.
haha lol
oh and FLAVA FLAV!!!
Good for her i hope she doesn't loose her sense of humor too. LOL
now she can make fun of fat people
now she can make fun of fat people too
The stomach can and will stretch.... She will eventually gain everything back and then some.
Only if she continues to over eat. If she really only eats a few bites at a time then her stomach will not stretch.
Before that happens, with the sleeve her stomach will rupture. You don't know what a gastric sleeve is, do you?
So, she finally puked up the three cows she inhaled. Thank God..
I never understand why these gastric surgery people feel they deserve to be congratulated. Congrats on...having surgery?
Meanwhile, thousands of people do it the right way by changing their diet and sweating off the extra weight, pound by pound, at the gym every single day.
Weight loss surgery is expensive and risky, most of the time the congratulations is for doing what it took to get healthy. The surgery is not a "magic wand" and can be "overcome" with bad habits but for thousands of people it's a tool they use to finally accomplish a goal they've wanted to for a long time. I see nothing wrong with congratulating that and I cheer those who do it the "old fashioned way" as well. Bottom line – there is no EASY way to get significant weight loss.
Thats no gastric procedure. She finally threw out the homeless black guy living inside her.
She's smaller but she's still mean and ugly,I don't like her.
Where does she hide the extra skin?
Great job kid!!! Can't wait to see ya on the next comedy central roast!!!!
THat b is funny as hell!
I"m Vixen.
Sorry..wrong person.

I don’t know how many campers we have (maybe 50) but it’s awesome. We just finished our opening worship and our Bible study groups are meeting right now. We feel all of your prayers and appreciate it. It’s great to see the comments you leave too. It’s been hectic today and amazing all at the same time. Thanks Darolyn, (my prayer partner) I can’t thank you enough for your prayers and especially for getting up early today to pray for our worship service. It means a lot to me.
So far I’ve preached my second sermon in dual language. We opened tonight worship with the videos we created, the band singing, Katie Roberts reading scripture, Aimee Godfrey reading scripture, and Agnus Dei skit (by Rebekah, Cathy, Nic, and Chase). I very proud of all of them. In fact, I’m proud of all of our students. Today was crazy, but they came through. I can’t name all the things people did, but people were all over the place doing things to help. From cleaning the dining hall to decorating the stage area and on and on. People took up the basin and towel and served today. I’m grateful to see these teenagers growing in the walk with the Lord to the point that they are willing to see past themselves, step up, and be the leaders that God created them to be.
Hopefully later tonight I will be able to upload a few pictures of our trip. Keep praying for us. We love you all and miss everyone.
We are so proud of all of you and what you are doing to serve Jesus. You will continue to be in our prayers daily during this mission to Poland. We Love you
Gene and Ann
We were definately thinking about everyone this morning during our very quiet Sunday School hour. I hope you aren’t having diet coke withdrawals yet!! Hope all is going well and I’m praying for you all!
Jim and Elizabeth Hoover
We are praying for all of you. Happy to know everyone is busy. Great to see you sharing the love of Jesus to so many. God is so good. We love you.
Thanks for the update Nathan! I am glad to hear everything is going so well. And I am really glad that my darling daughter finally called me! I wish I could send some ice over to you guys! I hear the drinks are warm. Yuk. It’s 10:30 pm here at home and I am – as usual – thinking about all of you. I am so very proud of our Morningside Team!
I can’t wait to hear everyone’s stories!!!! Ditto on the thanks being given for the blog entries…you give more details than teenagers do. Grin! I am praying for everyone but especially “hard” for Ruth and Nic. Please hug both of them for me!!
Just wanted to let you know that people at Central Baptist Church in York have you and the team on our prayer list.This bridal session is the definition of elegance.
Darden’s bridals were so unique because this session took place the Thursday before her wedding. With her work schedule and travel plans, it simply couldn’t have worked out any other way. But it was SO wonderful having the whole look come together just days before the wedding, and she looked stunning! It was the perfect session. We began at Merrimon Wynne and ended at Christ church – the place she got married a few days later. It was perfect.!
So elegant- in love with everything about this!Please drink responsibly.

QUICK RUN-DOWN: In 1984, Bob Geldof and Midge Ure organised all the top musicians in the world (Sting, Paul McCartney, David Bowie, etc) to gather in a London recording studio and sing “Do They Know It’s Christmas?” to raise money for the famine crisis in Ethiopia. Combined with the Live Aid concerts that followed, they raised more than US $150 million. Band-Aid 20 happened in 2004, with funds raised for the Darfur region in Sudan. And now, Band-Aid 30.
Bob Geldof has gathered a bunch of artists to record the song again and raise funds to fight the Ebola crisis. He has a bunch of chart-topping artists… but also has a few dark horses.

Combine the two Trieste and Venice
Message me now to reserve your place.
Day One: 1st April, Friday – Trieste
Our journey will start at Venice Airport this morning. Venice Airport will be the meeting point for our small group. From here we’ll proceed east to Trieste. As we travel through the rich, farming land of the Veneto region we’ll see the extensive lagoon of Venice to our right and to the north the hills and mountains leading up to the Alps. The road we are following was originally known as Via Annia, a Roman road built more than 2000 years ago, linking the Roman cities of Tergeste, Aquileia and Altinum. This was a trade route linking east and west.
It will take us about two hours to get to Trieste. On arrival in Trieste we will check-in to a small, boutique hotel in the old town. There is time to relax, maybe take a nap and unpack before we meet for evening drinks in nearby Piazza Unita. Later there will be a ‘Welcome Dinner’ featuring home-made pasta, local salads and some spectacular Friulani wines.
- O/N Albero Nascosto Hotel, Trieste.
- Meals included: Dinner
Day 2 – 2nd April, Saturday – Trieste
After a leisurely breakfast in the hotel, we’ll meet up in the lobby for a day exploring this magical and unique city. We’ll start with the extensive waterfront and discover the trading history of the city of Trieste. Trieste was established as a Roman municipality known as Tergeste in 177 BC, it was an important port and trading centre linking Istria and Magna Grecia with the Italian peninsula and Roman Empire. There’s a Roman theatre and the remains of a Roman Arch still visible.
Trieste became important in the late 14th century when, so the story goes, citizens of the city invited Austria to claim Trieste as Austria’s port on the Mediterranean. This began a long period of trading prosperity for the people of Trieste. The city gained free port status in 1719, by which time it was an emporium for goods coming from all corners of the Mediterranean. The city continued to develop as a prosperous and cosmopolitan port with a strong literary and musical tradition until the 1930s. Lunch today will be at one of Trieste’s famous Literary Cafes.
This afternoon we’ll explore the numerous Viennese style cafes that are still going strong in the centre of Trieste. The city was a major importer of coffee beans and several famous Italian coffee brands are based here, Illy and Hausbrandt. We’ll visit Caffe San Marco, Caffe degli Specchi and Caffe Tommaseo. These cafes help us to understand the culture of Trieste in the 18th and 19th centuries and why the city became a mecca for ‘new thinking’. James Joyce and Sigmund Freud both spent long periods of time here in Trieste.
This evening we’ll enjoy a fish supper over-looking the port and Trieste’s imposing waterfront.

Day 3 – 3rd April, Sunday – Trieste – Revoltella Museum – Muggia
After breakfast, we’ll stroll to the wonderful Revoltella Museum, former home of Barone Revoltella, a businessman and character who originally haled from Venice. Revoltella made Trieste his home, he was a huge personality and one of the original share-holders in the Suez Canal Company. He filled his home with incredible art which is still on display as it was during his lifetime. There’s an enormous sculpture representing the building of the Suez Canal and numerous paintings by Cesare dell’Acqua – a prolific 19th century artist in Trieste.
For a charming introduction to the museum check out this short video: Coffee with Barone Revoltella made and probably paid for by the dynamic and inspiring Trieste Tourist Office.
The area around the museum is lively and often hosts a street market which is fun to explore. Around about lunch time we’ll take a boat ride across the Golfo di Trieste to Muggia, a charming seaside town. Muggia is very close to the border with Slovenia and is a great place to wander and explore. There’ll be free time in Muggia and then (depending on the weather) either an early supper in the old town or the ferry back to Trieste for dinner in the city. Either way Gelateria Penguino next to the famous molo (pier) in Trieste awaits us.

- Meals included: Breakfast, Dinner
Day 4 – 4th April, Monday – Trieste – Miramare – Duino – Cividale (Friuli)
We’ll travel along the coast today to the Castello of Miramare, a magnificent sparkling white confection, built in the 1860s by Maximilian brother of Austrian Emperor Franz Josef. Maximilian loved the sea and built this fairytale castle for his bride Carlotta. We’ll visit the castle and gardens before continuing to Duino, a medieval castle with an equally fascinating history. Duino has been home to the Counts of Torre and Tasso for more than four centuries. During the Second World War it was a barracks for British and New Zealand troops. You can read more about Miramare here: Miramare Castle and Maximilian
Next we’ll head inland into the heart of Friuli wine country. In the Colli Orientali and Cividale area some of the finest white wines in Italy are produced, we’ll enjoy a visit to an enoteca where the local producers are represented. Lunch and a tasting are included. Cividale is a UNESCO world heritage site. There’s time to enjoy the medieval streets and frescoed houses of this delightful town – not to mention the superb Lombard Chapel. We’ll enjoy several hours this afternoon in this charming historic town.
- O/N Albero Nascosto Hotel, Trieste.
- Meals included: Breakfast, Lunch
Day 5 – 5th April, Tuesday – Trieste – Palmanova – Aquileia – Venice
Today we head west out of Trieste bound for Palmanova a fascinating geometric military town, built by the Venetians to keep the Austrians at bay in the 1590s. The project was originally supervised by Marcantonio Barbero, of Villa Barbaro (Maser) fame. Palmanova was a fortress town, walled and fortified to keep the enemy at bay. A curious place for coffee and to admire the vast and eerily empty central square.
Next it’s down to the coast to visit the city of Aquileia, a Roman town with exceptional Roman mosaics and numerous active archaeological digs. The medieval basilica and campanile dominate the town. Everywhere you look there are excavations taking place with numerous universities, both Italian and from overseas taking part. We’ll have a light lunch here in Aquileia before continuing on our way to Venice (about two hours to our west).
In the late afternoon we’ll board our boat bound for the historic heart of Venice and our centrally located hotel, with private jetty right on the water. Our hotel has an exquisite terrace, the sort of place where you want to sit and dream for ever. On arrival we’ll check into our comfortable rooms and then meet downstairs on the terrace for prosecco and canapes.
- O/N Monaco & Grand Canal Hotel, San Marco, Venezia.
- Meals included: Breakfast, Lunch
Day 6 – 6th April, Wednesday – Venice
Today is all about discovering Venice, starting with each of the sestiere (districts) of the city. We will start with Dorsoduro which we will reach by traghetto (a traditional flat-bottomed boat) rowed by two Venetian oarsmen. Custom dictates that you stand up on the traghetto, but that’s not compulsory! Dorsoduro is the part of Venice where the Guggenheim Art Gallery is located and La Salute – the famous church built to celebrate Venice’s survival of the plague in the 16th century. We will visit both buildings and enjoy a stroll along Zattere, the waterfront facing Giudecca. We’ll have lunch with a wonderful view to Redentore and San Giorgio Maggiore.
Later we’ll continue to San Polo, another Venetian sestiere where we’ll meet an artisan paper maker and watch the skillful process of hand colouring paper. By aperitivo time we’ll be at Rialto – just in time for an Aperol Spritz and some delicious Venetian cicchetti. From Rialto we’ll either walk or hop on the vaporetto back to the hotel.
This evening dinner is at a nearby osteria, where the main dining room is in a former chapel. To reach the restaurant we’ll walk through San Marco and Castello (that’s two more sestiere visited).
- O/N Monaco & Grand Canal Hotel, San Marco, Venezia.
- Meals included: Breakfast, Dinner
Day 7 – 7th April, Wednesday – Venice
From our hotel we’ll stroll along the Merceria today – the main commercial street linking San Marco and Rialto, our destination today is Scuola San Marco – a former guild hall and now possibly one of the most beautiful hospital entrances in the world. After a glimpse inside we’ll visit Gianni Basso – a traditional printer, working in Venice for decades. He uses printing machines salvaged from the Armenian monks of San Lazzaro in the 1980s. To read more about San Lazzaro
From Fondamenta Nova it’s a boat ride across the lagoon (by private boat) to Burano for a wonderful fish lunch at Da Romano. This is one of life’s golden moments. Risotto and fresh fish are the house specialities. Nearby is the island of Torcello, one of the original points in the lagoon where a permanent community developed, as the Roman Empire declined. In the Basilica of Torcello which dates from the 12th century there is a spectacular ‘Last Judgement’ mosaic. The tortures of Hell are vividly shown in black and red whilst the joys of Paradise are represented in green and gold and blue. A sobering message for the God-fearing congregation of medieval times.
Our private boat will whisk us back across the lagoon as the sun goes down.

In addition to the Women’s Tour and football’s Euro 2016 tournament, the United Kingdom is being occupied by something else at the moment too. On June 23rd, the referendum to decide on a potential Brexit is being held. The campaigns to get people to vote ‘yes’ or ‘no’ have been running for months.
Ever since the referendum was announced, I have felt we’re witnessing something huge. Talk of leaving the European Union has been in the mouths of politicians before – in the Netherlands too. But the UK is the first country to actually put it up to public vote.
It might prove a decisive moment for European politics in the years to come. The UK joined the European Coal and Steel Community in 1973 and has been an important player in the EU the last half century. Like Dutch newspaper AD put it: “An EU without the UK would be like tea without milk. Bitter.” If the country does leave the EU, this is important (and in my view dramatic) in economic, socio-political and historical terms.
A whole different dimension was added to the event when Labour MP Jo Cox was fatally injured outside her constituency surgery last Thursday. I was shocked, just like many others. Whether the murder was politically motivated isn’t confirmed yet, but the attacker supposedly shouted ‘put Britain first!’ at least twice before he shot and knifed Jo Cox. She was campaigning for Britain to stay in the European Union.
I didn’t know how to incorporate this information into my report of the Women’s Tour. I couldn’t unite the events. While the Women’s Tour celebrates the fantastic cycling culture in the UK, and the women’s cycling sport in particular, the other is a horrendous act of violence, not doing any good for Britain’s already semi-detached relationship with the EU.
Then Lizzie Armitstead (Boels-Dolmans) did something fantastic when she won the Women’s Tour stage 3 yesterday.
It was perfect. It was a small gesture, but I appreciated it immensely. Maybe exactly because it was so small. The horrendous act of one madman should not affect one of UK’s nicest women’s cycling events. But Jo Cox should be honoured, and Armitstead found the perfect way to combine both.
I am now given the opportunity to extend my condolences to family and friends of Jo Cox and to express my disgust with people like this, who feel they have the right to take the life of a hard working woman over something like this. With some ease of mind, I can now return to reporting on stage 4 of the Aviva Women’s Tour. This young and wonderful stage race, that is entertaining women’s cycling fans as part of the Women’s WorldTour now.
Today’s stage was as thrilling as the first three stages. After a quiet first part of the stage, the second half was very exciting to follow on social media and through the Women’s Tour live blog. A stage with four riders versus a chase group, that left it to the final meters of the race to unite, which saw Marianne Vos (Rabo-Liv) finally take that much sought after win in the 2016 Aviva Women’s Tour.
The stage
After a relatively easy build-up, most of the 1,500 climbing meters in today’s stage came after the halfway point. The route dipped into the National Forest after 25 kilometers, where the first intermediate sprint was located.
A second intermediate sprint and two QOM’s would have to be contested by the peloton today.
How the race unfolded
The peloton left Nottingham at 10:15 a.m. GMT, with the official start given fifteen minutes later.
No idea who’s winning. #AvivaWT2016 pic.twitter.com/rsCFHcicVo

A crash early in the race brought the Luxembourg champion down, sixth in the GC at 32 seconds from teammate Armitstead. Her team reported she chased back with a determined look on her face and joined the peloton not much later, ready to support the GC leader again, bloodied jersey and all.

The intermediate sprint, just after leaving Hartshorne where one of the many spectators filmed the peloton passing, was used by Marianne Vos (Rabo-Liv), Armitstead and Leah Kirchmann (Liv-Plantur) to collect some bonus points for the GC. The three women have been contesting the intermediate sprints from day one.
In between all the action, hydration is important! At Cervélo-Bigla, Lisa Klein made sure her teammates were topped up with liquids throughout the stage.

Some riders are always great to have in a race, since they will always entertain if they have the legs for it (and sometimes even when they don’t). Emilia Fahlin (Ale Cipollini) is one of those riders. After unsuccessfully trying to get into a break in the last couple of days, today she was finally given the go ahead by the peloton.
When Fahlin accumulated her lead to 2 minutes, attacks started coming from the peloton. However, since this was considered to be a stage for a breakaway, and yesterday’s stage was won by someone in the break as well, the peloton was not so keen to let a big group of riders get away.
The gap between Fahlin and the peloton decreased to 1’10” as the second intermediate sprint came up, with Fahlin obviously taking the 3 points and bonus seconds. Vos won the sprint in the peloton, followed by Armitstead.
After the crash in stage 1 just before the final kilometer of the race, no other notable crash had occurred since then. Today was different. After Majerus’ nasty crash at the beginning of the stage, a large one happened a few kilometers before reaching the first QOM.
Big crash at 87km. A lot of teams involved. Most riders seemed ok. 35″ to Fahlin #AvivaWT2016
— Cervélo Bigla (@CerveloBigla) 18 June 2016
VoxWomen reported that all riders were able to get up and chase back to the peloton. A little later, one rider unfortunately wasn’t able to continue.
All riders except Van der Breggen that were involved in crash are back up and riding. VDB has withdrawn w/ injuries. #AvivaWT2016
— Boels-Dolmans (@boelsdolmansct) 18 June 2016
With several riders less than were on the start line this morning – as Grace Garner (Team GB) and Amélie Rivat (PC Futuroscope) abandoned earlier in the stage -, Fahlin and the peloton reached the first QOM of stage 4. The Aviva Women’s Tour has an incredible partner in the QOM jersey’s title sponsor Strava. They have published overview videos of the all the QOM’s in this year’s Women’s Tour. If you want coverage and attention for your race, this is the way to do it!
Fahlin was caught before she reached the summit of today’s first QOM sprint, Ramshorn, and it was won by Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio (Cervélo-Bigla).
The second QOM caused fireworks, with yellow jersey wearer Armitstead herself attacking. Once again, she got company from Moolman-Pasio and Elisa Longo Borghini (Wiggle-High5), Armitstead’s closest chasers in the GC, plus Emma Johansson (Wiggle-High5) – twelfth in the GC at 47 seconds after stage 3.
While the four leaders passed the top of the Oakamoor climb, a group of chasers escaped the peloton, among them best young rider Floortje Mackaij (Liv-Plantur), GC contenders Amanda Spratt (Orica-AIS), Vos, Amy Pieters (Wiggle-High5), Kirchmann, Lisa Brennauer (Canyon-SRAM) and Giorgia Bronzini (Wiggle-High5), plus several other big name riders.
Out of the GC top 10, only Majerus wasn’t in the lead group or among the chasers, which surely had to do with her crash at the beginning of the stage.
The four leaders worked well together and still had 18 seconds to the chasers at six kilometers from the finish, but Sarah Connelly already looked to the situation if the two groups came together. Armitstead would be in the best position (with teammates Amalie Dideriksen, Chantal Blaak and Ellen van Dijk in the chase group), while both Moolman-Pasio and Vos wouldn’t have any teammates in that group.
Good news for Armitstead, if caught, the chase includes 4 teamies – 2 for Johansson & Longo Borghini – none for Moolman #AvivaWT2016

A very exciting finale followed, with only 9 seconds advantage for the leaders left as they entered the last three kilometers.

After losing the yellow jersey yesterday, Vos redeemed herself by winning the Derbyshire stage in the Women’s Tour today. Three top 5 results in stages 1 to 3, now finally a victory for her in stage 4.
Vos jumped from fifth to fourth in the GC, but Armitstead increased her lead in the GC by three seconds due to the bonus seconds she collected at the intermediate sprints. She is now 8 seconds ahead of Moolman-Pasio and 10 ahead of Longo-Borghini.

Stage 5
Northamptonshire was host to the first stage of the inaugural Women’s Tour back in 2014 and with a stage in the 2015 edition as well, Northamptonshire is the only county to have hosted a full stage in all of the three Women’s Tour editions so far. It’s therefore very suiting that the 2016 race should finish in the Northamptonshire city of Kettering, where the third Women’s Tour winner will be crowned.
Starting from the county town of Northampton, stage 5 will include some new routes and several climbs before finishing in the Kettering town centre.Property Attributes

Via Goldman Sachs,
The speed of credit expansion exceeds that seen prior to other credit crises in history, this expansion has not been matched by economic growth, and, of course, the more “shadowy” sources of much of the credit growth raise doubts about its soundness.
When you look at crises elsewhere, a lot of the same precursors are present in China. .
Leverage has been increasing rapidly.
and the source is becoming increasingly in the shadows…
But shifting to these sources means increasingly expensive funding (and thus increasingly unfeasible projects in a lower growth regime)
and Corporate leverage is on the rise…
There is no formal definition of shadow banking in China, but a common understanding is that shadow banking encompasses credit exposures that are sourced from outside a formal banking system. They are summarsised as follows:
And the relationship with the formal banking system is as follows…
Meaning that problems in one leak into the other very rapidly…
We see four broader areas of potential triggers that could catalyze an undesirable credit event:
1. Weak demand. Most likely due to lackluster exports or domestic overcapacity.
2. Intentional tightening. Regulations (i.e. monetary, fiscal, FX) to slow credit growth that may have unintended consequences.
3. Dissolution of implicit guarantees. If we start to see frequent defaults from trust or wealth management products, investors may recognize that they are not guaranteed by banks, and demand for such products may plummet, leading to refinancing shortfalls. Local governments’ implicit guarantees of LGFVs credits are another risk area.
4. Property sector collapse. Either caused by policymakers’ intentional price expectation management downward, or unintended consequences of widespread property tax or stringent anti-corruption asset disclosure laws.
We think that the former three present more imminent risks, whereas policymakers are less likely to push hard on the latter.
Which leaves the question for policymakers – Where do we go from here: “Proactive” or “Forbearance”?
Whereas the previous leadership tended to prioritize cyclical growth, the new leadership has already started to lean towards a more proactive approach to dealing with existing credit risks as well as pre-empting new ones via fiscal, monetary and other reforms. We believe that they will prioritize being proactive, but may opt for periods of forbearance (delay dealing with problems but not exacerbate them) in order to keep growth mostly stable and avert setting off credit risk triggers. This will be a delicate balancing act, but a challenge that must be taken on in order to minimize medium term risks. In the near term, reforms may pose headwinds to China growth, equities and credit performance.
Although it is admittedly difficult to tell “bad” from “good” booms in real time, Goldman finds that around half of the “bad” booms had one of the following three characteristics: (1) credit boom lasting longer than six years, (2) annual rate of increase in credit-to-GDP ratio exceeding 25% during the boom, or (3) credit¬to-GDP ratio higher than 60% heading into the boom.
For comparison, China is in year 5 of its boom that started at the end of 2008, corporate leverage-to-GDP (including LGFV leverage) has risen at an annual rate of just under 10% per annum (and total leverage about 15% per annum on average), and the starting point of the credit-to-GDP ratio was well above 60% — corporate and LGFV leverage together accounted for 113% of GDP at the end of 2008, and total leverage was slightly above 150% of GDP. So, while not all signals are flashing “red”, many are.

I have to say that it costs a lot of money to make up. Not to mention all kinds of cosmetics of various brands and functions, it is enough to say that the makeup brushes is enough to make people big. There are many kinds of makeup brushes, such as powder brush, repair brush, foundation brush, blush brush, high gloss brush, halo dye brush, color brush, nose shadow brush, eye shadow brush, eyebrow brush and so on. They each have their own uses, but many girls do not care if they run out, but that will damage the makeup brush.
We have always stressed that we should do a good job in removing makeup and skin cleaning, but many girls may forget to clean makeup tools! You know, a used makeup brush may be harboring more than 40000 bacteria. Do you think that your thick pores or acne is because you didn't choose the right skin care products? No, these bacteria may be the cause of your skin problems!
However, when it comes to cleaning our makeup brushes, we may postpone it until the next day, or until one day a thick layer of sticky cosmetics sticks together, then the brush may be a breeding ground for bacteria, which may lead to allergies and other problems in our skin, which is why you need to give your sacred brush tool a good wash.
Top 8 Reasons To Clean Your Makeup Brushes
Most experts believe that makeup brushes should be cleaned at least once a week to prevent bacteria, dust and grease from accumulating on them. But there are many other reasons if you don't have to clean the brush regularly every day.
1. Aggravating potential skin problem
Putting bacteria and germs back onto your face with a sticky, dusty makeup brush can aggravate underlying skin conditions like acne. If you have an open sore, pore or cracked skin, bacteria can start an infection. You'll be swapping the infection back and forth creating a never-ending cycle of breakouts. This is the biggest of all the reasons to clean your makeup brushes, but let's continue, shall we?
2. Prevent virus infection
If you've never thought about cleaning your brushes, maybe this will convince you to clean them thoroughly and often! Dirty brushes can cause viral infections. If you use a worn-out brush or share it with someone else, there will be a lot of microbes on the brush. Sharing eye makeup brushes and lip brushes also increases the risk of conjunctivitis and herpes, respectively. So don't underestimate the task of cleaning the brush. Now wash!
3. Skin irritation
Makeup bristles caked with product can dry out, causing them to become brittle, making them abrasive to your skin. Ouch! Scouring your face with scratchy makeup brushes can irritate and roughen the texture of your soft skin. It can even make your skin look dull. Cleaning your brushes on the regular keeps them soft and supple. You want your makeup brushes to feel like a soft cloud on your face, not a Brillo pad.
4. Herpes and pinkeye
Your lipgloss and mascara containers are a dark and moist environment, where herpes loves to live. You can clean your lipgloss wands and your lipstick with a spritz of rubbing alcohol. Please, never share your lip/eye brushes, mascara or eyeliner with anyone! You'll just be swapping germs with your BFF.
5. High quality makeup brushes need maintenance
We know that spending money on high quality cosmetics is an investment, so you won't regret how expensive the product is. But if you spend a lot of money on cosmetics every year, shouldn't you give them the care they deserve? Make up brushes are one of the more expensive tools. If you don't want your money wasted, clean your makeup brushes regularly. The more times you clean them, the longer they last.
6. Contamination
Cosmetic gels and creams are wet environments waiting for your dirty brush bristles, where bacteria can multiply. Liquid makeup gets older much faster than powder. Have a separate brush for each cosmetic to avoid contamination between them.
7. Makeup effect
If your brush is dirty, you won't have the color you want on your skin. In addition, mixing and shaping the dramatic effects of your cosmetics will be difficult. You want your skin to look porcelain smooth after makeup. Dirty make-up brushes can leave spots on your face.
8. As dirty as your hands
Dirty make-up brushes are as bad as fingers. Put a foundation, powder or shadow on your face, even with clean hands. The oil on your hands is more likely to spread bacteria on your face than a brush. We don't want germs on our faces because they cause blemishes and other nasty skin irritation. Hands on your face can even spread flu and cold germs
Makeup brushes cleaning mistakes
1. The brush should be vigorously rubbing and twisting the bristles, so that the brush can be washed clean
The bristles of the brush are actually very fragile, so when cleaning, you should try to be as light and soft as baby. If necessary, you can use some tools to help, which can not only protect the brush, but also wash it more cleanly!
2. When soaking the brush cleaning solution, the longer the soak, the cleaner it will be
Generally, the soaking time is about 1 minute. After that, as long as the brush is cleaned, and there is no residual color cosmetics on toilet paper.
When washing the brush, the whole brush must be flushed at 360 degrees, so that the brush will be clean
3. When cleaning the brush, the water can only flush down the direction of the hair flow, and try not to touch the water at the junction of the pen holder and the bristles,
To avoid the joint of the glue off, resulting in brush dehairing or damage, if the pen holder soaked in water is also easy to cause mildew !
4. After washing, the brush should be dried and sterilized in the sun
Basically, after cleaning the brush, first use toilet paper or clean towel to absorb the excess water, and then hang it on the brush holder to dry in the shade,Or the way of horizontal can also be used, do not use inverted hanging mode, so that water has the opportunity to flow into the pen holder.
5. The brush is not dry for several days. Use a blower to speed up the air drying
Brush is only suitable for indoor natural drying, using a blower hot air drying will damage the bristles, increase the speed and opportunity of brush damage!
How to clean makeup brushes
To start the cleaning process, first wet the bristles with warm water.
Next, squeeze some shampoo into a bowl or cup filled with warm water.
Use the brush in the water, gently massage the tip of the bristles to remove the dirt.
Clean the bristles with clean water and squeeze out the excess water.
Let the brush dry in a well ventilated place. The bristles hang on the edge of the counter to let the excess water drip down.
Once they're completely dry, put them on the dresser and don't have to look around for them next time.As Australian shipping grows, how can we avoid collisions with marine animals?

2018 was a challenging year for Nicaragua. Despite the ongoing economic crisis, we are extremely proud of our team and its efforts during these difficult times. Its positive attitude and eagerness to always give its best under all circumstances are inspiring!
We are confident 2019 will be an impactful year. We started it off by celebrating at our Annual Health Fair on February 2! The substantial number of people who look forward to our Health Fair – higher every year – continues to energize us. They come from many communities and remote villages.
This event has become a yearly tradition at the Roberto Clemente Health Clinic. We are delighted to learn what it means to the people of the surrounding communities – especially during times of adversity.
Spreading Gratitude!
Thank you, Dr. Fred Mandell, pediatrician at Boston Children’s Hospital, for coming to the Clinic as a volunteer and helping tremendously at the fair.
On behalf of our entire Clinic team, we would like to extend a special thanks to Mrs. Rosemarie Antonelli Turner and the Turner family for choosing to honor the life of Mr. Alvin “Al” Turner Sr. by asking that donations be made to our Clinic in lieu of flowers. We greatly appreciate such an incredible gesture and all the contributions received from friends and family.
We would also like to express our gratitude to long-time supporter Bill Bonner for recently donating a vehicle to our Clinic.
All these donations are already making a tremendous impact in 2019.
Clean Water Means Health
It is important to highlight the large donations of water that were made in 2018 to nearby health centers – Las Salinas, Las Canas, Asentamiento and San Ignacio. Approximately 463 people benefited.
Last year, we also expanded our coverage by giving support to two schools – Limón 2 and Virgen Morena – for a total of four schools and approximately 768 children now benefiting from this project.
We provided water bottles to 53 families of different communities neighboring the Clinic. There is an average of four to five individuals per family, which means more than 200 people enjoyed our purified water in 2018.
We also distribute purified water to all attendees of our weekly Diabetics Club meetings. We hold talks on the importance of drinking clean water, the differences in consumption and the risk of diseases when consuming contaminated water.
Eat Healthy, Be Healthy
In 2018, we were able to build 22 new gardens and monitor 30 gardens we started the year before, concluding with a total of 52 organic gardens.
Our main objective is to educate all our participants so that, with our workshops and progress monitoring for two years, they learn the skills to harvest for the rest of their lives. And even more significantly, they will gain the confidence to train other interested parties to replicate the methodology.
As part of this initiative, we provide new participants with protective mesh and seeds to start their gardens.
The construction of beds is always the most physically demanding task, but we observe that participants, specifically diabetics, improve their health and state of mind by doing this physical work.
We also started organic gardens at local public schools. We believe that involving children at an early age is extremely important to impart values of respect and love for Mother Nature.
Many people in the communities see the satisfactory results of the gardens, and they change their mindset that lands in the area are not useful. We’ve had a significant increase in requests from families who are now interested in creating new organic gardens.
With patience and determination, we promote the teaching of organic agriculture. We transmit to each individual the need to change old soil management habits learned from previous generations. These old ways have done so much damage to our soil and environment.
We teach families to use vacant lands and make them productive in a harmonious and balanced way with the environment. This is what drives our agricultural engineer, Eliezer.
Eliezer is in charge of our Heathy Eating Initiative at the Clinic. He is an agricultural engineer with a degree from Escuela Internacional de Agricultura y Ganadería (EIAG) in Rivas, Nicaragua.
Before Eliezer started our project in 2014, he worked on a tree nursery project growing vegetables. He’s also been a landscape foreman at Nicaragua’s top golf course.
Our beekeeping project continues to develop. Our apiculture module – now consisting of five beehives – will continue to grow. We are planning to add three more beehives by the end of 2019 for a total of eight. Although the amount of precipitation has not been ideal, the bees are very healthy.
Sponsorship and Volunteering
Our main goal is to provide healthcare, support education and improve the nutrition of the children who are part of the Padrino Program.
We love to encourage children to expand their academic performance through emotional support and motivation from our Clinic team.
We are always coming up with new activities to get the children motivated and involved. Cleaning sessions were carried out in some areas of the Clinic for embellishment and maintenance of our facilities, including the organic garden. Children have also supported our Clinic team during an educational fair for diabetes prevention. They were a huge help assisting with entertainment activities and logistics.
During these times of crisis, many local professionals have come to the Clinic to offer their services and expertise as volunteers. In November, local volunteer María José Calero Zavala, a psychologist from Managua, Nicaragua, visited the clinic to help and monitor Padrino Program children with special needs. She will be coming by every two weeks to continue her work with these children.
We are extremely hopeful about what 2019 will bring for our Clinic.
We humbly ask you to please consider helping us with our programs. We do not have any grants or endowments, and we rely on individual donors like you to continue operating.
If you have any questions or would like further information about any of our initiatives,The Finnish Oulu-based female fronted hard rock band Lost Division is set to release their debut album ‘Cuts And Scars’ on May 28th 2021 via Inverse Records. Their first single ‘The Queen’ from the album is already released.
So it’s time to introduce you to the band and let’s find out some more about the album! And so I asked them some questions.
First of all can you tell us something about the history of the band?
Lost Division is a metal-leaning hard rock band established in 2015, that has stabilized their style and configuration after a few member changes. Lost Division was originally a desk-drawer demo project for its core members, and refining the project ended up with the birth of the band. The first single release of ‘Wish You Were Dead’ came out in 2018. In 2019 the singer changed and the band started to gather material for their debut album, which was recorded in 2020.
Please introduce yourselves.
Line up:
Maija Väsänen –Vocals
Antti Ovaska –Rhythm guitar
Jaakko Korpi –Lead guitar
Mikael Luukela –Bass
Jaha-Matti Sipola -Drums
When I look at the information on social media it’s not easy to find out how you call your music. And when I listen to the album I hear a lot of metal/hard rock influences. How will you describe it?
We would describe our music as female fronted metal-leaning hard rock.
The new single ‘The Queen’ is, as you call it , ‘t he more calm and melancholic side of the upcoming album’. So what can we expect when we listen to the other songs?
You can expect heavier and more upbeat songs. The melancholic feeling although is there throughout the whole album.
The album was already recorded in 2020 but the release will be on May 28 th 2021. Is there a particular reason why just then?
No particular reason. Although there were some thinking to do with the cover art, publishing etc.
Who is responsible for the music parts and the lyrics on the album?
Music is mainly composed by Antti. Maija has composed all the vocal melodies and she writes the lyrics. Arrangements we do together as a band.
I also can read that there’s a message in your songs. Where are the songs about and is there a message for the people who will listen to it?
Lyrics describe personally felt cruelty of life. Lost Division wants to portray even the more difficult topics without self-pity and with the awareness of the fragile and unique value of life. We do not aim to change the world with our music, but want to tell you how it feels when life is kicking you in the head.
Who came up with the title of the album, ‘Cuts & Scars’?
In the song, “Mayhem” there’s a line “cruelty, cuts and scars” and we all thought that it sums up the theme of the album quite nicely.
Can you tell us how the recordings went?
All recording is made by ourselves in Lost Division’s own Liiteri studio. We wanted the record to be as good as possible, so it did take a long time, testing and finding proper sounds, but we are happy with the result. Altogether, the recording was hard at times but it was also so rewarding.
Which is (are) your favorite track(s) on the new album?
‘The Queen’ and ‘Mayhem’ are my personal favorites (Maija). I obviously like the sad ones.
Will there be a release party when the album will be released?
We hope so. Because of the corona you really can’t tell how it will play out and if it’s possible to have a party or not.
Will there be another single we can enjoy before the album will be released?
Yes, second single “Trapped” will come out in April. And a third one before the album. The third single is called “No God”.

Bella Hadid was one of the firsts this summer to break out her vintage tankini while spending some seaside time with friends recently, and we’re sure this is just the start. While the trend may be as polarizing as the comeback of low-rise jeans (those are sadly making a comeback as well), we couldn’t help but love the tankini trend for its nostalgic and wearable factors. You can get away with wearing your swimsuit top as a regular top and style it with shorts or a skirt. We’re totally here for the versatility.
While plenty of people have always loved the tankini style for its coverage and versatility, the new iteration we’re seeing now all have a fresh feel to them. Brands like Mikoh, Frankies Bikinis, and Ookioh have also released tankinis in bright colors and prints. Plus, the tops come in a shorter length which makes them more flattering. While the consensus is still up on the skinny jeans debate, we’re predicting this swimsuit rend is going to take over in 2021.

News Excerpt
Recently, the Finance Ministry announced plans to extend and modify the Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme (PCGS) 2.0. It has been decided to extend the scheme for three more months to build up the portfolio. The Ministry had expanded the scope of the partial credit guarantee scheme (PCGS) to provide greater flexibility to state-owned banks in purchasing bonds and CPs of Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).
Pre-Connect
• The Central government had announced the PCGS in July 2019, allowing public sector banks to purchase high-rated pooled assets from financially sound NBFCs and Housing finance companies (HFCs).
• As a part of its AtmaNirbhar initiative, the Finance Ministry had extended the scheme in May to cover primary market issuance of bonds by NBFCs, HFCs and micro finance institutions (MFIs) with low credit ratings.
• The idea was to provide liquidity support to institutions with low credit ratings and ensure continuity of credit support to small businesses, which were the worst hit during the COVID- 19 outbreak.
Analytica
Under PCGS 2.0, the Centre provided 20% first loss sovereign guarantee to public sector banks, resulting in liquidity infusion of Rs. 45 Rs. 11,250 crore.
According to the ministry, this will be extended to 50%, as the 25% ceiling for AA/AA- rated bonds and CPs was nearly met, while the appetite for low-rated papers is inching towards saturation, considering its lower ticket size.
The Cabinet also approved a special liquidity scheme worth Rs 30,000 crore, under which the Reserve Bank of India will indirectly purchase debt sold by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), housing finance companies (HFCs) and micro-finance institutions (MFIs)
Issues
This is a step towards increased funding for bigger NBFCs which have higher ratings, while the actual objective was to provide greater funding to small and medium NBFCs.
The government needs to expand the scope so as to extend the guarantee cover to term loans of banks and financial institutions given to NBFCs.
Less than 100 NBFCs have been covered under the scheme.
A majority of small and medium NBFCs turn to term loans, instead of raising funds via bonds or CPs.
Way Forward
NBFCs play a crucial role in sustaining consumption demand as well as capital formation in the small and medium segment, thus it is essential that they continue to get funding without disruption, and the extended PCGS is expected to systematically enable the same. The government can further expand the scope of the Scheme so as to extend the guarantee cover to term loans of banks and financial institutions given to NBFCs. decade, all wrapped up in a cookbook.
For over ten years, I have been teaching sold-out classes. The first class was held in the kitchen of my children’s pre-school to current day, where I teach the class in my bakery, Jenny Cookies Bake Shop. It’s been an exciting journey. I’ve met hundreds of women eager to learn how to make my signature buttercream decorated sugar cookies. They arrive to the class doubtful they’ll be able to replicate my cookies yet leave nearly prancing out the door, inspired and filled with confidence holding a box of sugar cookies that they decorated themselves. Most of them leave the class completely cookie obsessed.
Women (and a handful of men!) have come from all over the state as well as the country to attend a cookie class. It’s always been so humbling to have the opportunity to share my knowledge and skills with others. To teach someone to create something that builds their confidence and pride is truly amazing. Then to take it a step further and share that hand rolled, hand decorated cookie with friends and family that’s not only spread with buttercream, it’s spread with love. It’s so much more than just a cookie.
Some of you may have never been to a class, but you’ve been inspired by my cookies in other ways. You’ve used the recipes from Eat More Dessert, followed tips and tricks on my site and socials and have since become quite talented buttercream cookie decorators! It’s absolutely incredible to see how far buttercream decorated sugar cookies have come in the last thirteen years. I love that you guys continue to tag me in all your creations on your social media pages AND send your friends to my blog and book for the BEST SUGAR COOKIE EVER recipe! You are the best!!
The point of sharing the history of my cookie classes and how many people continue to use my recipe and techniques is to validate the credibility and history of a Jenny Cookie, and why it was so important it to me to package up all this knowledge into something tangible like a book. It’s not just another cookie decorating book. This is your go-to, must-have cookie handbook. You’ll never need another sugar cookie book because everything you need is inside COOKIE CLASS!
And the best part is, this book is even more than my class. I’ve made a few adjustments to my signature recipe to make them THE best sugar cookies you’ve ever tasted and, in addition to my basic recipe, I’m sharing all-new flavors and mix-ins that will rock your world, and your taste buds. The icing and cookie flavor combinations are endless!
I don’t want to give too much away..but I haven’t even started with the gorgeous photos and step-by-step images shot by Kelly Clare Photography. It will hands-down be the cutest and most used cookie book you’ll buy!
Stay tuned for more peeks inside as well as more COOKIE CLASS fun… but for now, go treat yourself! Grab a copy HERE!

Micalya competed in the Tomato Massacre in Los Banos, information pills hosted by CrossFit Valley View on Saturday. Micayla competed in 3 tough WODs: a HSPU/pistol/burpee/DU mash, buy information pills a Run/Snatch, visit this and a Death by Barbell except the barbell was an axel. Which is harder folks.
I didn’t make it to Los Banos until her third WOD, but her spirits were high, and I saw her really battle through the death by axel bar, taking 5th in the competition. These WODs are no joke – they all had high skill components
Based on her performance, Micayla earned her way into the finals in her first individual competition. The finals were NO JOKE: a 200m run, 30 GHD sit-ups, a 115# walking lunge, 30 53# Kettlebell Swings, another walking lunge, 30 more GHD sit-ups, and finishing with 10 squat cleans at 135, all under a 10 minute cap. Whew.
I gotta be honest, as they were rolling out the GHD, I was thinking about telling Micayla to pull out. We’ve had a CFO athlete experience rhabdo in their first comp, and I wasn’t looking to have that happen again. But with a 10 minute cap, and the GHD kept at a relatively lower level, a thought she would be ok. Micayla was clearly nervous, and the venue was really packed. At least 200 fans cheered on the women, and I wanted Micayla to have the experience.
I was so proud of her – she smoked the 200m run, the lunge walk, and even the first round of GHD. We knew that KB was going to be a fight, and boy, it was. Micayla’s face was a mix between – WTF, man this is heavy, and I never want to pick it up, and oh, screw it. I always tear up in spots like this, and, well, no exception. Watching a 19 year old kid battle it out with experienced athletes was well worth the drive.
The best part of the WOD, with time running out, Micayla had seconds to strip her bar and try to get a least 1 rep of a heavy squat clean. She could have EASILY let time expire and leave the bar, but she hoped off the GHD, quickly stripped the bar as seconds were being called off, threw 45s on the bar, and busted out 1 squat clean as time expired.
I got to watch Micayla with her parents, which is always fun. It was their first CrossFit comp, and I can confidently say Micayla made her mama and papa proud.
I recommend the Tomato Massacre – it’s a small, well run event on the Los Banos Fairgrounds. It’s held in conjunction with the Tomato Festival, so there is plenty of food and stuff to do.
Finally, it’s a long drive from Oakiedale, but if you were to stop at the Hilamr Cheese Factory and get the Piglet Sandwich – a grilled ham, cheese and bacon with chiptole dressing on a GRILLED PRETZEL BUN you’d be winning.

The relationship with antiactin positive smooth muscle cells and PGP9.5-positive intramural innervation was also investigated by confocal microscopy. Anti-c-kit labelling demonstrated a network of elongated and branched c-kit positive cells, which were located in interstitial spaces, oriented in parallel to the smooth muscle bundles that form the bladder muscular layer, irrespective of dog sex. Cells with a similar localization were also PAS- and NADPHdiaphorase-positive. A contact between c-kit immunofluorescent cells and intramural innervation was demonstrated, too. The roles of interstitial cells might include regulation of smooth muscle activity of the bladder detrusor, integrating neuronal signalsduring urine storage and voiding.

They have a really high quality of food that only a few other places have. And..every dish there is always so good! The deal at Empress Palace is buy one entree, get one free. Wahoo! You also receive 15% off every time you go after the first time.
My mom and I like to order family style. We chose to order sweet and sour chicken and chicken egg foo young. All of their chicken dishes are made with white meat which is really awesome! These are two dishes we hadn't tried there before, and both were delicious.
The sweet and sour sauce was delicious and the portion size was huge.
The egg foo young patties were very large and so delicious and crispy! The rest of the dish tasted like it was cooked in a slow cooker...it just melted in my mouth!
With our Axxess card we saved $13.99! I definitely plan to return....after I have been to all of the other restaurants on my card LOL
As a side note...can you tell I took these pics with my phone? I think they came out pretty nice :)

Mmmm. I miss good Chinese food. Haven't had any in a while.
Very nice post. If you like Chinese food, you might like my take on Sichuan chicken.Brentford Nights. It goes without saying that an evening game at Griffin Park is always a special occasion and tonight’s visit of Derby County promises to be just that. With confidence high following Saturday’s demolition of Bolton Wanderers, the bar of expectation will have been raised and fans will be hoping for more. In our way stand a Rams side who also played a basement club in Birmingham City and came away with a point themselves.
I really can’t wait for this one. The marketing campaign – Brentford Nights – has given added spice to this one with the lure of Oktoberfest mentioned in the build up and an image of those iconic floodlight pylons on the promo poster. Much as I love the thought of German hot dogs and beer, I’d happily settle for a goal fest or a flood of points.
For Brentford, back to back league wins can only be the target. Full time will see us having reached the ‘ten game’ mark and the table having officially ‘taken shape’. Will the Bees be heading towards mid-table with another win and just four defeats from this opening period? Will we be starting to look like draw specialists? Or will we be sucked back towards the Birmingham zone at the foot of the division?
If nothing else, yet another changed line up is sure to come. Whether because of ongoing injury to John Egan or Dean Smith quite rightly rewarding the performance of his replacement at Bolton, EFL Star of the day (their words), Yoann Barbet. The BBC report Lasse Vibe and Sergi Canos as still injured and so I can’t see any further changes beyond the return of the Frenchman.
But then, why would you? Saturday’s game saw all the potential that Dean had talked about. You can only beat who you are up against and 3-0 away from home is as comprehensive as it comes. I can’t see any goalkeeper in the land as having been able to stop any of those goals. It just shows what happens when you have the confidence to shoot. I’m still in awe at all three strikes.
The Rams won’t be any form of rollover. Far from it. That same BBC report also suggests that there’ll be no Lawrence, no Davies and no Thorne in the side tonight for Derby. For which we can only be grateful as Tom, Curtis and George all remain doubts. Quite frankly, the less options available to manager Gary Rowett the better.
Yet you can still be sure that he’ll have any team he selects fired up and ready to go for it. If nothing else, the 4-0 tonking administered at Griffin Park last season will be a performance they’ll want some form of pay back for. Truly, the Bees were magnificent that day. More of the same will do very nicely, thank you.
The one disconcerting thing about this evening’s game is the club’s aforementioned strapline of : Brentford Nights.
It may just be me, but I can’t read it without thinking of bad TV. Very bad TV. So bad it’s beyond bad and is genuinely compelling TV. Namely, the David Hasselhoff spin off show: Baywatch Nights. A two series run in which Mitch Buchannon (the Hoff) swaps his red lifeguard’s shorts to form an after dark detective agency in Malibu. As you do.
Baywatch Nights. The Hoff. It really happened
As career changes go, it was leftfield. The strangest Hasselhoff vehicle since Kitt, the back talking car. Yet if the opening season plots – about serial killers, robbery, and Hasselhoff going undercover in the drag queen circuit (episode 10) were your standard Miami Vice lite – the second series went truly bizarre. Rather than drug rings and kidnapping, the show took an X-files twist as Hasselhoff and his team investigated vampire sightings, Werewolves, a museum mummy and a time travelling log cabin.
Odd doesn’t begin to describe it. Baywatch Nights never got a third series. Sadly. Mitch returned to the beach and the only surreal happening involving The Hoff were the four goals he scored in red and white. Yet it goes to show that the strangest things happen after dark.
Here’s hoping for more tonight. Strange things going on. Such as a home win. As for the Vampire sightings, I’ll settle for Scott Carson being scared of crosses.
I’ll get my coat.
The Hoff. Gone but not forgotten

Take a look at our full Wedding BrochureThe genetic disorder Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is characterized by low bone mass that predisposes children and adults to skeletal fracture. Most patients with OI have a mutation in one of the two genes that encode type 1 collagen. Current medical therapies for patients with OI are mostly anti-catabolic, acting by preventing bone turnover to increase bone mass. Unfortunately, these therapies are limited and inadequate. In proof of principle experiments, I have found that enhancing bone anabolism via the low density lipoprotein receptor related-protein 5 (LRP5) signaling pathway leads to significant increases in bone mass and bone strength in two mouse models of OI. In the present application, I intend 1) to precisely define the mechanism(s) by which enhanced LRP5 signaling improves bone properties in these mouse models of OI, 2) to determine whether enhanced LRP5 signaling can improve bone properties in other mouse models of OI that are due to different type 1 collagen mutational mechanisms, and 3) to test whether prenatal administration of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against sclerostin, an endogenous inhibitor of LRP5, is able to effect further improvements in bone properties and provide protection against immunogenicity-induced treatment resistance in comparison to postnatal anti-sclerostin antibody therapy. By addressing these aims, I will determine whether enhancing LRP5 signaling improves bone strength by increasing bone formation or by altering the repertoire of matrix proteins that are secreted by OI osteoblasts. I will also identify whether the type of mutation that causes OI determines whether enhancing LRP5 signaling will be beneficial or detrimental to human patients. Finally, using a mouse OI model, I will identify therapeutic strategies that best improve bone properties while minimizing the side effects of therapy.
Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a disorder of low bone mass and frequent fractures for which current medical therapies are limited. Increasing low density lipoprotein receptor related-protein 5 (LRP5) signaling improves bone density and strength in two mouse models of OI by increasing bone formation. This proposal aims to define how LRP5 signaling improves bone strength in mouse models of OI, to define which types of mutations are most likely to benefit from therapies targeting the LRP5 pathway, and to identify therapeutic strategies using mouse models of OI that will provide the most benefit to human patients.Angel Number 1220: Spiritual Discernment

READ ALSO:I have decided to use Nathaniel’s Top 10 post as a reason to do my own. This was a fairly difficult list to make, but it was likely easier than a list of “favorite” or “best” books. What makes this list different from those is that I don’t have to think the books are any good. They could in principle be awful. What matters is the impact they had on me. However, my life has been influenced by many articles and essays, which technically don’t count. For example, Nobel economist F.A. Hayek’s 1945 article “The Use of Knowledge in Society” was far more influential than, say, his famous book The Road to Serfdom. Hamlet continues to enthrall me and was the main reason I came to love Shakespeare. It ignites my emotions and a need to reflect in a way few works do. I didn’t include it mainly because it is a play, but also because my initial reading of it was intertwined with a viewing of Kenneth Branagh’s film version (which I love). The FARMS Review (now the Mormon Studies Review) was a highly influential journal for me and my main introduction to biblical and Mormon scholarship. My familiarity with academic journals was largely because of it. But obviously, journals don’t count. David Foster Wallace’s commencement speech/essay “This Is Water” has influenced the way I view the mundane in everyday life. This in turn inspired numerous blog posts, a conference paper, and a new direction of research for me. But it is an essay, not a book. Of course, there are my many kind and intelligent friends that have helped shape my views through discussions, recommendations, blog posts, theses and dissertations, etc. As you can see, plenty of influential pieces and people are being left out, some of which are pretty big.
Now that that has been clarified, let’s proceed with the list (in the order I read them):
1. The LDS Standard Works
Being a devout Latter-day Saint (Mormon), it shouldn’t be any surprise that our scriptural canon shows up on the list. One could say that the Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine & Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price are all separate books (and they’d be right), but as you can see in the pic, the four are often published together in a “quad.” These “standard works” are essentially the Mormon canon. Understanding the historical, cultural, textual, and theological meaning of these texts take up a considerable amount of my time and thinking. These are the foundational texts for the paradigm by which I make sense of life. And it was the desire to learn everything I could about these texts and their meaning(s) that eventually spilled over into various fields.
2. Bill Watterson, The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book (1995)
I often say that Calvin and Hobbes was my first introduction to philosophy. And I mean that quite seriously. I used to remove the “funnies” every Sunday morning from the paper in order to read the latest strip from Watterson. I cut out strips centered around Spaceman Spiff and kept them in a folder (I was a big Star Wars fan, therefore, anything with space was cool). Calvin & Hobbes strips are scattered with nostalgia, wisdom, practicality, and imagination. I now own five C&H volumes. The 10th anniversary book was my first.” Nice to know someone else gets the small things in life.
3. Truman G. Madsen, Joseph Smith the Prophet (1989)
I’m slightly cheating here. At the very beginning of my mission, my trainer (i.e. first missionary companion) owned Madsen’s 1978 audio lectures titled Joseph Smith the Prophet. I didn’t come into contact with the book version until I was well off my mission. But given the fact that the book is basically a word-for-word reprint of the lectures, I included it. I cannot stress enough the impact of these lectures. We listened to them in the car during our travels (when we had a car). I would lay awake late at night listening to them with my headphones. I included them as part of my personal morning studies. This was the first time that Joseph Smith, the founder of my religion, became real to me. While still a positive, faith-promoting rendition, it was the first time he was fleshed out as a living human being. More than that, it was the first time that I can remember any historical figure being fleshed out in my mind. Up to that point, history was an abstraction to me. But these lectures made me want to dive into the details and nuances of history (and eventually everything else). While scholarship over the last few decades has surpassed this, it was still monumental for me. In essence, this was the beginning of my intellectual journey.
I was lucky enough to meet Truman and Ann Madsen at a women’s conference in Las Vegas on my mission. We four missionaries (me, my companion, and another missionary companionship) were virtually the only males in attendance. I was saddened when Truman passed away a couple years later. It made me all the more grateful that I had been able to thank him personally for the impact his work had on me.
4. Gerald L. Schroeder, The Science of God: Convergence of Scientific and Biblical Wisdom (1997)
I wouldn’t recommend this book to anyone frankly. It is mildly interesting, but ultimately unsatisfying when it comes to the religion vs. science debate.1.2 But it was Schroeder’s book, which I picked up at a Barnes & Nobles (?) one P-Day,3.
5. The Norton Anthology of World Literature, Vol. D-F: 1650 to the Present, ed. Sarah Lawall, Maynard Mack (2002)
In elementary school, I was part of a “gifted and talented” program called EXPO (EXceptional POtential). One of its perks was that I was allowed to attend an EXPO course during regular class time. Most the time, EXPO was much more fun than your everyday class. However, when I arrived in middle school, I found that EXPO was during my English class. English had been my favorite subject for years, which is why I quit going to EXPO after one class because I didn’t want to miss it. This love of English stayed with me up to my World Literature course in my early years of college. I had recently returned from my mission, during which I had been trying to understand the history, language, and culture of the scriptures as well as Christian history generally. This anthology was required for the course and it immersed me in multiple voices from a variety of times and cultures. It included works by Yeats, Proust, Lu Xun, Joyce, Woolf, Kafka, and more. It reminded me that there is so much to learn and that my studies should not only be cross-cultural, but interdisciplinary. In short, reading this anthology was my first big taste of one of the grand fundamental principles of Mormonism: “…receive truth, let it come from whence it may.”4
6. C.S. Lewis, The Screwtape Letters (1942)
I had never read any C.S. Lewis prior to my mission. A ward member bought Elder Anderson and I copies of The Chronicles of Narnia for Christmas one year, but I never read): “Your business is to fix his attention on the stream [of immediate sense experiences]. Teach him to call it ‘real life’ and don’t let him ask what he means by ‘real’.” I also remember asking myself afterwards what exactly I meant by ‘real’.5 It could be said that Lewis’ book was my first introduction to the importance of metaphysics. This led to later works on metaphysics, from Blake Ostler to David Paulsen to Edward Feser to David B. Hart to Stephen Webb. My current outlook is similar to Rosalynde Welch’s “disenchanted Mormonism,” but I imagine it will continue to change as metaphysics play an increasingly important role in my theological framework and overall worldview.
7. Thomas Sowell, Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One (2004)
I became a Sowell admirer by reading his weekly columns when I was first becoming interested in politics, but it was this book that made me fall in love economics. I ended up reading his other works soon after, including Black Rednecks and White Liberals, Intellectuals and Society, A Conflict of Visions, Economic Facts and Fallacies, etc. All of these had their own influence, but it was Applied Economics that started it all. What made this different from, say, his Basic Economics was that it looked at economic effects in the real world and explored the unintended consequences of particular choices and policies. It showed what he calls the “constrained” or “tragic vision”6 (i.e. there are no solutions, only trade-offs) in action. It aided in my understanding of economics as not merely models and math, but behaviors, emotions, relationships, and everyday choices.
8. Daniel H. Pink, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us (2009)
I was originally an accounting major as an undergrad. However, I both hated accounting and sucked at it. Realizing I was too far into my business degree to consider a complete change, I ended up choosing Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management (mainly because it sounded better than Business – General Studies). I didn’t have much interest in management or business outside of the practicality of a business degree until I had to do a group project on organizational culture in my HR course. In my research, I came across Dan Pink’s TED talk on human motivation. The focus on autonomy, mastery, and purpose in the workplace made me look at businesses in a different light; as organizations or communities of people rather than abstract entities. Organizational theory and management literature became a way of assessing the human condition. Business can be a practice pregnant with meaning, joy, and moral significance. The reason it often isn’t is because, as Pink puts it, there is “a mismatch between what science knows and what business does.” A desire to understand and possibly help repair this chasm was a major factor in my decision to pursue an MBA.
9. Matt Ridley, The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves (2010)
In his many lectures and interviews,7 famed economist Milton Friedman often encouraged his audience to have a sense of proportion. It is easy to look at anecdotal evidence or snapshot data and draw conclusions about the world. Ridley’s book provides the evidence for Friedman’s “sense of proportion.” He documents how prosperity emerged and evolved over hundreds of thousands of years via specialization and exchange. This helped me look at major problems like poverty from both a global and historical perspective. More important, it helped me take typically leftist crusades like “social justice” seriously and thus led to my embrace of a kind of bleeding-heart libertarianism. By tracing the rise of living standards over the centuries, I came to see how important trade and innovation are to the improvement of human well-being. It also left me just a tad more optimistic about the future.
10. Deirdre N. McCloskey, Bourgeois Dignity: Why Economics Can’t Explain the Modern World (2010)
On a panel at Beyond Belief 2006, astrophysicist and popular science educator Neil Degrasse Tyson made an insightful comment while (kindly) rebuking the (in)famous Richard Dawkins for his rhetorical methods: “Being an educator is not only getting the truth right, but there has to be an act of persuasion in there as well. Persuasion isn’t always “here’s the facts, you’re either an idiot or you’re not.” It’s “here are the facts and here is a sensitivity to your state of mind.” And the facts plus sensitivity, when convolved together, creates impact.” Rhetoric today has a rather negative connotation, one associated with cheap emotionalism or a lack of substance. However, McCloskey’s book argues that it was rhetoric–the act of persuasion or, more to the point, the power of words–that caused and sustained the Industrial Revolution. The bourgeoisie (i.e. the professional and educated class) were praised and seen as dignified and free. This shift in opinion changed the social and political spectrums. Far more than an excellent work in economic history, this book demonstrated to me how words and ideas, along with the way they are articulated, ultimately have the ability to transform societies. Rhetoric can inspire brand new thoughts or even recast old ones in a new light. This in turn has inspired me to be careful and selective in my choice of words and phrasing when expressing my ideas.
Here are a few honorable mentions with very brief explanations as to why:
- Ingri D’Aulaire, Edgar Parin D’Aulaire, D’Aulaires’ Book of Greek Myths (1962): I read this book over and over in elementary school. Where my love of Greek and Roman mythology came from.
- Ian Fleming, Casino Royale (1953): I’m a huge Bond fan and this is still my favorite Bond novel.
- Rodney Stark, For the Glory of God: How Monotheism Led to Reformations, Science, Witch-Hunts, and the End of Slavery (2003): Gave me a far greater love of medieval Christian history: a time frame that has been lambasted by Protestants, secularists, and Mormons alike.
- N.T. Wright, Surprised by Hope: Rethinking Heaven, the Resurrection, and the Mission of the Church (2008): Also played a role in my embrace of the social justice cause via a more “earthy” ministry and Wright’s “new creation” theology.
- Peter Drucker, The Essential Drucker (2001): Hayek is my philosopher economist, Drucker is my philosopher manager.
- Jim Butcher, Storm Front (2000): I’m going out on a limb with this one, but this may have major future repercussions. It it is the first in The Dresden Files (I need to begin #13: Ghost Stories) and it was recommended and given to me as a birthday gift by Nathaniel. I hadn’t read a fiction book in years prior to it. I think it very well may be beginning of my love affair with fiction. We’ll see once I finish the entire series.
I kind of wish my list was a little different, but it is what it is. This will surely change in the future. I probably missed some too. But this is what I can come up with as of now. Hope you enjoy.

Thanks, Walker! I’ve been really looking forward to this and I had a lot of fun reading it.
Your post also made me wish I’d come across Calvin and Hobbes earlier in my life. Sadly, I discovered and loved The Far Side first. Which, while quite excellent in its own way, isn’t the monument to poignant humanity that C&H is.
Thank you for these recommendations. You’ve bumped up my reading list nicely for this month. My best recommendation would go to Chip Mendez’s The Millionaire In The Next Cubicle.
It’s no exaggeration to say that book has changed my life. I have always made terrible financial and career decisions but reading this book has taught me a lot of new philosophies and ideas that have had a huge impact on my life. Fantastic book.Definition
The term “Fachschaft” stands for Student Union in German speaking countries and is mainly used at technical universities. “Wirtschaftsinformatik” is German for Business Informatics.
Therefore, we, Fachschaft Wirtschaftsinformatik und Data Science, aka FS Winf or sometimes just Winf, are the offical representation of all students studying Business Informatics or Data Science at TU Wien.
Tasks
Our tasks are:
- the legal representation of the interests of all Business Informatics and Data Science students at TU Wien
- advice and support for all kinda uni related topics for students and people who want to start to study
- organisation of events (parties (Festl), breakfasts (Frühstücke), workshops, talks etc.)
- committe work in several kinds of committies (Study Commission, Faculty Council etc.)
You can find more services we offer in the “Services” tab on this homepage.
People who feel part of the Fachschaft sometimes refer to themselves as “Fachschaftler”. It is importnt to mention that anyone who’s interested in joining can do that. Yes, even YOU! You can find the many different tasks our members are in charge of here. All of our members work voluntarily and have a lot of fun while doing so!
You have an idea you want to realize with us? We would love to hear about that! Come to one of our FS-Meetings or just drop by during our opening times.
Keep in mind that you don’t need any previous knowledge but just motivation! 😉 We’ll teach you everything a Fachschaftler needs to know.
DON’T BE SHY. Just come along! 😉
Fachschaft-Meetings
We have regular FS-Meetings were we talk about all kinds of topics related to the studies and to discuss how we are going to accomplish our tasks and plan our events.
You’ve got an idea you want to realize with us? Or do you want to become a member? Maybe you just want to listen to the discussions or even give your opinion. In any case – we welcome you to come along! You can see when the next FS-Meeting will take place in our calendar.

In 2002 and 2003, larval infestation in blueberries and apples was significantly lower in plots treated with GF-120 (spinosad bait) or SpinTor than in untreated control plots. Fruit fly infestation in apples was reduced by 67% in 2002 after weekly application of GF-120 for 6 wk. Six weeks of GF-120 treatment reduced infestation in blueberries by 85% in 2002 and 98% in 2003. Plots treated weekly with the bait component of GF-120 for 6 wk had significantly higher infestation of blueberry maggot larvae compared with untreated plots in 2002. Observations of wild R. mendax flies revealed that similar numbers of flies landed on blueberry foliage treated with spinosad bait, the bait component alone, or water droplets. However, flies on spinosad bait and bait treated plants spent significantly more time within 5 cm of the treatment droplets compared with control (water) droplets. Overall, the results demonstrate a high degree of efficacy of baited spinosad formulations against these key pests of temperate fruit and suggest that GF-120 is an arrestant for foragingBusiness Name:

Begin sluggish, learn the system, and obtain much better every day. Like any other ability, you need to service it, as well as learning whatever there is to know about beginning a food blog is just one of them (though ideally this post will aid you cut several of that time down). Mistake 2: Not choosing a reliable site host for your food blog.
They pick the most inexpensive website host out there and also believe nothing of the truth that their website is slow to lots, which badly impacts a visitor's individual experience and also signals to Google that your website is hard to accessibility (which may mean reduced search positions and also lower pageviews) - food blogger BasenjiMom. If you're simply beginning you will mainly likely have extremely reduced traffic to begin with, so obviously there's no factor in spending a lot of money on expensive organizing up until your site is larger and also needs more power.
My Web Site Hosting Recommendations Begin little with a solid (yet inexpensive host) and as your website expands as well as has more traffic, upgrade to a costs web host to make sure your reader's site experience is as smooth as feasible. based on your blog writing degree: Newbie Child Food Blog Site Hosting Bluehost is most likely the most common internet site host for novice blog owners.
As you grow you'll desire to switch to a far better top quality host that can manage your growing web traffic. Beginner to Intermediate Food Blog Site Website Hosting Site, Ground is a strong web site host, as well as is the host I made use of for two years after relocating Fork in the Road off of Bluehost.

Advanced Food Blog Internet site Holding A great deal of larger blog writers have actually been transferring to two different webhosting companies, WPEngine and Cloudways. While I have actually just made use of among these business myself (Cloudways), I've listened to fantastic features of both companies, however they do provide very various solutions: is recognized for its rapid site rate and also low price, and many Search Engine Optimization professionals routinely advise it.
Nevertheless, I've listened to that their assistance is lacking, though I have actually never really needed to get in touch with support so I can not share my very own experience (I have a committed technology solution that handles all concerns for me). So if you're a real novice who does not intend to DIY their website (or employ a person to do it) after that it may not be the selection for you right out of the gateway.
This suggests their service is leading notch, yet the cost is a lot higher. There are a lot of large as well as small blog writers alike who make use of WPEngline, so I would suggest picking them if you're brand-new but you understand you desire to begin with the very best feasible organizing while likewise requiring a little hand holding while you find out the ropes of bloggin (blogger BasenjiMom).
I have actually personally made use of and suggest Site, Ground due to the fact that it is a reliable host company, their assistance is terrific, as well as it is a firm you can grow with. As well as keep in mind, you can always update to committed servers and also a higher level of assistance in the future (blogger BasenjiMom).

Hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving! I enjoyed visiting with my daughters and family. Now with Christmas creeping upon us, it’s time to start thinking about your diy Christmas gifts. Time is running out if you like to make your own gifts. Today I am going to share a quick and easy diy gift idea for the sports fanatic.
> ones that I am sharing today are for “OU” (Oklahoma University) college football fans. These diy coasters are inexpensive to make, and can be customized for the receiver, and who doesn’t like coasters. Not only can they be easily be customized for sports fans but there is so many ways to decorate a coaster for anyone on your gift list. A design can be stenciled on them instead of lettering like these fleur de lis coasters, or painted like my Texas flag coasters, or even decoupaged like these Dallas Cowboy tile coasters (I have some big sports fanatic in the family). There are so many pretty napkins or stencils out there you are bound to find something to make the perfect gifted coaster set. So grab some travertine tile and let’s get started making some easy diy coasters for gift giving.
Diy Gift Idea for the Sports Fanatic
First, decide whether to stencil, paint or decoupage your coasters. For these, I will be stenciling the letters of Oklahoma University which is “OU”. I chose Pintura (a dark red) acrylic because that is the closest that I have in the school colors.
Grabbing my Travertine tile, paint, letter stencils, and favorite stencil brush I get started stenciling in the “O” on each tile.
Once dry position the “U” in place. (You can always go to Pinterest for help with colors and positioning of letters).
Let that dry thoroughly then add some small super sliders to the bottom four corners of each tile using clear gorilla gel. This will protect your furniture from getting scratched from the coasters.
Next use Mod Podge to help protect the letters on top of the tile by applying two coats. Let dry thoroughly before wrapping.
That’s it for these diy coasters! Perfect Diy Gift Idea for the Sports Fanatic! Do you like to give homemade gifts at Christmas?

The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) is alerting motorists that a section of Route 53 in Clearfield County was re-opened today around 2 p.m.
Temporary traffic signals are in place to enforce a one-lane, alternating traffic pattern along this section of Route 53, which is north of Kylertown and near the Clearfield/Centre County line.
The lane width is 13 feet, 6 inches.
Extreme, wet weather in mid-September, created a slide condition that forced the roadway closure. PennDOT thanks area drivers for their patience during this time.
PennDOT will make repairs to the slope alongside the road but those repairs will not take place immediately. Until repairs can be done, this long-term restriction will remain in place.
PennDOT encourages drivers to “Know before they go” and to check conditions on more than 40,000 roadway miles by visiting.
511PA is free, available 24 hours a day, and provides traffic delay warnings, road closures and restrictions,.
PennDOT also encourages travelers to subscribe to PennDOT news in Cameron, Centre, Clearfield, Clinton, Elk, Juniata, McKean, Mifflin and Potter counties at.

The first click the dialog is at the correct size for that scale. Close the dialog and open it again and now the dialog has shrunk to what is probably 100 scale.

2 CommentsThe Recording Academy
There seem to be differing accounts as to why Lauryn Hill failed to appear at the 58th annual Grammy Awards on Monday night.
Grammy President Neil Portnow yesterday told USA Today that the singer simple failed to show up at the last minute after having performed at a dress rehearsal hours before.
But a rep for Hill told Billboard that the Grammys had announced she would be performing even though she had not guaranteed she would take part in the ceremony.
“In regards to the comments [Thursday] morning from The Grammys, CBS did announce Ms. Hill’s performance, there were official Grammy television ads that ran for a couple of days naming Ms. Hill as a performer on the show,” the statement said. “Her camp was unhappy about this. They had made it clear from the start that although Ms. Hill was going to attempt to make the show, she could not confirm, as there were too many logistical issues that could potentially prevent the performance from happening.”
The rep adds: “The performance was also supposed to be a surprise. This was discussed with Grammy organizers, and the TV spots were pulled. As previously mentioned, Ms. Hill attempted a last minute rush to L.A., to see if this could happen, but unfortunately timing that day kept it from being a reality. Ms. Hill truly appreciated the invitation, and the efforts made by all parties to try and make the performance happen.”
As previously reported, Hill was supposed to perform with The Weeknd, who went at it alone with versions of his hits “In the Night” and “Can’t Feel My Face.” Lift door branding 39 PowerPoint (PPT) presentations online in SlideServe.

I told you Manfred wasn't feeling well so and now you all know why. Demon possession can be a real bitch and apparently, it leaves a nasty aftertaste. Luckily Kai's supernatural healing ability saved Manfred from "demon cancer" (poor wording by the way). And just how did Kai do that? Well, that mystery hasn't been solved yet but I'm sure we will find out in time.
Anyway, besides our newest additions to Midnight we now know something is up with Fiji and Bobo (well, besides the obvious). It seems their happiness is pissing someone or something off, but more about that later. And who can forget Olivia and Lem? If you were her would you really want someone reading your every thought and feeling? Yes, it seems cool but I'm not really sure how cool it is.
Anyway, Let's move on to episode two, shall we? Manfred was right when he said last week that the Hotel is haunted and this week we get out first "visitors". Unfortunately, they aren't all that friendly and cause some mayhem. Luckily Manfred and Fiji are there to help restore order despite having their suspicions about Kai and Patience.
Speaking of Fiji, she is beginning to realize there is something wrong and that a strange force seems to be out to get Bobo... but what and more importantly why? And speaking of lovey-dovey couples, I was right about Olivia and Lem. She is already annoyed with their "blood Bond" and wants some space. Of course, Lem really knows how she feels when he accidentally messes up and she has to help clean up his mess.
This leads to another realization that the supernaturals in Midnight are going to be really interested in but I won't spoil that surprise. You will just have to watch and find out for your selves.
There were some noticeable absences this week too. Creek is gone and Manfred is feeling lonely though he still holds out hope for their happy reunion. The Rev is nowhere to be found this week either but I'm sure we will be seeing him in the near future. Joe is also less involved in episode two but that is only because he is grappling with awakened feelings that have laid dormant for hundreds of years. It will be interesting to see how Walker fits into all this.
So far Season two is off to a great start and I for one am looking forward to finding out what's going on in Midnight in the coming weeks.

There were the varying body types on full display at Chromat, the downtown friends at Eckhaus Latta and Vaquera, and the ten-year-old LGBTQ activist and kinder drag star at Gypsy Sport. Continuing the fight for inclusion, though in a much more subtle manner than the rest, is Marcia Patmos. Yesterday, she proudly showed off her lookbook—one that she took great time and care with—featuring three very distinctly unique “models.” One is Rachel Doriss, a single mom living in Brooklyn who is the design director at interior design firm Pollack Associates. The second is Leslie Wade, born on the island of Nevis and currently the chief of ECOSOC and Interorganizational Cooperation Brand at the United Nations. The third is Catherine May, owner of Maison May café, restaurant, and catering. Patmos explained that these are women in her life who inspire her every day, plain and simple. There was no pretense or long-winded answer about her muses, just that they, in her words, “are the women who wear my clothes.”
They wear them well, too. The Fall 2018 M.Patmos collection looked spectacular on Doriss, Wade, and May, particularly the burgundy wine–colored cropped trousers, the ivory cable-knit sweater with subtle balloon sleeves, and the navy peacoat with a woven band at the back. Patmos travels often to India, Nepal, and Peru for her alpaca sweaters and specially woven cotton textiles, taking great care to oversee the production of her clothing by local artisans. The M.Patmos garments are always beautifully made, but fairly straightforward. But when coupled with the sustainability factor and styled by real women like Patmos’s models, they make a genuinely grand statement.VOINJAMA – Lofa County may have the fifth-highest COVID-19 infection rate and their second-highest fatality rate, but much is not being done to ensure that more people benefit from the vaccines that are rolled out, data from health authorities indicate.
Festus G. Frazer with Journalist for Human Rights
That northern county capped up the top five hardest hit by the pandemic behind Maryland (164), Nimba (183), Margibi (201), and Montserrado (4,553) Counties. Lofa has also recorded 35 deaths, the National Public Health Institute’s records show, but only a few people have given immunized against the virus in the area.
NPHIL data indicates that a little over 3,850 persons took the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the county—accounting for fewer than five percent of the total number of people who have taken their first dose of AstraZeneca in the country.
An additional 1,000 of the second doses of AstraZeneca arrived in Lofa a fortnight ago, county’s health promotion focal person at the level of the County Health Team, William Sherman, told newsmen recently in Voinjama.
“This will ensure that those who took their first dose take their second,” he says. This however leaves a gap of more than 1,850 persons who will have to wait to get fully vaccinated.
But Sherman assured that the health team is “working with the central office in Monrovia to ensure more people are vaccinated.
J&J Might Help Do the Magic
Mr. Sherman also says Lofa County has received a total of 24,805 doses of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 from the Ministry of Health and the Incident management system and would begin administering them to the public after the finalization of a communication strategy that would help create robust awareness about the exercise.
“Health authorities in the county are designing a risk communication strategy to facilitate its localized roll-out of the J&J vaccines across the county.
“We should have launched it last week Friday, but we had some constraints and we are also concluding the development of our risk communication strategy,” Sherman said.
The government on August 5, 2021, had a national launch of over 300,000 doses of the J&J vaccines, which were donated by the United States Government through the COVAX facility — a partnership of CEPI, GAVI, UNICEF, and WHO.
The risk communication strategy, Mr. Sherman said, will include radio awareness, drama production, house-to-house mobilization, advocacy meetings, and coordination with sectors, among other things. “These activities are geared toward enhancing effective vaccines drive and behavior change in the county,” he said.
Unlike the AstraZeneca vaccines which prioritized health workers before later being administered to the public, the J&J will be available to the public, Sherman added.
“The Johnson and Johnson will be opened to everybody. It’s not going to be like the AstraZeneca that we give priority to health workers”, he said while expressing optimism about increased vaccines intake in the county.
“I’m very hopeful that we will have a bigger turn-out for the vaccines if and only if we do the risk communication strategy well; maybe a week or more before the implementation, we will be able to get a larger population coming for the vaccines”, he said.
Lofa alone is not lagging behind in terms of administering the jabs as the country itself is far behind schedule.
Though the government expressed optimism of ensuring that about 10 percent of the population is fully vaccinated by the end of September, the country is miles away from realizing this dream. The government has vaccinated just 3.32 percent of the population with just a day to the deadline of the target.
As of September 24, 2021, the Incident management system (IMS) data indicates that a total of 165, 814 persons have received at least a jab.
The ten percent threshold is a target set by the World Health Organization (WHO) to ensure that ten percent of every country’s population is vaccinated and we want to meet that.
Minister Jallah said at a press conference in Monrovia recently that Liberia is making a difference in vaccination.
“The demand, for us, is here so we need to supply or visit communities, churches, schools, villages, and towns with the Vaccine in other to meet our quota by September 30, 2021,” she said.
WHO Director General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on May 24, 2021, called for all countries to vaccinate at least 10 percent of their populations by September and at least 30 percent by the end of 2021.
He urged WHO member states should back the “massive push” to reach these COVID-19 vaccination goals.
This is crucial to stop severe disease and death, keep our health workers safe and reopen our societies and economies,” he said.
Health Minister Jallah noted that the Liberian government has been working assiduously to ensure that it meets the global health body’s target. “We are reaching everywhere to make sure the vaccines get to our people to be vaccinated,” she said.
“We are making progress when it comes to the numbers of people recovering from the virus,” Minister Jallah said while urging every Liberian to continue to follow the preventive measures, especially mask-wearing and keeping distance away from people.
Though some residents expressed frustration over the slow pace of the vaccination process in the county, they are willing to take the jabs when the health team finally begins the process.
Acquoi Mulbah, a resident of Voinjama, noted that the surest way the virus can be defeated from the country is by ensuring that everyone is vaccinated. Meanwhile, some people have expressed their willingness to take the vaccines.
“The government should do all it can to reach out to the people. If we are to be relieved of this terrible situation, our government must vaccinate everyone,” Mulbah said, “I’m even willing to take mine now.”
Louis Jallah, 26, said she does not understand why it has been taking so long for the vaccines to reach Lofa County. “We have been waiting because the little ones that came first, according to the Count Health Team, was for the nurses and doctors. I cannot wait to get mine because I want my body to be prepared for the virus.
The population in Lofa has begun to understand that the vaccines will help boost their immune system against COVID-19.
“I’m beginning to understand that all of the information that we were getting, especially from the internet about how bad the vaccines are not true. I will take the J&J vaccines now that it is here and build my system for any eventuality. I’m taking no chance with this virus,” Emmanuel Kolubah, a youth leader in Voinjama noted.
However, vaccine hesitancy has been a huge problem affecting the fight against the pandemic. Not even half of a total of 494,400 doses of both the AstraZeneca (192,000) and Johnson and Johnson (302,400) doses imported are yet to be used. Vaccine hesitancy is also happening in other parts of Africa.

Outdoor use also depends on the weather forecast so please have a backup location indoors in case of bad weather.Ip Address For Mac Os...

Ip Address Mac Os Terminal?
On your Mac, choose Apple menu System Preferences, then click Network. Open Network preferences for me. In the list at the left, select the network service that needs a renewed IP address. Click Advanced, click TCP/IP, then click Renew DHCP Lease. But dynamic IP addresses won't work for certain tasks like port forwarding, dynamic DNS, or client-to-client file sharing on the local network. For those unique situations and others, only a static IP address will work. By setting a static IP address in OS X, you'll create a permanent, private IP address for your Mac that won't change from one. Angry IP Scanner. Despite being deceptively simple Angry IP Scanner does exactly what one would. The IP address is usually displayed beside last inet, however, this command does not work on macOS High Sierra. Back to Table of Contents Find your external IP address. To find your external IP address, there are two easy methods that work on all versions of the Mac operating system.

- Module 4 Exam2016 was huge for me. Although on the outside it looked like the most ordinary of years, no marriage, no house move, no announcement of baby or any other huge life event that defines a year. On the 7th January 2016 my new baby was born. A baby that had been almost 5 years in the making, this here, my blog baby.
I had been wrestling for all those years with my confidence and ability (or lack thereof), going about my days writing posts in my head, in the shower, at night in bed or even on paper and telling myself that one of these days I would pluck up the courage to actually learn how and start a blog of my own.
Then 2015 hit, now that was a big year. The year I welcomed my littlest lady Roma Rose into the world and the year I would try to make last forever as Eva was due to start school. Oh how I sobbed. It was such an emotional time, I really didn’t want that summer to ever end and I felt myself getting all reflective. Reflective on those years that people say go way too fast and are the best years of childhood, of motherhood, yet which are the ones that are actually – when you are in it – the hardest to appreciate. That is until you are sat staring the prospect of school square in the face and what you would really like is the opportunity to relive it all again. Not just the big days, the firsts, the holidays, the moments that are talked about or captured in a snippet of video or a quick snap. But all of those ordinary moments too.
I felt like those moments at home, the ones that happened every single day were the most precious, special, the ones I now treasured, wanted to remember and relive over and over again. The way that Eva used to curl up on me as a tiny 6lb newborn with extra skin on her neck and we used to laugh that she looked like a turtle. The start of our weaning journey at 6 months when she still had a tongue that pushed everything out like a giraffe. The way she pronounced different words including her name and would constantly chant, “Ear do it”, right down to the fact that she wanted to call the new baby twink and would ask a million questions about how it was coming out. All of those moments, and all of the ones in between. It was then, as the school days approached that I kicked myself. Because these are just the moments I recall, I know that there were so many more that I loved, that I swore I would never forget and that I know that I have.
I could hear myself teaching Eva all about being different, about following her dreams and celebrating who she was and I realised I needed to listen too. I am not the best photographer or writer, I don’t have an especially exciting life and I certainly didn’t have a clue what I was doing, but no-one would be judging except me and look what I was missing. I didn’t want to miss out on another day of documenting these moments with my two little ladies and it was absolutely not too late. So there and then the decision was made, in the dawn of her new adventure I would start my own. Little Ladies Big World was born.
It seems fitting then that the very first post I wrote and my most favourite to write at all are my ordinary moments posts, I am thankful to Katie at mummydaddyme for her linky, for a place and an incentive to remember these sweet moments that I still love to read back. I love each and every one of them but I have to say that Eva’s first trip to a Musical and their shared love for the bin men have to be my favourites. It truly is at the heart of my blog and I hope that it always will be.
Almost as soon as I stepped into this world of blogging I absolutely fell in love, I have never stuck to anything quite as much as this, I have never had the passion, the creative flare and worked so very hard at anything in my life. Because it is very hard work. Not a day has gone by this year without thinking of it, blogging has definitely became a way of life for me and I cannot imagine ever not doing it.
I have learnt so much, I have taught myself everything I have needed to know so far and even though it makes me wince a bit to write, I have learnt to be proud of myself too. Never in a million years did I think it would be as hard work as it is or that I would leave the year with a blogging to do list longer than when I started. But it isn’t a list that fills me with dread (unlike most of my others!) it fills me with excitement, and drive to continue to learn, and to grow, and to somehow freeze time so I have enough to write a post or two every now and again and still make the improvements to my site that I have been meaning to for 6 months!
One of the best things to come out of blogging also is the Family Portrait Project ‘Me and Mine’ by Lucy DearBeautiful , when I was thinking of joining in for the first time just a few weeks after starting the blog I was sad to find that we only had a handful of photos of us as a family ever. It still makes me so sad to think that we missed all of those times and I am more thankful than I could ever express that I now have a whole year of photos where we are all in the frame. It might seem like a chore almost every single month (it does) but I know I won’t remember that when I look back on them and it has encouraged me to get creative too. When we were in France I snapped probably my most favourite photo of us I have ever taken and the one that makes me so proud too. It really does mean so much to me to have them and I get a tear in my eye when I think back to that night, and in fact each and every one.
Of course this year hasn’t been without its challenges, I have doubted myself on an almost daily basis, compared myself to others and wondered whether I am good enough, whether I know enough, have the time to write enough and am even cut out for this blogging world. Whether my photos were awful, my words made sense and that being rubbish at social media would mean there would be no-one there to even read it. I am definitely not good at self promotion and that is something to work on in my second year of blogging – how long can I call myself a newbie?
We spent the summer in France which was meant to be the month I would have spare time, knuckle down, do site improvements, vlog and blog our time. Yet the wifi issues meant that unfortunately I could barely keep up my social media and I still have 100’s of photos and unedited vlogs to share, though I did manage to publish our first week here. Not to mention the fact that I smashed my camcorder in the second week so the shaky footage on the stand in may take some time to become watchable! Yet again though I have learnt to let it go, to tell myself it is ok and that this is my site, my diary and if it is only me and my little ladies that watch and read then that is ok, because in years to come we won’t care whether I published the very same day or a whole year later.
I did however make a huge decision whilst we were in France, or more accurately on our return, and that was to hand my notice in at my relatively new job to concentrate on this blog. I had finally found something I loved to do and wanted to give it my all whilst I was lucky enough to be able to. Just then I fell ill and I have unfortunately not been able to give my all to it since, yet, but I am hoping to very soon, I would love to say I am through that now however it is somewhat ongoing and so blogging is still slow but I wholeheartedly stand by the fact that is was the best decision I have ever made for me and for that I couldn’t be happier.
It may seem dramatic to say and lots of people just don’t get it, this blogging malarkey, but it has changed me in a way I never imagined. It has changed my life, my outlook, although I still compare and doubt myself daily, and sometimes feel like giving it all up in favour of a quiet life; I really can’t imagine life without it. I have grown in confidence, ‘met’ amazing people with amazing talents that inspire me and I have had some amazing support. In October I wrote an extremely personal post about my heartbreaking pregnancy loss due to hyperemesis and it still outperforms any of my other posts by a serious margin in views, thanks mostly to a charity sharing it on their site. But more than that there was an outpour of contact, messages everywhere with support, love, and from women who have gone through the same. Somehow, rather than the dread and judgement I was so worried about, just writing those words lifted a cloud that had been hovering over me for three years. A really dark cloud lifted and opened a brighter tomorrow. And more than anything else in the world my blog has allowed me that.
In December I also decided last minute to take part in Vlogmas over on my YouTube channel, vlogging is something I am still new to but having made videos of France and thanks to my lovely husband who bought me a longed for Canon G7X for Christmas (and then gave it me early in order to use it – he’s a keeper!), I really want to get into it more and due to the illness and break on my blog I really wanted to still create content and for our Christmas to be remembered, no matter what that looked like. Yet again I found something that I adore, I love the filming, editing and even though illness means I am still a little behind it is definitely something I want to branch out to and do more of in 2017 – though watching and listening to myself still makes me cringe!
I still adore photography and it has always been a passion of mine but this year I have really managed to focus on it that bit more and although I am completely self taught and could definitely do with making time to read the photography book that Eddy got me to go with my camera (for dummies…thanks Eddy!) I look at the progress I have made myself and I am proud. I love to take my camera out just because, I take far too many and should probably learn to edit them but I see how far I have come and some of the moments I have captured and I smile. I’m not so good at being proud of myself but I am trying and who knows where the next year will take me.
So 2016 has been pretty life changing for me and although I am not usually one for new years resolutions, last years one has done me quite well. In 2017 I would like to blog more, vlog more, grow my social media whilst staying true to myself and my family and most of all make, capture and record both exciting, amazing, and the downright ordinary wonderful moments, leaving the year loving blogging as much as I do today.
I have a long way to go but I am loving the journey. Happy Blog Birthday to me.
xx
Here are some photos from this week that I took just because, photos that don’t mean anything in particular but photos that I probably owe to writing this blog, and some that Eva took because I am breeding a little blogger (and vlogger) in the making there!

UNIVERSEH was established in November 2020 to develop new ways of collaboration in the field of space, within the “European Universities” initiative by the European Commission.
UNIVERSEH associates Université de Toulouse oversees the general coordination of the alliance, while each partner institution has the responsibility to manage specific areas. Under the team leadership of Professor Tadeusz Uhl, the AGH UST will focus on stimulating entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial skills among students through university-business cooperation, as well as equity, inclusion and diversity of the network in its cooperation. In all its areas of activity (science, engineering, economy, social and human sciences, entrepreneurship and innovation, medicine and culture), UNIVERSEH will contribute to the vision of the European Education Area, notably in supporting job,. In its combined power, UNIVERSEH has project gives us a great opportunity to work in international team of very experienced teachers and researchers form space sector. The role of space research for a Earth population will rapidly grow in near future. The technology based on space solutions will help people to have better and easier life. The space resources will satisfy our needs for everyday life, but firstly we have to understand space and her role, we have to educate people who should accept the use of space for improving life conditions on Earth. UNIVERSEH is a big challenge for us. We have to be more open for multicultural and multilingual cooperation which is common practice in space exploration. We need to organize a very modern and friendly environment for students and researchers which will help them to discover new ideas related to space innovation and give them the possibility to start their space business. The role of space is growing rapidly in human life. In the near future space resources will be used in many areas of common life, then education and research in this area are important for Europe. UNIVERSEH gives us a chance to exchange good practices in the education and research area between partner Universities. The project results will help to educate engineers for the future
explains Professor Tadeusz Uhl, the project leader at AGH UST.
UNIVERSEH now enters its implementation phase, with the workload being combined through the partner institutions. The first distributed and common courses will tentatively start in autumn 2021, probably in a teaching and learning distance.
explains Professor Philippe Raimbault, President of the Université de Toulouse.
It is an extraordinary honor for us. Together with partners from Europe, we will create a network of space universities. The development of disciplines beyond our terrestrial globe is the direction of development of the best universities in the world. I am extremely proud and honored with this opportunity. Additionally, it is a motivation for us to let the Academia contribute to the development of the discipline of the future, which is the cosmos and its better understanding. We are starting the second century of the Academia’s activity with ambitious plans to develop advanced technologies in the space sector
states Professor Jerzy Lis, Rector of AGH UST.

When buying a product, the cashier scans the barcode, and the name and price of the item pops up immediately, no matter the store or where the item came from.
That UPC code stays on the item throughout its time on the shelf. As a result, a set of Sony headphones will always be identified as a set of Sony headphones.
We don’t have a similar industrywide code in the media and advertising ecosystem. There are standard asset identifiers for both ads and entertainment content via Ad-ID and entertainment identifier registry (EIDR), but until recently, there was no open and persistent method for binding these identifiers into video assets.
That is closer than ever to changing. At the recent National Association of Broadcasters conference, CIMM, Kantar Media, Ad-ID and EIDR introduced the TAXI Complete initiative to advance adoption of Kantar Media’s audio watermarking technology for persistent binding identifiers into content.
The technology has recently been standardized by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. A second standard was also just published that binds timestamps and up to four distributor IDs into layers in the same watermark. This allows for full tracking of the ad or piece of content.
Embedding standardized identifiers throughout the media ecosystem will significantly improve the efficiency of cross-media workflows for ad agencies, media companies and marketers. It will enable faster reporting for ad verification and audience measurement, which will eventually help marketers better optimize live and on-demand advertising, as they do with digital advertising. It will bring the entire media ecosystem closer to real-time measurement.
Many inefficiencies in the linear television audience measurement workflow could be vastly improved if we could immediately identify a piece of content or ad displayed on a TV, set-top box, metering device or smartphone app. This technology can bring efficiencies and innovation to these workflows.
While there has been widespread adoption of Ad-ID and EIDR throughout the industry, an open standard for embedding these identifiers is really the key to helping both become true industrywide standards.
It is now incumbent upon both advertisers and TV content producers to implement standardized video asset identification throughout their ads and content. Once the ads and content are registered with Ad-ID and EIDR and the identifiers are embedded into the videos, innovation can begin. Register and embed once; innovate endlessly.
It may seem like working together to set standards is antithetical to an industry that prioritizes proprietary technology. But by having everyone go about it their own separate way, we risk true innovation from taking flight.
Open standards are the building blocks upon which new technology and features can be built. This won’t hinder customization but will instead help proprietary approaches flourish. Adopting standardized master metadata for ads and content will make it quicker and more accurate to identify each, enabling new capabilities in the same way as the UPC code.
Adoption of this open standard technology will spur new potential media products in audience measurement, cross-platform measurement, interactive services, content tracking, second-screen applications and more.
But it can’t happen until media companies and advertisers begin the process by registering video assets and embedding the identifier in the video. The entire ecosystem will benefit, but we need to start now.As highly requested from all you lovely readers I’ve decided to upload an updated skincare routine. As through my good days and bad days my skin has massively improved from frequent breakouts to hardly any! As I started to notice my skin was frequently breaking out I knew I had to try and fix it, so I decided to think about what I could do not just by using products but also taking a look into my lifestyle – which honestly plays a large part in this!
I hardly used to drink any water and have quite a lot of sugar which clearly didn’t balance out. So without a thought I stopped having sugar and started drinking plenty more water to clear out all the toxins and allowing the inside of my body to be much more hydrated and healthy. At first you may think Kiran are you crazy? No sugar..but honestly it’s the best thing I’ve ever done! Now onto the products which have helped my skin stay smooth, less oily and hydrated! I try not to use products on my skin everyday as personally I think every couple of days is much more effective as the use of products consistently can also have a negative impact on your skin.
Cream Cleanser – Bee Good. I have used this cleanser for a quite a while now mainly because it’s a good consistency and absorbs into my skin easily without irritating it as I have quite sensitive skin but I don’t use this on a day to day basis but every other day. It leaves my skin looking and feeling fresh.
Clear out face pore strips – T Zone. I purchased these strips last month and once I had used them it made me think where have you been all my life? As these strips allow your blackheads to be removed as well as any oil instantly. They’re easy to use give incredible results in a small space of time.
Nugg Beauty face masks – Selfridges. Both the exfoliating face mask and the deep cleansing face mask they both provide my skin with 2 different services which are both as important. Any redness is removed by the deep cleansing face mask and the exfoliating face mask hydrates the skin immensely. Again, I don’t use face masks as frequently as I use the cream cleanser I prefer to apply a face mask a month if my skin isn’t too bad if it is I apply a face mask twice a month!
Catastrophe Cosmetic face mask – Lush. Another face mask I have been alternating between is this one from Lush which I think is a perfect match for my skin. Containing blueberries, calamine and chamomile, rose, and almond oils to soothe and soften the skin this contains vitamins as it contains wholesome blueberries which is why I think it’s great!
Strawberry body butter – The Body Shop. This is perfect if you have normal dry skin as it moisturizes perfectly and doesn’t feel heavy at all it’s quickly absorbed and long lasting which I love!
What is your current skincare routine? Comment below.

Elton John, The Lockdown Sessions
After becoming one of the world’s most iconic pop stars, Sir Elton John could have easily rested on his laurels. Instead, the 74-year-old icon decided too go about one of his more ambitious projects to date with a new album of collaborations, The Lockdown Sessions. Filled to the brim with his various partnerships over the last year, Lockdown features John dipping his toe in a little bit of everything, from pure pop nostalgia (“Cold Heart” with Dua Lipa & PNAU) to soul (“Finish Line” with Stevie Wonder) to hip-hop (“Always Love You” with Young Thug & Nicki Minaj ) to Americana (“Simple Things” with Brandi Carlile).

“Turn the days into nights/ Hit the switch in my mind/ I burn through phases of life/ No reset, no rewind.” There’s a confidence to frontwoman Lynn Gunn’s voice as she croons the lyrics to Pvris’s new single, “My Way.” Scintillating with the alt-rock energy that flowed through previous tracks like “Monster” and “No Mercy” but with a dash of added swagger, “My Way” finds Gunn taking her rightful place as the leader of her band, while a blown-out bass and some razor-sharp synths help her send the message home.
Ashnikko, “Halloweenie IV: Innards”
Ready to get scared? Ashnikko certainly is, as she continues in her own tradition of dropping a Halloween song the week before the holiday officially arrives. On the fourth iteration of her “Halloweenie” series (this year with the subtitle “Innards”), Ashnikko takes the melody of Edvard Grieg’s masterpiece “In the Hall of the Mountain King,” chops it, twists it up, and adds in some of her own lyrics to fit the spooky season. Rapping and singing about organs, human skin suits, ghosts, ghouls and spiders laying eggs in your brain, Ashnikko goes out of her way to paint a gory picture that will have you boogieing all through this spooky season.
Cavetown, “Teenage Dirtbag (feat. Chloe Moriondo)”
It’s been over 20 years since Wheatus released their hit debut single “Teenage Dirtbag” — but it’s still finding new audiences everywhere. That’s thanks in part to Cavetown, who teamed up with fellow alt-pop artist Chloe Moriondo to deliver a stripped-down, chilled-out cover of the track this week. Subbing in some drowsy synths in place of the original’s slamming guitars, this new version of “Teenage Dirtbag” portrays a softer, more mellow version of the single, as Cavetown and Moriondo beg you to come listen to some Iron Maiden with them.
Joy Oladokun, “I Can’t Make You Love Me (feat. Jason Isbell)”
What happens when a fast-rising singer-songwriter and a country superstar come together to cover a blues icon’s classic single? Magic, that’s what happens. For her new Spotify Sessions, Joy Oladkun tapped none other than Jason Isbell to assist her on her cover of Bonnie Raitt’s “I Can’t Make You Love Me.” The result is a groovy, modernized version of the track that sees Oladokun flexing her vocal prowess while Isbell shreds on the guitar, doing perfect justice to Raitt’s stunning single while still making it entirely their own.
Alekxandr, “Sunflower”
“I only have eyes for you.” With six words, rising indie-pop singer Alekxandr draws you into his vision of romance and heartbreak. Backed up by a set of strings, some heart-pounding drums and a simple piano melody, Alekxandr lets his vocals shine through on “Sunflower” as he waxes poetic on the waning days of a relationship, wondering where things went wrong, and what he would do fix his mistakes. “I’m sending you all my love/ And my hand’s full of sunflowers,” he moans on the chilling chorus.2016 is almost here and it’s time to start picking your target races and thinking of how you will prepare. You may think it’s early, but now is the time to start thinking about your goals for next year. The earlier you establish the plan, the easier it will be to achieve those goals.
When building your long term plan, the initial step is to select the two or three events that are focal points for the coming year. For the sake of the article, we will pick three separate criterium races, each one month apart, starting in May and ending in July. Once the races are selected, take some time to forecast, or plan your time, leading up to the event. From there, break your goal preparation into smaller “periods” of training. Such detailed long term planning is essentially a road map for success.
Forecasting
Begin by placing the races in the Annual Training Plan (ATP) feature in TrainingPeaks. Now, do some forecasting; a two-step process. First, do your best to lay out all known life events. Life events are days when you might be able to train, but not with total devotion. Will you be going on vacation? Any business trips or big school projects due? Any holidays coming up? All distractions need to be considered when planning the training leading up to the focus event. Use your main calendar in Training Peaks to post these dates. Try to use such non-bike related events as rest periods if possible. That being said, you can’t plan for everything. Life always throws curveballs. You may have to be flexible and make more adjustments along the way.
The second phase of forecasting is to list any criteriums you will do prior to the main goal. Is there a “B” or “C” race you can do? Could doing this race help you prepare from a training perspective for your “A” race? Your “B” and “C” races can also be placed on your ATP. Participating under the pressure of competition gives you a measure of where you are and informs which areas might need improvement. Of course you want a good result, but maybe you compete to simply compare yourself to other riders in the same category as you. When planning “B” and “C” events, make sure you consider the location of the event. Does it require a lot of travel time? Is it worth doing if you burn a few days in the car? Timed correctly, you should have your “B” races two weeks prior to your “A.” This will allow you to fine tune any needed areas.
“A” Race Focus
Now that you have your goal races picked, all of your known distractions plotted and your lead-up races on the calendar, it is time to look at your specific race dates and start working backwards. Keep in mind that every three to four weeks of training should be followed by five to eight days of rest. The duration of the training periods and the rest period may vary from athlete to athlete. Some athletes can train for four weeks before needing rest while others build for shorter blocks of time. This difference can apply to an individual’s recovery too, since recovery can be age dependent. The older you are, the longer it takes to recover from a hard day of training let alone weeks of training.
Before any structured training is done, you must first have a strong base of training. Your base will serve as the launch pad for all of your structured training. Base building should begin 5 to 8 months before the first focus race. Rest is an important part of this early training and should occur every three to four weeks. Use the TrainingPeaks calendar to plan for this early period of training and rest before your “A” race.
With your base in place, begin planning the structured phase of your training two to three months before your first “A” race in May. Design your pre “A” race training in the shape of a pyramid. With the base consisting of Zone 4 efforts and the peak consisting of Zone 6 efforts. Devote two weeks to Zone 4 efforts, two weeks to Zone 5 and one to two weeks to Zone 6. During the final two week build, it is advisable to mix in some short 10 to 30 second all out efforts. Training the top end of your fitness with short intense efforts be the perfect final phase to the training block. Plan a five to seven days rest period before your “A” race.
This process can be repeated for each of your three “A” races during the summer. Note that even though you rested the week before your “A” race, it is advisable to take a few extra recovery days after the big event due to its overall intensity.
Now that your calendar is set, can you see the map? Use the months and weeks before the big date to base build, rest, train with structure and rest some more. The map will foster success if you stick with two or three goals per season, plan around upcoming life events, know how you are going to train and when you are going to rest. You don’t have to get mired down in all the details yet, simply getting your goals written down and doing a little pre-planning is a great start.

Agency Report
Myanmar could slide into civil war in the wake of the military coup, Germany’s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas warned on Sunday.
“The military has driven Myanmar to the brink of disaster within a few weeks. Well more than 500 people have already been killed, thousands are on the run,” Maas said in remarks to the newspapers of the Funke media group published on Sunday.
Mass demanded that all actors should now increase pressure on the regime so that it finally accepts the offers of talks with its partners in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
“No-one in the region can be interested in Myanmar sinking into civil war – not even those who are not interested in saving democracy,” Maas asserted.
Since the coup on Feb. 1, the military has violently cracked down on protests and at least 550 people have been killed, including 46 children, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a non-profit organisation.
Currently, 2,751 people have been detained, and 126 arrest warrants have been issued

Sense of Belonging and Diversity in Engineering Programs, Courses, and Teams
Educational Research and Methods

10.18260/1-2--34202

When examining factors affecting student academic success, it is important to consider how these factors interact with one another. Students’ affective attributes are complex in nature; thus, research methods and analyses should holistically examine how these attributes interact, not simply as a set of distinct constructs. Prior research into engineering students’ affective attributes, in which we used a validated survey to assess student motivation, identity, goal orientation, sense of belonging, career outcome expectations, grit and personality traits, demonstrated a positive correlation between perceptions of belongingness in engineering and time spent in the program. Other prior research has examined interactions between affective attributes, for example engineering identity as a predictor of grit (consistency of interest). However, more work is needed to examine the relationships between sense of belonging, engineering identity, future career outcome expectations and motivation, particularly for students in an engineering program undergoing curricular change. This paper describes a confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation model to examine how engineering identity, career outcome expectations, and time-oriented motivation (specifically, students’ future time perspectives, or FTP) impact their sense of belonging in engineering, with grit (consistency of interest) as a moderator of these relationships. To conduct these analyses, we used data collected over two years from sophomores, juniors, and seniors enrolled in an undergraduate civil engineering program (2017-18, n=358; 2018-19, n=556). Based on descriptive statistics and initial statistical comparisons, we confirmed our prior findings that students’ sense of belonging at the course level increased with time in the program (from sophomore to senior year), and that engineering identity increased with time in the program as well. In addition, we observed that seniors had higher perceived instrumentality, a sub-construct of FTP indicating their perceived usefulness of their courses in reaching their future goals, than sophomores and juniors. We found that course belongingness and FTP have the strongest influence on belongingness compared to other affective attributes we assessed. When identity and motivation were factored in, career outcome expectations were not influential to engineering belongingness. Finally, we found that time-oriented motivation (FTP) was also a mediator of this relationship through its influence on grit (consistency of interest).

1 - send invite. 2 - send confirmation. 3 - send reminder of event, two days before event
(alt) 4 - send reminder invite, five days before event
I don't believe the above is a nurturing campaign. Would I handle this by creating a default program with 4 smart campaigns? I don't see a "wait until five days before june 4th" flow. Please advise how to go about.
Thanks ~
Hi David,
Campaigns you wish to create are campaigns which are associated with program type event. Here is the structure of campaigns:
1 Send Invite
Within your Program type event you can create this campaign, define campaign' smart list for your target audience with flow step send email. This would be a batch campaign which would run on a specific date and time.
2.Send Confirmation
This would be a trigger campaign
Smart list: Trigger Fills Out Form Your event registration form Add constraint Web page is your LP on which form is sitting
Flow: Send email
3. Send Reminder 1 (five days before)
Batch campaign
Smart list: member of program is true, program status is registered
Flow step :Send email
Schedule it to run 5 days before your event
4 Send Reminder 2 (two days before))
Batch campaign
Smart list: member of program is true, program status is registered
Flow step :Send email
Schedule it to run two days before your event
Thanks
Priyank
To be clear, you are saying to make a default program. Within that default program, create 4 smart campaigns with the directions you mentioned above correct? This would be handled completely with smart campaigns within a default program. correct?
Nop, program would be event type NOT default
Hi David,
Yes, I'd create an event program and then within that program a number of different Marketing campaigns to manage the process/workflow.
In your Program you can leverage Program tokens, one of these is a date token that you should set up for the date of your event.
You should make sure to manage program statuses in this type of program.
Smart campaign 1. Send invite Batch
Flow Action : 1. Send Email 2. Change Program Status to invited
Smart Campaign 2. Trigger registration
Trigger : Fill out form
Flow : Change program status to registered.
You have to the choice to add the reminder to campaign 2 (add a wait step that uses a date token : Use a Date Token in a Wait Flow Action - Marketo Docs - Product Docs ) or you could create a 3rd and 4th campaign for the reminders that fire on Program status change, I would say most people do the later.
In the asset view it will look something like this
Perfect Cathal. One more thing, I just remembered, the actual form is not using marketo form; however, I can use another smart campaign "on page visit, change status to invited". I actually havent been using program statuses much. I need a good refresher on this specifically.
Thanks again ~TomTom Wins Deal to provide Volvo vehicles With Maps, information

Managing email can take up a large proportion of the working day. The expectation that you should be on top of everything that goes on in the company because you have been copied on millions of emails is probably making you less efficient and taking away time from what you are supposed to be doing, your job!
Estimates vary greatly by country and report but it seems that the number of business emails sent and received per person per day ranges from 50 to 180! How much of this email is really relevant to your own job and how much is ‘for info’? The chances are if you really need to know it you will find it out some other way.

Recent CommentsI was also making a Sophie Dahl recipe of baked onions with grilled salmon that required the small red onions to be cooked in seasoned water for 20 minutes before baking...I couldn't just throw away all that goodness, and so this soup was born.
Ingredients for four people:
- Two pints of hot vegetable or chicken stock
- A large handful of dried butter-beans soaked as long as possible in hot water or one can of ready cooked beans
- A couple of handfuls of roughly chopped baby spinach leaves
- One medium sized sweet potato cut up into cubes
- A couple of sticks of celery, sliced thinly
- One medium sized carrot, peeled and sliced
- Two or three medium sized potatoes, peeled and sliced
- Sea salt and crushed black pepper to season
Method:
Simply place all the ingredients into a heavy saucepan and cook until everything is tender about thirty to forty minutes. It couldn't be easier
I used a special cooks trick that I've learned from cookery writer Nigel Slater and used the rind I'd saved from a piece of Parmesan Cheese...It's a magical ingredient dropped into the soup it just melts away leaving a lovely flavour but not a cheesy one!! This soup was really delicious and I'm convinced that although all the ingredients do have distinctive flavours it's the cheese rind that brought the flavours together to make a very tasty vegetable broth...I will definitely be making this again using Nigel Slater's tip.

Jim Christina is certainly no stranger to the entertainment world. For years he played with a popular acoustic vocal group in the Seattle/Tacoma area in Washington State. The band Sundown became a name in the field until Jim moved back to Southern California. In 2008 Jim began writing a series of books about an Arizona Man Hunter in the 1880’s which has now snowballed into 11 novels and coming. With titles like “Requiem for an Appaloosa”, “The Dark Angel”, “Contraband Cowboys”, “Taggert” and “Still Waters”, any lover of western stories would appreciate the realism and grit these novels contain. Having been a frequent guest on ‘Around the Barn’ with Bobbi Bell and Nancy Zee, Jim quickly picked up on the tempo and immediacy of live radio. So, with conversations with Bobbi Bell to join him as Co-Host and Russ Aveson (no stranger to talk radio either) to come in as occasional guest host, he decided to launch “The Writer’s Block” a series of conversations with writers of fiction, non fiction, music, poetry, history and, well pretty much whatever people write and for what reasons. Wanting to keep the format loose and fun, Bobbi and Jim opted for a relaxed format to allow the writer to express themselves in their own way, with Jim and Bobbi steering the course. Jim and Bobbi think this is a wonderful opportunity to allow writers their say, the audience to learn what makes the writers tick and let the public know where they are going in the future.

Paris at both ends: Hôtel Félicien and OFF Paris Seine
Not surprisingly, most visits to Paris focus on the city centre. The allure of grand museums, famous attractions, and beautiful architecture of course attract a lot of attention and are known throughout the world. Less familiar are the edges of Paris, parts of the city where Parisian life is lived by residents rather than tourists. Especially for return visitors to the City Of Light, a stay in less touristy areas of Paris presents a very rewarding experience.
OFF Paris Seine night view
Eastern Paris has undergone a startling renaissance in recent decades, an area where abandoned railway yards and disused buildings have been collectively transformed into one of the buzziest districts of the city. The French National Library was the last of President François Mitterand’s Grands Projets and, like the Grande Arche de la Défense, the Opéra Bastille, and the Pyramide du Louvre, changed the skyline of its neighbourhood. The Library’s four towers and the deceptively large courtyard between them brought change to the area, now calmly busy with small shops and cafés for locals. Relatively new to the Paris hotel scene is OFF Paris Seine, a barge transformed into a floating hotel. This unique choice of accommodation is located just about 200 metres from the Gare d’Austerlitz railway station and about 500 metres from the Gare de Lyon across the Seine. A popular choice among young and social visitors who enjoy the barge’s many outdoor areas, OFF Paris Seine provides the chance to stay directly on the river; it is almost possible to touch the water from rooms on the lower floor, so close is it to the windows. The rooms are small but smartly appointed; clever European design makes the most of the space. Nearby attractions are the Jardin des Plantes, one of the nicest gardens in Paris but much less frequented than more central gardens; the Mosquée de Paris, where the hamam and tea garden bring Parisians through the lovely courtyard of the city’s most prominent mosque; and the rue Mouffetard street market, one of the most authentic in the city.
not the usual breakfast room at Hôtel Félicien
On the far western side of the city in the wealthy 16th Arrondissement is Hôtel Félicien, sister property of OFF Paris Seine as part of the Elegancia hotel group. Despite being one of the largest districts in Paris, there are relatively few hotels in the 16th, a residential area often scoffed at by Parisians as snobby and boring. Not necessarily. Hôtel Félicien‘s friendly staff are only too helpful in providing information about the immediate vicinity and generally making a stay as comfortable as possible. There are several interesting sights within easy walking distance of this classy hotel decorated under the guidance of fashion designer Ted Lapidus; most of them are considerably less famous than the Eiffel Tower (a bit further away but also within walking distance). Architecture buffs will enjoy coming across landmark buildings that are unknown even to most Parisians; rue Mallet-Stevens, a short street named after the architect who designed the striking Art Déco houses lining it, is one of the them. The smaller version of the Statue Of Liberty in New York, which was a gift from France to the American people, is located close by at the tip of a narrow island in the middle of the Seine.
Inside the hotel itself, the rooms are smartly appointed, though a bit on the small side as is the norm in Paris. The coveted rooms on the top floor have private terraces, while the spa and chromotherapy pool provide places to relax after a day out exploring the neighbourhood. For accommodation in a part of residential Paris that is still convenient to the city centre, a stay at either end of the city at OFF Paris Seine or Hôtel Félicien helps to give visitors insight into a Paris beyond the crowded tourist areas.For right now or long lasting unsecured loans for big-ticket products, you can expect unsecured loans to everyone whether it lightweight financial loans to cover you.

In many cases, TRICARE Prime beneficiaries will be referred by a Primary Care Manager (PCM) to a medical department of a Military Treatment Facility (MTF)/Enhanced Multi-Service Market (eMSM) if the type of care needed is available at the MTF/eMSM. In such a case, failure to adhere to that referral will result in the care being subject to Point Of Service (POS) charges. In other cases, a referral may be to the civilian provider network, and again, POS charges would apply to a failure to follow the referral. In contrast to referral, preauthorization (see Chapter 7, Section 2). 1.2 For referrals requiring contractor authorizations, the contractor shall review the referral request, to determine: • That the provider to whom the patient is referred meets applicable authorized provider and network provider requirements, • That the services being requested are a TRICARE covered benefit and are requested in a covered setting, and • Whether any specific services requested as part of the referral also require preauthorization. The contractor shall provide a response to the referring provider and beneficiary. The response shall identify any requested provider and/or services that are excluded from coverage and the reason(s) therefore, and will either not be paid by TRICARE, or paid under the POS option, if applicable. A preauthorization based on a contractor’s medical necessity or utilization management determination is not required when a network PCM or network specialty care provider makes a referral to a network specialty care provider except as required under Chapter 7, Section 2. For additional information on access standards for enrollees, see 32 CFR 199.17(p)(5). 1.3 The TRICARE beneficiary must be “held harmless” (i.e., considered not financially responsible for any charges) in cases where the network provider fails to request a referral and the contractor either denies payment or applies the POS option. If the referral involves services rendered by a non-network provider, “hold harmless” cannot apply, as “hold harmless” only applies to network providers. Once the patient is evaluated by the specialist, the contractor may require an authorization before the services are provided or the procedure is performed. In those instances where a contractor requires authorization of services in addition to those listed in Chapter 7, Section 2, such authorization must be available to and appealable by all beneficiaries, whether enrolled or not. Within Prime Service Areas (PSAs), the MTFs/eMSMs have the Right of First Refusal (ROFR) for all referrals, as determined by the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the contractor and each MTF/eMSM. 1.4 Urgent Care Referrals1.4.1 Effective January 1, 2018, contractor approval of referrals for urgent care visits for TRICARE Prime enrollees are no longer required. No referral from their PCM or authorization by a Health Care Finder (HCF) will be required and no POS deductibles and cost shares shall apply when urgent care is provided by a TRICARE network provider or a TRICARE-authorized (network or non-network) Urgent Care Center (UCC) or Convenience Clinic (CC). If the enrollee seeks care from a non-network provider (except a TRICARE-authorized UCC), the usual POS deductible and cost-shares shall apply. This supersedes the guidance in Chapter 18, Section 5 regarding the number of unmanaged urgent care visits for TRICARE Prime enrollees. Note: The aforementioned January 1, 2018, urgent care referral policy excludes Uniformed Services Family Health Plan (USFHP) enrollees. 1.4.2 ADSMs enrolled in TRICARE Prime continue to need a referral. ADSMs enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote (TPR) will not be held to any urgent care referral requirement, but they are still held to applicable Department of Defense (DoD) and Service regulations concerning ADSM care outside MTFs/eMSMs. The usual ADSM POS exception stands. 1.4.3 Active Duty Family Members (ADFMs) enrolled in TRICARE Prime may self refer for urgent care but they are required to seek urgent care. 1.4.4 ADFMs enrolled in TPRADFM with an assigned Primary Care Provider (PCP) are required to seek urgent care from a TRICARE network provider or a TRICARE-authorized (network or non-network) UCC or CC to avoid POS. 1.4.5 ADFM in TPRADFM without an assigned PCP may utilize any local TRICARE participating or authorized provider for primary care services (to include urgent care services). 1.4.6 ADFMs and ADSMs enrolled to TOP Prime/Prime Remote enrollees need to contact the TOP contractor to obtain an authorization in order to ensure their urgent care visit will be cashless/claimless. Without this authorization, overseas providers may request payment upfront and the enrollee will then have to submit a claim for reimbursement. • ADSMs enrolled to TOP Prime/Prime Remote requiring urgent care while Temporary Duty (TDY) or on leave, in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia, will not be held to any urgent care referral requirement, but they are still held to applicable DoD and Service regulations concerning ADSM care outside MTFs/eMSMs. The usual ADSM POS exception applies. • ADFMs enrolled to TOP Prime/Prime Remote traveling in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia, may access urgent care without a referral or an authorization, but POS deductibles and cost shares shall apply for claims when urgent care is not provided by a TRICARE network provider or a TRICARE-authorized (network or non-network) UCC. 1.4.7 If urgent treatment is required by a TRICARE Prime enrollee after hours, while traveling away from their residence, or whose PCM is otherwise unavailable, the enrollee may contact their Managed Care Support Contractor (MCSC), TOP contractor, Designated Provider (DP), Nurse Advice Line (NAL) (where available) for assistance finding an appropriate facility/provider before receiving non-emergent care from a provider other than the PCM. If an enrollee is traveling overseas, he or she may call the TOP Regional Call Center for the region in which he or she is traveling to coordinate urgent care. 1.4.8 TRICARE Prime enrollees are to be encouraged to notify their PCM of any urgent/acute care visits to providers other than the PCM within 24 hours of the visit or the first business day following the visit and to schedule follow-up treatment, if indicated, with their PCM or to get a referral from the PCM for additional specialty care. The contractor shall provide beneficiary and provider education on this process, to include information on how to schedule follow-up appointments, and how to coordinate care. 1.4.9 Urgent care can be rendered by a TRICARE network provider or TRICARE-authorized UCC. Providers must have one of the following primary specialty designations: • Family Practice; • Internal Medicine; General Practice; • Pediatrician; and • UCC or Convenience Clinics (CCs).. 2.0 Preauthorizations/Authorizations2.1 The contractor shall review all requests for authorization to determine that the services being requested are a TRICARE benefit. Issuance of authorizations are not a medical necessity or utilization management determination and shall not be used to restrict freedom of choice of the TRICARE Select beneficiary who chooses to receive care from authorized non-network providers, except as required under Chapter 7, Section 2. However, when a TRICARE Select beneficiary receives services covered by the basic program benefits from an authorized health care provider who is not part of the TRICARE provider network, that care is covered by TRICARE but is subject to higher cost-sharing amounts for out-of-network care. 2.2 The contractor shall advise beneficiaries, sponsors, providers, and other responsible persons of those benefits requiring authorization before payment may be made and inform them of the procedures for requesting the authorization. Although beneficiaries are required to obtain authorization prior to receiving payment for the care listed at Chapter 7, Section 2, authorization may be requested following the care. Whether the authorization is requested before or after care, all qualified care shall be authorized for payment. The contractor shall emphasize the need for concerned persons to contact a Beneficiary Counseling and Assistance Coordinator (BCAC) or the contractor for assistance. 2.3 Because of the high risk that many services requiring special authorization may be denied, the contractor shall offer preauthorization for the care to all TRICARE beneficiaries who reside within its jurisdiction. The contractor shall process all requests for such authorization whether submitted by the beneficiary, sponsor or provider requesting authorization on behalf of the beneficiary. 2.4 The contractor shall issue notification of preauthorization/authorization or waiver to the beneficiary or parent/guardian of a minor or incompetent adult, the provider, and to its claims processing staff. Notification may be made in writing by letter, or on a form developed by the contractor. These forms and letters are all referred to as TRICARE authorization forms. The contractor shall not issue an authorization for acute, inpatient mental health care for more than seven calendar days at a time. 2.5 The contractor shall document authorizations and match authorizations to the Unique Identifier Number (UIN); the UIN consists of the MTF/eMSM Defense Medical Information System (DMIS) plus the date referral was generated in Composite Health Care System (CHCS) and the CHCS consult order number. The contractor must also maintain an automated authorization file or an automated system of flagging to ensure claims are processed consistent with authorizations. The contractor shall verify that the UIN, beneficiary, sponsor, provider, and service or supply information submitted on the claim are consistent with that authorized and that the care was accomplished within the authorized time period. 2.6 Prime enrollees receiving emergency care or authorized care from non-network, non-participating providers shall be responsible for only the Prime copayment. On such claims, contractors shall allow the amount the provider may collect under TRICARE rules; i.e., if the charges on a claim are subject to the balance billing limit (refer to the TRICARE Reimbursement Manual (TRM), Chapter 3, Section 1 for information on balance billing limit), the contractor shall allow the lesser of the billed charges or the balance billing limit (115% of allowable charge). If the charges on a claim are exempt from the balance billing limit, the contractor shall allow the billed charges. Refer to the TRM, Chapter 2, Section 1 for information on claims for certain ancillary services. 2.7 The contractor shall implement National Provider Identifier (NPI) checks or other business processes to ensure that authorizations are not issued to MTF/eMSM providers who are also providing services in the purchased care sector. 2.8 Service members, who have sustained an amputation, shall be considered for transfer or admission to an appropriate MTF/eMSM Center of Excellence. Prior to authorizing rehabilitative treatment to a purchased care sector provider or facility, the contractor (Managed Care Support Contractor (MCSC), DP and TOP), in coordination with the respective TRICARE Regional Office (TRO)/TRICARE Area Office (TAO) and the assigned MTF/eMSM (or DHA-Great Lakes (DHA-GL) for TRICARE Prime Remote (TPR) enrollees), shall determine whether care is available from any DoD Advanced Rehabilitation Center (ARC). The DoD ARCs include the Center for the Intrepid (CFI); San Antonio Military Medical Center (SAMMC), San Antonio, Texas; Military Advanced Training Center (MATC); Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), Bethesda, Maryland; and the Comprehensive Combat and Complex Casualty Care (C5), Naval Medical Center, San Diego, California. The assigned MTF (or DHA-GL for TPR enrollees) and the ARC will determine appropriateness of the transfer/referral. If care is available and appropriate in one of these facilities, the contractor shall facilitate the transfer or admission of the Service member as soon as practical based on the patient’s condition. The contractor shall coordinate with the respective TRO/TAO or DHA-GL for any issues or concerns. See Section J of the contract for reporting requirements. 3.0 Failure To Comply With Preauthorization - Payment ReductionDuring claims processing, provider payments shall be reduced for failure to comply with the preauthorization requirements for certain types of care. See the TRM, Chapter 1, Section 28, for more information. 4.0 Psychiatric Residential Treatment Centers (RTCs)4.1 All RTC care requires preauthorization review, regardless of the setting (see Chapter 7, Section 2). Before any claims for RTC care may be paid, an authorization must be on file. The dates of service on the claim form and the name of the facility plus the Employer Identification Number (EIN) with suffix must correspond with the dates of the approval and the facility indicated on the authorization. If the beneficiary resides outside of the contractor’s region, the contractor responsible for payment shall pay the claims at the rate determined by Defense Health Agency (DHA). When the contractor issues an RTC authorization, it shall flag its files to preclude payment of any family or collateral therapy that is billed in the name of the RTC patient. That cost is the responsibility of the RTC, unless, as part of its negotiated agreement, the contractor agrees to a separate payment for such care. Under the DHA-determined rates, family therapists may bill separately from the RTC (outside the all-inclusive rate) only if the therapy is provided to one or both of the parents residing a significant distance from the RTC. In the case of residents of a region, geographically distant family therapy must be certified by the contractor in order for cost-sharing to occur. 4.2 If a claim for admission or extension is submitted and no authorization form is on file, the claim shall not be paid. For network claims, the contractor may deny or develop in accordance with its agreements with network providers. For non-network claims, the contractor shall deny the claim. 4.3 For any claims submitted for inpatient care at other than the RTC, the contractor shall pay the claim if the care was medically necessary. Claims for RTC care during the period of time the beneficiary was receiving care from another inpatient facility shall be denied. If the RTC has been paid and a claim for inpatient hospital care is received and the care was medically necessary, the contractor must pay the inpatient hospital claim and recover the payment from the RTC. 5.0 Grandfathered Custodial Care CasesA list of the beneficiaries who qualified for custodial care benefits prior to June 1, 1977, has been furnished to the contractor with instructions to flag the file for those beneficiaries on the list who are within its region. Claims received for those beneficiaries, for which no authorization is on file, are to be suspended and the contractor shall notify the appropriate TRICARE Regional Office (TRO). Refer to 32 CFR 199.4. 6.0 Referral And Authorization ProcessThe contractor shall process referrals in accordance with the following: 6.1 Referrals From The MTF/eMSM To The ContractorReferral Management Suite (RMS) is the Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) system to transmit referrals and authorizations between the Military Health System (MHS) MTFs/eMSMs and contractors. RMS captures and stores the referral and authorization information allowing for the tracking of referrals from the time it is created to the time the referral results are provided to the referring provider or closed for non-use by the patient. RMS is able to transmit Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant 278 Health Care Services Review Request for Review and Response transactions. The RMS supports reporting of referral authorization processing times, rejected referrals, and referrals awaiting contractor response, among others. Faxing shall be used only in situations when electronic means is temporarily unavailable (with the exception of transmission of ROFRs and the Coast Guard which does not use the RMS). Referrals from the MTF/eMSM will include the information in the chart below, at a minimum, unless otherwise specified. The MTF/eMSM is not required to provide diagnosis or procedure codes. The contractor shall translate the narrative descriptions into standard diagnosis and procedure codes. The contractor shall ensure that care received outside the MTF/eMSM and referred by the MTF/eMSM (for MTF/eMSM enrollees) is properly entered into the contractor’s claims processing system to ensure the appropriate adjudication of claims. To facilitate adjudication of claims, the contractor’s claims system shall utilize the UIN, at a minimum, to match claims with referral authorizations.

The UIN is the DMIS (of the referring facility identified in the “Referring MTF/eMSM” field on this request) --Date in format indicated-- Consult Order Number from CHCS. Special Instructions: Note 1: *Above data elements are required unless otherwise noted as “Optional.” Note 2: Use of the NPI is required in accordance with Health and Human Services (HHS) NPI Final Rule of May 23, 2007 or upon service direction and/or direction of the Contracting Officer (CO). Implementation requirements may be found at Chapter 19, Section 4. Note 3: When issuing a preauthorization for a Service member while in terminal leave status to obtain medical care from the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA), as required by Chapter 17, Section 1, paragraph 4.5, the MTF/eMSM shall make special entries for data elements as follows: Patient Primary Provisional Diagnosis Condition of a routine or urgent nature as specified by the patient at a future date. Reason for Request Provide preauthorization for outpatient treatment by the DVA for routine or urgent conditions while the active duty patient is in a terminal leave status. Service 1 - Provider Any DVA provider. Service 1 - By Name Provider Request if Applicable - First and Last Name DVA provider only. Note 4: When issuing an authorization for the DVA to provide a Compensation and Pension (C&P) examination for a Service member as required by Chapter 17, Section 2, paragraph 3.2.2, the MTF/eMSM shall make special entries for data elements as follows: Patient Primary Provisional Diagnosis V68.01 - Disability Examination or Z02.71 - Disability Examination Reason for Request DVA only: Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) C&P Examinations for Fitness for Duty Determination Service 1 - Provider Any DVA Provider Service 1 - By Name Provider Request if Applicable - First and Last Name DVA Provider Only Service 1 - Service Quantity Number of C&P Examinations Authorized This blanket preauthorization is only for routine and urgent outpatient primary medical care provided by the DVA while the patient is in a terminal leave status and/or for C&P examinations through IDES. Terminal leave for this patient concludes at midnight on DD MM YY. The referral in Note 4 shall be considered a blanket authorization for any DVA to conduct the authorized number of C&P exams and ancillary services. 6.1.1 Using the UIN, the contractor shall locate related referrals, authorizations, and claims. Contractor generated MTF/eMSM reports shall be modified to accommodate the UIN and NPI. The UIN shall also be used for all related customer service inquiries. UINs and NPIs will be attached to all MTF/eMSM referrals and will be portable across all regions of care. The UIN will be used to match claims to an MTF/eMSM generated referral. The contractor shall provide the MTF/eMSM a monthly adjudicated referral claim report which shall include the UIN against each claim. The contractor shall capture the NPIs from the referral transmission report and forward the NPI and corresponding UIN to the referred to provider on all referrals. 6.1.2 The contractor where care is rendered shall apply their best business practices when authorizing care for referrals to their network and shall retain responsibility for managing requests for additional services or inpatient concurrent stay reviews associated with the original referral as well as changes to the specialty provider identified to deliver the care. The contractor authorizing the care shall forward the referral/authorization information, including the range of codes authorized (i.e., Episode Of Care (EOC)) and the name, the NPI, and demographic information of the specialty provider to the contractor for the region to which the patient is enrolled. If the patient is enrolled overseas, the contractor shall provide the same service and information required above to the TOP contractor. If a CONUS Prime retiree/retiree family member receives authorization to obtain care overseas from a contractor, the contractor shall forward the authorization information to the TOP contractor to ensure appropriate adjudication of the claim. Claims submitted by the provider shall be processed by the contractor or the TOP contractor according to Chapter 8, Section 2. 6.1.3 The contractor shall screen the information provided and return incomplete requests within one business day to the MTF/eMSM by HIPAA-compliant 278 response. If the contractor’s system is temporarily not available, then the contractor shall send the information to the MTF’s/eMSM’s single POC via fax or other electronic means acceptable to the MTF/eMSM and the contractor. The return of a referral to the MTF/eMSM is considered processed to completion. 6.1.4 The contractor shall verify that the services are a TRICARE benefit through appropriate medical review and screening to ensure that the service requested is reimbursable through TRICARE. The contractor’s medical review shall be in accordance with the contractor’s best business practices. This process does not alter the TRICARE Operations Manual (TOM), TRICARE Policy Manual (TPM), or TRICARE Systems Manual (TSM) provisions covering active duty personnel or TRICARE For Life (TFL) beneficiaries. 6.1.5 The contractor shall advise the patient, referring MTF/eMSM, and receiving provider of all approved referrals. The MTF/eMSM single Point of Contact (POC) shall be advised via HIPAA-compliant 278 response. (The MTF/eMSM single POC may be an individual or a single office with more than one telephone number.) The notice to the beneficiary shall contain the UIN and information necessary to support obtaining ordered services or an appointment with the referred to provider within the access standards. The notice shall also provide the beneficiary with instructions on how to change their provider, if desired. If the contractor is informed that the beneficiary changed the provider listed on the referral, the contractor shall make appropriate modifications to MTF/eMSM issued referral (to revise the provider the beneficiary was referred to by the MTF/eMSM). The revised referral shall contain the same level of data as the initial MTF/eMSM referral. The revised referral shall be issued to the current provider, with an updated HIPAA-compliant 278 response to the MTF/eMSM. If the contractor’s system is temporarily not available, then the contractor shall send the information to the MTF’s/eMSM’s single POC via fax or other electronic means acceptable to the MTF/eMSM and the contractor. For same day, 24-hour, and 72-hour referrals, no beneficiary notification shall be issued. The contractor shall notify the provider to whom the beneficiary is being referred of the approved services, to include clinical information furnished by the referring provider. 6.1.6 If services are denied, the contractor shall notify the patient and shall advise the patient of their right to appeal consistent with the TOM. The contractor shall also notify the referring single MTF/eMSM POC by HIPAA-compliant 278 response of the initial denial..7 For services beyond the initial authorization, the contractor shall use its best practices in determining the extent of additional services to authorize. The contractor shall not request a referral from the MTF/eMSM but shall provide the MTF/eMSM, by HIPAA-compliant 278 response, the updated authorization and clinical information that served as the basis for the new authorization..8 Directed Referrals (CONUS Only)6.1.8.1 The contractor shall establish and maintain an adequate network (Chapter 5, and TRM, Chapter 1, Section 1) to produce the best quality and outcome for TRICARE beneficiaries. MTF/eMSM-directed referrals could impede the contractor’s ability to maintain and manage the network. Directed referrals are any provider generated by-name requests for services. Directed referrals are expected to be rare; however, a description of appropriate circumstances is outlined in the MOU and the process for submitting directed referrals for services within the PSA will be contained within the MOUs between the MTFs/eMSMs, TROs, and contractor. 6.1.8.2 MTF/eMSM directed referrals for initial services to a non-network provider greater than 100 miles from the MTF/eMSM where specialized treatment, surgical procedure, and/or inpatient admission is expected or being requested require justification from the MTF/eMSM to the contractor and coordination between the contractor and TRO prior to approval by the contractor. This coordination process is contained within the MOUs between the MTFs/eMSMs, TRO, and contractor. The MOU will also contain guidance on types of MTF/eMSM directed referrals excluded from this policy. The contractor shall accomplish benefit review and medical necessity review as required by policy and then coordinate with the TRO prior to completing the referral/authorization. The contractor may ask the TRO for guidance on any MTF/eMSM or network provider-directed referral that meets the intent of this policy. 6.1.8.3 The contractor shall make and document appropriate determinations considering the justification provided by the MTF/eMSM for directed referrals to non-network providers. The contractor shall track and report MTF/eMSM-directed referrals to the TRO as specified in Section J of the contract. 6.2 Referrals From The Contractor To The MTF/eMSMReferrals subject to the ROFR provision from the civilian sector shall be processed in accordance with the following procedures. 6.2.1 The contractor shall send ROFRs to the MTF/eMSM via a HIPAA-compliant 278, or other process as identified by the Government. The request shall contain the minimum data set described in paragraph 6.1 (with the exception of the UIN) plus the referring civilian provider’s fax number, telephone number, and mailing address. This data set shall be provided to the MTF/eMSM in plain text with or without diagnosis or procedure codes. This transmission shall take place within 90 minutes from date/time of receipt of referral for “urgent priority” ROFRs and within two business days from date/time of receipt for “routine priority” ROFRs. If the contractor’s system is temporarily not available, then the contractor shall send the information to the MTF’s/eMSM’s single POC via fax or other electronic means acceptable to the MTF/eMSM and the contractor. 6.2.2 The MTF/eMSM will respond to the contractor via HIPAA-compliant 278, or other process as identified by the Government, within 90 minutes from receipt of the request for “urgent priority” ROFRs and two business days, as defined in paragraph 6.2.1, from receipt of the request for “routine priority” ROFRs. When no response is received from the MTF/eMSM in response to the ROFR request as defined above, the contractor shall process the referral request as if the MTF/eMSM declined to see the patient. The contractor shall provide each MTF/eMSM with a report of the number and specialty types of ROFR referrals forwarded to the MTF/eMSM, the number of accepted and declined ROFRs by the MTF/eMSM, and the accuracy of the types of ROFRs forwarded to the MTF/eMSM compared to the MTF’s/eMSM’s capability and capacity report. All referrals for care indicated on the MTF/eMSM capabilities table shall be forwarded to the MTF/eMSM by the contractor. The only exception will be for continuity of care. Continuity of care is operationally defined as follow on care from a specific specialist as part of a specific procedure or service that was performed within the previous six months. 6.2.3 The ROFR will be forwarded for Prime beneficiaries for whom the MTF/eMSM has indicated the desire to receive referral requests based on specialty or selective diagnosis codes or procedure codes, and/or enrollment category. ROFR requests shall be provided prior to the contractor’s medical necessity and covered benefit review to afford the MTF/eMSM the opportunity to see the patient prior to any decision. 6.2.4 In instances where the MTF/eMSM elects to accept the patient, the MTF/eMSM will advise the contractor from date/time of receipt for “routine priority” ROFRs, as defined in paragraph 6.2.1. The contractor shall notify the beneficiary of the MTF’s/eMSM’s acceptance and provide instructions for contacting the MTF/eMSM to obtain an appointment. The contractor shall enforce the POS if the patient chooses to not go to the MTF/eMSM once the MTF/eMSM has accepted the ROFR. 6.3 The contractor shall provide reports on unactivated behavioral health referrals, referrals received by specialty, and purchased care MTF/eMSM Prime enrolled inpatients. Details for reporting are identified by the DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirement List (CDRL), located in Section J of the applicable contract. - END -Posted by John Flint on August 26, 2010 at 07:33:42:

Hey kids, bring out the spinning rod and reel, it is rainbow trout season! Thanks to the Fraser Valley Trout Hatchery, lake fishing in the Lower Mainland is fantastic between April and September!
Fishing for a few relaxing hours with friends and family by the lake with a few fish as a bonus can be an excellent way to spend the evenings after work or school. Between Squamish and Mission, there are up to twenty kid-friendly lakes where trout fishing is consistently productive. Each year, staff at the Fraser Valley Trout Hatchery stock up to 1,000 rainbow trout in each lake, to ensure that everyone can experience the thrill of catching!
Because the rainbow trout are raised at a hatchery and programmed to eat artificial feeds, bait fishing is the easiest method to entice them. Bait that have proven to be successful include dew worm, shrimp, roe sac, PowerBait and artificial salmon eggs. You can increase your success by paying close attention to details such as line weight, float and hook size. When fishing, move your float several feet once awhile if the action is slow. Keep that line tight, and be ready to pull when that float goes under!
Keys to baitfishing success (left to right): A small Drennan float such as this 7g Loafer provides the sensitivity needed but also heavy enough for distance casting from shore. Shrimp are irresistible to rainbow trout and they rarely fail during at the local lakes. Small split shots and hooks between size 4 and 8 allow you to fish with confidence!
For more information on bait fishing for these stocked rainbow trout, please go to this article.
For a more challenging way to fish, try casting artificial lures or flies. Small bright spinners and spoons can grab a fish's attention from a great distance on a sunny day. Too often the fish becomes aggravated by the vibration of the lure and ends up biting it. Typical flies that work well at lakes in the Lower Mainland are leeches and in various colours. Don't be afraid to change. A change of lure or fly can suddenly improve your result.
Artificial weapons (left to right): A small silvery lure trailed with a size 6 hook is irrisitible to any fish. A light spinning reel with a smooth drag is necessary for trout spinning. Assorted small flies such as wooly buggers and doc spratleys are usually productive.
For more information on lure fishing for these stocked rainbow trout, please go to this article.
For a list of lakes that are regularly stocked with catchable rainbow trout up to 12 inches by the Fraser Valley Trout Hatchery, please go to the Region Two fishing location guide. Daily quota for most lakes is four fish per person per day, but some lakes have specific quota. Como Lake has an age restriction, only anglers who are under 16 and above 65 can fish it. When fishing, be sure to respect your fellow anglers by keeping the area clean. If you see an angler who is keeping too many fish or violating other regulations, be sure to contact the conservation officers. By doing so, you can keep your favorite local lakes angler-friendly.The owners of several YouTube channels have reported some of their crypto-related videos are being removed from the platform.
At least 11 channels have reportedly complained about the situation, including Altcoin Daily, Сhico Crypto, The Cryptoverse, Crypto Tips, BTC Sessions and Chris Dunn. The latter has tweeted YouTube has blocked most of the videos he has posted over the past years.
.
This situation has been received with surprise by the crypto community if we take into account that YouTube's community guidelines do not ban crypto-related videos, at least not directly. However, the regulations do mention that any reference to fake coins are totally forbidden.
YouTube has not yet shared any statement on this controversial decision.

Being a mother, I am very concerned about the health and well-being of my little one as I always want my baby to be safe and sound. The infections, rashes and redness which occur on the skin of my baby are my greatest concern as the products I used earlier contained numerous harsh chemicals and alcohol. I came across newly launched Mother Sparsh Water Wipes recently and they are purest wipes with 99% of water and natural fabric from a plant, which makes it most suitable for newborns. These wipes are quite thick, effective, pure and gentle. Mother Sparsh India has now launched new premium 99% water based baby wipes that are fabricated using super thick medical grade cloth.
I found the New Mother Sparsh wipes ideal for cleaning the delicate skin of my baby as they are a suitable alternative to cotton wool. These unscented baby wipes are apt for the sensitive skin of my little one and are completely fragrance-free, alcohol-free and chemical free. They are unlike other wipes in the market in terms of thickness, as they are manufactured using a cutting-edge technology. A newborn baby’s skin is thin and vulnerable to infections but conventional baby wipes have ingredients that are full of harmful chemicals that can cause infections and skin problems. However, Mother Sparsh Baby wipes are absolutely pure and convenient, with non-greasy feeling and no residue on the skin.
Here are some of the qualities they possess:
- Newly launched Mother Sparsh sensitive baby wipes have it all: Wipes by Mother Sparsh are Unscented, Super thick, made with medical grade and are perfect for hand and mouth cleansing as they are as good as cotton and water. My baby stays away from allergies, rashes, and redness while providing great cleansing to my bundle of joy.
- Let’s accept it that they are the best: These newly launched are the best baby wipes for newborns with sensitive skin as these unscented wet wipes are fabricated with 100% biodegradable and natural fabric, which is velvety soft. This plant-based and medical-grade fabric feels soft like cotton and is environment-friendly too. They are great for the newborn babies as they are dermatologically tested. The cloth is medical grade which makes the baby wipes gentle for my baby’s sensitive parts.
- Sensitive baby wipes with no perfume: I got purest wipes with no chemicals from Mother Sparsh as they are premium and purest baby wipes with 99% water, no fragrance or chemicals and they are certified to be safe for neonates and for babies with sensitive skin.
- Thicker fabric for better wiping: The fabric used in wipes is three times thicker than the ordinary baby wipes as they are derived from the plant pulp and are completely natural. The thicker fabric provides better cleansing the baby’s sensitive parts.
Moisture locked lid: The packaging of the wipes contains moisture locked lid which retails the moisture of the product after every use. This makes it easier to carry while travelling and prevents entry of dirt and germs. The freshness stays intact along with the moisture and every wipe is as good as the first one.
- Totally apt for cleaning hands, mouth or body: Mother Sparsh wipes are gentle and chemical free and can be used for cleaning hands, mouth or body of newborns, without any stress. Give your infants and neonates the best gift with the newly launched Mother Sparsh sensitive wipes, which are the most awaited unscented variant of Mother Sparsh Water Wipes.
My opinion about the newly launched Mother Sparsh wipes is they are sensitive baby wipes as gentle as a mother’s touch on baby’s sensitive skin and are hypoallergenic so that the skin of my infant stays protected. These alcohol-free and chemical free wipes are eco-friendly and are made from natural materials. I would totally recommend them for enhanced hygiene and the safety of your child.

Legend has it that, in the 11th century, Lady Godiva rode her horse through the streets of Coventry entirely naked! As saucy as that may sound today, the story goes that her nude ride was in protest against a tax on the people, imposed by her own husband, Leofric, Earl of Mercia. She must have been quite the woman!
This coin takes that legend, and borrows the artwork from John Collier's 19th century painting of the scene, and pieces it together with high precision minting in the form of a puzzle.
Struck with intricate detail, there appears to be a large number of puzzle pieces on this three ounce, 99.9% pure silver coin. On top of that, the precise colouring used to reflect Collier's masterpiece is unbelievable.
The non-traditional take on a classic painting, and tiny mintage of just 340, makes this coin particularly desirable!

For Nolan, who has spent the past four years in Portland, he played 118 games, collecting 5 goals with 20 assists for 25 points and 59 penalty minutes in regular season play and 2 games with 2 assists in the playoffs.
Portland will play a pair of US teams this weekend and then return home with an unheard-of 11 game homestand starting on Tuesday when they take on Everett.
The WHL has had to readjust the schedule for the Spokane Chiefs as two of their players tested positive for COVID 19. The names of the players were not released. Adjustments included a pair of games scheduled for this weekend when Spokane was to visit Victoria. Dates have not been announced for the teams in make-up games. Spokane and Everett, who were to face off Wednesday, November 10 in a rescheduled game, have now moved that game to Friday, March 11, 2022, in Everett. Spokane has paused all team activities, including off-ice practice and off-ice training, pending further test results. The WHL will provide information once it becomes available.
Five WHL teams ranked in the KIA Top Ten CHL rankings, with four in the top 5. Winnipeg Ice, who stormed out to 11 wins in a row, snagged the number top spot with a record of 15-1 and were closely followed by Kamloops Blazers at number three. Kamloops Blazers have been dominant in the BC Division with an 11-2 record. The fifth spot went Everett capturing the spot with a record of 9-0-0-1. Having played the fewest number of games thus far, the Tips have started as they finished off last season, at the top. Edmonton Oil Kings took the sixth spot at 10-3-2-1 but were recently overtaken by the Red Deer Rebels, who may capture a ranking if they do well this weekend. Entering the rankings were Seattle Thunderbirds 9-2-1-0, who shocked the Tips with a 4-3 win recently. Three teams from Quebec make the poll, and two from Ontario round out the top ten.
Portland is currently out of the rankings at 5-7 0-1 and hanging onto a playoff spot as they rank seventh. The top eight conference teams will make the playoffs.

And he takes the long view. It was 20 years ago that the self-made billionaire from Brittany, who parlayed his family’s modest timber company into a luxury-brand empire before he fell hard for contemporary art, first announced his intention to create a museum for his growing collection. The original site, appropriate for this man who speaks with MyClubtee Fashion LLC t-shirt pride of his humble origins, was an abandoned Renault car factory on an island in the Seine to the west of Paris, long a potent symbol in the French workers movementFive years later, citing endless administrative delays, Pinault scrapped those plans and turned to Venice, where the Palazzo Grassi, an 18th-century mansion on the Grand Canal that had served as a cultural venue, was seeking a new owner. He acquired it in 2005 and two years later leased the nearby, historic Punta della Dogana, or customs house, from the city of Venice. He had Ando subtly revamp both spaces, now home to site-specific installations as well as thematic selections of work Pinault owns.

OPINION
PAEZ, Circuit Judge.
In the weeks preceding the closely contested presidential elections of 2000, a number of Internet websites were created that facilitated discussions among voters regarding potential strategic ways of voting. Through these discussions, the participants could agree to informally "swap" their votes, generating additional votes for the Democratic candidate in crucial swing states while allowing the third party candidate to garner enough votes to become eligible for federal financing in future elections. Plaintiffs, the creator and users of one such website, brought suit alleging violations of the First Amendment after Defendant Bill Jones ("Jones"), then Secretary of State for California, sent a cease and desist letter to the operators of a similar website in which he threatened to prosecute them under California Elections Code sections 18521 and 18522 for brokering the exchange of votes. Plaintiffs appeal the district court's order staying their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief under the abstention doctrine established in Railroad Commission v. Pullman, 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941), and dismissing their claims for damages under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to conform to heightened pleading rules.
We agree with the district court that Plaintiffs' First Amendment and other claims are justiciable and are not barred by the Eleventh Amendment, but we reverse the district court's ruling staying Plaintiffs' claims under Pullman. It is rarely appropriate for a federal court to abstain under Pullman in a First Amendment case, because there is a risk in First Amendment cases that the delay that results from abstention will itself chill the exercise of the rights that the plaintiffs seek to protect by suit. We conclude that the risk of this kind of First Amendment chill is present here, notwithstanding the fact that Plaintiffs' challenge to the threatened application of Elections Code sections 18521 and 18522 is an as-applied challenge. Because the factors required for Pullman abstention were not met in this case, the district court had no discretion to abstain.
We also hold that the district court erred in dismissing Plaintiffs' claims for damages for failure to meet the heightened pleading standard that we established in Branch v. Tunnell, 937 F.2d 1382, 1386 (9th Cir.1991). In our recent decision in Galbraith v. County of Santa Clara, 307 F.3d 1119, 1125 (9th Cir.2002), we held that Branch v. Tunnell's heightened pleading standard did not survive the Supreme Court's decision in Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 118 S.Ct. 1584, 140 L.Ed.2d 759 (1998). Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of the damages claims and remand for consideration of the merits.
I.
BACKGROUND
On October 23, 2000, in anticipation of the November 2000 national presidential election, Plaintiff Alan Porter ("Porter") created a website called "votexchange2000.com" ("Porter's website"). In addition to offering general information about the electoral college, election predictions, and voting, Porter's website provided "a forum to allow individuals around the country to contact one another and discuss their political beliefs and strategies for the upcoming election."
As described in the amended complaint, Porter's website contained:
a questionnaire Page designed to facilitate the exchange of [] information [about voting intentions] by creating a database of e-mail addresses of interested voters.... The program would inform voters about whether their states were considered `safe' or `swing.' The website then invited visitors who wished to contact compatible voters to enter their e-mail addresses.... A software program matched up citizens with complementary preferences and sent out e-mail addresses to each party. From there on, further discussion or action by any two voters matched by the votexchange2000 software was conducted directly between those parties on an entirely voluntary basis.
On October 30, 2000, Defendant Jones, the Secretary of State of California, sent a cease and desist letter to the founders of a website called "voteswap2000.com," threatening criminal prosecution under Elections Code sections 185211 and 185222 for allegedly brokering the exchange of votes. This letter also stated, "Any person or entity that tries to exchange votes or brokers the exchange of votes will be pursued with the utmost vigor." On that same day, Jones sent similar correspondence, with similar threats of prosecution, to Yahoo! Inc. and Register.com. These threats were reported in local and national newspapers.
The creators of voteswap2000.com posted a notice on their website regarding these threats and discontinued those activities deemed potentially illegal. Although Jones received complaints regarding other election-related websites, such as NaderTrader.com, virtualvotesforNader.com, and winwincampaign.org, Jones did not send cease and desist letters to the owners of these websites, because he determined that they did not broker the exchange of votes in violation of Elections Code sections 18521 and 18522.
Porter promptly learned of the cease and desist letter, and that voteswap2000.com "had shut itself down under threat of prosecution." Because Porter was "deeply afraid" of being prosecuted, he suspended the operation of his website, although he never received a cease and desist letter. On November 2, 2000, Porter, along with Patrick Kerr, Steven Lewis, Scott Tenley, William J. Davis, and the Democratic Law Students Association at the University of California, Los Angeles (collectively "Plaintiffs"), filed suit against Jones.3 Plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that Jones's actions denied them freedom of speech and association in violation of the First Amendment and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and requested declaratory and injunctive relief. They applied for a temporary restraining order enjoining Jones from taking any "enforcement action against Plaintiffs for any expressive activities in connection with the November 7, 2000 presidential election, including expression conducted on web sites," but the district court denied Plaintiffs' application the day before the election.
Subsequently, Plaintiffs amended their complaint, alleging that Porter intended to operate a website similar to his first one in the 2004 presidential election, and suing Jones in his individual capacity for damages and in his official capacity for a permanent injunction restraining him "from prosecuting, threatening to prosecute, or taking any enforcement action against Plaintiffs, and others similarly situated, for any expressive activities described herein in connection with the November 7, 2000 presidential election as well as any future presidential election, including expression conducted on web sites." Plaintiffs also added claims under the California Constitution and, in addition, § 1983 claims alleging violations of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Commerce Clause.
Jones responded by filing a motion to dismiss, challenging Plaintiffs' claims on the basis of standing, mootness, and ripeness. In the alternative, Jones argued that the district court should stay the case under the Pullman abstention doctrine. As noted, the district court dismissed Plaintiffs' damages claims for failure to satisfy the heightened pleading standards that we established in Branch v. Tunnell, 937 F.2d at 1386. The district court stayed all other claims, concluding that Plaintiffs had standing and their claims were not moot, but abstaining under Pullman. Plaintiffs timely appealed the district court's abstention order and judgment dismissing their claims for damages.
II.
JURISDICTION
The district court's decision to abstain under Pullman is immediately appealable under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and 1292(a)(1). Confederated Salish v. Simonich, 29 F.3d 1398, 1407 (9th Cir.1994). Plaintiffs' damages claims are also immediately appealable because the district court entered judgment on them under Rule 54(b). Because Plaintiffs appeal the district court's dismissal for failure to state a claim, Plaintiffs' allegations are taken as true. See, e.g., Burgert v. Lokelani Bernice Pauahi Bishop Trust, 200 F.3d 661, 663 (9th Cir.2000). In debating the propriety of abstention, the parties also rely on the facts alleged in the complaint.
We initially address the question of justiciability, because Jones claims that this case is moot and unripe,4 and alleges that the damages claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Mootness, ripeness, and standing are questions of law that we review de novo, Cole v. Oroville Union High Sch. Dist., 228 F.3d 1092, 1097-98 (9th Cir.2000), as is the existence of sovereign immunity, Corzo v. Banco Cent. de Reserva del Peru, 243 F.3d 519, 522 (9th Cir.2001).
A. MOOTNESS
Jones argues that this case is moot because Plaintiffs' claims for injunctive and declaratory relief arise from the 2000 presidential election, which has already taken place. A case becomes moot "when the issues presented are no longer `live' or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome." Clark v. City of Lakewood, 259 F.3d 996, 1011 (9th Cir.2001) (citations omitted).
Plaintiffs retain a cognizable interest in their claims for damages, which clearly indicates that a live controversy remains between the parties. Bernhardt v. County of Los Angeles, 279 F.3d 862, 872 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that a plaintiff's claim for damages was not moot although the plaintiff's claim for prospective relief was). And, as the district court held, Plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief fall within the "capable of repetition, yet evading review" exception to the mootness doctrine. A case falls within this exception where: (1) the challenged action was too short in duration to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration; and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subjected to the same action again. First Nat'l Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 774, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978).
Election cases often fall within this exception, because the inherently brief duration of an election is almost invariably too short to enable full litigation on the merits. See, e.g., id.; Norman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279, 287-88, 112 S.Ct. 698, 116 L.Ed.2d 711 (1992); Reich v. Local 396, Internat'l Brotherhood of Teamsters, 97 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 5 (9th Cir.1996); Baldwin v. Redwood City, 540 F.2d 1360, 1365 (9th Cir.1976); Becker v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 230 F.3d 381, 389 (1st Cir.2000). We have explained:
Election cases like the present one come within the type of controversy that is "capable of repetition, yet evading review."... Appellate courts are frequently too slow to process appeals before an election determines the fate of a candidate. If such cases were rendered moot by the occurrence of an election, many constitutionally suspect election laws — including the one under consideration here — could never reach appellate review.
Joyner v. Mofford, 706 F.2d 1523, 1527 (9th Cir.1983).
Here, the district court found that Porter had only "six to eight months from the identification of the party candidates to the election to create his website, and barely two weeks from the creation of his election website to the date of the actual election to fully litigate this case." Plaintiffs are likely to be subjected to this same type of action again, because Porter has expressed his intent to create a similar website in future presidential elections, the other plaintiffs are likely to use such a website, and there is no indication that Jones will not enforce the election laws against Plaintiffs in the future.5 See Baldwin, 540 F.2d at 1365 (9th Cir.1976) (holding that controversy was capable of repetition, yet evading review, because plaintiffs had shown that they had used political signs in past elections, that they wanted to use them in future elections, and that city officials indicated that they would continue to enforce the prohibitions on that activity). We therefore reject Jones's argument that this case is moot.
B. RIPENESS
Jones also argues that this case is not ripe to the extent that Plaintiffs' allegations are based on activities intended for the 2004 election. The district court did not resolve the issue of ripeness, instead merging the ripeness analysis with its decision to abstain under Pullman.
"[A] case is not ripe where the existence of the dispute itself hangs on future contingencies that may or may not occur." Clinton v. Acequia, Inc., 94 F.3d 568, 572 (9th Cir.1996). But as a fair reading of Plaintiffs' amended complaint indicates,6 Plaintiffs' allegations do not concern the 2004 election, but are based on events surrounding the 2000 election, thus presenting a fully developed factual scenario. Porter's statement of intent to set up a similar website in 2004 is relevant to Plaintiff's claim that this controversy is capable of repetition, yet evading review, and cannot be read to constitute a separate, unripe claim.
C. ELEVENTH AMENDMENT
Jones next argues that the Eleventh Amendment bars not only Plaintiffs' claims for prospective relief, but also their damages claims. These arguments are meritless.
The Eleventh Amendment erects a general bar against federal lawsuits brought against a state. Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 276, 106 S.Ct. 2932, 92 L.Ed.2d 209 (1986). However, suits against a state official are an exception to this bar. Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). Under the doctrine of Ex parte Young, suits against an official for prospective relief are generally cognizable, whereas claims for retrospective relief (such as damages) are not. Papasan, 478 U.S. at 277-78, 106 S.Ct. 2932; Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 664-68, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974). Jones claims that Plaintiffs may not, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, adjudicate the legality of past conduct. This argument confuses liability with remedy. Although Plaintiffs' allegations are rooted in events that occurred in the past, the injunctive and declaratory relief that they seek would prevent future and ongoing illegality.7 The Eleventh Amendment poses no bar to Plaintiffs' claims for prospective relief.
Jones's argument that the Eleventh Amendment bars claims for damages against state officials in their individual capacities also fails. Hafer, 502 U.S. at 27-31, 112 S.Ct. 358. "[T]he Eleventh Amendment does not erect a barrier against suits to impose individual and personal liability on state officials under § 1983." Id. at 30-31, 112 S.Ct. 358 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although Jones alleges that Plaintiffs' addition of the words "in his individual capacity" to the complaint is a mere pleading device, the Supreme Court has expressly rejected this argument. See id. at 27, 112 S.Ct. 358 ("[T]he distinction between official-capacity suits and personal-capacity suits is more than `a mere pleading device.'") (citation omitted). The Eleventh Amendment does not bar Plaintiffs' suit.
III.
PULLMAN ABSTENTION
Having determined that Plaintiffs present a justiciable controversy and that their suit is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment, we hold that the district court erred in abstaining under Pullman. We review a decision to abstain and stay proceedings under Pullman for abuse of discretion. Cinema Arts, Inc. v. Clark County, 722 F.2d 579, 580 (9th Cir.1983). Abstaining under Pullman constitutes an abuse of discretion when the requirements for Pullman abstention are not met. Id. at 582; C-Y Dev. Co. v. City of Redlands, 703 F.2d 375, 377 (9th Cir.1983).
Pullman abstention "is an extraordinary and narrow exception to the duty of a District Court to adjudicate a controversy" that is properly before it. Canton v. Spokane Sch. Dist. No. 81, 498 F.2d 840, 845 (9th Cir.1974). By allowing "federal courts to refrain from deciding sensitive federal constitutional questions when state law issues may moot or narrow the constitutional questions," San Remo Hotel v. City and County of San Francisco, 145 F.3d 1095, 1104 (9th Cir.1998), Pullman abstention is intended both to avoid "a collision between the federal courts and state ... legislatures," id. at 1105 (quoting Waldron v. McAtee, 723 F.2d 1348, 1351 (7th Cir.1983)), and to prevent "the premature determination of constitutional questions," C-Y, 703 F.2d at 377 (quoting Martin v. Creasy, 360 U.S. 219, 224, 79 S.Ct. 1034, 3 L.Ed.2d 1186 (1959)).
In order to "give due respect to a suitor's choice of a federal forum for the hearing and decision of his federal constitutional claims," Pullman abstention should rarely be applied. Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241, 248, 88 S.Ct. 391, 19 L.Ed.2d 444 (1967). It is appropriate to abstain under Pullman only if each of the following three factors is present: "." Confederated Salish, 29 F.3d at 1407; accord Canton, 498 F.2d at 845. Thus, the absence of any one of these three factors is sufficient to prevent the application of Pullman abstention.
Abstention was inappropriate because the first Pullman factor was not present here. Plaintiffs also argue that the second Pullman factor was not satisfied, because Jones's threats of prosecution constitute an unlawful prior restraint in violation of the Constitution, and under prior restraint doctrine, a limiting construction of sections 18521 and 18522 will not resolve the claim that the threatened prosecution was unconstitutional. While Plaintiffs appear to allege a colorable prior restraint claim, in light of our determination that the first Pullman prong is not satisfied, we need not address whether the second or third Pullman factor is present.
The first Pullman factor requires that "the case touches on a sensitive area of social policy upon which the federal courts ought not enter unless no alternative to its adjudication is open." Confederated Salish, 29 F.3d at 1407. We have held that, in First Amendment cases, the first Pullman factor "will almost never be present because the guarantee of free expression is always an area of particular federal concern." Ripplinger v. Collins, 868 F.2d 1043, 1048 (9th Cir.1989). "Indeed, constitutional challenges based on the first amendment right of free expression are the kind of cases that the federal courts are particularly well-suited to hear. That is why abstention is generally inappropriate when first amendment rights are at stake." J-R Distribs., Inc. v. Eikenberry, 725 F.2d 482, 487 (9th Cir.1984), overruled on other grounds by Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 105 S.Ct. 2794, 86 L.Ed.2d 394 (1985).
Our special concern with abstention in the First Amendment context arises in part from the fact that in many cases, the delay that comes from abstention may itself chill the First Amendment rights at issue. See, e.g., Zwickler, 389 U.S. at 252, 88 S.Ct. 391 (holding that to abstain and thus "force the plaintiff who has commenced a federal action to suffer the delay of state court proceedings might itself effect the impermissible chilling of the very constitutional right he seeks to protect"); City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 467-68, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 96 L.Ed.2d 398 (1987); J-R Distribs., 725 F.2d at 488; Garvin v. Rosenau, 455 F.2d 233, 239 (6th Cir.1972) ("Further delay necessitated by abstention would be inconsistent with the policy of protecting the First Amendment against possible chilling influences.").8
In finding that it was appropriate to abstain from the as-applied challenge presented here, the district court distinguished the cases discussed above because they involved facial challenges, not as-applied challenges. The district court was correct in noting that there is a distinction between facial and as-applied challenges for purposes of Pullman analysis. However, that distinction relates to the second Pullman factor, not the first Pullman factor.9 The danger under the first Pullman prong that the decision to abstain might itself chill speech applies to both facial and as-applied challenges. The Supreme Court has clearly stated that "abstention doctrine is inappropriate for cases ... where ... statutes are justifiably attacked on their face as abridging free expression, or as applied for the purpose of discouraging protected activities." Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 489-90, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965) (emphasis added).
The district court relied on Almodovar v. Reiner, 832 F.2d 1138, 1140 (9th Cir.1987), for the proposition that there is no absolute rule against abstention in First Amendment cases. Almodovar is the only First Amendment case in which we have found that Pullman abstention was appropriate.10 Almodovar involved an unusual procedural setting; the issue in question was already before the state supreme court. As a result, we concluded that "[t]he fears of chill that justify our preference against abstention in first amendment cases are not present in this instance." 832 F.2d at 1140 ("[T]he litigants need not undergo the expense or delay of a full state court litigation because other parties are already presenting the issue to the California Supreme Court."). Thus, the delay that is particularly pernicious in First Amendment cases was not an issue.
That unique circumstance is absent here. The district court claimed that "no fear of a chilling effect ... is present in this instance," in light of the fact that Porter does not intend to set up his website until 2004. However, the parties have already been litigating the case in federal court for over two years, and it is far from clear that the case would be resolved prior to the 2004 election if Plaintiffs were sent to state court. Further delay of the adjudication of Plaintiffs' First Amendment claims is not warranted. See Baggett, 377 U.S. at 379 n. 15, 84 S.Ct. 1316 ("[W]here, as here, the litigation has already been in the federal courts an inordinately long time, considerations of equity require that the litigation be brought to an end as quickly as possible.") (quoting Pub. Utilities Comm'n v. United Fuel Co., 317 U.S. 456, 463, 63 S.Ct. 369, 87 L.Ed. 396 (1943)). Because the first factor required for Pullman abstention was not satisfied, abstention was inappropriate.
IV.
DAMAGES CLAIMS
Plaintiffs assert that the district court erred in dismissing their damages claims. Dismissal of a complaint or part of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) is reviewed de novo. Zimmerman v. City of Oakland, 255 F.3d 734, 737 (9th Cir.2001). In light of our recent decision in Galbraith v. County of Santa Clara, we reverse the district court's dismissal of these claims.
To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint generally must satisfy only the minimal notice pleading requirements of Rule 8(a)(2). Rule 8(a)(2) requires only that the complaint include "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2).
In Branch v. Tunnell ("Branch I"), however, we adopted "a heightened pleading standard in cases in which subjective intent is an element of a constitutional tort action." 937 F.2d at 1386. Under that standard, "in order to survive a motion to dismiss, plaintiffs must state in their complaint non-conclusory allegations setting forth evidence of unlawful intent." Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We reaffirmed this statement in Branch v. Tunnell ("Branch II"), 14 F.3d 449 (9th Cir.1994). The district court found that the allegations in Plaintiffs' amended complaint failed to meet this standard.11
In Galbraith, we held that following the Supreme Court's decision in Crawford-El v. Britton, "Branch I and II are no longer good law to the extent that they require heightened pleading of improper motive in constitutional tort cases." 307 F.3d at 1125. This is consistent with Crawford-El's directive that we are to follow those pleading rules established in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and by statute, and that we are not to establish our own. Crawford-El, 523 U.S. at 594-97, 118 S.Ct. 1584; see also Swierkiewicz v. Sorema, N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 513, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002). Thus, the liberal notice pleading standards of Rule 8(a) are appropriate here. Because there is no dispute that Plaintiffs' amended complaint satisfies the requirements of Rule 8(a), we reverse the district court's dismissal of the damages claims and remand for consideration of the merits.
CONCLUSION
We reverse the district court's stay of Plaintiffs' claims under Pullman abstention because there are no special circumstances here that would indicate that we may disregard our general unwillingness to abstain in First Amendment cases when abstention itself could result in chilling the very First Amendment rights that plaintiffs seek to protect by suit. Additionally, we reverse the district court's dismissal of Plaintiffs' damages claims for failure to satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of Branch I, because a heightened standard is no longer appropriate after Galbraith.
REVERSED and REMANDED.
Notes:
The Honorable Donald P. Lay, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation
California Elections Code section 18521 states in relevant part:
A person shall not directly or through any other person receive, agree, or contract for, before, during or after an election, any ... valuable consideration ... for himself or any other person because he or any other person: (a) Voted, agreed to vote, refrained from voting, or agreed to refrain from voting for any particular person or measure.... (d) Induced any other person to: ... (3) Vote or refrain from voting for any particular person or measure. Any person violating this section is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for 16 months or two or three years.
California Elections Code section 18522 states in relevant part:
[A] person ... shall [not] directly or through any other person ... pay ... or offer or promise to pay ... any ... valuable consideration to or for any voter or to or for any other person to: (a) Induce any voter to: ... (2) Vote or refrain from voting at an election for any particular person or measure ... Any person or candidate violating this section is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for 16 months or two or three years.
All of the plaintiffs other than Porter are California and Massachusetts voters or groups of voters who intended to use Porter's website
In its discussion of justiciability, the district court found that Plaintiffs established standing. Jones does not raise this issue before us, and we agree with the district court that Plaintiffs have standing to bring this case. Although Jones did not specifically initiate action against Porter's website, "[i]t is sufficient for standing purposes that ... there is a credible threat that the challenged provision will be invoked against the plaintiff."LSO, Ltd. v. Stroh, 205 F.3d 1146, 1154-55 (9th Cir.2000). The district court noted that Jones directly threatened to take action against a website that Plaintiffs allege is functionally identical to Porter's website. Jones's letter generally threatened "[a]ny person or entity that tries to exchange votes or brokers the exchange of votes," and Jones insists in this litigation that sections 18521 and 18522 outlaw Porter's activities. In addition, the fact that Porter took down his website after Jones threatened voteswap.com indicates that Jones' activities "allegedly `chill' conduct protected by the First Amendment." Navegar, Inc. v. United States, 103 F.3d 994, 999 (D.C.Cir.1997); see also LSO, 205 F.3d at 1156 (finding a credible threat of prosecution in part because "LSO has already engaged in self-censorship"). Because there is a credible threat of prosecution in this case, Plaintiffs have standing to bring this suit.
Jones responds that he will not be Secretary of State in 2004, and thus will be unable to enforce the election laws. This is immaterial, however, because Plaintiffs have sued Jones for injunctive and declaratory relief in his official capacity, and thus any such relief would be binding on his successors in officeSee Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 25, 112 S.Ct. 358, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991) (noting that "when officials sued in [their official] capacity in federal court die or leave office, their successors automatically assume their roles in the litigation").
Plaintiffs only mention the 2004 election in the section of their complaint entitled "Continuing Controversy."
The cases that Jones cites stand only for the proposition that a plaintiff may not couch in terms of injunctive and declaratory relief a compensatory, backward-looking remedy that would be otherwise barred by the Eleventh Amendment, such as a damages or quiet title remedyCompare Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe, 521 U.S. 261, 281-83, 117 S.Ct. 2028, 138 L.Ed.2d 438 (1997) (barring a suit that was equivalent to a quiet title suit); Papasan, 478 U.S. at 278, 106 S.Ct. 2932 (barring "relief [that] is tantamount to an award of damages for a past violation of federal law, even though styled as something else") with Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians v. Hardin, 223 F.3d 1041, 1049 (9th Cir.2000) (allowing a suit to enjoin state officers from collecting an allegedly illegal state tax).
Plaintiffs have filed a motion requesting that we take judicial notice of certain court records and administrative reports, which they claim document the delay that might result if Plaintiffs must proceed in state court before they may return to federal court. As the cited cases indicate, our concern regarding delay in First Amendment cases is well-established. Thus we deny Plaintiffs' motion to take judicial notice
The secondPullman factor, which involves an evaluation of whether a constitutional determination may be avoided, is frequently absent from a facial challenge, because a constitutional determination is generally required to assess a frontal attack upon a statute. See, e.g., Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 375-78, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d 377 (1964) (noting that in light of the facial challenge at issue, abstention was inappropriate because a lengthy series of state lawsuits might be required before the constitutional issue could be entirely evaded); J-R Distribs., 725 F.2d at 488 (noting that, under a facial challenge, some provisions of the statute "are not susceptible to such saving constructions"). In contrast, in as-applied cases a statute may be construed narrowly so as not to apply to the facts in the case presented, thus averting a constitutional determination. See, e.g., Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 402 n. 5, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974) ("Where the case turns on the applicability of a state statute or regulation to a particular person or a defined course of conduct, resolution of the unsettled questions of state law may eliminate any need for constitutional adjudication."), overruled on other grounds by Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 109 S.Ct. 1874, 104 L.Ed.2d 459 (1989).
The only other First Amendment case in which a circuit court has found thatPullman abstention was appropriate is United Home Rentals v. Texas Real Estate Commission, 716 F.2d 324 (5th Cir.1983). In contrast to the case at hand, United Home Rentals involved a commercial speech question, regarding whether the government could require that employees of home rental agencies have real estate licenses. The court did not consider the danger that abstention would chill the First Amendment rights at issue, nor did it recognize the concern that the Supreme Court and other circuit courts have expressed regarding the chilling effect of delay on noncommercial speech. Additionally, it appears from the court's discussion of ongoing state administrative proceedings that the court intermingled Younger principles with the principles underlying Pullman abstention. See Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). United Home Rentals is therefore inapplicable to the case before us.Population Matters charity give Harry and Meghan award for limiting family to two children | US News
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been given a “special award” for deciding to limit their family to two children.
Prince Harry, 36, told British Vogue in 2019 he and Meghan, 39, were only planning “two maximum” to reduce their impact on the environment.
Their son Archie was born on 6 May that year, followed by Lilibet ‘Lili’ Diana on 4 June 2021.
The couple have said they only want two children. Pic: AP
The charity Population Matters said they were giving the couple the award after making the “enlightened decision” to have a smaller family and acting as “role models for others”.
“Having a smaller family reduces our impact on the Earth, and provides a better chance for all our children, their children and future generations to flourish on a healthy planet,” the charity said in a statement.
“We commend the duke and duchess for taking this enlightened decision, and for affirming that a smaller family is also a happy family.”
The Sussexes will receive £500 to donate to a charity of their choice, along with nine other recipients honoured in the run-up to the UN’s World Population Day on Sunday.
They include Wendo Aszed, founder of a women’s empowerment and community health project in rural Kenya, Emma Gannon, author of Olive, a best-selling novel addressing the choice to be child-free, and Nairashe Maritsa, a teenager fighting child marriage in Zimbabwe.
Their second child Lilibet was born at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital. Pic: Google Street View
Harry, who recently returned to the UK from Los Angeles to unveil a statue of his late mother, spoke about his thoughts on family size in an interview with conservationist Jane Goodall.
In the interview, which was part of Meghan’s guest-edited copy of Vogue, he described our planet as “borrowed”.
“Surely, being as intelligent as we all are, or as evolved as we all are supposed to be, we should be able to leave something better behind for the next generation,” he said.
His comments came at a time the couple were facing criticism for reports they used private jets to travel to royal engagements and go on holiday.
They quit as senior royals for a life in California last year, criticising the Royal Family in a tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey in March.It is actually secure to convey that Tinder enjoys totally ensconced it self in to the zeitgeist of the modern relationship world

$14.95The city of Seattle has exceeded last year's record-breaking number of homeless encampment fires that have since cultivated an extreme risk to public safety throughout the city. According to the Seattle Fire Department, over 900 encampment fires have been recorded this year alone, up from 2020's recorded number of 825.
To compare, there were a recorded number of 520 encampment fires in 2019, according to data from the Seattle Fire Department.
ANOTHER SEATTLE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT FIRE: Otherwise, a gorgeous evening in the Emerald City. @komonews pic.twitter.com/fSv6zNH2wI— Jonathan Choe Journalist KOMO News (@choeshow) September 19, 2021
As a result of the shocking increase in number of encampment fires, the Seattle Fire Department told The Post Millennial that SFD added a new code for dispatch to better improve the way they track fires that stem from homeless encampments.
"In order for us to better track our responses to homeless encampments, we have added in new dispatch type codes that list "encampment" if this information is known when someone calls 911 to report it," Seattle Fire said in an email.
"Crews can also change the type code from a regular type code by contacting dispatch once they arrive on scene if its an encampment. In addition to tracking, it also gives responding crews improved situational awareness that the response is at an encampment location," Seattle Fire continued. "This was a department decision to change the type codes so we could improve our tracking mechanism for encampment responses."
According to KOMO News, the Seattle Fire Department has responded to over 60 encampment fires in the last two weeks alone.

In addition, sources inside the Washington State government told The Post Millennial that the encampment fires in green spaces are being classified as "forest fires." Multiple requests for comment from various levels of government, including the Public Lands Commissioner regarding the clasification have not been answered.
Seattle, Washington: Homeless encampment fire at Seattle’s Ballard Commons Park.

Police Frequency on Telegram pic.twitter.com/btzm5DytXj— Dennis Dunham (@DennD68) September 19, 2021
Seattle's homeless encampments continue to ravage communities throughout the city. Last week, protests erupted throughout Seattle communities that have been severely affected by the dangers of the encampments. Seattle's taxpayer funded parks have been overrun by vagrants, which have resulted in the city shutting down the parks for residents to use. However, in response to the protests, city officials said changes aren't to be expected anytime in the near future.
"What the city is doing, what this guy is doing, is not working," concerned parent Jeff Lindstrom told KOMO News. "I just want my kids to be safe and to be able to come to the park."
Another concerned resident protesting the city's lack of intervention told KOMO, "Our city elected leaders have failed to really implement any sort of meaningful program to help the homeless. We really want the Seattle City Council to help the homeless people and also their commitment to all of us to keep the parks safe and open."
In August, fed-up Seattle businesses and residents were fined by the city for attempting to prevent homeless vagrants from camping in front of their private property by placing cement blocks near the road. After community organizing efforts and meetings with city officials to discuss the homeless crisis impeding on livelihoods, Seattle city leaders failed to take action to help their constituents.
In wake of the popular democratic "Defund The Police" movement, Seattle City Council voted to abolish Seattle PD's Navigation Team, a group of officers designated to police encampments despite Seattle's skyrocketing increase in criminal activity. Encampments continue to be at the height of crime in the city as they often bring criminals and drug addicts to communities.1 Packaging Guide
rOpenSci accepts packages that meet our guidelines via a streamlined Software Peer Review process. To ensure a consistent style across all of our tools we have written this chapter highlighting our guidelines for package development. Please also read and apply our chapter about continuous integration (CI). Further guidance for after the review process is provided in the third section of this book starting with a chapter about collaboration.
We strongly recommend that package developers read Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan’s concise but thorough book on package development which is available for free online. Our guide is partially redundant with other resources but highlights rOpenSci’s guidelines.
To read why submitting a package to rOpenSci is worth the effort to meet guidelines, have a look at reasons to submit.
1.1 Package name and metadata
1.1.1 Naming your package
We strongly recommend short, descriptive names in lower case. If your package deals with one or more commercial services, please make sure the name does not violate branding guidelines. You can check if your package name is available, informative and not offensive by using the
availablepackage. In particular, do not choose a package name that’s already used on CRAN or Bioconductor.
A more unique package name might be easier to track (for you and us to assess package use) and search (for users to find it and to google their questions). Obviously a too unique package name might make the package less discoverable (e.g. it might be an argument for naming your package geojson).
Find other interesting aspects of naming your package in this blog post by Nick Tierney, and in case you change your mind, find out how to rename your package in this other blog post of Nick’s.
1.1.2 Creating metadata for your package
We recommend you to use the
codemetar package for creating and updating a JSON CodeMeta metadata file for your package via
codemetar::write_codemeta(). It will automatically include all useful information, including GitHub topics. CodeMeta uses Schema.org terms so as it gains popularity the JSON metadata of your package might be used by third-party services, maybe even search engines.
1.2 Platforms
-.
1.3 Package API
1.3.1 Function and argument naming
Functions and arguments naming should be chosen to work together to form a common, logical programming API that is easy to read, and auto-complete.
- Consider an
object_verb()naming scheme for functions in your package that take a common data type or interact with a common API.
objectrefers to the data/API and
verbthe primary action. This scheme helps avoid namespace conflicts with packages that may have similar verbs, and makes code readable and easy to auto-complete. For instance, in stringi, functions starting with
stri_manipulate strings (
stri_join(),
stri_sort(), and in googlesheets (
%>%).
We strongly recommend
snake_caseover all other styles unless you are porting over a package that is already in wide use.
Avoid function name conflicts with base packages or other popular ones (e.g.
ggplot2,
dplyr,
magrittr,
data.table)
Argument naming and order should be consistent across functions that use similar inputs.
Package functions importing data should not import data to the global environment, but instead must return objects. Assignments to the global environment are to be avoided in general.
1.3.2 Console messages
1.3.3 Interactive/Graphical Interfaces
If providing graphical user interface (GUI) (such as a Shiny app), to facilitate workflow, include a mechanism to automatically reproduce steps taken in the GUI. This could include auto-generation of code to reproduce the same outcomes, output of intermediate values produced in the interactive tool, or simply clear and well-documented mapping between GUI actions and scripted functions. (See also “Testing” below.)
The
tabulizer package e.g. has an interactive workflow to extract tables, but can also only extract coordinates so one can re-run things as a script. Besides, two examples of shiny apps that do code generation are, and.
1.4 Code Style
For more information on how to style your code, name functions, and R scripts inside the
R/folder, we recommend reading the code chapter in The R Packages book. We recommend the
stylerpackage for automating part of the code styling. We suggest reading the Tidyverse style guide.
You can choose to use
=over
<-as long you are consistent with one choice within your package. We recommend avoiding the use of
->for assignment within a package. If you do use
<-throughout your package, and you also use
R6in that package, you’ll be forced to use
=for assignment within your
R6Classconstruction - this is not considered an inconsistency because you can’t use
<-in this case.
1.5 CITATION file
- Create and populate the CITATION file. It’s easy to create a boilerplate with
usethis::use_citation().
- Archive each release of your GitHub repo on Zenodo and add the Zenodo top-level DOI to the CITATION file.
- If one day after review at rOpenSci you publish a software publication about your package, add it to the CITATION file.
- Less related to your package itself but to what supports it: if your package wraps a particular resource such as data source or, say, statistical algorithm, remind users of how to cite that resource via e.g.
citHeader(). Maybe even add the reference for the resource.
As an example see nasapower CITATION file that refers to both the manual and a paper. All it lacks is a Zenodo DOI for the manual – although most users would probably end up citing the JOSS paper.
citHeader("While nasapower does not redistribute the data in any way,\n", "we encourage users to follow the requests of the POWER\n", "Project Team:\n", "\n", "'When POWER data products are used in a publication, we\n", "request the following acknowledgment be included:\n", "These data were obtained from the NASA Langley Research\n", "Center POWER Project funded through the NASA Earth Science\n", "Directorate Applied Science Program.'\n", "\n", "To cite nasapower in publications, please use:") citEntry( entry = "Article", author = as.person(", textVersion = paste("Sparks, Adam (2018). nasapower: A NASA POWER Global Meteorology, Surface Solar Energy and Climatology Data Client for R. Journal of Open Source Software, 3(30), 1035,")) year <- sub("-.*", "", meta$Date) note <- sprintf("R package version %s", meta$Version) bibentry(bibtype = "Manual", title = "{nasapower}: NASA-POWER Data from R", author = c(person("Adam", "Sparks")), year = year, note = note, url = "") textVersion = paste0("Adam H Sparks, (", year, ").", " nasapower: A NASA POWER Global Meteorology, Surface Solar Energy and Climatology Data Client for R. ", note, ".", "")
1.6 README
All packages should have a README file, named
README.md, in the root of the repository. The README should include, from top to bottom:
- The package name.
- Badges for continuous integration and test coverage, the badge for rOpenSci peer-review once it has started (see below), a repostatus.org badge, and any other badges (e.g. R-universe). If the README has many more badges, you might want to consider using a table for badges, see this example, that one and that one. Such a table should be more wide than high.
- Short description of goals of package, with descriptive links to all vignettes (rendered, i.e. readable, cf the documentation website section) unless the package is small and there’s only one vignette repeating the README.
- Installation instructions using e.g. the remotes package, pak package, or R-universe.
- Any additional setup required (authentication tokens, etc).
- Brief demonstration usage.
- If applicable, how the package compares to other similar packages and/or how it relates to other packages.
- Citation information i.e. Direct users to the preferred citation in the README by adding boilerplate text “here’s how to cite my package”. See e.g. ecmwfr README.
If you use another repo status badge such as a lifecycle badge, please also add a repostatus.org badge. Example of a repo README with two repo status badges.
In all cases, for adding repostatus.org badges you can use the
rodev::use_repostatus_badge() function.
- Once you have submitted a package and it has passed editor checks, add a peer-review badge via
[](<issue_id>)
where issue_id is the number of the issue in the software-review repository. For instance, the badge for
rtimicropem review uses the number 126 since it’s the review issue number. The badge will first indicated “under review” and then “peer-reviewed” once your package has been onboarded (issue labelled “approved” and closed), and will link to the review issue.
If your README has many badges consider ordering them in an html table to make it easier for newcomers to gather information at a glance. See examples in
drakerepo and in
qualtRicsrepo. Possible sections are
- Development (CI statuses cf CI chapter, Slack channel for discussion, repostatus)
- Release/Published (CRAN version and release date badges from METACRAN, CRAN checks API badge, Zenodo badge)
- Stats/Usage (downloads e.g. download badges from METACRAN) The table should be more wide than it is long in order to mask the rest of the README..mddirectly, but from a
README.Rmdfile (an R Markdown file) if you have any demonstration code. The advantage of the
.Rmdfile is you can combine text with code that can be easily updated whenever your package is updated.
Consider using
usethis::use_readme_rmd()to get a template for a
README.Rmdfile and to automatically set up a pre-commit hook to ensure that
README.mdis always newer than
README.Rmd.
Extensive examples should be kept for a vignette. If you want to make the vignettes more accessible before installing the package, we suggest creating a website for your package.
Add a code of conduct and contribution guidelines.
See the
gistrREADME for a good example README to follow for a small package, and
bowerbirdREADME for a good example README for a larger package.
1.7 Documentation
1.7.1 General
All exported package functions should be fully documented with examples.
If there is potential overlap or confusion with other packages providing similar functionality or having a similar name, add a note in the README, main vignette and potentially the Description field of DESCRIPTION. Example in rtweet README, rebird README.
The package should contain top-level documentation for
?foobar, (or
?`foobar-package`if there is a naming conflict). Optionally, you can use both
?foobarand
?`foobar-package`for the package level manual file, using
@aliasesroxygen tag.
usethis::use_package_doc()adds the template for the top-level documentation.
The package should contain at least one HTML vignette providing a substantial coverage of package functions, illustrating realistic use cases and how functions are intended to interact. If the package is small, the vignette and the README may have very similar vignette intro or documentation should not merely read, “Provides access to GooberDB,” but also include, “…, an online repository of Goober sightings in South America. More information about GooberDB, and documentation of database structure and metadata can be found at link”. Any vignette should outline prerequisite knowledge to be able to understand the vignette upfront.
The general vignette should present a series of examples progressing in complexity from basic to advanced usage.
Functionality likely to be used by only more advanced users or developers might be better put in a separate vignette (e.g. programming/NSE with dplyr).
The README, the top-level package docs, vignettes, websites, etc., should all have enough information at the beginning to get a high-level overview of the package and the services/data it connects to, and provide navigation to other relevant pieces of documentation. This is to follow the principle of multiple points of entry i.e. to take into account the fact that any piece of documentation may be the first encounter the user has with the package and/or the tool/data it wraps.
The vignette(s) should include citations to software and papers where appropriate.
If your package provides access to a data source, we require that DESCRIPTION contains both (1) A brief identification and/or description of the organisation responsible for issuing data; and (2) The URL linking to public-facing page providing, describing, or enabling data access (which may often differ from URL leading directly to data source).
Only use package startup messages when necessary (function masking for instance). Avoid package startup messages like “This is foobar 2.4-0” or citation guidance because they can be annoying to the user. Rely on documentation for such guidance.
You can choose to have a README section about use cases of your package (other packages, blog posts, etc.), example.
1.7.2 roxygen2 use
We request all submissions to use
roxygen2for documentation.
roxygen2is an R package that automatically compiles
.Rdfiles to your
manfolder in your package from simple tags written above each function.
More information on using roxygen2 documentation is available in the R packages book.
If you were writing Rd by hand, the Rd2roxygen package contains functions to convert Rd to roxygen documentation.
One key advantage of using
roxygen2is that your
NAMESPACEwill always be automatically generated and up to date.
All functions should document the type of object returned under the
@returnheading.
We recommend using the
@familytag in the documentation of functions to allow their grouping in the documentation of the installed package and potentially in the package’s website, see the “manual” section of The R Packages book and the “function grouping” section of the present chapter for more details.
You could re-use documentation pieces (e.g. details about authentication, related packages) across the vignettes/README/man pages. A possible approach for that is the use of R Markdown fragments, relying on knitr use of child documents so you can store the re-used parts in a folder in man/, and call them from both the README and the vignette as well as in man pages by using the
@includeRmdtag available from
roxygen 0.7.0.
Add
#' @noRdto internal functions.
If you prefer not to clutter up code with extensive documentation, you can place further examples outside of the R script and use the
@exampletag; and you place further documentation in files in a
man-roxygenfolder in the root of your package, and those will be combined into the manual file by the use of
@template <file name>, for example.
- Put any documentation for an object in a
.Rfile in the
man-roxygenfolder (at the root of your package). For example, this file. Link to that template file from your function (e.g.) with the
@templatekeyword (e.g.). The contents of the template will be inserted when documentation is built into the resulting
.Rdfile that users will see when they ask for documentation for the function.
- Note that if you are using markdown documentation, markdown currently doesn’t work in template files, so make sure to use latex formatting.
- In most cases you can ignore templates and
man-roxygen, but there are two cases in which leveraging them will greatly help:
- When you have a lot of documentation for a function/class/object separating out certain chunks of that documentation can keep your
.Rsource file tidy. This is especially useful when you have a lot of code in that
.Rfile. On the other hand, it means the docs are not readable “in-source” since they’re in another file.
- When you have the same documentation parts used across many
.Rfunctions it’s helpful to use a template. This reduces duplicated text, and helps prevent mistakenly updating documentation for one function but not the other. Using a template file for a parameter documentation is an alternative to defining the parameter for one function and using
@inheritParamsfor other functions using the same parameter.
Starting from
roxygen2version 7.0.0,
R6classes are officially supported. See the roxygen2 docs for details on how to document
R6classes.
1.7.3 URLs in documentation
This subsection is particularly relevant to authors wishing to submit their package to CRAN.
CRAN will check URLs in your documentation and does not allow redirect status codes such as 301.
You can use the urlchecker package to reproduce these checks and, in particular, replace URLs with the URLs they redirect to.
Others have used the option to escape some URLs (change
<> to, or
\url{} to.), but if you do so, you will need to implement some sort of URL checking yourself to prevent them from getting broken without your noticing. Furthermore, links would not be clickable from local docs.
1.8 Documentation website
We recommend creating a documentation website for your package using
pkgdown. Neal Richardson wrote a good tutorial to get started with
pkgdown, and unsurprisingly
pkgdown has its own documentation website.
There are a few elements we’d like to underline here.
1.8.1 Automatic deployment of the documentation website
You only need to worry about automatic deployment of your website until approval and transfer of your package repo to the ropensci organization; indeed, after that a pkgdown website will be built for your package after each push to the GitHub repo. You can find the status of these builds at, e.g. for
magick; and the website at, e.g. for
magick. The website build will use your pkgdown config file if you have one, except for the styling that will use the
rotemplate package. The resulting website will have search enabled by Algolia. Please report bugs, questions and feature requests about the central builds at and about the template at.
If your package vignettes need credentials (API keys, tokens, etc.) to knit, you might want to precompute them since credentials cannot be used on the docs server.
Before submission and before transfer, you could use the approach documented by
pkgdown or the
tic package for automatic deployment of the package’s website. This would save you the hassle of running (and remembering to run)
pkgdown::build_site() yourself every time the site needs to be updated. First refer to our chapter on continuous integration if you’re not familiar with continuous integration. In any case, do not forget to update all occurrences of the website URL after transfer to the ropensci organization.
1.8.2 Grouping functions in the reference
When your package has many functions, use grouping in the reference, which you can do more or less automatically.
If you use
roxygen2 above version 6.1.1, you should use the
@family tag in your functions documentation to indicate grouping. This will give you links between functions in the local documentation of the installed package (“See also” section) and allow you to use the
pkgdown
has_concept function in the config file of your website. Non-rOpenSci example courtesy of
optiRum: family tag,
pkgdown config file and resulting reference section.
Less automatically, see the example of
drake website and associated config file.
1.8.5 Mathjax
Once your package is transferred and it gets a website using our
pkgdown template, if you want to use Mathjax you’ll need to specify it in the
pkgdown config file like so:
1.8.6 Package logo
To use your package logo in the pkgdown homepage, refer to
usethis::use_logo().
If your package doesn’t have any logo, the rOpenSci docs builder will use rOpenSci logo instead.
1.10 Licence
The package needs to have a CRAN or OSI accepted license. For more explanations around licensing, refer to the R packages book.
1.11 Testing
All packages should pass
R CMD check/
devtools::check()on all major platforms.
testthatfor writing tests. Strive to write tests as you write each new function. This serves the obvious need to have proper testing for the package, but allows you to think about various ways in which a function can fail, and to defensively code against those. More information.
Packages with Shiny apps should use a unit-testing framework such as
shinytestto test that interactive interfaces behave as expected.
For testing your functions creating plots, we suggest using
vdiffr, an extension of the
testthatpackage; or testthat snapshot tests.
If your package interact with web resources (web APIs and other sources of data on the web) you might find the HTTP testing in R book by Scott Chamberlain and Maëlle Salmon relevant.
Once you’ve set up CI, use your package’s code coverage report (cf this section of our book) to identify untested lines, and to add further tests.
testthathas a function
skip_on_cran()that you can use to not run tests on CRAN. We recommend using this on all functions that are API calls since they are quite likely to fail on CRAN. These tests should still run on continuous integration.
Even if you MangoTheCat’s goodpractice package to check your package for likely sources of errors, and run
spelling::spell_check_package()to find spelling errors in documentation.
1.12 Examples
Include extensive examples in the documentation. In addition to demonstrating how to use the package, these can act as an easy way to test package functionality before there are proper tests. However, keep in mind we require tests in contributed packages.
You can run examples with
devtools::run_examples(). Note that when you run R CMD CHECK or equivalent (e.g.,
devtools::check()) your examples that are not wrapped in
\dontrun{}or
\donttest{}are run. Refer to the summary table in roxygen2 docs.
To safe-guard examples (e.g. requiring authentication) to be run on CRAN you need to use
\dontrun{}. However, for a first submission CRAN won’t let you have all examples escaped so. In this case you might add some small toy examples, or wrap example code in
try(). Also refer to the
@exampleIftag present, at the time of writing, in roxygen2 development version.
In addition to running examples locally on your own computer, we strongly advise that you run examples on one of the continuous integration systems. Again, examples that are not wrapped in
\dontrun{}or
\donttest{}will be run, but for those that are you can configure your continuous integration builds to run them via R CMD check arguments
--run-dontrunand/or
--run-donttest.
1.13 Package dependencies
Use
Importsinstead of
Dependsfor packages providing functions from other packages. Make sure to list packages used for testing (
testthat), and documentation (
knitr,
roxygen2) in your
Suggestssection of package dependencies (if you use
usethisfor adding testing infrastructure via
usethis::use_testthat()or a vignette via usethis::use_vignette(), the necessary packages will be added to
DESCRIPTION). If you use any package in the examples or tests of your package, make sure to list it in
Suggests, if not already listed in
Imports.
If your (not Bioconductor) package depends on Bioconductor packages, make sure the installation instructions in the README and vignette are clear enough even for an user who is not familiar with the Bioconductor release cycle.
Should the user use
BiocManager(recommended)? Document this.
Is the automatic installation of Bioconductor packages by
install.packages()enough? In that case, mention that the user needs to run
setRepositories()if they haven’t set the necessary Bioconductor repositories yet.
If your package depends on Bioconductor after a certain version, mention it in DESCRIPTION and in the installation instructions.
Specifying minimum dependencies (e.g.
glue (>= 1.3.0)instead of just
glue) should be a conscious choice. If you know for a fact that your package will break below a certain dependency version, specify it explicitly. But if you don’t, then no need to specify a minimum dependency. In that case when a user reports a bug which is explicitly related to an older version of a dependency then address it then. An example of bad practice would be for a developer to consider the versions of their current state of dependencies to be the minimal version. That would needlessly force everyone to upgrade (causing issues with other packages) when there is no good reason behind that version choice.
For most cases where you must expose functions from dependencies to the user, you should import and re-export those individual functions rather than listing them in the
Dependsfields. For instance, if functions in your package produce
rasterobjects, you might re-export only printing and plotting functions from the raster package.
If your package uses a system dependency, you should
Indicate it in DESCRIPTION;
Check that it is listed by
sysreqsdbto allow automatic tools to install it, and submit a contribution if not;
Check for it in a
configurescript (example) and give a helpful error message if it cannot be found (example).
configurescripts can be challenging as they often require hacky solutions to make diverse system dependencies work across systems. Use examples (more here) as a starting point but note that it is common to encounter bugs and edge cases and often violate CRAN policies. Do not hesitate to ask for help on our forum.
Consider the trade-offs involved in relying on a package as a dependency. On one hand, using dependencies reduces coding effort, and can build on useful functionality developed by others, especially if the dependency performs complex tasks, is high-performance, and/or is well vetted and tested. On the other hand, having many dependencies places a burden on the maintainer to keep up with changes in those packages, at risk to your package’s long-term sustainability. It also increases installation time and size, primarily a consideration on your and others’ development cycle, and in automated build systems. “Heavy” packages - those with many dependencies themselves, and those with large amounts of compiled code - increase this cost. Here are some approaches to reducing dependencies:
Small, simple functions from a dependency package may be better copied into your own package if the dependency if you are using only a few functions in an otherwise large or heavy dependency. On the other hand, complex functions with many edge cases (e.g. parsers) require considerable testing and vetting.
An common example of this is in returning tidyverse-style “tibbles” from package functions that provide data. One can avoid the modestly heavy tibble package dependency by returning a tibble created by modifying a data frame like so:
class(df) <- c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame")
(Note that this approach is not universally endorsed.)
Ensure that you are using the package where the function is defined, rather than one where it is re-exported. For instance many functions in devtools can be found in smaller specialty packages such as sessioninfo. The
%>%function should be imported from magrittr, where it is defined, rather than the heavier dplyr, which re-exports it.
Some dependencies are preferred because they provide easier to interpret function names and syntax than base R solutions. If this is the primary reason for using a function in a heavy dependency, consider wrapping the base R approach in a nicely-named internal function in your package. See e.g. the rlang R script providing functions with a syntax similar to purrr functions.
If dependencies have overlapping functionality, see if you can rely on only one.
More dependency-management tips can be found in this post by Scott Chamberlain.
1.14 Recommended scaffolding
For HTTP requests we recommend using curl, crul, or httr over RCurl. If you like low level clients for HTTP, curl is best, whereas crul or httr are better for higher level access. crul is maintained by rOpenSci. We recommend the rOpenSci maintained packages webmockr for mocking HTTP requests, and vcr for caching HTTP requests in package tests.
For parsing JSON, use jsonlite instead of rjson or RJSONIO.
For parsing, creating, and manipulating XML, we strongly recommend xml2 for most cases. You can refer to Daniel Nüst’s notes about migration from XML to xml2.
1.15 Version Control
Your package source files have to be under version control, more specifically tracked with Git. You might find the gert package relevant, as well as some of usethis Git/GitHub related functionality; you can however use git as you want.
Make sure to list “scrap” such as
.DS_Storefiles in .gitignore. You might find the gitignore package relevant.
A later section of this book contains some git workflow tips.
1.16 Miscellaneous CRAN gotchas
This is a collection of CRAN gotchas that are worth avoiding at the outset.
- Make sure your package title is in Title Case.
- Do not put a period on the end of your title.
- Do not put ‘in R’ or ‘with R’ in your title as this is obvious from packages hosted on CRAN. If you would like this information to be displayed on your website nonetheless, check the
pkgdowndocumentation to learn how to override this.
- Avoid starting the description with the package name or “This package …”.
- Make sure you include links to websites if you wrap a web API, scrape data from a site, etc. in the
Descriptionfield of your
DESCRIPTIONfile. URLs should be enclosed in angle brackets, e.g.
<>.
- In both the
Titleand
Descriptionfields, the names of packages or other external software must be quoted using single quotes (e.g., ‘Rcpp’ Integration for the ‘Armadillo’ Templated Linear Algebra Library).
- Avoid long running tests and examples. Consider
testthat::skip_on_cranin tests to skip things that take a long time but still test them locally and on continuous integration.
- Include top-level files such as
paper.md, continuous integration configuration files, in your
.Rbuildignorefile.
1.16.1 CRAN checks
Once your package is on CRAN, it will be regularly checked on different platforms. Failures of such checks, when not false positives, can lead to the CRAN team’s reaching out. You can monitor the state of the CRAN checks via
the
foghornpackage.
the CRAN checks API maintained by rOpenSci, that provides badges. You can add one of them to the README of your package via
rodev::use_cchecks_badge().
1.17 Bioconductor gotchas
If you intend your package to be submitted to, or if your package is on, Bioconductor, refer to Bioconductor packaging guidelines.
1.18 Further guidance
If you are submitting a package to rOpenSci via the software-review repo, you can direct further questions to the rOpenSci team in the issue tracker, or in our discussion forum.
Before submitting a package use the goodpractice package (
goodpractice::gp()) as a guide to improve your package, since most exceptions to it will need to be justified. E.g. the use of
foomight be generally bad and therefore flagged by
goodpracticebut you had a good reason to use it in your package.

A lumbar epidural steroid injection is administered to help relieve low back pain with or without leg pain (lumbar radiculopathy). Similarly, a cervical epidural steroid injection is performed to decrease neck pain and cervical radiculopathy. Dr. Jose Colon, MD may perform an epidural spinal injection for one or two reasons:
- Reduce nerve inflammation, calm symptoms, aid healing
- Obtain important diagnostic information*
*Pain relief may prove a particular nerve root is causing or contributing to pain and symptoms.
The entire procedure often takes about 15 minutes. However, if you have more than one spinal level treated, your procedure may take longer.
Medications injected
The procedure involves injecting a local anesthetic and corticosteroid into the epidural space. As the medications are injected, they coat nerve roots. The local anesthetic provides immediate short-term pain relief. Corticosteroids take time to be effective, but may provide long-term pain relief.
- A corticosteroid is a powerful, slow-releasing man-made anti-inflammatory drug.
- The epidural space is a protective tissue around the spinal cord. It contains blood vessels and fat tissue.
About the procedure
An epidural injection is administered in a sterile setting. After you change into a gown and lie down, medications are given intravenously to relax you. In the procedure suite, you are positioned face down on the table. A cushion is placed beneath your abdomen to flex your spine. The skin area is cleansed using sterile soap. A local anesthetic is injected to numb your skin and spine muscles. Our doctors keep you comfortable during the entire procedure.
The procedure is performed using fluoroscopy (real-time x-ray) to guide the needle into position. A contrast dye is injected to confirm needle placement. Then the anesthetic and corticosteroid is injected into the epidural space. Pain may temporarily increase during the injection. After the injection, a small bandage covers injection site.
After the procedure
You are moved into a recovery area where your vital signs are closely monitored until Dr. Colon and his medical team deems you are ready to go home.
Before you are released to go home, our medical team gives you written home-care instructions. It is common to feel some discomfort two or three days after a lumbar (or cervical) epidural steroid injection. Post-procedural discomfort does not always mean the corticosteroid is not taking effect. If you have any concerns or questions, please contact us. We are here to help you.
Day after
A medical staff member telephones you the morning after your spinal injection to follow up. We urge you to keep a pain journal to record your discomfort or pain and symptoms. Your notes help Dr. Colon measure your response to the spinal injection.JavaScript seems to be disabled in your browser.

Using a terminal fragment probe, monoclonal proliferation of EBV in infected cells was demonstrated in three of the four EBV-positive EATL cases (in one case, insufficient signal prevented the determination of EBV clonality). The EBV genome and an early transcript, EBER1, were identified in tumour cells by in situ hybridization. Expression of latent membrane protein (LMP) was detected in two EBV DNA/RNA-positive EATL cases. In view of the known oncogenic properties of EBV and the putative central role of LMP in EBV-induced cell immortalization, the results of this study suggest that the virus may play an aetiological role in the pathogenesis of EATL.WRA CHARITABLE TRUST

Michael Eddy F Belloy
Postdoctoral Scholar, Neurology and Neurological Sciences
BioMy broad scientific goal is to investigate neurological disorders with the aim of identifying novel mechanisms that improve understanding of disease pathophysiology and that could lead to novel drug development. I pursue this goal by investigating the genetic risk factors of the respective disease under question, studying how they contribute to disruptions of brain function measured by in vivo imaging techniques, and how they correlate with the presentation of disease-sensitive biomarkers. Within this broader scope, my primary interest is to focus specifically on Alzheimer's disease, elucidating the genetic, molecular, and clinical spectrum of the disease, and hopefully, eventually, contributing to the path towards a cure.
I am a highly interdisciplinary scientist with experience in programming (using various scripting languages), advanced data analyses methods, neuroimaging, and studies of preclinical mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease. I also have a long-standing interest in brain function and network dynamics in both health and disease. More recently, I have further gained experience into the clinical aspects, imaging approaches, and genetics of Alzheimer’s disease. Altogether, this translates into my current research strategy in which I investigate large-scale multimodal datasets that contain information on genetics, clinical outcome measures, structural and functional brain properties, and other biomarker data.
I am currently a third-year post-doc at Stanford university, under the lead of Dr. Michael D Greicius. My main aims in this lab are to identify genetic factors that may be causative to Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, I aim to uncover genetic risk factors that interact with the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene to alter risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Further, I seek to identify how these genetic interactions with APOE differ by sex, age, and ethnicity. I believe this will allow the identification of novel genes relevant to Alzheimer's disease and contribute to advancing personalized genetic medicine.
During my PhD, supervised by Dr. Marleen Verhoye, Dr. Shella Keilholz and Dr. Georgios A Keliris, I worked on developing dynamic resting state functional (rsf)MRI in mice, which lead to the first observation of mouse Quasi-Periodic patterns, and related applications for Alzheimer's disease research in rodents. I still have an ongoing interest in dynamic rsfMRI research.
-At the moment, the FOX token value comes mostly from its LP programs and DeFi endeavors. I am a strong believer in the utility value of a token. ETH 2.0 will eventually come, although the process has been painful and lengthy to watch. But sooner or later, the FOX gas cashback will no longer be necessary, and users will have no real incentive to use the ShapeShift platform unless there are new very enticing value-adds for the token. (Although I hear that some awesome things are going to be open-sourced soon, so definitely excited to see that!)
I’m also a huge believer in diversification. At the moment all the talk seems to be around financial diversification. This whole time I’ve been thinking, why isn’t anyone talking about value-adding diversification?
Ultimately, value provided by the token always outshadows value provided by staking or depending on third party DeFi programs.
Outside of my main job and my participation in the DAO, I’m currently in several other projects, which I truthfully wanted to leverage the DAO for the benefits it could bring me, and of course ultimately help grow the DAO’s treasury as well as increase token demand.
As I am preparing to launch a NFT mint/marketplace specifically targeted towards subreddits and communities that may not be very well versed in crypto to make it easy for them to get in the NFT craze, I thought to myself, how can this benefit FOX? How can FOX help this project? Because it shouldn’t be a one-way relationship, right? I mean, maybe discounted prices for FOX holders? Staked FOX needed for free minting? There’s a million ways I guess, but it’s a one-way relationship.
Same goes with my endeavors with game3.js – As we are converting old HTML5 games into tokenized, revamped games with NFTs, in-store purchases, etc., I kept thinking about ways to integrate FOX and leverage the community of the DAO. And yet again, I am at a brick wall. Why use FOX when we can create our own token and use Polygon or xDai which are much more suited for these types of things at the moment?
After a couple years in AI and dataset training, I saw the huge growing demand for residential and mobile proxies. While we’re still working out the kinks, we have a PoC (without blockchain, but the feasability) successfully run where people can rent proxies P2P instead of paying one of the 5 corporations that are controlling the enterprise proxy market. This system requires masternodes and resource providers, so that takes FOX out of the equation.
I’ve been waiting for a discussion on getting FOX on xDai (with liquidity) and Polygon, then maybe it would make more sense. But it seems everyone is too knee-deep and crazed over the DeFi world that they fail to realize that the utility function of a token is one of the main drivers of price, not the LP programs.
I truly believe in the vision, I will continue to contribute, and I will forever cheer for FOX. But if we want to really drive up demand for the token, we need new utilities, fast. Admittedly this DeFi revolution came as a sort of “whoah” moment for me as I missed out on its growth, so I may be biased. But relying the future of ShapeShift on the success and continuation of the DeFi world is, in my humble opinion, dangerous and foolish. Just like forking a coin and changing one line and rebranding it as something new, just like investing tens of thousands of dollars on now useless masternodes, just like relying on ICOs and then IEOs to 100x your wealth, sooner or later, the cryptosphere will evolve and change. I’m not saying DeFi will be gone or unprofitable, but there the landscape will look different in another 3 years.
And this ShapeShift Foundation that is to be formed soon – we have almost no idea what it is, how powerful it will be, and who the 12 members will be and and their roles/duties. Will ShapeShift be a “true DAO” with this foundation? We don’t know yet, cause we don’t know what it is.
So, how do we create an ecosystem where developers or projects can truly build on top of FOX? Does it even make sense? Would FOX support proposals that are not built with FOX embedded into its design somehow? If so, what would be the best way to mutually benefit? These are all sincere questions I am asking. Both for selfish reasons, as well as for reasons that concern me about FOX’s current value proposition.

Share this:The Guardian is about to make major cuts to its U.S. operation, reducing staff by 30%, leaders there announced in a meeting Thursday.
Roughly 50 jobs will disappear out of about 150 across editorial, commercial, and administration, according to a source inside the meeting. The cuts, which were first reported by Politico, will be accomplished through a combination of buyouts and layoffs.
The announcement led to a tense Q&A session with staff and management, as employees pressed management on how quickly the organization had gone from expansion to contraction.
"Lots of unhappy faces," the source inside the meeting told CNN in an email. "Lots of people concerned at being in the job market in December/January."
The Guardian had until recently been aggressively expanding its operations across the globe in search of a worldwide audience to compensate for the worsening fortunes of U.K. newspapers. The U.S. branch, which was launched in 2011 -- its fifth anniversary was on Wednesday, one day before the announcement -- had arguably been the crown jewel of that expansion. In 2014 it won a Pulitzer for its work breaking Edward Snowden's leaks about NSA surveillance.
That success, and the audience growth that came with it, never brought the revenue that executives had hoped for, however, and the paper as a whole has been tightening its belt as a result. Its U.K. base was hit with significant cuts earlier this year, but until now the U.S. had been spared those kinds of austerity measures.

In a statement, The Guardian said that it remained "committed to Guardian US and to building on the remarkable success of our journalism" but that in order to break even these cuts were required.
"We said in January that we want Guardian Media Group to break even at an operating level within the next three years and that no part of the business can be immune from tough action to secure the Guardian in perpetuity," a Guardian News & Media spokesperson said in a statement.
In an email to the paper's worldwide staff obtained by CNN, David Pemsel, CEO of Guardian Media Group, and Kath Viner, the Guardian's editor in chief, noted that their website has seen strong U.S. audience growth in the first quarter of this year and that it was "now among the top five digital newspaper platforms in America."
However, they added that digital advertising revenues are being eaten up by companies like Facebook.
"US news publishers are facing conditions as challenging as those of the UK," Pemsel and Viner wrote. "[C]ompanies such as Facebook and Google are growing in dominance -- by some estimates, 85c in every new dollar of digital advertising revenues is going straight to them. It is inevitable that such seismic shifts in the business model are adversely impacting our revenues despite the Guardian's strong US brand recognition."
Pemsel and Viner confirmed in their email that the Guardian's U.S. staff will be reduced "to approximately 100 people" and wrote, "The impact will be spread across all departments and the priority is to protect Guardian journalism. We will maintain streamlined newsrooms in New York, Washington DC and San Francisco... Other savings will come from freezing recruitment and reducing spend in areas such as marketing, consultancy, travel and general expenses."
The union that represents journalists at Guardian U.S. responded to news of cuts by saying in a statement it was "deeply disappointed to learn of the company's decision, considering the optimistic financial projections made to us within the last year."
"However, management has committed to working with the union to decide how cuts will be made," the statement said. "We are committed to fighting for fair and equitable treatment for the entire Guardian US editorial staff for as long as it takes."You’ll love this mein dish.

From Philippe Fondanaiche, Paris, France I have lost the recollection of the basical theorems of geometry.I have found a solution of your problem, I admit, not very elegant: 1) RS is a diameter of the circle Let OM=d and OR=r The law of sines in the triangle MPR gives: sin(MPR)/MR = sin(PMR)/PR therefore sin(MPR)/(d+r) = sin(MPR+MRP)/(2rcos(MRP)) hence (r+d) tg(MRP) = (r-d) tg(MPR) as MPR = MSY then MX =MY 2) any R on the circle Let AMB the x-axis and MO the y-axis Let OR = r = 1(to simplify) Let OM = d <1 Equations of line PQ y=ax a>0 of line RS y=bx b<0 of circle O x^2 + (y-d)^2 = 1 Let A = sqroot(1-d^2+a^2) and B=sqroot(1-d^2+b^2) The coordinates of the vertices P,Q,R,S are the following: P x_p = (da+A)/(1+a^2) y_p = ax_p Q x_q = (da-A)/(1+a^2) y_q = ax_q R x_r = (db-B)/(1+b^2) y_r = bx_r S x_s = (db+B)/(1+b^2) y_s = bx_s MX= - MY is equivalent to x_p.x_s/(y_p - y_s) = - x_q.x_r/(y_q - y_r) So we hane to demonstrate the following relation (R): a.x_p.x_q.(x_r+x_s) = b.x_r.x_s.(x_p+x_q) Whereas x_p.x_q = (1-d^2)/(1+a^2) x_p + x_q = 2da/(1+a^2) and x_r.x_s = (1-d^2)/(1+ b^2) x_r + x_s = 2db/(1+b^2) the relation (R) is easily proved.Technical support for the food and drink industry

The candy cane moonshine recipe is surprisingly easy to make and tastes delicious. This is a great drink for winter parties, Christmas celebrations, or even New Year's Eve! The best part about the candy cane moonshine recipe? It is a simple recipe that packs quite a punch!
If you want to make your own candy cane moonshine, the first thing that you need is candy. You don't just have any old type of candy either; it's got to be candy canes! Of course, you also need moonshine. Whether you want to flavor a traditional corn moonshine or a simple sugar shine, the results will be delicious and potent.
Speaking of potency, it is a good idea to prepare your guests before serving.
Those who are not used to high ABV liquor should definitely take it easy. No matter what your experience, moonshine is a drink to be sipped. Otherwise, its effects can sneak up on you fast. Not a great look for anyone or a fun problem when you are trying to host a holiday celebration.
In addition to preparing your guests for the potency of your candy cane moonshine, you need to decide how you want to serve it. Peppermint candy canes are a great holiday flavor on their own, but also a great compliment in many of your favorite cocktails.
A good rule of thumb is to use peppermint candy cane moonshine in place of peppermint schnapps or Creme de Minthe in any cocktail recipe.
With this in mind, peppermint candy cane moonshine is a great addition to warm up your holiday hot chocolate or go one step further and mix it with our sinful dark chocolate moonshine for a delicious chocolate mint cocktail. Of course, crushed candy canes on the rim of your glass will add a beautiful and festive touch.
How to Make Simple Syrup
Simple syrup is a staple in flavored moonshine recipes. While you may not be familiar with simple syrup, the name really gives it away-it couldn't be any easier.
Making a simple syrup is as easy as combining equal parts sugar and boiling water until the mixture dissolves into a syrup.
One of the nice things about simple syrup is that you can customize your syrup to your tastes. If you want a less sweet syrup, try changing your ratios to one-third sugar and two-thirds water. If you want a richer syrup, use one-third water and two-thirds syrup.
Is Peppermint Extract Necessary?
While not as important of an ingredient as the candy canes or white whiskey, adding peppermint extract will really bump up the flavor of your moonshine. It is an inexpensive addition and packs a delicious punch.
Is Candy Cane Moonshine the Perfect Gift?
Candy cane moonshine is the perfect holiday gift because it tastes delicious and packs a punch.
It's like candy canes but in adult beverage form! You don't need to be an experienced bartender or have access to specialized equipment for this recipe either. If you want to make candy cane moonshine for yourself or others as gifts, all you really need are candy canes and some good-quality white whiskey.
Whether you're looking for something new that your friends will love when they come over during winter break or just trying to think up great Christmas presents, candy cane moonshine fits the bill perfectly.

So far as I know, this is the only record of such an event taking place on 2 November. As a Thursday, that was indeed a market day when people from rural towns brought their goods into Boston to sell.
Unlike other tar-and-feathers attacks, such as the assault on sailor George Gailer on 28 October, there’s no mention of this mobbing in contemporary letters or diaries. None of the people involved appears to have filed a lawsuit (though it’s possible we still need to take a thorough look at Middlesex County records). I haven’t found a mention in other Boston newspapers published later that week.
This attack would be unusual in another way: All the other examples of tarring and feathering around this time involved punishing people who worked for or helped the Customs service, or broke the non-importation boycott which that agency opposed.
In contrast, this episode involved punishing a man for putting a young woman in sexual danger from soldiers. That was another way of violating community values, but on a much more local scale.
Does that suggest rural towns were inflicting similar tar-and-feather chastisements regularly? Or might Charlestown have used those materials only because the attacks on Cape Ann and in Boston a few days before had indeed made that “the present popular Punishment”?
Contrariwise, did the Boston Whig press make up this incident, or insert details like the out-of-town tar and feathers, in order to distract public attention from the well documented attack on Gailer? Lt. Gov. Thomas Hutchinson was issuing proclamations and promises of rewards for finding the culprits in that riot. The Whigs might have seen benefits in confusing newspaper readers with a similar incident, or spreading the idea that the victim the acting governor was talking about had actually harmed a young woman.Male Voice Over Artist English Speaking Scott Topper

The emergence of media: Humanity's endgame – a précis (Part Three)
By Mark Wegierski
web posted February 25, 2013
The author continues with his analysis in point-form, in tune with current media practices.
How Media Distorts Fundamental Human Ways Of Experiencing, Knowing, And Understanding The Lifeworld
- living in a world of fictive personas and clichés
- the trend to trends - "meta-trends"
- the fiction of the personas is greater than the fiction they participate in - it would be like knowing about Pope Leo XIII without knowing anything of the history of the Roman Catholic Church
- from archetype to cliché
- the cliché-ridden society
Technosphere/Americanosphere
- "virtual reality" - Jean Baudrillard - Der Spiegel (no. 6, 1991) interview
- 500-channel universe, cf. Bruce Springsteen song, "57 Channels and Nothing On"
- high definition TV (HDTV) - eventually, the Blu-ray format won out – now moving on to 3D TV; "virtual sound"
- the Internet and "Internet Two"
- are there types of technological advance that are said to presage the breakup of the media monopoly (as discussed in George Gilder's book Telecosm)? - will small publishing become increasingly possible in the near-future, as technology makes costs of producing books cheaper? - but what about distribution?? - how will authors draw attention to their work in an ocean of information??
The Mass-Media Model Triumphs In More Traditional Media:
Mass Media And The End Of Literary-Humanistic Culture
- another treason of the clerks? – i.e., writers about the media who love the media too much (e.g., Teleliteracy, by David Bianculli; Metapop, by Michael Dunne; Media Virus, by Douglas Rushkoff; Macrocosm and Telecosm, by George Gilder)
- literary critic Northrop Frye and the theory of cycles of literature and social decline
- stigma of not having a television - if you don't watch, you're a social outcast - some case-studies of people without TV (as adults or preferably as children) - one person I know of watched about 6 hours of TV in his first eighteen years of life in North America - nice guy, however he also did his BA in Film at the University of Toronto (became a cinéaste?); in the 1990s, knew about successful Toronto businesswoman in her thirties (1.5 million p.a. gross revenue) who didn't have cable, not because she couldn't afford it, but because she felt all her time would be eaten up by it
- mass-marketing of books - e.g., movie rights sold before book has been written
- megastar authors (e.g., Stephen King, Danielle Steele) - better books lost out in the wash - Allan Bloom once said that his Closing of the American Mind was knocked out of bestseller status by The Cat Who Came Home for Christmas
- celebrity authors - usually ghostwritten - 'as told to'
- primary facet of a book is titillation - same as media - sex, violence (horror), and flash (e.g., technothrillers) - technothrillers often constitute justification for American imperial adventurism
- combination of literature/mass media, e.g. "culture" shows on CBC/TVO/CBC Radio
Has Media Swallowed Media-Criticism?
- Critique of Media/Pop-culture as Part of Media/Pop-Culture - e.g., Noam Chomsky - is he an author, or the guy the film was about? - especially, McLuhan - Goldie Hawn on Laugh-In asking - "whatcha doin', Mr. McLuhan?" - his appearance in a Woody Allen movie
To be continued.

ESRThe Republican Party's attempt to craft an Affordable Care Act replacement bill is running into more and more problems, especially after more and more is known about the bill and its effects.
Here's the latest in what we know about the GOP's Trumpcare plan.
Republicans don't think the Congressional Budget Office is going to be too kind to their bill
Although the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office has not yet issued its findings regarding the cost and effectiveness of the repeal plan, Republicans are already anticipating negative results and attempting to discredit the CBO in advance, according to Politico. Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi said he has "never been one who worried too much about scores because there are constraints that the bean counters have to operate under that don’t necessarily contort with reality."
Similarly, House Ways and Means Chairman Rep. Kevin Brady, R- Texas, said that "it’s not unusual to not have a CBO score at this point and when we get it, it will reflect only this first step. We have multiple steps going forward to complete the plan which will also lower the score and increase the coverage amounts. When we get the CBO plan, just understand that is just a small piece of the overall replacement plan."
Rep. David Brat of Virginia, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, claimed that "CBO has scored everything wrong forever so they’re a minor concern."
The health care bill could inadvertently weaken our defenses against bioterrorism — or abet an epidemic
The Prevention and Public Health Fund, which provides 12 percent of the budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, would be on the chopping block under the Republican repeal plan, according to NBC News.
In addition to providing basic services like delivering vaccines and monitoring infectious diseases, the fund also works to "help ensure that our nation is prepared against emerging threats such as bioterrorism and Ebola and other infectious diseases," explained Baltimore health commissioner Dr. Leana Wen to NBC News. The money ($931 million for 2017) is also used to help prevent major causes of death in America today, such as hypertension, cancer, and diabetes.
President Donald Trump is warning his House Republicans that there will be a "bloodbath" if they don't pass the replacement bill
Trump made it clear to Republicans in the House of Representatives that, if they fail to replace the Affordable Care Act with their newly minted Affordable Health Care Act, there will be a "bloodbath" against the GOP in the 2018 midterm elections, according to CNN. Trump also told them that he planned on supporting the House-proposed plan "100 percent" and vowed to pressure skeptical members of the Republican Party into toeing the line. He reiterated his support for their bill later on Tuesday to an assembled press pool, saying "I'm proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives and encouraged by members of both parties."
SharesIf anyone can give fans friendship advice, it’s BTS‘s social butterfly, V.
V is one of those instantly loveable people who attracts friends like a magnet, but he has experienced his fair share of hardship too.
A “friend” once invited everybody but V to his birthday party. When V finally found the party’s location, he gave this “friend” his gift then ran out crying, saying it was time for him to go home. V has since received an apology, and has forgiven this person, but he was very hurt at the time.
It turns out, a fan is having similar problems these days. On April 20, they reached out to V on Weverse, asking him for advice.
Oppa, I’m exhausted because of human relationships right now… These “friends” don’t like me, but I don’t want to hurt them. I want to express how I’m feeling, but it’s so hard to do ㅠㅠㅠㅠ What should I do?
— Fan
Instead of using words, V showed the fan how to express their feelings through emojis. The meaning is up for interpretation, but V seems to be advising the fan to let it all out, then move on. It’s not good to bottle these things up!
This isn’t the first time V has talked (emojied?) ARMY through a hard time. Find out how he comforted another fan here:

Words related to horn
horny (adj.)
late 14c., "made of horn," from horn (n.) + -y (2). From 1690s as "callous, resembling horn." The colloquial meaning "lustful, sexually aroused," was in use certainly by 1889, perhaps as early as 1863; it probably derives from the late 18c. slang expression to have the horn, suggestive of male sexual excitement (but eventually applied to women as well); see horn (n.). As a noun it once also was a popular name for a domestic cow. For an adjective in the original sense of the word, hornish (1630s) and horn-like (1570s) are available.

inkhorn (n.)
late 14c., "small portable vessel (originally made of horn) for holding ink," from ink (n.) + horn (n.). Used attributively from 1540s ("Soche are your Ynkehorne termes," John Bale) as an adjective for things (especially vocabulary) supposed to be beloved by scribblers, pedants, and bookworms. An Old English word for the thing was blæchorn.
krummhorn (n.)
also crummhorn, "A medieval musical instrument of the clarinet class, having a curved tube and a melancholy sound" [Century Dictionary], 1864, from German, literally "crooked horn," from krumm "curved, crooked" (8c.), from a West Germanic *krumba- (compare Old English crumb, crump "crooked, bent, stooped," source of crumple); for second element see horn (n.).
longhorn (adj.)
Matterhorn
Alpine mountain, from German Matte "meadow, pastureland" (see mead (n.2)) + Horn (see horn (n.)). So called for its horn-like shape (cut by glaciers in the Ice Ages). The slopes are steep and treacherous; the Matte is for the meadows at its base. The Roman name was Mons Silvius, which might be based on a personal name.
powder-horn (n.)
reciprocornous (adj.)
"having horns turning backward and then forward," as a ram, 1775, with -ous + Latin reciprocornis, from reciprocus "turning back the same way" (see reciprocal) + cornu "horn" (see horn (n.)). "This form is characteristic of the sheep tribe, though not peculiar to it" [Century Dictionary].
scorn (n.)
c. 1200, a shortening of Old French escarn "mockery, derision, contempt," a common Romanic word (Spanish escarnio, Italian scherno) of Germanic origin, from Proto-Germanic *skarnjan "mock, deride" (source also of.)).

Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox partisans will gleefully point out that while Scripture may be infallible, its canon is not. In other words, an infallible Scripture has a fallible canon. The purpose of this essay is to demonstrate that this is not a problem for traditional Protestant theology (let alone Sola Scriptura), but that it involves something of a shell-game and a dishonest use of tradition. I don’t ascribe bad faith to individual apologists who indulge in these strategies, I think they’re genuine in how they think this 1-2 punch is a “gotcha” for the average Protestant. However, not unlike the Roman Catholic revival of Pyrrhonian skepticism in the seventeenth century, it will inevitably cause blowback. A robust Protestant understanding of Scripture will clear the ground to not only advance Sola Scriptura as a tenable position but rebut the skepticism deployed against it. The hope here is that dialogue between Christians can proceed on firmer grounds, and despite differences, Scripture will have a firmer base against opponents of Christianity.
Before we sketch out Sola Scriptura (which is central to a Protestant doctrine of Scripture), it will be helpful to understand what, precisely, we mean by canon, as well as the ancient notion of Scripture. Canon referred not to a question of inspiration or infallibility, let alone its binding definition as Scripture, but rather what was read in church. Among the Eastern Orthodox, this more fluid definition remains, with the Greek church traditionally not reading Revelation as part of the New Testament readings, while the Russians include it. Such does not mean there is a divergence between Orthodox churches as to what books apply as infallible or inspired, but rather an ecclesiastical question. Thus, when the Council of Carthage professes “that besides the Canonical Scriptures nothing be read in church under the name of divine Scripture” this refers to both a recognition of inspired status and its subsequent right to be read in church. As many know, the Council of Carthage includes the deuterocanon, as well as the standard Old and New Testaments of the Protestant canon. While this claim may appear as QED (“what was demonstrated”) for proponents of the expanded canon, it should be noted that the Lutheran and Anglican lectionaries include these same books to be read. Is this an aberration, does it make them less “Protestant”?
Protestants and the Deuterocanon
What do Protestants say about these books? First, it should be stated that many Protestant confessions do not include any enumeration of books of Scripture. The Augsburg Confession (1530) does not even have a category of Scripture! The Lutherans take a stable doctrine concerning Scripture for granted. Similarly, several Reformed confessions of faith appeal to “the Scripture” without any reference to particular books (e.g. Genevan Confession [1536], Scots Confession [1560]). However, as the century progressed, Reformed numbering of the books did not remove the deuterocanon from the Church’s “canon.” Rather, the deuterocanon (or Apocrypha) were recognized per their name: they were books of secondary importance, for establishing good morals and not doctrine.
The Belgic Confession (1561), which will make up one of the three core confessions (Three Forms of Unity) for Continental Reformed, states that the deuterocanon was to instruct in virtue, not doctrine:.
The Second Helvetic Confession (1566) states that these books are inspired, but not sufficient for establishing doctrine, citing Augustine:.”
The 39 Articles stated similarly that the deuterocanon were for establishing good living among catechumens, but not sufficient to establish doctrine, citing Jer furthest departed from this trend is in the Gallican Confession, which simply did not mention the deuterocanon (neither to include nor exclude), but that the undisputed canon (the 39 books of the Old Testament and the 27 books of the New Testament) were sufficient to establish faith. In a point we will return to later, this enumeration is justified from an internal witness, not an appeal to tradition. Nevertheless, from the testimony of the first century of the Reformation, it’s clear that the deuterocanonical books, as they were listed in the Council of Carthage, were still considered within the category of “Scripture” even if in a diminished capacity. Nevertheless, the Reformed will call upon Augustine and Jerome to support this contention.
The fatal flaw of many anti-Protestant apologists involves a shell-game. It may be true, granted the above, that a “canon list” does not decisively answer which books are then to be relied upon. As the argument usually goes, if Scripture does not reveal its own content in an infallible way, the Church (which is vaguely defined) must establish the canon of Scripture through a magisterial council. Usually, this counter-claim has the added flourish of modern scholars, who list differing canons of Scripture from the first centuries of the church. But there’s one problem: is this how the fathers think about Scripture? On the contrary, the fathers state uncritically their reliance on Scripture against their opponents. As Gregory of Nyssa will state against his Neo-Arian opponents: “Let the inspired Scriptures then be our umpire, and the vote of truth will be given to those whose dogmas are found to agree with the Divine words” (On the Holy Trinity).
But, one may object, this appeal to Scripture is within the context of a shared canon. It does not answer the question of what that canon is. But the earliest apologists, when disputing with Gnostics, argue similarly. As one paragon example, Irenaeus appealed to the Scripture as definitive for man’s knowledge of God and of the world:? (A.H. II.28.3)
How does this argument make any sense against Gnostics (whether Valentinian, Ptolemaic, or Marcionite), whose epistemological raise d’être was the existence of secret knowledge? If the Gnostics did not possess a shared canon of Scripture, why would Irenaeus appeal to “the Scriptures” as a fixed source of authority? If the canon of Scripture was as fluid as anti-Protestant apologists and modern scholarship say, then Irenaeus (as well as his opponents, it seems) was entirely ignorant of these differences. “The ignorance of the Fathers” is far from a traditional argument for trusting the doctors of the church!
Nevertheless, a certain level of fluidity may be granted to the precise canon of Scripture. An ancient method for counting the books of Scripture appealed to the alphabet of the dominant language. This altered between twenty-two (the letters in the Hebrew proto-alphabet) and twenty-four (the letters in the Greek alphabet). Hence Josephus will claim, against the Hellene Apion, that the Jews have a solid set of twenty-two books as the ancient and divine source of the Jews’ doctrine and law:. (Against Apion, I.8)
Scholars have raised the specter that these books are not listed and thus this adds nothing to the debate. However it makes little sense, if there was as much chaos and confusion over the list of sacred scripture as scholars say, then this argument is a pathetic rhetorical bluff. Couldn’t Apion, a trained scholar in Homeric hermeneutics, look for himself? The Torah (if not more) had been translated into Greek for Egyptian Jews. At the very least, Josephus’ uncritical claim of a stable set of books as divine Scripture makes it difficult to sustain that it was epistemic chaos to know, precisely, what those books, generally, were.
I would go as far as to argue that there really was no dispute as to what “the Scriptures” was as a category of sacred texts. Rather, there were debates about which books were appropriate to be read in the synagogue or church, as well as which inspired books had more or less authority. Thus, at the so-called council of Yamnia (end of the first century) the question was not so much deciding a canon, but whether certain books were more or less sacred at the core of Holy Scripture. It was not whether Esther or Song of Songs were inspired works or not, but whether they “stained the hands,” that they had the requisite level of holiness to be read in the Synagogue alongside the other, undisputed, works of canon (such as the Pentateuch, the Prophets, or the Holy Writings). The general concern was found in the content of these books: Esther (in its Hebrew form) does not mention God and Song of Songs, read superficially, is royal erotic poetry.
It’s in a similar vein that there was really no dispute among Christians as to what the canon was. The controversy around Marcion was the exception to prove the rule: when the canon was critically savaged, it was in a radical and post-Christian way. Marcion rejected the entirety of the Old Testament and most of the New. He did not do this out of a concern for a true canon of Scripture, as much as it flowed from his Gnostic “secret knowledge” that revealed the God of the Old Testament as the Demiurge, a created (and corrupt) entity that had enslaved the world in the bonds of materiality. Christian opposition to Marcion rejected this alternate cosmology, but revealed little anxiety as to what, precisely, the canon of Scripture was. It neither reflected the scholar’s or modern apologist’s notion that the Church needed to magisterially define the canon of Scripture against heretics. Rather, Christian councils claimed that they were merely restating what the Church had always believed. There was no development of doctrine or innovation. Even changes in grammar, as shown in Athanasius’ apology for Nicaea, required major justification. Most Christians believed, as the Apostle Paul and Irenaeus did, that the form of words was important to preserve the doctrine deposit that the Church’s bishops were to faithfully guard and pass down unchanged.
Given later Protestant use of the deuterocanon (even as they rejected its equivalence with the Scriptures proper), there’s no reason to think that the patristic era had a different notion about their use in argument. While Protestants certainly are averse to using Wisdom of Solomon as a prophecy of Christ, the aversion is not from the text in itself. The prophecy of the suffering servant in Wisdom 2 is not unlike what one finds in Isaiah. Therefore, given the later context of dispute about the canon of Scripture from within the world of Humanist textual criticism, it’s unnecessary. The patristics lacked much of this skeptical analysis, but even Jerome (as Protestants are fond of citing) doubted the inspiration of texts like Tobit and Judith. Nevertheless, he submitted. Again, the question is not whether these texts are inspired and sacred, but whether they operate the same way as Scripture proper.
Sola Scriptura: a Question of Authority
Here is where Sola Scriptura comes into play. To summarize a major thread among the Reformers (constituting it as one of the solae), the question is authority. When Luther, Zwingli, and other Reformers examined the claim of authority, they were baffled. Apologists of Rome may claim the councils, but which ones? What if they contradicted? They claimed tradition, but which strand of tradition? The fathers don’t always speak with a single voice. They claim the authority of the papacy, but papal bulls revised each other. For many of the Reformers, soaked in the Humanist methodology of ad fontes, using techniques of textual criticism and scholarship, the question of authority had reached a boiling point. What if the Church had required belief in something that not only had no justification, but was spiritually harming the lives of the faithful? What if the sales of indulgences (and the requisite belief in purgatory) had made Christians lose sight of God’s grace? What if the canonical fasts had made Christians self-righteous, focused on outward performance and neglecting an inward conversion? It’s for this reason that Luther nailed his Ninety-Five Theses (1517) and Zwingli led his band of reformers to eat sausage during the Lenten fast (1522). The only way out of this morass was the appeal to Scripture as the ultimate authority to bind the conscience with life-saving doctrine. The question is not whether there are other sources of authority besides Scripture. All the Reformers accepted the role of textual scholarship, reason (scholastic or otherwise), and the tradition of the Fathers and the councils. The question was that when these authorities disputed, Scripture operated as the supreme referee.
A major qualifier in the Protestant doctrine of Sola Scriptura is binding the conscience. It is not a question of what one can believe, in se, but what beliefs are necessary for eternal life. Hence, as the early Reformed confessions explicated, the doctrine of God and Christ (shared with Rome) flowed naturally into Christ’s saving and atoning work. These doctrines were the several jewels that surrounded the core of saving faith: the interrelated doctrines of justification by faith alone (Lutheran emphasis) and union with Christ (Reformed emphasis). While it may be true that the Virgin Mary was an ever-virgin (something that most Reformers emphatically believed), this doctrine was not necessary to safeguard the atoning work of Christ (and thus is not included in any Reformation confessions of faith). In contrast, the meritorious invocation of saints, purgatory, and the Mass as meritorious sacrifice of Christ damaged the once-and-for-all atonement and Christ’s sole mediatorship between God and man. Thus these doctrines were ejected as harmful errors. Similarly the Reformers repeat the laundry list of Christological heresies that all churches had denied. Arians, Nestorians, Doceticists, Ebionites, and Eutychians were denounced as diminishing Christ as mediator. If Christ was not, according to Chalcedonian orthodoxy, both God and man, a single divine person, with divine nature, who assumed a human nature, then Christ’s could not atone in the way Scripture described. Christ had to be described in this way, as God and man, in order to be the mediator between God and man.
The alternative view, pace Apologists, was not Papal fiat, conciliar authority, or the tradition of the fathers. The appeal to these was precisely the problem, because if they conflicted (as the Reformers made clear they did) how were they to be resolved? Rather than the Reformers’ notion that the Scripture (Old and New) were the binding word of God, Rome split the Word into two: the written (Scripture) and unwritten. As “Session III” at the Council of Trent puts.
To restate the problem: how could Christians know whether a council was faithful to the Word of God or not if they contradicted? For Rome, the appeal was to a dual source of authority: the Scriptures and the Unwritten Tradition. The latter subsists precisely as unwritten & thus whatever past authority mentioned something that pertained to current Roman practice, such was not authoritative in itself but described what Christ had dictated. If the Reformers asked where the papacy or the cardinals were in Scripture, the Roman apologist would appeal to this unwritten tradition. Christ had privately taught these doctrines as binding, and references to these through time were testimonies to this original doctrine.
In a way, this argument involved a kind of fideistic presentism that allowed Rome to retroject itself backwards as a timeless and unchanging bulwark against novel heresies. Again, it should be clear that this approach is not what most contemporary apologists posit. It is far more similar to the ultramontanism fideism of Cardinal Manning than any claim of developed doctrine or that the traditions, in themselves, are sufficient for additional doctrines. Of course, most apologists are relatively ecumenical, not threatening Protestants with damnation for continuing in their error (even the papacy effectively teaches ecumenism, both in and out of Christianity proper). The Eastern Orthodox struggle to gain their composure in the particular confines of this debate, and often ape Roman arguments without understanding what this means for their own doctrine. There are ways out for them (such as the ecclesiastical organicism of the 1848 Encyclical of the Eastern Patriarchs or Georges Florovsky’s “Mind of the Fathers”), but I won’t judge them. This leaves no wiggle room for Protestants in terms of Sola Scriptura. It’s either that or an unwritten tradition. But in the same vein, it opens the rich use of the Fathers, councils, tradition, and reason that defined Protestants through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It was not Rome, but the Lutherans, who developed Patristics as a serious humanistic field of inquiry. It was this notion of Sola Scriptura, where Scripture was the final authority, that made Anglican ministers the stupor Mundi in their learned exegesis and textual scholarship. And thus the Reformation advanced this doctrine of Sola Scriptura upon this generally given definition of Scripture.
It should be noted that this stable basis for canon suffered some turbulence during the rise of Humanist textual scholarship. Prior to and during the Reformation, Christian humanists had their questions about the contents of the Scripture. While it’s true that Luther had dismissive words for the Epistle to James, he was not alone in questioning this book (along with Hebrews and Revelation) as truly canonical. Lutherans to this day (whether out of traditional concern or modernist theology) will distinguish between the homolegoumena (undisputed primary books) and the antilegoumena (books of disputed, but still accepted, orthodoxy). Hence why the New Testament, as a bound book, is ordered with the four Gospels first, with Acts following, and then Paul’s canon of letters; at the end of the book are included 2 Peter, 2-3 John, Hebrews, James, Jude, and Revelation, which took a lower priority in determining the doctrines of the Scripture. Even as these concerns existed among both Roman and Reformation humanists (Cardinal Cajetan had similar doubts about the canon), these antilegoumena were widely accepted and nevertheless valid. Their disputed inclusion itself defined the role these books played in shaping doctrine. While Luther should be censured for his cavalier commentary about James, it is true that the clarity and primacy in Luke or Romans should not be doubted against a statement in James. Despite the occasional bad conscience from James’ denunciation of “faith alone,” the Reformers from the very beginning interpreted James in light of Paul in Romans and Galatians. Flowing from Sola Scriptura, the Reformers emphasized Scripture interpreting Scripture. Clearer statements of faith (e.g. Rom. 10:9) should interpret more ambiguous statements. This ordering in no way jeopardizes the authority of Scripture, but is a subsequent question as to how the good bishop or priest utilizes his office to properly teach from the Scriptures.
Returning to the content of canon, it’s not only the early Fathers and the Reformers which had this similar approach to canonical definition. In John of Damascus’s An Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith, after extolling the authority of Scripture, proceeds to enumerate the books of the Old Testament:.
Damascene’s justification for the inspired, but non-canonical status, works of the deuterocanon flows from a traditional belief that the Scriptures were finished when Ezra placed them in the Temple at the end of Israel’s fleshly exile. Juxtaposed from this still patristic source is the nineteenth-century patriarch-saint Philaret of Moscow. In his authoritative catechism for the Russian church, Philaret described the contents of Holy Scripture as the 22 books of Scripture:.
While this in no way covers over differences over the necessary or licit doctrine of the church, it’s clear that Eastern Orthodoxy justified the same canon of Scripture that the early Reformers utilized. The deuterocanon is purely for moral formation, but it’s demoted to be strictly for catechumens! Again, there may be alternatives (as listed above) to either Protestant or Roman doctrines of authority, but it does not depend upon the fact that the Fathers (or Orthodox patriarchs) do not know the content of the Scriptures without an authoritative statement from a magisterial council.
However, the caricature between Ultramontane Fideism fighting the paper-pope of increasingly austere biblicists has some root in truth. Without rehashing the entirety of the post-Reformation period, suffice to say that the fighting between Rome and the Reformers (both Lutheran and Reformed, who increasingly divided among themselves) produced increasing rigidity on both sides. Confessions became more elaborate to exclude error. A new wave of Schoolmen sought to build more elaborate systems of doctrine to impose upon the faithful. Generally cooler heads prevailed (manifest in the Epitome of Concord or the Synod of Dordt, which were rather generous in their orthodoxy as they excluded error). Nevertheless, both sides intensified their defense of doctrines along increasingly self-defeating lines. As mentioned above, Roman Catholics recouped their losses in patristics through a reappraisal of Pyrrhonian skepticism. Textual scholarship, if applied more vigorously, could destroy confidence not only in the manuscripts of the Fathers, but the Scripture itself. The purpose was not apathetic skepticism, but to ring a warning bell. If Christians did not flee to Mother Rome then the scholarly methods of the humanists would lead to atheism. For if the authority of the Church could not backstop the Scripture and the Fathers, then the naked conscience was on its own. Of course, this method found adherents among radical Anabaptists as well. Quakers, in their early “wild-man phase,” utilized similar arguments in defense of Inner Light. One’s subjective experience of truth, given through interior confirmation, alone could ground faith. Not amount of external witnesses, Scripture or otherwise, could shore up truth.
Inerrantists and Elite Secularity
On the other side, Reformed stalwarts, like John Owen, boxed himself into defending not only the infallibility of Scripture, but of particular texts. The Masoretic text wasn’t just an ancient and sure witness to the Scripture, it was itself inspired. However, the problem was that textual scholarship had revealed its vowel-points were an invention of a later age. Owen found himself defending the inspiration of the vowel-points in order to back-stop trust not only in the Scripture (given historically), but a perfect text that existed out there. This may seem like a strengthening of Sola Scriptura, but it fatally weakened it. If scholarship could not adequately defend a particular text, then confidence in the Scripture (free of textual errors) would decline. In contemporary terms, this problem marks out much of the “inerrantist” movement. The problem isn’t whether Scripture is infallible or inerrant (a teaching common to all Christian churches), but whether a certain text has a near inspired protection from error. Most inerrantists do not opt to protect any particular textual tradition (least of all the Textus Receptus, which many Evangelicals have simply abandoned without reason). Instead they defend a phantom: the Original. Of course, the originals don’t exist and thus this opens the door to constantly revising the content of Scripture. Otherwise conservative Baptist excludes John 8 and the end of Mark 16 from his preaching: these cease to be inspired Scripture since they’re, supposedly, not included in the original.
The context for these metastases was not only intellectual. Confessional warfare happened not only with the pen, but the sword. The French Wars of Religion, the Thirty Years War, the Eighty Years War (or Dutch Independence), and the English Civil Wars reflected confessional divisions on the battlefield. In the aftermath of these battles, Confessional orthodoxy (whether Roman, Lutheran, or Reformed) suffered irreparable loss. Confessional standards were not sufficient to establish Christendom, and thus new methods of rationalism and empiricism challenged historicism and scholasticism as the new basis for social stability. Again, without getting into the changing dimensions of European society and politics, with the rise of increasingly powerful commercial interests, a form of “elite secularity” settled in, changing the role of ecclesiastical polity. And subsequently, as these intensified and reified standards offered less flexible means, they no longer served as a means of stability. While still a generous statement of Reformed orthodoxy, the Westminster Confession of Faith reveals the shift towards Sola Scriptura as not only a source of authority, but an increasingly import source of epistemology. It is necessary to quote its first three statements at length: that His will unto His Church; (Heb. 1:1) and afterwards, for the better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the Church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing: ).
After listing the core canon of Scripture (39 books of the Old Testament and 27 books of the New), Westminster delegitimizes the deuterocanon:
3.
Here we return to the curious clause of Scripture’s self-affirmation as an internal assurance. Formally this may be true, but the importance of traditioned authority is diminished to Scripture’s detriment. It’s important to recognize that, indeed, Scripture’s ultimate authority flows from God. But knowledge of what this scripture is cannot rely on what appears to be an individualized witness of the Holy Spirit, or one separated from the contours of church history. It is important not only to know the content of Scripture from the witness of the Fathers in all ages, but also authorial details. Would Mark possess this received authority if the name “Mark” is really an empty signature for an unknown author? It was precisely through this historic knowledge that this book of Scripture possesses its authority. For as the tradition testified, Mark wrote what Peter dictated to him, a witness of the Twelve to the world. Scripture possesses an interior witness, where reading is a portal to God’s presence who confirms that this in fact is his holy word, but it’s not a process separated from either history or the church. It’s the internal witness of the church, through time, that appeared in and through these historic witnesses. Hence there was no immediate soul-searching, or any manic search for an ur-text, to back-stop the witness of the Scriptures simplicitur. To repeat: the earliest Reformed and Lutheran confessions don’t even offer a list of inspired books. It was simply a given from and through church history.
The Fluid and Confident Sense of Scripture
Protestants must resource the fluid and confident sense of the Scripture that existed at the beginning of the Reformation (so too, for that matter, should Rome and Byzantium). Such is not a return to innocency, as if Christians should simply close their eyes to scholarly developments. But it’s the deep appreciation of the witness of the Fathers, which the early Reformers possessed, which grounds the doctrine of Scripture, even Sola Scriptura. Hence Anglicans should return to Bishop Joseph Butler above all. It’s in his use of probabilistic reason, grounded in historicist use of sources and a dependence on the testimony of the centuries, that Protestants can find their footing. The recent historical scholarship of Anglicans like Richard Bauckham have fruitful potential to not simply give up the field to skeptics (both believing and unbelieving). Instead of a quest for an ur-text or entering into a mush of traditionalism (which usually fails to understand the core issues at stake during the Reformation), a dynamic Sola Scriptura will restore a lively faith in the text as given.
In short, rather than staking one’s faith in an academic textual guild or the particular politics of this or that magisterium, Christians should once again state with Jude:
“contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints”
'What Do We Mean By Sola Scriptura?' has no commentsBe the first to comment this post!This guest post is by Neil Patel of Quick Sprout.
Whether you want to write a persuasive post or a headline that grabs attention, or create a call to action that grows your RSS subscription count by 243%, you first have to understand who your reader is.
So how do you go about finding this out?
You could guess, measure, and repeat until you hit upon a winning formula … but that could take months or years.
The easiest and fastest way to find out what will resonate with your readers is to ask them. And the best to do that is with a survey.
How can surveys help you?
You probably have a good working understanding of who your readers are because of your experience in the field. This will help you create surveys, but it won’t help you get to those breakthrough insights that will turn your posts into reader magnets.
To do that you need to know information like this:
- Demographics: A survey will tell you who’s reading your blog. It can tell you their sex, age, income, and interests.
- Content: A survey will tell you what kinds of content your readers like. Do they like practical articles or more research-based posts? Do they want those to be long or short? What about frequency?
- Products: A survey will also tell you what kinds of products your readers may be interested in.
- Problems: Finally, a survey can tell you what problems that your readers want solved. This is probably the best piece of information you could have when it comes to creating engaging content, right?
Top survey tools
AJ showed how to create a survey that gets insightful answers from your readers earlier today.
Now, let’s look at some in expensive tools that will help you gather this all-important information professionally and securely.
One of the simplest ways to get feedback from readers is to write a post with survey-like questions, and then ask your readers to respond in the comments.
There are some disadvantages to this approach. For example, because people are free to say anything they want in the comments, it may be hard to get the exact information you want.
Also, with this approach, the survey responses are out in the open, and this may suppress the response since people may be a little timid to share information so publicly.
What I’ve found about using comments for surveys is that this approach is perfect for simple questions like “What was the worst work experience you ever had?” If you want something more specific, then you need to use one of the tools we’ll look at next.
WP-Polls
Using a WordPress plugin like WP-Polls on your blog will give you the option of asking very specific questions that should generate very specific answers over an extended amount of time.
This plugin is embedded on your site as a widget, and actually adds another element of interaction with your readers. Every month, you can change the questions.
The nice thing about WordPress plugins is that they’re simple to install from inside your WP admin control panel.
Google Docs
Google Docs offers a tool that will help you create surveys that you can link readers to (for example, in an email), or actually embed into your blog.
It creates these forms out of HTML, gives you several survey styles, and even gives you a huge selection of themes to choose from:
This is the form that Chris Brogan uses:
On the back end, you can review the collected data in a charts and graphs:
Survey Monkey
Survey Monkey is the most well-known survey tool online, having been around since 2002.
While there are paid plans that won’t bankrupt you, I’ve found that the free online version suits most of my needs. The only drawback to this type of survey is that it will drive your readers away from your site, as they need to go to Survey Monkey to give their answers.
The service gives you a choice of 15 question styles to choose from.
And you can even customize the survey to match your blog color scheme.
KISSinsights
This tool is one my team developed. KISSinsights is a simple tool that takes two minutes to install, and allows you to ask one question of your readers. You can update that question at any time.
What I really like about this survey tool is that we tried to make it as little a distraction from your site as possible: it pops up, but then the user can close it and move on to your site immediately.
WP Survey and Quiz Tool
This robust WordPress tool, WP Survey and Quiz Tool, will let you do more than just create surveys—as the name suggests, you can also use it to create quizzes and polls.
There is no limit to the number of surveys or quizzes you can create, and the tool gives you these features as well:
- Limit answers to one per IP address.
- Send customized notification emails.
- Send notification emails to one email address or a group of WordPress users.
- Create custom contact forms.
- Export your surveys and quizzes.
The drawback to this tool is that your survey is limited to s single post—it’s not available site-wide.
WordPress Simple Survey
The jQuery-based WordPress survey tool Simple Survey will allow you to create basic weighted surveys that route users to a location based upon their survey “score.”
The page doesn’t need to be reloaded as the user progresses through the quiz:

The feature that I really like about this tool is what it can do to help your poll go viral through features like one-click sharing to Twitter and Yahoo, and adding your survey to SodaHead’s network to get more exposure.
Polldaddy Polls and Ratings
This fully customizable survey tool for WordPress gives you the ability to post your poll on a single post or as a sidebar widget:
The nice thing about Polldaddy Polls is that it supports 57 different languages, making it a better option for those serving audiences outside of the United States.
Unfortunately if you have the latest WordPress update, 3.3.2, then it may not be compatible with your site.
Survey Me
For the people who don’t code out there, SurveyMe is probably the WordPress plugin you want to use.
This simple install will allow you to role out a poll within minutes.
Maximizing responses
By the way, if you are concerned about how many responses you’ll get to your survey, don’t worry. People love to share their opinions—you’ll probably get as high as a ten percent turnout!
If you are interested in getting an even higher response, I’d recommend you tell your readers that you’re going to share some of the best responses that you get from the survey. With a promise that they might get some exposure on your site, more people will be motivated to leave a response.
If you want an even higher turnout, or if you have a small audience and want to maximize the number of answers you receive, you may want to offer some kind of incentive (for example, everyone who responds will be entered in a drawing for a $50 Apple iTunes gift card).

Neil, does the KISSinsights tool cookie users that have already answered or closed the popup? I wouldn’t want the user to be bombarded with the survey again and again.
Google Docs is most easy online tool to create survey form,not only is this tool very easy to use, but it has served many purposes at work — surveys, polls, online registration, online forms, and online exams. It has definitely been a great communication and tracking tool and absoluately free .
Hi Niel Great Post
I like Survey Monkey and have been using it for a while now..
thanks for sharing some other tools would definitely try em
Neil – This is a nice insight into the various tools. Google Docs is ofcourse the most popular of them all I believe and I think it is quite effective for online surveys. I am sure the others are useful in one way or the other, just have to spend some time and review them. Thanks for sharing.
A great collection. Also one tool is much more helping me that am searching previous now i got it. Am variously liking color scheme tool. Thanks for posting an awesome topic.
This is really great information. I haven’t tried surveying my blog readers yet; I simply work from the mails they send me. However I run this Facebook group along with my partner for those interested in writing fiction and I found out that the FB poll works quite well too. So if you have an active FB group or page, you could try surveying the visitors there with the FB Poll.
Momentarily I am using kissinsights and it’s working fine for me. But, I am limited to only one question. Hopefully, I am going to try google docs. Thanks for the post @ Neil.
Actually, SurveyMonkey now allows you to embed surveys into your post, if you wish, so you’re not sending the traffic away. I did it just last week here
This was still using their free offering – it’s a great service.
Interesting plugin, thanks for shaing, I will be checking it out!
This list is great. I wish you had sent this prior to the completion of book. :)
Thanks for the great survey tools. It’s always good to get opinions from people.
i am prefer google docs most of it :)
google provide a many tools to used, tools to analytics and of course blogger to blogging itself.
Nice article Darren, i am your fans, thx.
Great list of tools, thank you!
You guys forgot to mention SoGoSurvey.com. They offer the best tools for survey design in the industry.
Ben: Google forms might be free but when you add in the additional time it would take to grade responses in that, it becomes hard to use it for exams. If you are using google forms for exams, you will love what we do. For saving time with automatic grading checkout our quiz maker and survey software
I guess they missed to put in the list …
Great collection of survey tools + feature review. This saves a lot of time! Thank you, Neil!
Thank you Neil for this almost perfect list, However I do feel that PollDeep should also be added to this list given its ability to conduct amazing results. Latest features and super service has made it a name to reckon with in this industry.Valuations

Launched by the World Health Organization (WHO), this call to action emphasizes addressing hearing loss and raising awareness about preventative measures. Hearing loss is one of the most common medical conditions that people experience. According to WHO, 466 million people globally have disabling hearing loss. This public health epidemic is expected to rapidly increase so focusing on prevention is critical.
World Hearing Day: Screen, Rehabilitate, Communicate
In addition to advocating for public hearing health policy that expands accessibility, World Hearing Day highlights three important strategies:
- Screen: integrate regular screenings into annual health check-ins. Having hearing assessed consistently allows you to monitor your hearing health and intervene early if you experience any changes. Early intervention can significantly improve treatment and health outcomes.
- Rehabilitate: the most common treatment for hearing loss is hearing aids. These highly advanced devices are designed to absorb, amplify, and process sound; providing significant support and increasing a person’s hearing ability.
- Communicate: treating hearing loss has countless benefits including enhancing communication. Effective communication is what sustains healthy relationships, strengthens job performance, enhances social life and general wellness.
Treating hearing loss also reduces the risk of developing other associated health conditions including cognitive decline and accidental injuries.
Hearing Loss FAQs
Though hearing loss is one of the most pervasive health conditions that people experience today, it is often underdiagnosed for a variety of reasons. There are various misconceptions about impaired hearing that contributes to overlooking its occurrence and the impact it has on all facets of life.
- Doesn’t hearing loss only impact older adults?
Hearing loss impacts people of all ages. It is true that age-related hearing loss (referred to as presbycusis) significantly impacts older adults:
- 25% of adults ages 65-74 have some degree of hearing loss
- 50% of adults 75 and older have disabling hearing loss
Additionally, according to WHO:
- Over 43 million people globally, ages 12-35, live with disabling hearing loss
- 1.1 billion teens and young adults are at risk for developing hearing loss caused by exposure to loud noise
Hearing loss isn’t fatal so how can it be a serious condition?
Hearing loss is the third most common chronic health condition that adults experience. It is also a permanent condition that cannot be cured and if untreated, it can lead to significant health issues. Additionally, the symptoms it produces can take a toll on daily living by straining communication which is essential to managing personal and professional responsibilities. Strained communication often leads to social withdrawal and this combination can take a toll on mental health, contributing to depression, loneliness, and anxiety. Impacting physical and mental health, untreated hearing loss can deepen if it is not addressed.
Speaking loudly solves the problem right?
People often assume that they can self-manage declining hearing with strategies like speaking loudly, reading lips, pretending to hear etc. But these strategies are not effective and can actually exacerbate hearing loss by delaying treatment. Hearing loss is best assessed and treated by a hearing healthcare professional. The most common treatment is hearing aids which are electronic devices that are designed to provide support with amplifying and processing incoming sound.
Tips for Effective Hearing Care
There are various ways you can tend to your hearing health. Simple tips to integrate into your daily life that prioritize your hearing health includes:
- Wear protective gear: earmuffs, earplugs, headphones etc. serve as a protective barrier for the ears, reducing the amount and impact of sound absorbed.
- Reduce exposure to loud noise: by avoiding noisy environments, opting for quieter settings, maintaining low volume setting on electronic devices etc.
- Take listening breaks: your ears and brain are constantly working to process incoming sound information throughout the day. Taking breaks from this stimuli by powering off sources of sound allows the auditory system to rest and replenish.
- Have hearing assessed: hearing tests measure hearing capacity in both ears, establishing any impairment and the degree. Having hearing tested regularly allows you to be informed about your hearing needs and intervene if you experience changes.

OF Fasting, And Trumpets, And Feasts.
Come, my beloved, the season calls us to keep the feast. Again, 'the Sun of Righteousness1 ,2 '-that knowing both the one and the other, be might do things befitting the season, and avoid the blame of unseasonableness. For thus the God of all, after the manner of wise Solomon3 , distributes everything in time and season, to the end that, in due time, the salvation of men should be everywhere spread abroad. Thus the `Wisdom of God4 ,' our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, not out of season, but in season, `passed upon holy souls, fashioning the friends of God and the prophets5 ;' so that although very many were praying for Him, and saying, `O that the salvation of God were come out of Sion6 !'-the Spouse also, as it is written in the Song of Songs, was praying and saying, `O that Thou wert my sister's son, that sucked the breasts of my mother7 !'8 .'
2. And, on this account, the blessed Paul, urging us to note this season, wrote, saying, `Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation9 .' At set seasons also He called the children of Israel to the Levitical feasts by Moses, saying, `Three times in a year ye shall keep a feast to Me10 ' (one of which, my beloved, is that now at hand), the trumpets of the priests sounding and urging its observance; as the holy Psalmist commanded, saying, `Blow with the trumpet in the new moon, on the [solemn] day of your feast11 .' Since this sentence enjoins upon us to blow both on the new moons, and on the solemn1213 ;'-very properly for those who here love Him. So that we may know that these things had reference to the time of Moses-yea, were to be observed so long as the shadow lasted, the whole being appointed for use, `till the time of reformation14 .' `For' (said He) `if ye shall go out to battle in your land against your enemies that rise up against you15 ' 16 .'17 ;18 .' At another time the call is made to virginity, and self-denial, and conjugal harmony, saying, To virgins, the things of virgins; and to those who love the way of abstinence, the things of abstinence; and to those who are married19 ,20 .' If thou wouldest listen to a trumpet much greater than all these, hear our Saviour saying; `In that last and great clay of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink21 .'22 .'23 . And therefore the blessed Paul accuses those who dishonour God; `Transgressors of the law dishonour God24 .'25 ,26 .' That we may be able to shew what kind of persons we should be when we fast, and of what character the fast should be, listen again to God commanding Moses, and saying, as it is written in Leviticus27 , 28 .'29 .' Such was the case with our Lord, who said, `My meat is to do the will of My Father which is in heaven30 .' Aethiopia31 .' For this is the food of sinners. And as our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, being heavenly bread, is the food of the saints, according to this; `Except ye eat My flesh, and drink My blood32 ;'33aea and the city existed, there were a type, and a lamb, and a shadow, since the law thus commanded34 : These things shall not be done in another city; but in the land of Judaea, and in no place without [the land of Judaea].35 ;'36 .'aea,37 .'38 ;'-as we hear the sacred trumpet, no longer slaying a material lamb, but that true Lamb that was slain, even our Lord Jesus Christ; `Who was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and was dumb as a lamb before her shearers39 ;' being purified by His precious blood, which speaketh better things than that of Abel, having our feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel, holding in our hands the rod and staff of the Lord, by which that saint was comforted, who said40 , `Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me;' and to sum up, being in all respects prepared, and careful for nothing, because, as the blessed Paul saith, `The Lord is at hand41 ;'42 ,]43 .

Chancellor Gaetan J. Alfano on District Attorney Seth Williams
In light of the news regarding District Attorney Seth Williams, Gaetan J. Alfano, Chancellor of the 12,000-member Philadelphia Bar Association today issued the following statement:
"The most recent revelation that District Attorney Seth Williams received more than $160,000 in gifts during a five-year period highlights the pressing need for amending the state ethics rules for public officials.
The state law currently allows for the receipt and non-disclosure of gifts from 'friends,' an exception that can be construed so broadly as to defeat the purpose of the ethics rules.
The public could question whether such gifts, especially of this magnitude, were motivated by considerations of political power as opposed to true friendship.
This exception should be completely eliminated to avoid the appearance of impropriety. Otherwise, public confidence in the government and fair administration of the justice system will be unduly compromised."You can get the table made by rendering your own personal needs.

A bedside table is somewhere to put all of your bedside essentials. A bedside table is an ideal piece to optimise the space in your home. A bedside table alternatively called as a side table is a little cabinet, intended to be kept beside the bed or some other place within the room.

Art Works
About me
Eileen Stapleton McCarthy is an abstract, environmental, contemporary Irish visual artist from Co. Tipperary with a keen interest in the Irish landscape. She has studied Fine Art Painting at St. John’s College Cork and received a first class honours degree in Fine Art Painting from Limerick School of Art and Design.
Although painting is Eileen’s primary medium, she engages with other mediums such as installations, photography and combined media, land art and Social Engagement. She is well known as an evocative and creative writer. Her engagement with the community, landscape, heritage, and a love for nature is evident throughout her practice. Her artwork is a relational exploration of humankind, the landscape environment, and our potential to change.
In these artworks Eileen focuses on the Irish Landscape and its context in Contemporary society. The representational aspect of her paintings, installations and her audio-visual media are replaced by abstract dichotomies. These paintings focus on our relational position and shifts through the permeance of embodied memory in the landscape. She uses simple natural materials to communicate an authentic aesthetic language. This creates a space which connects the viewer to the Irish Landscape Environment. The viewer is prompted to relinquish any attachment to industrialised materials and instead focuses on pure aesthetics and nuances of memory on a surface of raw linen. The result is freedom of artistic expression while the viewer is provided with a connective space in which to mindfully reflect.Directed by Lew Landers and written by Bert Granet and Edmund L.

Posted by Luggage Hub on
When you’re getting ready to go on a holiday or business trip, you need to consider the excess load of baggage charges that the airport places on any extra luggage weight over the allocated amount. Too often travellers tend to over-pack and take unnecessary items that they almost never use when they are on holiday.
Depending on your travel, you’ll easily be able to weigh in within the baggage limit by implementing some handy tips.
Here are some pointers on how to avoid those costly excess baggage charges:
- Clothing
We understand that you might want to take the majority of your wardrobe with you, but in reality, how many different pairs of pants do you need? The same goes for your jackets, jumpers and t-shirts as well. If you’re happy to re-wear most of your clothes, then it will save you doubling or tripling up on items.
- Toiletries
Carrying a 750ml shampoo bottle for a two-week holiday is not sensible. It will add to the weight of your luggage. If you want your special shampoo, for example, then you can always decant some into a smaller bottle. Still, you can always buy toothpaste and other toiletries at your destination.
- Shoes
If you’re going on a trip such as a business meeting or dinner ceremony, it is understandable to bring your best high-heels or leather slicks. However, is it necessary to bring along those three or four other shoes? We suggest one pair of good shoes and a pair of walking shoes – depending on the trip, of course.
- Allow extra space
Remember, when you go on holiday, you will always want to buy souvenirs from the country you visit. Plus, friends and family will always have a list of things for you to bring back. Therefore, make some space in your luggage prior to departing so you can bring those items back and stay within the baggage limit.
The tips can make a huge difference in the way you pack your luggage and avoid those hefty charges at the baggage counter. Just bear in mind that not everything you bring along will be used.
If you want more information about the right type of luggage to choose that would suit your travel plans, contact us today.

Seeing what you want to create is a very big deal.
Bounties of scientific studies – lots focused on sports and visualization as a part of a training program where the results are easier to “measure” in sports performance- have come up with a great big conclusion.
It is much easier to achieve an outcome if you can envision it clearly beforehand.
We’ve all tried some form of visualization before, even if it’s daydreaming and don’t think it qualifies as “visualization.”
It does!
But, sometimes I struggle to visualize things. Maybe you do, too?
Have you ever tried to sit down and do the visualization/ manifestation exercises so much touted these days, only to come up blank or feel like it’s extremely hard to focus?
Lately I have been getting some wonderful knowledge in the world of envisioning things, and there are three key aspects of being able to see things clearly and meditate on an outcome in mental pictures that I have embraced! I hope you find them as helpful as I have!
To sharpen the focus of your mind’s eye…
1. Get physically calm before you start.
Sometimes I am all over the map mentally. My body is tense. My mind is moving a million miles an hour.
And, I get frustrated.
Sound familiar?
Srinivasan Pillay writes about the science of visualization in Huffington Post, emphasizing the fact that you have to be calm first: ”.”incense essential oil on the soles of my feet as well as the third eye point between my eyebrows, a new go-to habit of mine when my mind feels scattered and I am having trouble tuning in and envisioning things.
Some people put an quartz crystal on that same third eye point while they visualize as a way to focus and open up to their inner vision.
Music (*even a guided meditation tape) help some people to tune in and get into the rhythm of visualization.
3. Practice. Apparently, the brain needs practice and exercise as much as the rest of the body does, so don’t neglect the practice.
You may not see things perfectly every day when you try to meditate on your visions and you may not even feel amazing each time you visualize. But with more patience and some practice, you can use these short visualization sessions every day as a way to extend your patience and focus more and more on what you want.

It’s fun to cruise along for a while but if you have been feeling the rut, these instant to- dos will add much needed depth to your thought process and put you right back in the driver’s seat.
- Close loop
It’s not fun when people keep reaching out to you over status updates. Run your own update mechanism (message/ whatsapp/ one line email/ 30 seconds call) and update concerned stakeholders periodically.
Anticipate their next question and have a response ready. So that you don’t react to the question or to the person; it’s a matter of perspective.
Why- Reactions put you in a fight or fly mode. More often than not you start resenting the person who keeps asking for updates. Take that out of the equation, communicate first.
- Be tomorrow ready
If you don’t want to take instructions or be instructed; you need to have a cogent plan for tomorrow. That way when you are instructed, you actually have some recommendations and don’t have to just say yes and move on.
Why- This makes you engage in quality conversations and engages beyond semantics. It is a great opportunity to showcase your thought process.
- Substantiate what you say
Data is a great addition to supposition and intuition. Data is more useful when you have a story to corroborate it; one that is actually true.
Figure out what the data is supposed to make you feel, and then choose anecdotes/ stories that are relevant to your ecosystem and will influence as per your mind-set.
Why- Data and stories provide insights that cut through the noise. It helps you start answering unasked business questions and raises the bar for others.
These will instantly change what people perceive of you and while they aren’t easy, it will enable you to change the rules of the game.It ain’t just a river in Egypt

ABC News: Bush on His Legacy: I ‘Liberated’ Iraqis
In a personal and wide-ranging interview conducted by his sister about his legacy, his faith and the influence of his father, President George W. Bush said he hopes to be remembered as a liberator of the Iraqi people.
…
“I surrounded myself with good people,” Bush said. “I carefully considered the advice of smart, capable people and made tough decisions.”
…
“The promise of No Child Left Behind has been fulfilled,” Bush said.Abstract
A field trial was conducted to determine the effects of harvest method (green cane harvest versus preharvest burning) and different crop residue removal treatments on the populations of ground-inhabiting arthropod predators and Elasmopalpus lignosellus (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) in the first ratoon crop. Neither preharvest burning nor percentage crop residue removal after green cane harvest had any significant effect on the numbers of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) (F = 1.00; df = 4; P = 0.412) or spiders (Araneae) (F = 0.08; df = 4; P = 0.921) captured in pitfall traps. In contrast, crop residue levels remaining after green cane harvest significantly impacted E. lignosellus damage to the ratoon crop, with increased damage associated with lower levels of residue. Removal of ≥66% of the crop residue caused a significant (F = 132.68; df = 3; P < 0.001) increase in E. lignosellus damage that would likely reduce sugarcane yield, while 33% of the residue could be removed without increasing damage. Overall, our data indicate that green cane harvesting will not affect arthropod ground predators but may reduce the risk of E. lignosellus damage.This stunning quality set of 3 glass ornaments from German company Inge are an elegant addition to your Christmas collection.

The author collected in one work just a tiny fragment of the atrocious crimes carried out by the Albanian terrorists in Kosovo before and after the NATO’s aggression against Yugoslavia.
The main character, a 12-year-old Serbian boy who was kidnapped in broad daylight and who almost fell victim to an illegal organ transplant in the notorious “Yellow House” in Northern Albania, where no less than 300 people, primarily Serbs, were killed. Many reputable sources claim that the victim’s organs were sold abroad, from which profited the leaders of the terrorist Kosovo Liberation Army.
As far as we know, the Voice of Russia is the first Russian media, which is publishing an extract from The Boy from the Yellow House in Russian.
“I could sense the smell of chlorine, a weird smell, a smell of the hospital, of medicine. The doors opened and we were blinded by a bring light of the surgery ward. I could see the doctors and a person lying on the table, from his body they pumped something out with large thick syringes. I was just a child and I was afraid, I did not know what was going on. I felt sick. I could only see that the victim was lying in a cat position: the knees together with the spine curved.
We sat in the corner and waited for the surgery to end. The doctors were not wearing surgical gowns. They only had rubber gloves and aprons that were a light green color. I remember the floor on which I sat praying for mercy, surrounded by syringes, empty plastic bottles and gauze soaked in blood. The surgical table was huge… They killed the victim from which they drew the bone marrow, put him on a gurney and took out of the room. Then they brought the half dead person I had seen in the prison cell while I walked down the corridor. He was all yellow, wounded and was delirious. They gave him anesthesia. They were in a great hurry. They put on the surgical masks and prepared the containers. The victim was attached to some equipment, perhaps for sucking out blood. I began to loose consciousness…
I am haunted by horrible images. I watched them cut a corpse with a saw. The victim was wrapped in sheets, then in thick plastic. Then a few men came in and took out the cut up corpse. I was scared that they would put me on the table next, but I kept my mouth shut because I was afraid of the bald man who had his gun pointed at me. Since I was weak from acute hepatitis they decided to first cure me and then extract my organs. That’s when I fled that horrible house taking the horror of death with me. They say time cures everything. Time cures nothing. It destroys. What are inside me now are ruins, dusty, buried ruins.”
In his interview to the Voice of Russia the author of the novel Saša Milivojev told the story of how he created the book The Boy from the Yellow House whose main character managed to run away from the hospital and save his life.
When I studied the list of people who disappeared and were kidnapped in Kosovo, I found a lot of details about the horrible destiny of the victims. There are 1,128 people on the list – women, children, and priests. There was no trace left of them… I collected the material for the novel by talking to the witnesses who lost relatives in Kosovo… The author of a fiction novel has the right to make up things, but in this case I did not need to invent anything: there were sufficient life stories, stories of the horrible reality. I saw everything as if on a movie screen. I did not make up the war in Kosovo. I was also bombed in 1999 because of the made up Račak case, the place where the Serbs allegedly massacred the Albanians. It was the NATO that bombed the Serbs and gave the Albanians the green light to drive away and kill our people and to form a criminal state on the territory of our country with the help of the money received from stolen minerals and the extracted human organs of kidnapped civilians. And if anybody wants to silence the problem of illegal organ transplantation in the Balkans, it means that that person is either protecting himself or somebody else from justice or worldwide shame.
The novel The Boy from the Yellow House appeared to demonstrate to the world that we are not the most “genocide prone people in the world”, as they try to portray us. Serbia’s prosecutors need to make public the information about secret burials in the same way they made public the testimony of the protected witness, a former member of the Kosovo Liberation Army, about the heart extraction from a live Serb. This way they can prove the fact of the genocide of the Serbs.

What was the first spanking you ever received as an adult and would you say it was playful? Sexual? A punishment? Oh, sadly, the first spankings I received as an adult were the result of sharing my secret liking for spankings with some very vanilla guy I was dating, who then tried to spank me because he figured I’d like it and it would turn me on. It did turn me on, but being spanked by someone who doesn’t really like doing it and who doesn’t know what he’s doing at all is not as much fun as those of us who crave spankings might dream of.
On the other hand, my first actual spanking by someone who considered himself a Dom for real, and who liked to spank women, was a lovely experience. I don’t think I’ll ever forget it. And the best spanking I ever had – well, really, it was “impact play” was from a Dom at a dungeon. We had been dating and he was really experienced so he’d already spanked me and tied me up and done all kinds of things.
He attached me to a St. Andrews cross. Just my wrists, he left my ankles unfettered. He told me if what he did “hurt more than I expected it to” that I should raise one leg off the ground, to let him know, because in the dungeon he wouldn’t be able to hear my safe word.
He started with a flogger, I remember that, but i couldn’t tell you what else he used on me, just that i slipped into subspace without ever feeling real pain and just soared for a while. The entire room disappeared.
All i was aware of was this amazing sensation of being in my body completely and totally present to the moment, but just focused on me. Nothing else existed other than the feelings i was having. When I came back to earth, he was untying me, and my ass was red and welted, but i had still not felt any real pain.
When i said that to him, “but it never even hurt, Sir,” in tones of amazement, he said, “Of course not, it wasn’t supposed to,” adding “Come on, carry this blanket over here and I’ll wrap you up,” or something like that. He left me just trembling with submissive longings…
Sigh. It was lovely.
Thanks for the question!!

Oh WOW Olivia, Eric and I are always talking about trying St Andrews Cross and we do fantasize about the whole dungeon thing. I’ve never gotten to subspace but what’s fascinating by your post, is we always thought it was because of the level of play. Eric doesn’t want to hurt me and I’m kind of wimpy compared to some of the girls I read about. The fact that you got to subspace without it being extremely painful – where do we sign up?! No. Seriously. Where do we sign up? Eric would love to learn how and I’m in for the experience. Awesome story. Thanks so much for sharing.

Oh that does sound great. I have been to subspace a handful of times- though I DID FEEL pain to get there. Actually, the first time it happened I didn’t know what the heck was going on. Barney thought I was falling asleep. I loved the after effects. The second time it happened I was told by a far more experienced Dom that he suspected I went beyond it, which I didn’t even know was a ‘thing’. I had a horrible, horrible drop that lasted almost a week. I was emotionally flat-lined for days. Apparently my dopamine levels needed to rise again? Again no clue. LOL. See this is what happens boys and girls when you don’t know what subspace is. At the time we were strictly Dd. My head was, who am I kidding, IS a hard nut to crack.
Now that I am more aware of it as is Barney, life is better. LOL.
I have to say I am envious of your experience.

Drat, Willie, I swear I had forgotten about subdrop. Sigh… Right. That can really suck. And it does help when you know to expect it and your partner has some experience helping you with it. I’ve heard people talk about Dom-drop lately too, which makes sense. It is a euphoric experience, so crashing afterwards makes perfect sense for them too.
And yes, for sure pain can take us to subspace – and it is still lovely. I might be a bit envious that your current lifestyle allows for the possibility of it! 🙂

-.The end of the year is a time time to reflect on the past 12 months and plan for the year ahead. In these annual year end lists, we take a look back at some of the best moments within our union in 2014.
This past year was a big year for PSAC members in the Prairies. As a little refresher, here’s a list of the 8 most exciting things (in no particular order) to happen in 2014.
These kids were obviously born to be activists. Here are some of our union’s biggest supporters.
Human rights issues have always been a priority for PSAC members. Here’s a list of 7 feel good human rights stories from the past year.
These dogs show us what it means to be an activist. Take notes.Note: This blog was originally published on my MySpace blog, December 31, 2007.
My website has a feature that allows me to look up the search phrases people use to find me. Not surprisingly, the most common phrase by far is “rowan mcbride.” Over the past year, though, I’ve spotted some really interesting ones. Brand names for drugs and cars (I think that comes from the guestbook I had at the beginning of the year—it was since obliterated by a programming error when I was updating the site), other authors (I list some of my faves on my links and interests pages), as well as broad and random words like “December” or “bar” that always make me wonder how many pages the surfer read through before finding the link to my site in the search engine.
With the year coming to an end, I thought I’d share my favorites of 2007, in no particular order:
v rowan rowan rowan
· gotta love a surfer who’s that excited about my name.
v footsex stories
· Yeah…I’m not even sure what footsex is.
v want me rowan
· now, logically, I know this refers to the story I wrote titled Want Me, but my ego still saw it as a three word love letter.
v anime & muscle growth
· whoever typed this one is a person after my own heart
v gay male erotic short stories I can read now
· there’s a surfer who knows exactly what they want
v muscle yaoi links
· hey, if you wrote this and you found what you were looking for, drop me a line so I can see it too.
v rowan and the book shark
· I don’t know what a “book shark” is, but that does sound like a pretty cool title for a story, and I’m always strapped for those.
v erotic stories about card games
· and I just released an erotic story about a card game! Yes!
v hit me beat me arousal stories
· I’m thinking that’s Michael’s fault. Gaw. Avery’s gonna have to have a long talk with him soon.
v first chest hair
· again, that’s all Michael
v incredible muscle growth stories
· mmm, yeah. That’s a search phrase I’ve been meaning to try out myself.
v mcbride naked
· wow.
There it is. 2007’s been a great year to me, gifting me with new writing opportunities, new friends, and new forms of entertainment (search phrase fishing should be a bonafide game!). There have been some downs, for sure, but it’s hard to remember them as the final minutes tick away and you find yourself with friends and family.
So I wish you a fantastic First Night, and a Happy New Year. Have fun, be safe, and get kissed.

Contact & MapBackground and purpose: Activated Protein C (APC) stimulates multiple cytoprotective pathways via the protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) and promotes anticoagulation. 3K3A-APC was designed for preserved activity at PAR-1 with reduced anticoagulation. This Phase 1 trial characterized pharmacokinetics and anticoagulation effects of 3K3A-APC.
Methods: Subjects (n=64) were randomly assigned to receive 3K3A-APC (n=4) at 6, 30, 90, 180, 360, 540 or 720 µg/kg or placebo (n=6) and were observed for 24 hr. After safety review additional subjects received drug every 12 hr for 5 doses (n=6 per group) at 90, 180, 360, or 540 µg/kg or placebo (n=8) and were observed for 24 hr.
Results: All subjects returned for safety assessments at 72 hours and 15 days. We found few adverse events in all groups. Systolic blood pressure increased in both active and placebo groups. Moderately severe headache, nausea and vomiting were reported in one of two subjects treated with 720 µg/kg so 540 µg/kg was considered the highest tolerated dose. Mean plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose. Clearance ranged from 11,693 ± 807 to 18,701 ± 4,797 mL/hr, volume of distribution ranged from 4,873±828 to 6,971 ± 1,169 mL, and elimination half-life ranged from 0.211 ± 0.097 to 0.294 ± 0.054 hours. Elevations in aPTT were minimal.
Conclusions: 3K3A-APC was well tolerated at multiple doses as high as 540 µg/kg. These results should be confirmed in stroke patients with relevant co-morbidities. Clinical Trial Registration-URL:. Unique identifier: NCT01660230.Sample business plan candy bouquet

So ministry leadership wants people to live for Jesus more passionately and sacrificially through Christ-likeness in obedience to God in the embrace of God’s grace as Christ’s witnesses empowered by the Holy Spirit to proclaim the life-changing message of the cross:
a. More passionately: Living for Jesus implies the relational reality of a continually deepening passion of relationship that occurs through spiritual disciplines such as devotion to prayer, the experience of serving others and the expression of adoration for God.
b. And sacrificially: Living for Jesus also implies emulating the sacrificial purpose and lifestyle of Jesus. So ministry leadership seeks to equip people to live sacrificially through Christ-likeness in obedience to God and in the confident assurance that those who approach God with a sacrificial heart will live in the embrace of God’s grace.
c. As Christ’s witnesses: Passion and sacrifice are essential to the nature of living for Jesus because such a life becomes a witness. Gratefully, people are not left to fend passionately and sacrificially on their own, but are instead empowered by the Holy Spirit to proclaim the life-changing message of the cross to the world.63 Best Italian Quotes Images On Pinterest | Italian Quotes Throughout Black and White Italian Wall Art

Surfers in Hawaii have used coconut oil for centuries to care for their hair and skin, I only started about 4 months ago. As with most amazing discoveries in my life it came from my mother. First in an effort to rehabilitate my hair from over bleaching both inside the hair parlor and outside in the sun teaching surfing lessons all day long. One day I googled ” how to grow your hair” and it said to treat it really well, so I started braiding it and coating it with coconut oil each day before going to teach surfing lessons on the North Shore of Oahu. The results…Amazing my hair is growing super fast, I think because the ends are not splitting. Next my mother suggested that I start using it instead of soap…this may seem a little gross, but coconut oil has amazing antimicrobial properties so why not? The results after only a week my skin is much smoother and way less dry…,I will never go back to soap…It’s like the coconut oil is nourishing my skin. I guess Mom still knows best.In 130 years of gas-powered glory, the automobile industry has produced some stunning and memorable designs. Others… not so much. Today we look at 10 cars dating as far back as 1948 that may have been otherwise just fine, or even excellent, were it not for their repugnant styling.
After the superstar success of Porsche's Cayenne SUV, the German sports car brand turned its attention toward another segment: the four-door sedan. Actually a hatchback, the resulting Panamera tried to nail down the DNA that makes the 911 coupe such an icon, but applied to a larger body with a front-engined layout. While the Panamera just may be the most exciting four-door ever, its misshapen styling and particularly its ugly rear haunch makes it also one of the least attractive.Want to do something to fix your hair loss?

Watch the official video for "A Last Waltz of Gevaudan":It is common knowledge that synthetic motor oil easily outperforms its conventional counterpart. However, most people don’t know which type of synthetic oil is the best one for their car: full synthetic or synthetic blend. We want to clear this confusion here.
We will do this by discussing the two types of synthetic oil and what each type offers to your vehicle. The discussion on the types of synthetic oil will be followed by the steps you need to follow when choosing the right type of synthetic oil for your car. Let’s begin.
The Types of Synthetic Oil
Before we start the discussion on the types of synthetic oil, you should know some facts about it. Synthetic oil is manufactured in the lab and comprises of artificially produced chemical compounds; a break down followed by the rebuilding of petroleum molecules is what produces these compounds.
The motor oil produced through this process has far fewer impurities than its conventional counterpart. Moreover, it is less likely to breakdown and cause problems at higher temperatures. Most importantly, it provides you with higher mileage than conventional oil. We can now discuss the two types of synthetic oil.
Synthetic Blend Oil
A combination of synthetic base stocks and conventional motor oils, synthetic blend oil has great low-temperature properties, and it offers excellent resistance to oxidation. Moreover, the synthetic base stock in the oil ensures greater protection and performance of your car than conventional motor oil.
Overall, synthetic blend oil has many benefits that can prolong the life of your vehicle’s engine while improving its performance. An advantage that synthetic blend oil has over synthetic motor oil is its price. The former costs considerably less than synthetic motor oil and thus is the preferred choice for many car owners today. Synthetic blend oil offers most of the benefits offered by fully synthetic motor oil, such as Motul synthetic engine oil, but at a much lower cost.
Full Synthetic Oil
A combination of synthetic base stock and several additives in full synthetic motor oil help to ensure great performance and protection of your car’s engine. For this reason, full synthetic oil is used more frequently than conventional or synthetic blend oil.
The high efficiency of some full synthetic motor oils allows engines today to tolerate higher temperatures and perform much better under extreme conditions than what was possible a few decades ago.
Full synthetic motor oils offer far more benefits for your car’s engine than conventional or synthetic blend motor oils. However, all full synthetic oils are not the same. While most top brands of full synthetic oils, including Motul synthetic engine oil, feature a combination of high-performing additives and fluids, the protection levels and attributes offered by each brand depend on how these formulations come together.
How to Pick the Right Type of Synthetic Oil
With the two types of synthetic oil discussed, it is time to look at the factors you need to consider to choose the right kind of synthetic oil for your car.
Consider Price
The first consideration for choosing the right type of synthetic oil for your car is its price. As mentioned before, full synthetic motor oils cost far more than synthetic blends. On average, the price of synthetic motor oil is about thirty percent more than synthetic blend oil. Even the increased life span of the car’s engine that full synthetic motor oil enable does not compensate for this. So, when it comes to price, there is one clear winner—synthetic blend oil.
Consider Change Intervals
Conventional motor oil needs to be changed a lot more frequently than full synthetic oil. However, the difference between full synthetic oil and synthetic motor oil in this regard is very small. Still, full synthetic motor oil needs to be changed less frequently than synthetic blend oil and thus wins the battle of change intervals.
Consider Long Term Use
The third and final consideration to choose the right type of synthetic oil for your car is the oil’s long-term use. Trends indicate that full synthetic oils, such as Motul synthetic engine oil, offer much more resistance to thermal breakdown, oil sludge concerns, and oxidation than synthetic blend oil. Therefore, it would be wise to conclude that the chances of your car’s engine staying useful for longer are higher with full synthetic than synthetic blend.
Final Word
We considered three factors for determining which synthetic oil is better for your car. Full synthetic motor oil came out on top in two of these factors, which makes it the winner in the duel between the two types of synthetic oil.

There is quite a bit of difference among the different parties in the House as to how we should respond to the recession. There are those in particularly dire straits, those who do not perhaps have access to the EI system, and those who have fallen between the cracks in various parts of the country. There are increasing numbers of people out there in dire straits, not just single people but there are families. There are men and women with children and dependants.
Maybe we are not grappling too well with that as a federal Parliament. Maybe the provinces are expected to play a role in this as well and municipalities. However, I take the member's question as notice of a huge problem out there and I would not blame my colleagues opposite for all the bad stuff that is out there right now.(216) 661-2626 Hours

The 29th day of May is the anniversary of the restitution of monarchy and in England there are still vendors of oak apples in the streets of our large cities on this day. The custom of wearing the oak apples on the 29th of May since 1660 is not so universal in the east as in the west of Britain. To-day, how- ever, there will be large quantities worn in England to commemorate the hiding of K'ng Charles II. in the Deri," by old Richard Pendril, at Boscobel, Worcestershire. Leision Ap Morgan. There is in the British Museum a seal of Leision ap Morgan,who was dispossessed of his property in Glamorgan by Gilbert de Clare, and imprisoned at Cardiff Castle. The Earl of Clare took a number of castles, which were taken over by King Edward I. about the year 1260, on the quarrel, or rather flight of Gil- bert from Rhys ap Morgan, a Son or brother of Leision above mentioned. Gilbert fled for his life before the men of Rhys and Glamorgan, and the King came down into Morganwg to heal the breaeh-a truce which was not favour able to the Earl. The King held his chancery at Llantrisant (the castle had beenassaulted and the garrison fled), and in the inquisition held on the occa- sion the lordship of Glyn Rhondda was awarded to Morgan, the son of Cadwallon, Walter de Hackluyt, who was appointed custodian of the castle, was commanded by the King to finish the erection of the western gate (which had been begun, and which bad been demolished by the assault of Rhys ap Morgan and "Gwyry Gwt "—or as they are best known, Gwyr y Gloren. How the people of Ystradyfodwg got this name is undoubtedly, not as the old legend in- forms us, that when a certain number of the young men were rot one time catching some Welsh mountain ponies on the mountain, and that on the brink of one of the big cliffs over- hanging the valley, one of the young men caught his pony by the tail as he was falling over the precipice. The pony went, but the 'tail remained in the hands of the stalwart i.Rhonddaite. and since that occurence they are known in Glamorgan by this familiar name. But how the people ofYstradyfodwg got this name is due to the fact that their name appears alphabetically last in the list of fight- ing men. Ther~ are such lists to be met with i in the record office, and in war-time the Ystrad men's names would appear and be called last on the list for the division—Aber- d&re, Llantrisant, Llantwit Faerdref, Pen- 4 tyrch, Ystradyfodwg. And from this eircum- • stance, I think, they came to be called Gwyri y Gloran," or the tail end of the wnr list—the i last called. They were the reserved men, and, f- if last called, were nevertheless prominent under the banner of Y Ddraig Goch.v Llywelyn Ein Llyw Olaf's Letters. The epistolarium of John of Peckham gives copies of numerous letters from and to Llew- elyn also states the contents of the letters j. found on Llewelyn's body when he was slain r by the Mortimers at Builth. There are also numerous petitions and complaints by the Welsh to the Archbishop of the insults and robberies committed upon them by the barons and English officials of the churches and mon- asteries. The letters to and from Llewelyn would fill a small volume. John of Peckham was in Wales acting as a kind of mediator be- tween Llewelyn and the English king (Edward Pendaulwyn. This place-name has been variously spelt— Pen-dau-lwvri (the head of the two bushes), Pendwylan, Pendoylan, &c., but the present Welsh pronunciation of the word bears the nearest approach to its origin, which Welsh tradition states to have been as follows— In the days of early Christianity in Glam- organ, and long before the advent of the pagan Saxon— "Addolwyr Thor ag Odyn gau," three of the first pioneers of the Gospel of our blessed Saviour, Tathan Dunawd and Cattwg Ddoeth. the last-named was of Hancarfan, had met and preached the Gospel at the newly founded churches of Llanddunwyd, Welsh St. Donat's, which is situated on Mynydd y Glew, near Hensol. They had in view the erection of another church, and in fixing upon the exact spot of building they yoked two oxen together and agreed that wherever the oxen stayed of their own accord, there, would the Christian church be erected. The f&ce3 of the oxen were turned to the east, to the rising sun, and upon following the ychain they were found grazing, contentedly, on an elevated spot between two groves of trees. Pen y ddau Iwyn Here then was this church founded. The oxen had strayed about a mile due west. The situation of the church fully bears out this old Welsh tradition, and there is more in ancient Welsh tradition oftentimes tha.n there is in new fangled history. Herwiry. In a wood to the west of the greater pond at Hensol is,'and has been for centuries, a -heronry —one of the few places, it is said, in England and Wales where these birds make their nest, and lay their eggs. The female heron (y garen grychydd) sits very close on her two eggs, which are of an olive green colour, and almost as large as a goose egg. The bird, who has very long legs, thrusts them down through two open apertures in the nest when sitting. J have known some to have climbed up the large oak trees at the Hensol, and tied the heron's legs together with their boot-laces beforfe trying to take the eggs away. This was dangerous work, for to approach the old garen grychydd was no mean job, as she is always on the alert, and with her sharp beak, like a two-edged sword, would run it through the fleshy part of & boy's arm. It was usual, I am informed by an expert at this work at one time, when near the nest of the crychydd," to beat the tree with a stout stick after securing the bird's legs with a pair of strong leathern laces, when the poor bird in trying to flyaway usually carried away the nest with her the nest, although light, being composed of many crossed sticks, and about the Circumference of a round table (bord gron), usually came to the ground with the fluttering grychydd entangled therein, when the bird easily became the prey of the inischievious urchins. The expert in question makes this confession, which is rather pathetic — I would not be so cruel as to do this kind of thing now, even if I could climb the old oaks but boys will ever be boys, I suppose." This kind of work could not be attempted now at Hensol, with the vigilance of the many keepers.
A BRIDGEND BEAR GARDEN. -L- Hot Discussion at the Board of Guardians. There was a lively discussion at the meeting of the Bridgend and Cowbridge Board of Guardians on Saturday over a proposed in- crease in the salary of Mr R. H. Cox. clerk to the Board. Mr T. C. Jones presided. Mr D. H. Price moved that the clerk's salary be increased from £170 to JE190 per annum. He remarked that Mr Co x had now completed 25 years' service, and four years ago had consented to a reduction of £30 in his salary on the appointment of a deputy clerk to assist him. Mr J. Canniff moved that the increase be £30, but this was lost. Mr Edward Edwards, Ogmore Vale, moved that the matter be referred to the General Purposes Committee, and that information be obtained as tf6 the clerk's total income from public sources. The Rev. D. G. Rees seconded, and this amendment was discussed at length. The Rev. Eynon Lewis, opposing the amend- ment, said that what the Board had to con- eider was not the clerk's total income but his value to the Board. t The amendment was lost. Mr Edward Edwards proposed, as a further amendment, that the increase be £10 instead of £20. He understood that Mr Cox's total income from public sources Was over £400, and that was fair remuneration. He complained that while some^guardians made a great deal of fuss about spending the ratepayers'money when it was a matter of 6d in out-relief to the podr, they were only too ready to vote a jE20 a year increase to an official. This was rank hypocrisy. (Dissent.) The Hev. Eynon Lewis said that if the members responsible for the great increase in out-relief were consistent with themselves they Would not vote for a mere £10 increase, but to double the salary. (Laughter.) At this point matters became uproarious, and Mr Canniff asked whether the board room was to be made a bear garden. The Rev. Eynon Lewis said he did not want to take up the time of the Board, but the rotten arguments used against the in- crease tempted him to speak. There were cries of Vote." Mr Edward Edwards I object to be choked down. Mr Nicholl There are some people who never know when they are beaten, and cannot take a licking. The amendment was lost. A division was challenged, and amidst a good deal of disorder the names of the guardians voting were taken. The amendment, was declared lost by 19 votes to 11, and the motion fur au increase of Jb20 was carried. -c-J.

MEETINGS AT CARDIFF. YOUNG WOMEPTDISTURBERS. Speakers Refused a Hearing. The votes-for-women campaign was con- tinued in Cardiff on Monday night, when a meeting under the auspices of the Women's Social and Political Union was held at the Secondary Schools, Howard Gardens. Special precautions were taken by the police to guard against disorder, but the disturbance came from quite an unexpected quarter. The police were conspicuously stationed at various points. Chief-Inspector Rankin was present, and every grade of the force from superintendent, in- cluding detectives, both plain clothes and uniform, was represented. Only ladies were admitted to the meeting. The attendance was made up for the most part of girls of about 16 or 17 years of age. Miss L. Gillett presided, and the speakers were Miss Keegan and Miss Crocker. Miss Gillett, in her opening remarks, referred to the proposed visit of the King to the Czar of Russia, and alluding to the treatment meted out to workers for freedom in Russia, said if she had an opportunity to shake hands with the Czar she would decline, as his hands were too red. Her remarks were greeted with ironical ap- plause and laughter by a section of the audi- ence. Subsequently Miss Keegan mounted a chair and submitted a resolution calling upon the Government to give a definite pledge this Session to bring in a Bill for the enfranchise- ment of women. She had not uttered many words before it was evident that a number of those present refused to take her seriously. There was a Continuous Ripple of Laughter while Miss Keegan stated that during Chartist days 400 men went to prison for the vote. Recently 300 women had suffered imprison- ment for the cause, but she did not think many, more would have to go before they got what they wanted. The interruptions became so pronounced that Miss Gillett observed with some asperity, If Cardiff women forget themselves it will be the first time that I have known of it. At the close anyone will lie permitted to ask a question, and will be civilly answered, but I must aek you to keep quiet and listen to the speakers." Mrs Reed seconded the resolution, but her observations were drowned by the stamping-of feet. Mjss Crocker rose to support the resolution, and said she thought her hearers hardly appre- ciated the importance of the question of votes for women. It was first and foremost one of bread and butter. Anyone who laughed, she remarked, was greatly to be pitied. All that could then be heard above the stamping of feet was, I maintain that if there i3 any- one Miss Crocker could get no further. There was stamping of feet, and one-half the audience were laughing or carrying on conversation with each other, while the noise was increased by girls entering or leaving the lecture-room. Miss Gillett strenuously appealed for order. She said, "If there are any who don't want to listen, and find the arguments Too Advanced for Their Brains, and have not the decency to behave respect- ably, they can leave. I should iike to point out that the suffragettes have never yet dis- turbed a meeting in Cardiff, and goodness knows what will happen if they begin." (Laughter ) Miss Crocker assayed again to obtain a hearing, but the disturbance was too great. Again the chairman (Miss Gillett ) rose and remarked, I think there is' an organised at- tempt to stop the meeting bv some very silly and empty-headed girls who think they will imitate the empty-beaded boys who can't combat the arguments of intelligent women." These remarks acted more as an irritant than as an emollient, and the cries from the front row of Chuck them out were lost amidst the shrill notes of defiance from the rear. Miss Crocker ejaculated, This opposition is a great compliment to our cause. Opposi- tion is a sign of growth and progress." (Ap plause.) She then proceeded to speak about the great demonstration in Hyde Park next month, and remarked, I believe the women of Cardiff know what is good for them." Rather," was the response, followed by Derisive Shouts. The din was quite deafening. Babies in arms were screaming, girls were whistling, and feet were hammering on the boards. One or two in the front of the hall stood up and faced the opposition and were promptly told to sit down. Miss Gillett appeared quite distracted, while Miss Keegan wore a severe and disgusted look. I didn't think Cardiff girls capable of such rude and unbecoming behaviour," said Miss Gillett. Very pluckily, Miss Crocker resumed her address during a lull in the disturbance, and referred to the Hyde Park demonstration. Now, are you going to be represented there ? she asked. No," was the rejoinder from half-a-dozen. While Miss Crocker continued to speak on the conditions under which women were com- spelled to work, saying that slavery was with them, Mrs Keating Hill got up from the front row and marched up the steps with a very defiant look on her face. For some moments she fixed a withering glance upon the offen- ders, but all to no purpose. She was utterly disregarded, and soon Had to Sit Down. Miss Crocker strove valiantly to make her- self heard, her remarks being punctuated with ironical cheering and shouts of "Go it." Meanwhile, a couple of male teachers at the secondary school and a police officer entered the room at the back of the hall, and were saluted with cheers. One of the former, the brother of Miss Gillett, endeavoured to quell the disturbance. The interruptions ceased for a moment, but broke out again as bad as ever. Miss Crocker, after a consultation with the presiding lady, finished her address, after which Miss Gillett observed that they had now arrived at the most interesting period—ques- tion time and, she added; While you are thinking about them we will take the collec- tion." Oh," was the exclamation. Miss Gillett appealed for questions, but none were asked,and mounting a chair she held up two sheets of blank paper showing, as she said, the state of mind of the interrupters. Amidst disorder she put the resolution and triumphantly declared it carried by a large majority. Immediately shouts of disapproval followed, during when Miss Gillett said the meeting is now closed." Itwas several minutes before the hall was cleared, some of the in- terruptors continuing to laugh and applaud ironically as if pleased with the success of their own efforts to create a disturbance. Outside the School there was a fairly large crowd of youths, but they rushed off along Moira-terrace thinking the speakers had gone that way. Meantime Miss Keegan and Miss Crocker, with the police in close attendance, proceeded to New- port-road and boarded a tramcar for town.
SUFFRAGETTES AND LAUNDRY SUFFRAGETTES AND LAUNDRY MAIDS. 'Mid-day Meeting at Cardiff. During the dinner hour on Monday the Misses Keegan and Crceker, suffragettes, made an effort to enlist the sympathy of the girls work- ing at the laundry in Minny-street, Cathays. A fairly large crowd assembled, and as soon as the speakers drove up in a brougham they were saluted with shouts of Go home, What's the good of you in Parliament ?" from a couple of youths perched at a window at the back of a Woodville-road house. The laundry girls did not seem to be so much inter- ested in what the speakers had to say, but were rather tickled by the nbvelty of the whole thing. Miss Keegan had not been speaking long before she was told to Go and mend the socks." Later Miss Crocker spoke and in- dulged in so much gesticulation that several onlookers imitated her. One man ventured to make aremark. whereupon the speaker levelled her finger at him, and, with threatening look, said, Now. you keep quiet." Don't you cause a riot," was the retort. For a time Miss Crocker got a good hearing, but the girls sur- rounding the carriage were inclined to ap- plaud too much, and were asked to be a>little lees demonstrative. The speakers took the banter in very good part. Question time was filled up by the singing of Three women to every man," and, after much handshaking with the laundry girls, the Misses Keegan and Crocker drove away.
TRELEWIS MIDNIGHT FIRE. Released Dog Bites Its Rescuer. A fire was discovered about midnight at the grocery premises of Messrs Evans and Hughes, at Trelewis, near Treharris. Smoke was seen coming from the shop, and an alarm was at once given. Lieut. Jones, in charge of the Trclewis district of the Gelligaer Council Fire Brigade, was soon there with the two lengths of hose available, but these proved to be quite useless, as the are hydrant near the premises Was smashed in February, and although reported to the Council had not been re- paired; The hose was too short to reach another hydrant, and the firemen,assisted by P.O. JonM and a number of civilians, car- ried water in buckets. At one time it was feared that the fire would get the upper hand, and a messenger was dis- patched to Treharris Police Station for their hose and reel. P.S. Jones, of Treharris, on reaching Trelewis at 3 a.m., found that the fire had been extinguished. The damage, it is com- puted, will be-over £100, and is covered by in- surance. A shoemaker named Jordan was attempting to force open a door at the rem- of the pre- mises, when a dog jumped at and bit bird very st-verelv on the band. He is being attended to by Dr. Jones, Treharris. -n_

-+- WOMEN'S STREET QUARREL LIVELY CADOXTON SCENE. ¡ A Cadoxton street row led to a couple of cases at Barry Police Court on Monday (before Mr T. P. Thomas and Mr J. J. Neale). Keziab Cridgb, a married woman, of Forster-street, summoned Thomas Fury, of Holmes-street, for indecent assault, and Mary Ann Fury for common assault. On the 9th inst. (com- plainant said) the female defendant challenged I her four times to fight, and at length when she went towards her she was struck and fell. They were together on the ground when the male defendant came out and caught her by the back of the neck, pressed her down, put his knee on her shoulder, and with the left hand tried to raise her clothing. She cried out, That's enough of that." Mr Harold Lloyd (for the defence): Wereyou not keeping the whole street in an uproar, and acting like beasts, you two women, fighting on the ground, one on top of the other ? Complainant: Certainly not. Mr Lloyd Then were you behaving like a lady ? Complainant (haughtily): I am a lady, Mr Lloyd. (Laughter.) Were you not kicking about, and did not this man, Thomas Fury, take hold of your legs to stop you ?—Certainly not. Rhosina Wheeler said that Tom Fury cried out, Mary Ann, where's your knuckle- dusters ? Have another round." (Laughter.) Sergeant Davies said he saw complainant shortly after the' occurrence, and found her then very much under the influence of drink. She made no complaint of having been inde- cently assaulted. The charge of indecent assault was dismissed, and in the case of assault against Mary Ann Fury defendant became very demonstrative in court, and asked complainant, Didn't you make a ring in Forster-street, stand in the middle and say, Come up here,' and I said, No, come down here.' As two witnesses were giving evidence they described defendant as Mary Ann," and were greeted with, Mrs Fury, please, and less of your Mary Ann." (Laughter.) Witnesses for the defence could not say who struck the first blow, but they declared that Mrs Cridge issued a challenge, and then the fight began. The Bench imposed a fine of 20s and costs, or 21 days' imprisonment with hard labour. As she heard this, defendant cried out, "Pay for challenge Not likely. I'll watch it," and with that she walked with a jaunty air towards the cell passage.
AMMAN BOY WANDERER. On Monday afternoon the party organised to search for the missing boy, Evan Phillips, aged 12, son of Mrs Phillips, Gwndwnmawr, Glanamman, arrived with him at Carmarthen and took him home by the 4.35 p.m. Llandilo train. The lad is in good health and had been found at the house of his aunt, Glaneiron, to which he was traced on Friday. On Saturday it appears his aunt gave him money to get home by train, but when he reached Carmarthen he returned to Llan- pumpsaint on foot, and as his widowed mother saw nothing of him on Saturday and Sunday, she and her friends became extremely anxious, seeing that the lad ""aU not been seen at Glynamman since Thursday, when he was sent to school as usual. In order to allay the anxiety occasioned p. number of young fellows scoured the country around some of them went over the hiUs on foot, and the majority cycled along the highways and byeways in Conwil and neighbouring districts. The lad, it seems, returned to Llanpumpsaint late on Saturday night in a deplorable condi- tion. His feet were very much blistered, and the child, being exhausted, took refuge in his aunt's dog kennel and slept with the animal all night. There his aunt found him on Sundaymorning sound asleep. Whilst Informa- tion of his discovery was being sent to Glan- amman on Monday the search party was still on the, look out. Several of them had charge of him on his arrival at Carmarthen, and before leaving they regaled him with some good things at a cook-shop, thus further displaying their goodheartedness. These sons of toil were quite content trt lose their wages so long as they could restore the missing boy to his mother.
LADS STEAL BICYCLE. AtAheravon on Monday two lads were charged with stealing a bicycle, value £4, the property of Joseph Thomas, Gwyn-street, Taibach, on the morning of the 19th inst. Joseph Thomas (the prosecutor) said he was a platelayer on the Great Western Railway, and the bicycle was stolen from the place where he was work- ing. P-C. Phillfps deposed to receiving the prisoners into custody. In reply to the charge, they said they found the cycle in the graàS, covered with mud, and took it home. Prisoners were bound over under the Probation Act for six months.

-¡;, BARRY COMPANY'S SECRETARY. Mr Main's Retirement. Mr W. Mein, who has been secretary of the' Barry Railway Company from its very early hours, will BhortlJMWtire from that position, and it is believed he' will be superannuated. The company are already advertising for a successor, but the date of the retirement has not yet been fixed. Mr Mein, who is 72 years of age, is one of the most respected officials in the service of the company. He is of Scotch parentage, and entered the service of the Barry Railway Company shortly after the line was opened, first as assistant-secretary and. in 1894, when Mr G. C. Downing, of Messrs Downing All. NV. MEIN. and Handcock, relinquished the post of secre. tary, Mr Mein was appointed as his successor. This position he has now filled for many years with unfailing tact and great efficiency, his kindly disposition and keen bnsiness aptitude securing for him the respect and esteem of a large number of people in South Wales com- mrcial circles. For many years, Mr Mein, prior to coming to Barry, was secretary of the Rhymney Railway company, being the imme- diate predecessor of Mr Fairlamb in that position, and his impending retirement is greatly regretted by the other officials and the staff of the company. Mr Mein is of retiring disposition. One of his favourite sources of recreation is walking in the beautiful Vale of Glamorgan.
TRAIN PULLED UP. Scramble on a Cardiff Express. At Hereford City Police Court on Monday ar i John Callaghan, collier, of Carlisle-street, Cardiff, was charged by Frederick Jones, rail- way constable, with being drunk and dis- orderly in the 6.3 Cardiff express, and interfer- ing with the comfort of passengers on May 23rd. The constable said that at Hereford Station the guard of the Cardiff express train drew his attention to a compartment full of sailors, who had been fighting. Defendant was helplessly drunk on the floor, and when assisted out he could not stand on the plat- form, but kicked and tried to throw witness. Assistance had to be obtained to carry him into the waiting-room. Mr Lambert, the station-master, said the guard informed him that the train was pulled up at Llanfihangel, owing to the communication cord being pulled in the scramble. It was al corridor train, and passengers complained of the men's conduct, at which they were terrified. For the safety of the public and the safety of the man himself defendant was remold to the waiting-room. At Mr Lambert's request, the charge was amended to drunk and disorderly at the station. Defendant said be knew nothing about the affair. He had been a teetotaler for 3l years, but having to appear at Caerphilly to answer a summons for having a piece of cigarette in his pocket, he broke out on Saturday, and had too much to drink in Cardiff. The Bench sent him to prison for a month without the option of a fine.
NEWPORT BLAZE. At 4.30,a.m. on Monday « fire was discovrfed at No.76, Commercial-street. Newport, a three- storey brick building occupied by Mr Winired King as a newsagent, tobacconist, and hair- I dresser's shop. The alarm was given by P.C. Drewett and Alfred Harrington, a foreman road sweeper, and the occupants of the ad- joining houses, as well as Mr King, were called up. The fire brigade, in charge of Lieutenant Lyne and Supt. Cottcll,#ere at the spot within a few minutes, but by this time the flames had secured a good hold, the combustible Btock feeding them rapidly. They were, however. prevented by the brigade from spreading. The stock at No. 76, which Mr King values at iE400, was completely destroyed. Mr King says he retired to rest just after midnight, and was awakened by someone kick- ing at his frbnt door. He tried to get out that way, but was prevented by the smoke, and was obliged to escape through tin; back pre- inises of his next-door neighbour. An outbreak of fire WKK reported in the building behind the Wcstgate Chambers, New- port, on Sunday evening. Most of the offices' were locked, and some uneasiness was felt.. Later it was discovered that the volume of smoke was caused by s-ome waste paper which had been left to burn at the back of a mantle l shou-
I "Filled with Shame." WHAT GERMAN VISITORS SAW. We have received the following letter for publication I/etchworth, Herts, May 24th, 1908. Sir,—Last week I took part in the reception of the German burgomasters who visited London on the invitation of the British Muni- cipal Society. My vanity as an Englishman was gratified by their admira.tion of our in- stitutions and their sympathetic interest in our social achievements, but there was one slight shown to them which filled me with shame. They were taken to the Hugh Middle- ton Higher Elementary School of the London County Council in Clerkenwell. The buildings, the equipment, the teaching staff, and the attainments in drill and singing excited the warm approbation of our visitors but the physical condition of the children, and especially of the girls, was so deplorable that some of the visitors spoke to me about it of their own accord in terms of pity and regret. The children were pale, hungry-looking, and uncared for. I could not help contrasting the sight with that which I had seen at a school Un the poorest quarter of Berlin three years ago. A Lancashire municipal councillor, who was a practising doctor, stood with me at the door as the children streamed out, and we failed to mark a single child that could be pronounced to be really in bad condition. At Clerkenwell you had to search the ranks carefully for the few who looked at all passable. I wondered if the members of the London Countv Council who were present shared my feeling of shame. Two Acts have been reeently passed for the benefit of neglected children in elementary schools. The one is permissive, giving to education authorities power to feed starving children, and charge the cost on their parents. The other is compulsory, requiring the authority to medically examine every child coming into the school after January 1st, 1908. The poor little half-starved children in the Hugh Middleton School have not, however, enjoyed any benefit from either Act.-I am, etc., JOHN E. GORST."
FINANCE COMMITTEE. Local Consols. At the meeting of the Finance Committee of the Cardiff Corporation on Monday (Alderman F.J. Beavan presiding), the City Treasurer (Mr Allcock) reported that in accordance with a resolution passed by the committee, he had sold £ 34,426 nominal value 2J per Cent. Con- sols at 86 13-32, for settletnent on 1st June. The cash realised was £29,746, and, after deducting commission, there was a net sum left of £ 29,703, resulting in a loss to the Corporation ot *1,041. ReptyiiMf to a question, he stated that this sale of Consols would not provide them with all the money they wanted by £ 60,000. Councillor H. C. Vivian suggested in that case they should sell another B.30,000 Con- sols if they could get 861, especially as they had X120,600 invested. The Chairman observed that he would rather wait a little, and see if Consols jumped. In any case, he would much rather leave the decision to the Council. It was agreed to defer the question and call another meeting of the committee before mak- ing a recommendation to the Council, if neces- sary. sary. Rumney Bridge. The Committee, at the request of the Public Works Committee, agreed to reconimend the Council to apply to the Local Government Board for sanction to borrow jE3,661, being the city's share of the cost of re-constructing the Rumney bridge. The other share will be borne by the county of Monmouth, an agreement having been arrived to in the matter. Official Complimented. The City Treasurer reported that he had been in communication with the Surveyor of Taxes regarding the amount due from the accounts of the Corporation to the Inland Revenue* in respect of tax on dividends on stock, interest on loans, and profits from trading undertak- ings. There had been no settlement of the matter since 1899, but as the result of his claims, he had been able to effect a cash s iving to the Corporation of jE742 15s. Also, in the tramways and electric lighting departments. substantial reductions had been made by reason of deductions on amount of deprecia- tion. The Chairman (Aid. Beavan) thought the report was very creditable to the City Treasurer, and Councillor Vivian concurred. It was agreed the. report should be printed in full on the minutes. Lord Bute's Reply. The Committee received a letter from Lord Bute in reply to the deputation which waited upon him last week with a view to securing a contribution towards the improvement of the Monthermer-road bridge. His lordship stated he had inspected the brdge, and whilst he agreed that what was proposed to be done would be a public benefit, he regretted his in- ability to agree to contribute towards the cost. The Chairman (Aid. F. J. Beavan) added that when they interviewed Lord Bute, the line his lordship took was that aaoneof the, if not the, largest ratepayers in Cardiff, he would be pay- ing his full share towards the cost of the im- provement. It was stated that the money was in hand, and the committee agreed to recom- mend the council that they saw no reason why the work should not be proceeded with. The total estimated cost is jE2,300, towards which the Rhymney Railway Company has agreed to contribute if".
PARKS COMMITTEE. Roath Lake Dressing Boxes. The Cardiff Parks Committee on Monday decided that a charge of one penny per bather be made for users of the dressing box|s to be erected at Roath Park. Ticket hold<V"S only are to be permitted to use the stage, Itut free bathing will be allowed from a reserved Space near the stage. Appointments. Mr W. J. Martin, Plymouth, was appointed art master at Howard Gardens Secondary Boys' School at a salary of f,135 per annum. Two candidates for the post of senior mathe- matical mistress for the Howard Gardens Municipal Secondary Girls' School appeared before the committee. Miss L. Glanville, B.A., of Belfast, was appointed.
LLANDAFF MAN'S NEGLEOT. A Four Months' Sentence. One of the worst cases that you could pos- sibly imagine, was the way in which Mr D. W. Evans (Messrs George David and Evans) described a cafie at HandafF on Monday when, on behalf of the N.S.P.C.C.. he prosecuted Ernest Owen, of Llandaff North, for neglect- ing his three young children. 1_ air i'iVaus expiameu in at- ueieimam, was lazy and left his work on the Taff Vale Railway, the children had to be fed by the guardians, while the wife in the eight years of hermarricd life had been nine times in the workhouse, the furniture had to be sold for food, and ift the end defendant, taking the two eldest, children with him, left his wife in an absolutely empty house with a youug baby, without fire, food, or even a seat. Prisoner said that" as a collier of 16 years standing he did not think that he ought to work for £1 a week. Characterising him as a bad and disgrace- ful husband" the magistrate passed a sentence of four months' hard labour.
A wedding was celebrated at Clyne Castle Chapel, near Swansea, the nuptials of Miss Hilda Down, eldest daughter of Mr John R. Down, metal merchant, of Belmont, Black- pool, and Mr Allan Young, second son of the late Mr J. Stow Young, of Penang, Strait# Settlements. The bride who was given away by her father, was attired in a picturesque robe of ivory Liberty satin, and she was attended by Miss Mabel Down (sister). Miss Jessie Young (sister of the brid•••groom), and Miss Enid Down and Miss Dorothy Falconer (cousins). Mr J. Slow Young was the best man. The officiating clergy were the Rev. the Hon. Talbot Rice (vicar of Swansea), and the Rev. Harold Williams. The church was eautifully decorated with roses.
Eastern Valleys Free Church Council. REVIVAL REACTION PROBLEM; Close Communion Controversy. The annual meeting of the Eastern Valleys Free Church Council was held at Abersychan on Monday' the chair being occupied by the Rev. D. Phillips, Pontnewynydd. the retiring president. Sahsfactory reports wcre prp. sented by the Rev. E. Owen, B.A., secretary, andRev. J. James, financial secretary. Mra W. P. James, Abersychan, submitted an interesting report on the work of the Rix branches of the Free Church Girls' Guild which had been formed in the district. The branch at Garn- diffaith had 80 members. These guilds, it was stated, were doing excellent work, building up the character of the future women and mothers of the nation Officers were elected as follow :—President, Rev. W. II. Colbeck. Pontypool vice-presi- dents, Rev. J.G. Watts, Pontnewynydd Rev. J. Goldtborpc, Pontypool and Mr W. Hales, Pontypool financial secretary, Rev. Jenkyn James, Grimthatown treasurer, Mr H. iI. Pratt, Pontypool; temperance secretary, Mr A. Jones, A hersychlln; secretary, Rev. E. Owen, B.A., Pontypool. The Rev. J. Goldthorpc proposed a resolu- tion expressing gratitude to the Government for the Licensing Bill, but regretting that grocers' licences were not to be abolished and that the clauses relating to children were not prohibitive. Mr Goidthorpc said the greatest success of the measure was illustrated in the re-union of the churches, and the focussing of the moral energy of the community upon the accomplishment of a great reform. The resolu- tion was unanimously agreed to. A resolution, proposed by Mr G. Jenki ns J.P., Abersychan, approving of the main pro- visions of the Education Bill, was also unani- mously passed. Spiritual Poverty. A report from the Abersychan centre stated that during the year mission work had been carried on, but the numerical results, notwith- standing elaborate preparations, were not successful Unfortunately, this district shared with many others a reaction from the revival, and the spiritual poverty felt to day was largely due to the lack of good nursing of the converts. Close Communion Question. Discussion took place upon the question of close communion. The matter arose out of a report from the Pontnewynydd centre, which stated that on Christmas Day a united com- munion service was held, conducted by the Rev. J. G. Watts (Baptist) and the Rev. D. Phillips (Congregational), members of all the churches being present. A similar service was held on Good Friday, when the Rev. J. Gold- thorpe (P.M). officiated. The Rev. W. Maurice, Talywain (Baptist) said that as a close communionist he was bound to refer to this matter. It was a burning question in Wales, and had caused the Welsh Baptists to stand aloof from the Free Church Council. They had been protesting in Wales against the bogey that it was only a mere name, and he was sorry that it had cropped up here. He would have to attend the forth- coming meetings of the Baptist Union of Wales, and he could not then say that this question of communion had not been discussed at the Free Church Council. In order not to be inconsistent with his principles, he would have to withdraw from the Council. The Rev. J. D. Rees, Pontryhdyrun, said that afl a Council they had always left this question out of their deliberations. At the same time, he did not think they had any jurisdiction over the Pontnewynydd people. The Rev. D. Phillips, Pontnewynydd, said thsse united services were held independently of the Free Church Council. The various churches combined in order to hold a. service in those days. The Rev. A. O. Hopkins, Abersychan, pro- posed that this portion of the report be deleted, but on a division the motion was lost by 11 votes to 10. The Rev. W. Maurice afterwards stated that the only course now open to him was to resign from the Council, and he was very sorry to do so.

> MISSING DEED OF GIFT. Llandilo Will Suit. Before Mr Justice Neville in the Chancery Division on Monday the action of in re Williams, deceased, Richards v. Williams, came on for hearing. Mr Ashton, K.C. (instructed by Mr C. E. Morris, Carmarthen), was for plaintiff, and Mr Jenkins, K.C. (instructed by Mi Claud R. Davies, Llandilo), for defendant. Mr Awhttm vtated the litigation was com- 'mcnccd' in the Probate Court, then went to the King's Bench, and now came to Chanccry. The plaintiff, Mrs Hannah Richards, was the only child of the administratrix of David Thomas Williams, and the defendant was the widow and executrix of John Williams. David Thomas Williams, the father of the plaintiff, left Wales and went to America. From time to time he sent to his brother in Wales cer- tain money to be invested. In 1895 John made a deed of gift in favour of David of certain estates which he had in his own name, but which it was contended represented the money his brother had sent home for invest- ment. In 1897 David died in America, and in May, 1898, plaintiff came to England at her uncle's request and kept house for him for several years without payment. He made a will leaving her the whole of his property. When she came from America she brought with her between JE300 and £400, and that was invested in the bank with money of her uncle's, in their joint names. In 1902 it was with- drawn and invested in a mortgage, the total amount being £1,700, of which £1,300 was found by the uncle. In 1901 the plaintiff executed an agreement under which her uncle took the interest in the £1,700 during his life. The mortgage was in the plaintiff's name, and in September, 1904, the mortgage was made over by her to him, he giving her his note of hand for the JE400 she had contributed. In October of that year he paid off the £400, and pressed his niece to give him a general release in respect of all claims she might have, but this she declined to do. They quarrelled partly over that and partly over the fact that she had married. She left his house, and his wife, who had been separated from him for many years, returned to the house. Then he made a new will leaving her JE50 in consideration of her services during the time she was his house- keeper. In October, 1905, J ohn Williams died and plaintiff commenced the action in the King's Bench Division, and obtained judgment for two sums which had been sent from Aiherica by her father to John Williams. No account, as asked for. was rendered. Mr Jenkins said the judgment in the law action was a complete bar to the relief sought in this case, except in regard to the alleged deed of gift, which was not forthcoming. There was no evidence as to the money received. His Lordship; Am I to understand that this is an action for ejectment ? Mr Ashton said that was so. The ejectment would necessarily follow on proving the deed of gift. Evidence a3 to the deed of gift was then given, the principal witness being Mr J. R. Nicholas, clerk of the peace for Carmarthen, a member of the County Council, etc. Other witnesses were called, who said that John Williams told them he had burnt the deed of gift, but had provided for his niece in his will. The deed of gift to his niece comprised the farm of Pantyhedw, which John Williams afterwards sold. The plaintiff was the last witness, and she said she had been paid the amount of the judgment and costs in the King's Bench action—over £)00. In reply to his Lordship, Mr Jenkins said he relied on the Statute of Limitations, and that was an absolute bar to the plaintiff's case. His Lordship thought there was sufficient evidence to show that the deed of gift had been duly executed. The real difficulty in the plaintiff's way was the Statute of Limitations. He thought that at the time of the brother's death John had no intention of doing anything wrong. It was only after his brother's death that he got it into his head to get rid of the deed of gift. There was no doubt John Williams gave instructions for the deed to be drawn up, and paid £2 for the stamp, but no stamp was ob- tained. Then, was there such fraud as to render the deed null and void ? It seemed to him that the non-disclosure and concealment of the deed from his brother was really concealed fraud, and fraud by which the plaintiff was deprived pf property. She must have the benefit of the unsold property and her costs in regard to that, but as for the sold property and the claim for statement of accounts, the defendant would succeed. Mr Jenkins said that really meant that the plaintiff succeeded in regard to the property in the statement of claim. Mr Ashton All the unsold property ? His Lordship I do not go as far as that. I have given my judgment.
SWANSEA FORESHORE RIGHTS. Speaking at the annual court leet of the Duke^ of Beaufort on Monday, Sir Griffith Thomas said a good deal was made of the rights to the foreshore, and ho hoped that some agreement would be come to between the Corporation, the Harbour Trust, the London and North-Western Railway Co., and the Duke of Beaufort by which access could begot to the most- beautiful sands in the neighbour- hood of Swansea. He regretted that these rights might to some extent have been lost to the public, and he hoped that by an agreement all parties interested would be got together. Sir Griffith said he would venture to prophesy that future generations would see great works established in the immediate neighourhood of the new dock which would be a gn at benefit to the town.
On Saturday morning Alf Sandy (61), living at West View-terrace, Steelworks, Ebbw Vale, was knocked down at the steelworks by a loco- motive attached to some waggons, being run over and terribly mutilated. Death ensued a short time afterwards.

A LONDON WELSH CHURCH. A very interesting and somewhat lengfttf account of the Church ot St. Benet (i.e., Bene- diet in an abbreviated form: Bene't), Paul's Wharf, London. appears in a recent number of The Organist and Choirmaster and which church has, since the year 1876' been given over to a Welsh congregation whose services are in conformity with thoeB of the Church of England." The building stands, as we read, on Bennett's Hill, having its south front in Upper Thames-street opp°" site Paul's Wharf: and placed in an iso- lated position on a slope leading down to tbc river side, the church is seen to from the higher ground of Queen Victoria" street. The old church is mentioned as far back as 1180 but the ancient building was destroyed in the great fire, and the chutcb was rebuilt in 1683 by Sir Christopher WreB» at a coat of over t:3,OOO. It is of interest to Welshmen that Inigo Jones was buried in the old church in 1652 a costly monument 01 white marble bearing a Latin inscription beiog erected to his memory on one of the walls and the writer in the" Organist and Choir- master ventures to express the very com- mendable opinion that it would have been to the credit of Sir Christopher Wren placed a fresh monument to his brother-arcb1- tect (and mason) in the New St. Benet." It is also of interest to the musical reader to find that E. J. Hopkins, afterwards organise of the Temple Church, sang the soprano sol° in Handel's Messiah in this church when » boy and that among the eminent men who have filled the post of organist here were George Cooper. Dr. James Higgs,and Sir John Stxliner, M.A., Mus. Doc. The organist from 1897 to 1904 was Mr G Vincent Davies, Mr J. B* Davis, who holds the office at present,^sue* ceeding him, and who has proved himself to b* a capable and an indefatigable worker. Sunday evening, April 12th, the choir, under his guidance, we may add, numbering some 40 voices, gave an excellent rendering 0 Hemory's sacred cantata Prynedigaeth '1 Byd" (sung to the Welsh words), without 8311 assistance from without, the performance o the work being preceded by a short service address. Churches and chapels in Wales taaj make a note of this, and profit by followinft the example. Evidently this church is not ot the Laodicean type, and one can quite accept the closing words of the above notice as beiOi correct and well-deserved, to the effect that the services of this Welsh church are of tbc heartiest description the congregation iJ& large one, and altogether there is far mof spiritual life and much greater religious actiV' ity here at St. Benet's than can be found in tbC great majority of the City churches at the pre- sent time." Good Advice. Good practical advice and very useful infor- mation to the aspiring a.nd ambitious yriuntf t-inger is given in the current number of "HoCie Life," by Mr George Cecil, a gentleman con', nected with the Carl Rosa Company and wbo therefore is in an advantageous position to form an opinion on such a topic, and to offet valuable advice. Particularly should his word" be thoughtfully pondered over by those numer- ous lady vocalists, with burning ambitioB« whose one sure way of reaching the much-de- sired and longed-for goal, as they think, is to take lessons" the practical result for maDJS however, heing grievous disappointment and disenchantment, for an all-wise Creator never endowed them with the qualities essential to the formation of a successful artiste. As a ter of fact, our author says, little wealth apd less fame can honestly be held out as an in- ducement to a girl to neglect the offer of a cer* < ain clerkship for a problematic position iØ the musical world. There is nothing especially new in these views, they have been expressed and presented to the public and those whoDO they more particularly concern many before, and, unfortunately, the sequel^ wiD prove to be just the same in the majority Of instances as in times past. Young ambitioO will go its own way, no matter what the men- tor's warning may be—until dearly-bought personal experience will "teach the lesson sharply. I. Llangollen's Last Minstrel."

. Coco Crisp's walk-off single against Tigers in Game 4 of the 2012 ALDS
(From Ben Ross)
The A's were three outs away from elimination. Trailing Detroit 3-1 in the bottom of the ninth, Oakland needed an improbable rally to force a Game 5 in the 2012 ALDS. And that's exactly what they delivered.
Facing Tigers closer Jose Valverde, Josh Reddick led off the inning with a single to right. Josh Donaldson followed with a double, putting the tying runs in scoring position. Then Seth Smith came through with a 2-run double to tie the game at 3.
But the A's weren't done. Three batters later, with two outs and Smith still on second, Coco Crisp came to the plate with a chance to play the role of hero. Coco ripped a base hit to right, scoring Smith from second, and the A's walked off with a dramatic 4-3 victory to keep their season alive. Detroit would respond to win Game 5, 6-0.

Which @Athletics 50th Anniversary moment was more memorable?
The winning moment will move on to the next matchup.— A's on NBCS (@NBCSAthletics) August 7, 2018Some of you may have wondered why I would give The Brevity of Roses away for two days last week. It was exciting, to be sure. It’s amazing to think that thousands of people can now read it, of course, but that’s not all I expected. I knew the giveaway would increase the book’s visibility on Amazon while it was free, but what about after that period?
I believe Brevity is a good story and its reviews confirm that, but only a limited circle knew about it. People can’t buy a book they don’t know exists. As an independent author, specifically one with no influence or marketing budget, I’ve had a major challenge getting Brevity noticed, so when I heard about the KDP Select program, I had to consider it.
In the first three months after Brevity’s publication, 74% of e-book sales were through Amazon, and that increased to 91% during the last seven months. That fact weighed heavily in my decision because to enroll your e-book in the KDP Select program, you have to remove it from all other distributors. Obviously, for me that restriction was practically a non-factor.
Also, enrollment in the program makes your book available to the Amazon Prime lending library, and each borrow earns the author a percentage of a monthly pool of funds. I would earn less for a loan than for a sales, but far more than zero.
So, did the giveaway give my book more visibility on Amazon? Heck yeah! It rose to #4 on the Kindle contemporary fiction chart. Did the promo result in increased sales after the free period? You betcha! It maintained a rank of #22 in all fiction sales for eighteen hours. It’s also racking up borrows.
From others experience in the KDP Select program, I expect my current sales rank to gradually lower over the next few days, but not return to what it was before the giveaway. As people read Brevity, they’ll tell their friends about it. Some of them will leave reviews at Amazon. Word of mouth will continue to give the book exposure. I deem this experiment a success!

You seem to be on one heck of a roll, my friend! You nailed it with the fantastic cover, then you had the rollercoaster ride of your life (thus far) with the amount of copies you moved. Well done. I’m so very happy for you. You have inspired me to make some changes, although I plan to keep those to myself for a while. But they’re coming!

The ride’s kept going very well in paid sales, Jimmy. I couldn’t be happier. This was a great way to segue into spring.
Well, I know what I hope your secret plan is. 😉
This book was awesome. I can’t wait to read your next book. Great characters and development.
I’m so happy you enjoyed it, DJ, and thank you for letting me know. 😀 I hope you’ll rate it at Amazon.
KDP Select is definitely a good marketing tool. Congrats on your fantastic results!
It may not be for everyone, Cathryn, and it would have worked even better for me if I had other publications, but I’m glad I did it.The Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory is pictured above. (Photo courtesy ORNL)
The American Physical Society on Monday honored the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory as an APS Historic Physics Site.
It’s the first designated APS Historic Physics Site in Tennessee. The APS is one of the world’s top professional societies for scientists.
APS President-elect Laura Greene presented a plaque marking the historical designation of the now-decommissioned physics research facility to kick off the Nuclear Structure 2016 conference and Neutrinos in Nuclear Physics workshop being held this week in Knoxville. ORNL Deputy for Science and Technology Thomas Zacharia accepted the plaque for ORNL.
ORNL is a U.S. Department of Energy laboratory.
“In naming the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility as a Historic Physics Site, the American Physical Society took into consideration the half century of nuclear and atomic physics research performed there, as well as the scores of scientists who performed experiments with its unique capabilities,” Greene said. “The Holifield Facility has indeed been an important contributor to the physical sciences history.” [Read more…]Merritt is the daughter of a US senator. She works for Doctors Without Borders in the trauma team, visiting some of the worst tragedies to provide emergency medical care.
Austen is an Australian rock star. She has a reputation for bedding whomever she wants whenever she wants.
The two first meet when Merritt is in College. They meet when Merritt goes to a signing for Austen and Merritt is one of those that catches Austen’s eye. They have a nice night together but for reasons I won’t get into it, it doesn’t go any further than that. This forms a brief flashback in the book, but it’s the only one, so those that aren’t flashback fans don’t need to worry.
The two meet again in Australia. Austen has returned home for a vacation, but not before she performs an important show for some diplomats. Merritt has decided to vacation in Australia after a particularly difficult spell at work, as her parents are in Australia for her fathers work.
I liked how the authors approached the two meeting again and especially liked how they interwove both MCs friends and acquaintances into this part of the book. The side characters are interesting and provide a little bit of will they, won’t they intrigue, as well as allowing us to get to know the MCs better away from each other. It also serves to help build up chemistry between the two again – something we don’t always see in second chance romances.
I liked the Doctors Without Borders aspects to the storyline. I liked that Merritt was open about how her assignments had made her feel and that she dealt with them in a communicative manner.
There’s a couple of twists in the last quarter of the book that I actually really enjoyed.
I can’t comment as to how the authors styles have combined as this is my first time reading either author, but I wasn’t able to identify any clashing styles or weird jumps on the page, so I’d say they were successful.
All in all this was an interesting read that I think wlw romance fans will enjoy.

The trailer of this drama raises high expectations for the drama coupled with the fact that Director Maruthi who is known for bringing entertainment to the screen of viewers teams up with Sai Tej for the very first time.
Let’s find out how much entertainment we’ll get from this family entertainer.
Story
Raghuramaiah an advanced stage lung cancer patient in his last days wishes for his children to spend time with him before he passes on.
His grandson Sai in his bid to fulfil his grandfather’s last wishes hurriedly comes back to make his grandfather’s last days worthwhile while his children were too busy to come back almost immediately.
According to his grandpa’s wish, Sai was to get married to Angel a tiktok celebrity. What happens when Raghuramaiah’s sons and daughters with their families land in Rajahmundry is something to find out about.
Highlights:
- Entertaining first half
- Family emotions
- Rao Ramesh
Drawback:
- Regular treatment
- Predictability in final portions
- Lack of strong emotional moments
- Inconsistent narration
Analysis
Director Maruthi brings yet another entertainment to the screen of viewers by bringing both Sai Tej and Rao Ramesh who is known for his entertainment to the drama. The characters in this drama were well chosen as they fit the story well and acted their various parts pretty well.
Though it came with the regular storyline, it brought about the importance of family time, especially during their last days. Family emotions and family bonding was also portrayed in this drama as we saw how the grandpa’s poor health condition brought back the whole family together.
The first half of the drama was quite entertaining. With fun and cool moments from both lead roles; the chemistry and the romantic moments between them which was perfect and with them giving to the audience funny TikTok scenes.
The second half’s entertainment was focused more on Rao Ramesh who we can say stole the spotlight there. The cinematography was good too and also the drama was mostly based on Raghuramaiah and Sai and the relationship they share as a grandson trying to fulfill all the wishes of his dying grandfather and making sure that his grandpa dies without regrets.
A few of the drawbacks of this story were the inefficient emotional dialogues and inconsistent narration. Though the end was predictable, there were still a few good highlights like the good music by Thaman, the rich and colorful production values, the really good and neat editing, and of course the presence of Rao Ramesh who brought entertainment to the studio especially in the second half.
Finally, we can say that “Prati Roju Pandaage” is an entertaining movie filled with family emotions and comedy which is quite good for the family.

Selecting a vehicle or truck is really a decision that is big made after plenty of research. Nonetheless, if you are about to borrow cash to purchase your vehicle that is next after you have examined simply how much you need to invest, you ought to learn lenders and their terms because closely as you explore various makes and models.
Get Your Loan Preapproved
Many dealers are desperate to offer funding, however you might get a far better rate—and could drive a far better cost in the car—if you arrived at the negotiating dining dining table with that loan authorized beforehand because of the loan provider of one’s option.
Know Very Well What You Ought To Invest
There is a difference that is big just how much you are authorized to borrow and exactly how much you really need to borrow. Determining this can be because straightforward as once you understand your situation that is financial and goals—and maybe perhaps not breaking your allowance.
While you’re budgeting, give consideration to investing a maximum of 15percent of one’s take-home pay regarding the total cost of purchasing a car.
Keep in mind: a car’s total price of ownership is more compared to the payment that is monthly. It offers your insurance coverage premium, gasoline, upkeep expenses and, in certain situations, parking. Additionally, aspect in any expected modifications to your revenue on the next couple of years, including bonuses and adjustments that are cost-of-living.
Be Mindful With Long-Term Loans
Probably the most essential alternatives you will make is just how many months you will simply just take to cover the loan back. Only a 60-month loan is suggested.
The longer the term associated with the loan, the low the payment per month. That seems great and soon you realize you are going to wind up having to pay more interest as time passes. With an extended term loan, you increase the risk also that sooner or later you are going to owe more cash from the car than it really is well worth.
Your Credit History Things
Just like many kinds of borrowing, your approval to borrow along with your interest rely in component on your own credit rating and history. Bear in mind: When banking institutions or dealers promote low interest, maybe it’s a teaser price which is why only those with all the credit scores that are best can qualify.
Finally, weigh 0% provides with rebates and compare your alternatives to look for the most useful deal. In many situations, you’re going to be best off financially having a cash rebate put against a low-rate offer.
Loan Prices Only Suggest A Great Deal
There is significantly more than prices to take into account. Constantly go through the interest that is total within the lifetime of the mortgage. As your financial obligation may span years that are several it’s also advisable to measure the loan provider’s track record of providing quality solution in creating and servicing your loan.
Your Car Or Truck Is Your Collateral
Car and truck loans generally have actually reduced prices than bank cards because they’re a kind of “secured loan. ” Which means which you pledge your car or truck as security: if you do not continue with your repayments, maybe it’s repossessed.
Be aware of Rolling Additional Charges To Your Loan
Lenders may provide you the choice not to finance the car just’s cost, but additionally taxation, name, license along with other fees. A lowered expense that is cash advance out-of-pocket, nonetheless, comes during the cost of greater monthly premiums and much more investment property on interest. You should think about having to pay 15% to 20per cent as a payment that is down.
You may also be tempted to roll your old debt into your new loan if you owe money on your current car. This could be the concealed maneuver behind a dealer’s offer to “pay down your debts” in your present automobile.
You increase the chances of being “upside down” on your new loan—owing more than it’s worth if you do this. In addition, you establish up for greater interest costs while increasing the probabilities you are going to get into the exact same costly period whenever it comes down time for you expensive automobile.
Consider Your Entire Insurance Options
There is a chance that is good lender will give you more insurance choices, such as for instance credit term life insurance, which takes care of your loan in the event that you die. Make sure to assess your overall insurance requirements in the eventuality of a death or disability and discover the most useful protection for you personally. Look around for any other options before committing.Virgin Mary in Glory - Robert Kampen. 47 x 31 cm
Artists of the Northern Renaissance often painted biblical paintings for wealthy customers or churches. One of these works is before us.
In the foreground, sitting against the red brick wall that separates them from the world, St. Peter and St. Augustine are arguing. On the left is Peter sitting on his bench, with a heavy gold tiara richly inlaid with precious stones on his head. The red-yellow cloak, fastened with a large agraph, soft folds descends to the ground. He is no longer young, his hair and beard turned gray, wrinkles furrowed his forehead, but his dark, lively eyes glow with his mind and wisdom. Despite a slight fatigue, he carefully listens to the interlocutor. In his left hand he holds two keys to the kingdom of heaven.
And to the right, in a blue cloak trimmed with a wide golden border, Augustine sits in a white bishop's robe and a snow-white tiara. He has a haggard, thin face, a narrow long nose, a sharp chin. He reads in a focused book lying on his lap.
A donor (the customer of the picture) is kneeling between them - a middle-aged man with a large bald head, a man dressed in a black cloak and listening to the conversation with admiration.
During the argument, the clouds in the sky diverge to the side, and before them appears the Virgin and Child. Sitting on the bench, she gently looks at Jesus, affectionately holding him. Red hair waves descend on a blue robe, shading the fair skin and emphasizing the soft oval of a young face. The fingers of the right hand give the debaters a sign.
And in the background is a white-stone city, spread out on the hills, written with the smallest details. The wide road, winding, goes beyond the horizon.
And of course, the painter's favorite variety of colors. Juicy red and bright blue, warm orange and noble olive green, white and brown - all of them create an atmosphere of sincere uplift and festive mood.
The artist achieves incredible craftsmanship, conveying the texture of heavy silk fabrics, the cold luster of metal keys, and the uniqueness of luxurious agraphs. The harmony and beauty of the world depicted in the works of Robert Kampen leave no one indifferent.-.

Fans of Game of Thrones all knew the show would have to end someday, but even so, many viewers weren’t happy with how the final season went. Season 8 introduced several plot twists that proved divisive—from Daenerys’s shocking turn to the deaths of beloved characters. And even though it has been two months since the series finale aired, some disgruntled fans are still harboring feelings of disappointment (thousands have even signed a petition for HBO to remake the final season). So naturally, when Nikolaj Coster-Waldau defended Jaime Lannister’s death scene during a San Diego Comic-Con 2019 panel, audience members voiced their disagreement.
According to Variety, Coster-Waldau appeared on the panel on July 19th, along with several of his Game of Thrones castmates. The actor addressed Jaime and Cersei’s death, in which the crumbling Red Keep buries the two Lannisters.
"I thought it was perfect for him to end in the arms of Cersei, it made sense to me, that’s just my opinion," Coster-Waldau said.
The audience, however, disagreed. Variety notes that several fans booed the actor when he made his feelings known. (Lena Headey, for the record, has said that she “wanted a better death” for Cersei.)
Coster-Waldau also pointed out that the ending of the show was never going to make everyone happy, and he urged fans to keep that in mind.
"It comes to an end it’s gonna piss you off no matter what because it’s the end,” he said. “If you hated the ending, if you loved the ending, that’s great, just don’t call people names."
Spoken like a true knight.
The actor also had some thoughts about what would have happened between Jaime and Brienne if their romance hadn’t been cut short. According to IGN, Coster-Waldau said, “It would’ve been Brienne and Jaime forever” before taking a metaphorical dagger to the heart of this ship.
"He’s got a lot of baggage, and I think she’d find out after a few weeks and go 'No, I think I’m gonna have to move on,'" he added.
Well, at least Jaime and Brienne can live on in our headcanon. Like Coster-Waldau said, no show can completely satisfy every fan, and we’re doing our best to keep that in mind with Game of Thrones. 22, 2019

We establish unique existence of $p$-barycenter of any probability measure for $p \ge 2$ on CAT(1)-spaces of small radii. In our proof, we employ Kendall's convex function on a ball of CAT(1)-spaces instead of the convexity of distance function. Various properties of $p$-barycenter on those spaces are also presented. They extend the author's previous work [Yo].

Sounds like an excellent book. Clearly we are altering the climate at considerable cost to future generations, so this begs the question of why the climate change denialism?
I can think of 100 reasons for climate change denialism, but I think it boils down to people being worried about costs of moving away from fossil fuels, and being rather selfish about this in ignoring future generations. If the climate problem could be fixed for free I doubt there would be many denialists left.
Some people also dislike taxes on ideological grounds and conservative parties seem particularly sceptical about climate science. This ideology is put above almost every other concern it seems.
The denialists rationalise their position by claiming the science is wrong or global warming could prevent an ice age (which it cant). Or that C02 is plant food, which is a massive over simplification of the issues.
However some countries have substantial renewable energy already, and it hasnt bankrupted them, and electric cars are becoming more affordable, and are very cheap to run. The costs of the transition are being exaggerated by the denialists.

Murray is far enough along in his NFL journey that the odds of him turning back—particularly with a nine-figure contract extension on the horizon—are slim to none. And though drafting him would be a worthy PR stunt and good exposure for a team looking to grow its brand (the Yankees did this when Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, who played briefly in the minor leagues, attended their spring training), the reality is Murray hasn’t played competitive baseball in over three years. Even for a world-class athlete like Murray, that’s a long layoff to overcome. The optics of rostering Murray over a more deserving player also has the potential to ruffle feathers, similar to the farce the Mets invited by parading Tim Tebow around the minors, milking his celebrity for every last dime in one of the most blatant cash grabs you’ll ever see.
Players selected in the Rule 5 Draft must remain on the big-league roster all season. If not, that player is then returned to their original team. Examples of recent Rule 5 players include Tigers slugger Akil Baddoo and Red Sox reliever Garrett Whitlock, both of whom were chosen in last year’s draft. The Rule 5 draft is traditionally held at the Winter Meetings, though this year’s proceedings could be affected by a work stoppage with MLB’s CBA set to expire on December 1st.

Fans around the world will be delighted to hear that Gossip Girl (Season 1, Part 2) is coming soon! After a successful first part, the American teenage drama will resume streaming on the platform, HBO Max. The new season, developed by Joshua Safran of Random Acts will again feature six episodes and has already been renewed for a second season. Hence, fans can expect a lot to come in the future. The show, as everyone knows, is a reboot of the original series of the same name from 2007. Therefore, it generates a lot of buzz from old and new viewers alike. We can anticipate, secret liaisons, lies, and betrayal galore in the upcoming part 2. So, read on to find out more!
Gossip Girl (Season 1, Part 2): Plot and Cast
The show, much like the original, takes place in the fictional elite schools of Constance Billard and St Jude’s, which are set in the Upper East Side of NYC. The previous part of the show had ended in a cliffhanger. Fans can therefore definitely expect a resolution for the same in the upcoming part. We can also obviously expect threesomes aplenty between Audrey, Max, and Aki. There will also perhaps be a storyline about Audrey and the new mystery guy as they were seen kissing in the trailer. Along with that we also see Julien getting canceled on social media. Thus, things seem to be getting pretty steamy, and escalating situations are at the crux of part two of Gossip Girl.
We can rest assured that the entire cast lineup of part one will be reprising their roles. This includes Jordan Alexander as Julien and Whitney Peak as Zoya Lott, Zoya Lott. Thomas Doherty returns as Max Wolfe, Evan Mock as Aki Menzies, and Savannah Lee Smith as Monet de Haan.

TOKYO, NNA – Japanese frozen confectionery maker Goyo Food Industry Co. has started producing frozen cakes in Thailand in partnership with a local peer, shifting from exports from Japan to cash in on local demand.
The move marks the company’s first production overseas, making frozen cakes at a factory of Srifa Frozen Foods Co. in the west of Bangkok to supply them to convenience stores, café chains and hotels among other businesses, Shinya Fujinaga, a director of Goyo, told NNA on Monday.
The Japanese sweets maker had exclusively teamed up with Srifabakery Co., an affiliate of Srifa Frozen Foods, in 2014 for sales in the Southeast Asian country but stopped shipments as the prices of the cakes remain high for local consumers, Goyo said in a statement on Monday.
In a bid to offer such cakes at lower prices, the Japanese firm based in Itoshima, Fukuoka Prefecture in southwestern Japan, has decided to share its expertise in specifications and recipes for frozen cakes with the Thai group to begin local production at the plant in Kanchanaburi Province, it said.
From this month, baked cheese cakes will be put on sale at 40 baht ($1.3) a piece, said the director in charge of marketing overseas.
Under the partnership, Goyo Food Industry has the rights to supply locally produced frozen cakes to its own sales channels in Thailand and exports to overseas markets, according to the statement.

It used to be a small fishing village specializing in stockfish, but now it focuses more on tourism due to the increasing number of people visiting the archipelago. You can visit there two museums: Tørrfiskmuseum (Stockfish Museum) and The Norsk Fiskeværsmuseum (Norwegian Fishing Village Museum).
The Norsk Fiskeværsmuseum (Norwegian Fishing Village Museum)
We visited the Fishing Village Museum, an open-air museum consisting of different buildings, showing the 250 years of the village fishing story. When there, check out Europe’s oldest active cod-liver oil factory and get a taste of tran (cod liver oil). If tran is not your cup of oil, what would you say to cinnamon rolls from a stone oven from 1878? They were so delicious; we ended up getting two each 🙂
The museum usually has guided tours and demonstrations, but due to Covid, they were unavailable.
You can check out the museum website to know more.

Shaming is a phenomenon in human social interaction where a person is publicly humiliated for their behavior and/or appearance, in an attempt to alter it.
Contents
Research[edit]
Research suggests that feelings of shame make people lose empathy that would be necessary to behave better towards someone they have harmed emotionally.[1][2] Some researchers regard shame as inferior to shameless-guilt in changing behavior in that shame turns a person inward to the point that they focus on ego-building rather than behaviour-"correction".[3] One study found that children who felt shame more than others behaved less socially acceptably,[4] including a propensity to illegal behavior.[5] Adults who experience high levels of shame engage in higher substance-abuse than the general population.[6][7][8]
Slut-shaming[edit]
"Slut-shaming" occurs with women who are open about their sexuality, with various slurs such as "slut" or "whore" directed at them (in contrast with men, who are labeled positively with "pimp" or "stud").[9]azy and sexual is used against her – there are assumptions that she encouraged it regardless of evidence.[10] Slut shaming has become harder to get away with in the #MeToo era.

Dani Alves officially became a Barcelona player for the second time at the start of this week after the Catalonians agreed a deal to take the defender back to the Nou Camp. Alves had been a free agent since departing Sao Paulo in September over an apparent dispute over money.
Alves made 391 appearances for Barca during a successful eight-year spell at the Nou Camp after signing for the club from Sevilla in 2008.
The 38-year-old three won three Champions League trophies and six La Liga titles for the Catalan giants and was regarded as one of the best right-backs in the world during his first stint at the club.
He became a star performer for Brazil during his time with Barca and represented his country at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.
The defender left Barca to join Juventus in 2016 but only stayed in Italy for a year before joining Paris Saint-Germain the following summer.
He moved to Sao Paulo in 2019 but made an abrupt exit earlier this year.
JUST IN: Liverpool’s XI if three stars join to cover African stars in January
And following his return to the Nou Camp, Alves had some wise words for his new team-mates as he made an emotional speech.
“It’s a pleasure to be here after so long,” Alves gushed in a video shared on the Barcelona Twitter page.
“Coming back here is an honour – a pleasure. To be able to share with you again as well.
“I come to learn from you, now the new world. But of the old man, I want to convey one thing – to know what this club and this shirt represents.

“I have been out and this is the best place to do great things – to live. You are here – let them value it because outside there is nothing better.
“It is a pleasure to be here with you. We are going to do great things because this club is made of this – of doing great things.”
Alves was handed the number eight shirt on his return to the club. Eight was the lowest squad number available after midfielder Miralem Pjanic freed it up when he joined Besiktas on loan in September.
Alves has already begun training with his new side but will not be able to play any matches until January as he is not registered.
That means the defender will be able to build his fitness and offer the team a fresh pair of legs during the business end of the campaign.
Alves has apparently become Barca’s lowest-paid player following his arrival and has signed a deal which expires nextIt’s a Taco Takeover!

Dr Julie Hedayioglu, Research Associate at Kent’s Centre for Health Services Studies (and a BPS Chartered Psychologist and Health Psychologist, HCPC Registered) is leading the evaluation of these community events. The aim is to look at the experiences and how people engage with using creative ways of sparking conversations around death, which are known to be beneficial in supporting better choices for end-of-life care.
The Coffin Tales Roadshow, a new series of events funded by Creative Estuary Ideas Lab, gives people the chance to come and look at customs, reflect, and experience traditions around life and death. Each event will have three different workshops led by creative practitioner Natasha Steer, Poet Dan Simpson, and Heritage Scientist/Conservator Dana Goodburn-Brown. There will be investigations into burial artefacts, live cooking workshops relating to funeral food, after dinner games, and creating writing.
Dana Goodburn-Brown said: ‘Some of my favourite and most memorable work is related to the conservation of objects from graves; investigating and sharing stories from our discoveries about the life of the person they belonged to. Finds from graves represent incredible and poignant time capsules revealing the details of ancient lives. It has been my privilege to work with such objects. I rarely get a chance to discuss what these findings mean to people in communities today. It is wonderful to be part of the Coffin Tales Roadshow Team, coming together to focus on what life and death means to us all.’
Dan Simpson said: ‘Poetry is often deployed at significant life events – and, of course, at the end of it: when we come together to celebrate someone who has passed. It is words that outlast us: through stories we tell and lines engraved on gravestones to commemorate the dead. I’m excited to encourage people to write their own words on this topic, and reflect on how to live a meaningful life in the here and now through poetry.’
All are welcome to drop-in events taking place in:
- Chatham: 18.00 – 21.00, Wednesday 20 October, at Dragon Coworking, St George Hotel, 7-8 New Road Avenue, ME4 6BB
- Sittingbourne: 14.00 – 17.00, Tuesday 26 October, at The Forum Shopping Centre

The divestment decision was reached at a Board of Trustees meeting in March.
“Pratt’s commitment to sustainability reflects its mission of educating students to be responsible contributors to society,” said Pratt President Thomas F. Schutte. “We agree as a community that the time has come to divest from fossil fuels in order to fulfill our environmental responsibility and to be consistent with our core values as an institution.”
The comprehensive approach that the Institute is taking, which is to divest from coal immediately and other fossil fuels over time, will allow it to be both environmentally and financially conscious with modest impact on overall investment performance. The divestment of fossil fuels from Pratt’s approximately $150 million investment pool will be a long-term process, which may take up to five years to complete. This phased approach will ensure that the Board can fulfill one of its primary responsibilities, which is the sound investment of Pratt’s endowment to ensure that funds are available for student scholarships and other vital needs.
At the March meeting, Pratt board members heard statements from student representatives and from Mike Pratt, vice chair of the board of trustees and chair of the investments subcommittee, calling for the Institute to divest.
“This action of divestment, which is a significant step in a long-term process, is consistent with the values and teachings at Pratt Institute and the sustainability initiatives and commitments already in place,” said Pratt. “We can no longer ignore the negative impact of pollutants or dependency on nonrenewable resources. Pratt has a responsibility as a world-class art and design college to lead by example and make important decisions that will serve as a catalyst for positive change in its community and beyond. This new policy further stresses Pratt’s important role in ensuring that our planet is habitable for future generations.”
Pratt Institute has shown strong support for sustainability-related issues at the local and national level, as well as within the art, design, and higher education communities. Pratt was one of the earliest signatories to the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment (now known as the Climate Leadership Commitments) in 2007. That same year, the Institute accepted New York City Mayor Bloomberg’s 30/10 Challenge to reduce greenhouse gases by 30 percent by 2017. Following.
Pratt’s decision to divest from fossil fuels responds to requests from its student government and from senior administrators concerned about the environmental and economic consequences of climate change.
“We are happy that Pratt Institute will continue its support of sustainability efforts and divest its endowment from the fossil fuel industry,” said Pratt Institute Student Government Association President Emma Colley. “Divestment further affirms the Institute’s commitment to environmental responsibility and ensures that students have an understanding of the impact of their decisions as creative professionals on the environment.”Feel like going out to eat or drink, but don’t want to leave your dog behind?

Dog-Friendly Patios create customer loyalty for owners
Allowing dogs in your outdoor space can be an excellent way to bring in new customers and create a fun and energetic vibe in your establishment. Here are some advantages to allowing dogs in your business: Younger generations want to bring their dogs with them.. Patios with dogs are a big draw to customers walking by your establishment. Many foodservice establishments in cities rely on foot traffic to bring in new business, and if your restaurant patio has dogs, it can convince passersby with their own dogs to stop in and make an order. Dog-friendly patios can boost your sales. In addition to foot traffic, you can advertise your dog-friendly space on this website (Pet Friendly Restaurants) for example and on specific apps to bring in more customers and boost sales. Additionally, some dog-friendly establishments offer dog menus, which is a great way to offer food […]

In setting the record straight, Pogo makes
strong comments about those who blew the incident out of
proportion, starting with ICP themselves.
According to the July 14 issue of Pro Wrestling Torch, "ICP
were supposed to work the main event, but left the building
when Violent Jay was hit with a stiff cane shot by Pogo
the Clown and suffered broken ribs."
"Impossible," Pogo said from his home in the Bay Area."
I never hit him with a cane because there was no cane. I
don't`like anyone saying I stiffed him with one, it is a
lie and makes me look unprofessional."
I initiated this interview, in part, because I watched the
angle and was not taking busy pictures of Pogo when he bust
past security towards the Black Army and hit the ring. He
attacked ICP in an angle that drew pretty heated reaction.
I did not remember Pogo using a cane at all.
What I did remember was 2 Pogo clotheslines.The first sent
Shaggy 2 Dope into a spinbump that looked great. The second
was a heavy short-arm across the 260lb. Violent J.'s chest.
Now, by reputation, the 419 lb. Pogo has a clothesline that
has been compared to WWFer Bradshaw.But I had never heard
of anyone getting broken ribs like that before, and it looked
ok, not being in the throat or on the head.
"If some online site reported I broke his ribs with a clothesline,
(as at least one did), even that's wrong. He should go to
wrestling school and learn how to bump. They've never gone
to school, right? He can't bump properly and that's how
he got hurt."
After the angle, which was the opening angle before even
the first match , ICP went to the back, and with Violent
Jay reportedly none too happy, left the Grand Olympic Auditorium
for the nearest LA ER.
This resulted in some rapid rebooking of the main event
as ICP's close buddy and partner, Vampiro, stayed and was
odd man out as the XPW Title match saw Messiah pin Sabu.
(More on that later.)
A RESPECTED VET
The wrestler behind the John Wayne Gacy inspired facepaint
is Joe Applebaumer. He quickly appeared on the radar screen
in his 12th or so indy match when his size, aptitude and
Applebaum finishing move popped the house, which included
the editor of the "Variety" of pro wrestling, the Observer's
Dave Meltzer. The rave review in Meltzer's sheet was the
one thing I knew about Applebaumer's career when I met him
in May.
Joe is old schooltrained and is well liked and respected.
He resents the spreading of the stories as as they portray
him as unprofessional in 2 ways. Firstly, the false reports
of deliberately causing injury with a weapon. Secondly,
by provoking the walkout Pogo ruined the card. (To top it
off, another story making the rounds has it that Sabu needed
some convincing by XPW owner Rob Black to do the new finish,
starting speculation of heat in the locker room.)
Pogo says ICP propagated the story on their website.
"I never could get through to see it, and I sent them an
email. I still haven't heard back. Then he was going on
about it at the ICP Juggallo cards last weekend,(attended
by XPW wrestlers). For some reason after the weekend, his
Pogo issued a warning to his alleged victim.
"Violent J. needs to stop trash talking about POGO being
part of a conspiracy among the boys to get ICP out of XPW.
That's ridiculous. He has to stop saying that, saying that
stuff about me last weekend."
"There was no conspiracy at all, the boys didn't care. He
doesn't know how to bump. I didn't hit him any harder than
I hit any other worker in XPW, I didn't stiff him. That's
how I clothesline my friends too, are they complaining?
I didn't break his ribs with a cane or a clothesline. "The purpose of the study was to analyze the ultrasound lung comets (ULCs) variation, which are a sign of extra-vascular lung water. Forty-two healthy individuals performed breath-hold diving in different conditions: dynamic surface apnea; deep variable-weight apnea and shallow, face immersed without effort (static maximal and non-maximal). The number of ULCs was evaluated by means of an ultrasound scan of the chest, before and after breath-hold diving sessions. The ULC score increased significantly from baseline after dynamic surface apnea (p = 0.0068), after deep breath-hold sessions (p = 0.0018), and after static maximal apnea (p = 0.031). There was no statistically significant difference between the average increase of ULC scores after dynamic surface apnea and deep breath-hold diving. We, therefore, postulate that extravascular lung water accumulation may be due to other factors than (deep) immersion alone, because it occurs during dynamic surface apnea as well. Three mechanisms may be responsible for this. First, the immersion-induced hydrostatic pressure gradient applied on the body causes a shift of peripheral venous blood towards the thorax. Second, the blood pooling effect found during the diving response Redistributes blood to the pulmonary vascular bed. Third, it is possible that the intense involuntary diaphragmatic contractions occurring during the "struggle phase" of the breath-hold can also produce a blood shift from the pulmonary capillaries to the pulmonary alveoli. A combination of these factors may explain the observed increase in ULC scores in deep, shallow maximal and shallow dynamic apneas, whereas shallow non-maximal apneas seem to be not "ULC provoking".Merk: ‘instability’

Roosevelt during his December 8, 1941 speech before the United States Congress, asking that they declare war against the Empire of Japan.
To be sure, December 7, 1941 was certainly a cataclysmic one in American and World History. Fast forward almost 47 years to August 9, 1988, a date that, for many Canadians, was another date which will live in infamy—the day when the unthinkable happened: then-Edmonton Oilers superstar center Wayne Gretzky was traded to the Los Angeles Kings.
In the deal, the Kings sent center Jimmy Carson, Martin Gelinas, their first round draft picks in 1989, 1991, and 1993, along with $15 million in cash, to the Oilers. In addition to Gretzky, the Kings got Marty McSorley and Mike Krushelnyskif in the trade.
But for Canadians, they had lost the best player to ever play the game, a national treasure, The reaction was shock, disappointment, and anger, among other emotions.
That evening, after Gretzky addressed the Edmonton media, he did the same with the Los Angeles media at the Sheraton Plaza LaReina Hotel, near Los Angeles International Airport, in front of a massive throng of local media, by far, the largest media gathering ever for a Kings press conference.
“I hadn’t seen anything like that,” said legendary former Kings star right wing Dave Taylor. “I’ve never seen so many cameras in my life.”
“[The Kings acquiring Gretzky] was pretty exciting,” he added. “I felt both sides of it, because I was close to Jimmy Carson. He was actually the guy who called me and told me, ‘The deal is done. I’m going to Edmonton. Wayne Gretzky is coming to Los Angeles.’ I said, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me.’ I never dreamed Edmonton would trade Gretzky.”
Taylor noted that, contrary to popular belief, it was Dr. Jerry Buss who got the ball rolling on acquiring Gretzky from the Oilers.
“Bruce McNall was the [Kings] owner, but Dr. Buss, [the Kings previous owner, following Jack Kent Cooke, their original owner], started the discussions with [then-Oilers owner] Peter Pocklington,” he said.
“Dr. Buss believed in the star system,” he added. “That works more in basketball, and he saw the effect Magic Johnson had on the [Los Angeles] Lakers, [which he also bought from Cooke]. Then they acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar—if you add two or three superstars like that in basketball—they had a dynasty. The same thing happened when Kobe Bryant [became a star].”
“That was Dr. Buss’ philosophy, especially in the L.A. market. He believed you needed stars to draw people, to win, and to be successful. But hockey is a little different. Star players help, but you’ve got to have the depth. You’ve got to have more than a couple of key players.”
With Gretzky now wearing a Kings jersey, they became the hottest ticket in town, literally overnight, as phones at the Forum in Inglewood, California began ringing off the hook with people clamoring to buy season tickets.
“When the word broke that he was coming to the Kings, the Forum became the place to be, watching Kings games,” Taylor reminisced. “It was just amazing. I remember driving to games with him—we drove to games together. He would ask about crowds. I would tell him, ‘Hey, we’re playing Montreal, so we’ll have a sell-out tonight.’ [The same would be said for the New York Rangers, or the Winnipeg Jets]. He said that ‘we’ve got to make it so that they’re coming to see us play,’ and he was exactly right. A year or two later, the Kings sold out every single home game. That was the first time that happened for the Kings.”
“The seats I had in the corner went from $16.50 to $80.00,” Taylor added. “I had seats—I got a couple from the team, and I bought a couple, so I had four seats in the corner, on the end where the Kings shot twice, about 2/3rds of the way up. That was an overnight price difference!”
A situation that could have been rather awkward was that on November 6, 1985, in a game against the Oilers at the Forum, Taylor nailed Gretzky with a one-punch knockdown.
“It was just a reaction,” said Taylor. “There was a scrum going on, and he gave me a shot from the side, so I just turned and punched, and hit him on the side of his helmet.”
“I don’t think I hit him that hard, because I was punching across my body,” added Taylor. “But he went down, and all heck broke loose. I ended up on the bottom of the pile there with about five Oilers on top of me. I think I still have lumps on my head from that.”
But with Gretzky now as his teammate, that incident could’ve been a bit of a sticking point between the two. But Taylor indicated that they never talked about it, noting that, “That kind of stuff happens in the game.”
Taylor said that he gained a new appreciation for The Great One once he joined the Kings.
“I was amazed, first of all, at how Gretzky handled all the [attention from media and fans],” he observed. “I played against him for many years, and I knew how good a player he was. But then he came to us, and I got to watch him play every day, and you realize, ‘Oh [expletive deleted], he does have eyes in the back of his head,’ the way he made plays, and the way he could do things, it was truly amazing.”
“I played with Rogie Vachon, Marcel Dionne, and Larry Robinson was here,” he added. “Nobody impacted the game like Wayne Gretzky. He’s the one guy, in my opinion, during my time with the Kings, who could attract the casual fan to come out to the Forum and watch us play, and that happened, literally, overnight.”
A lot of things changed for the Kings when Gretzky arrived. But contrary to what conventional wisdom may dictate, Taylor indicated that the players took it all in stride.
“I don’t think the game really changed for the players,” he stressed. “You still have to show up, and you have to play. But there’s no question that the whole atmosphere of the game production, and the fact that he was there, I think people came with more energy to the games, with the opportunity to see Wayne Gretzky play.”
One change the players made was in their leadership the following season, when Taylor willingly gave up the team captaincy to Gretzky.
“It was kind of a group idea,” he said. “The year before, Robbie Ftorek was our head coach. He said, ‘You’re the captain. I’d like you remain as the captain, if you want to be the captain.’”
“So I wore the ‘C’ that first year when he came here,” he added. “But when I watched how he operated, and saw the demands on his time, he was really the spokesperson for the team, and I felt, the next year, that he should be the captain. I talked with [new head coach] Tom Webster about it and said, ‘all I want to do is win.’ He liked that, so Gretz was named captain, and we moved on.”
Even though Gretzky was now in a Kings jersey, they did not become a Stanley Cup contender right away.
“We were OK, early on,” said Taylor. “But the team built up, from 1988, when Gretz first arrived, to the early 1990s, when I thought our team was very good.”
“Bruce McMall was spending as much [on player salaries] as any of the other teams,” added Taylor. “We were really competitive, but we had different things that derailed us.”
After a few years of getting the trains back on the tracks, the 1992-93 season came along, and started out as a near disaster. Things started well, but nearly ended up being a disaster, and they came up just short of the ultimate goal. In the next instalment of this series, Taylor shared his memories of the Kings 1992-93 season, focusing on the 1993 playoffs, and their first appearance in the Stanley Cup Final. Stay tuned.

‘Get Up, Get Up’
Label: Cordial Recordings – Catalog: CORD7025 – Release Date: Out Now – Format: 7’
We decided at the beginning to release it as a single and not to include it on the vinyl release album. It is included on the CD version. It’s a sprightly energetic warm song that’s lifts your spirit on listens. We’ve also included ‘Get Up On The Dancefloor’ on the flip because we’ve had a lot feedback on this being the best cut on the vinyl album.
There are a run of 50 litho printed sleeves. We’ve also got x15 copies of the demo release available, but this has been recut. We don’t at the moment have a release date yet.
These songs were recording in a bedroom studio as demo cuts and were never considered for commercial release at the time, but both songs are too strong not to release in our opinion. We had to audio restore the original files because there was a bit of distortion on the original recordings.
Roual GallowayFrom my 19th floor hotel room, I can see a gorgeous view of downtown Manhattan. Skyscrapers glitter above and below me, and the crawl of people and cars never stop. I’ve always dreamed of working in New York City, and now I’m finally here – flying first class coast to coast, staying weekends at luxury hotels, and melting into the flow of a busy, bustling city. And before New York, I’d quite literally flown around the world, spending time in Shanghai, Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe, and Moscow. Over the past 2 months, I’ve spent about 4 days in my home in San Francisco. (That’s why there have been more travel posts and less recipe posts. It’s hard to bake in a hotel room :))
The constant hustle is thrilling and exhausting. Everyday I see something new, have a fresh experience, or eat something delicious. I learn more about the world and more about myself. The view from my window is never the same.
But it’s also lonely.
It’s lonely to wake up at 4am when my roommates are still sound asleep, to quietly drag my suitcase down the stairs so I can catch a plane that will take me across the country. It’s lonely to check into a big, empty hotel room, to stretch out across an empty King bed. It’s lonely to say goodbye when my traveling companions inevitably return home and I stay on the road. My status quo is that there is no constant, only change.
And I’m certainly not complaining. I’m just saying that it’s okay and normal to be lonely even if you’re living a dream life of travel. When you’re floating around the whole wide world, of course you’re going to feel unanchored.
So when my job requires me to be away from home week after week, how do I combat the loneliness?
Learn to enjoy your own company
This is by far the most important lesson for solo travel (and for life). Get used to hanging out with yourself and valuing the time that you have alone. Don’t be shy about eating alone – who’s there to judge you? I love eating a slow dinner on my own. It gives me more time to think, reflect, and really taste the food.
Establish a routine
When you rarely spend a week in the same bed, an established routine can ground you no matter where you are. No matter where I am, I always try to exercise 2-3 times a week and spend some time in the evening unwinding and reading. Whether I’m working in San Francisco, New York, or Dallas, this routine gives me something dependable in my day to day.
Keep in touch
You might not be in the same place as your friends and family, but they’re always just a call away. And while this may seem obvious, it’s so easy to get caught up in your day to day and miss the chance to call your loved ones. I’ll take at least half an hour each day to keep up connections at home.
Reach out to your extended network
One of the great things about traveling is the chance to catch up with old friends who are scattered around the globe. I had dinner with my host family in Japan, and reconnected with close friends in New York. These interactions create a support network in your location and refresh relationships that may have been neglected due to distance.
Extended travel is truly an adventure, and adventures can often wear on the soul. But while loneliness may strike, take the chance to embrace something new. And most importantly, enjoy the unique experiencing of traveling with yourself as your main companion.

Hey gorgeous how are youIngredients
- 50ml rum
- 10 mint leaves
- 1 lime cut into wedges
- 1 spoon of brown sugar
- 10ml gomme syrup
- dash of soda or sprite
Garnish
- Sprig of mint and/or lime wheel
- Sprinkle of brown sugar
Method
This drink is built in the serving glass.
(Read more on cocktail techniques here)
Take your mojito glass, add the lime wedges and use your muddler to release the juices. Add the brown sugar, gomme syrup and rum. Place the mint leaves in your one hand and clap them with you other hand to release the mint aromas. Add the mint to the glass and chuck in a few ice cubes. Place your bar spoon in the glass and cover the remainder of the top of the glass with a bar napkin and your hand (the napkin is just so you don’t touch the glass rim with you hand – it looks more professional + more hygienic). Now move the spoon quickly up and down to mix all the ingredients. The napkin will get wet but at least most of your ingredients will stay in the glass. Top up the glass with crushed ice first and then either sprite or soda/sparkling water (I generally use sprite unless they request a “not so sweet” mojito, then I’d use soda). Finally, finish off your drink with a sprinkle of brown sugar, a lime wheel and a sprig of mint.
For extra brownie points, slap the mint on the back of your hand before placing in the glass. It will release that beautiful fresh mint smell to the lucky guest who gets to sip this cocktail.“Platitudes? Yes, there are platitudes.

London was looking beautiful today. Bright blue sky, the leaves just turning yellow and gold, a few puffy white clouds. Lunch with friends in the sun that got so hot it felt Mediterranean, signing some books in Watkins, London’s oldest occult bookstore, and then off to see at first hand Trafalgar Square’s Fourth Plinth. I had hoped to see some fascinating display of public performance art, but instead a chap was hoisted up and he proceeded to tell us about Benjamin Creme’s announcement of the imminent arrival of the Maitreya. Something Creme has managed to talk about for the last 20 or 30 years. He’s on his way! Yes he is. Hang on a moment. Yes he’s coming. Hang on…for decades!(Working with the seemingly opposite principle to the ‘Power of Now!’)
Then off to a book launch of Satish Kumar’s new book ‘Earth Pilgrim’. It looks to be a very inspiring and satisfying read. Rattling home on the train to Lewes, sun setting over the Thames and the London Eye I read:
‘Journeying to …sacred destinations is a helpful inspiration to get me out of my home and bring me into a challenging and vivid relationship with the world. I welcome this practical and down-to-earth motivation, but at the same time I have to let go of the desire to arrive, and yield to the joy of sacred drift.’
Satish Kumar, Earth Pilgrim
I love that man. Will have to get a copy of his book.There was pain. Her eyes clenched shut.
She opened her eyes.
She swore and tried to move, shift away from the hardness that was hurting her back.
Her arms were behind her back and they wouldn’t move. Something at her wrists stopped her.
She writhed.
Jenny opened her eyes again, feeling something as her eyelids brushed it. A blindfold?
Her mouth was stuffed with something too… a gag?
She, of course, had read that book, like all her friends. Her best friend, Sarah, lent her a copy. She’d laughed about it with all her mates over too much wine.
Then one day she’d suggested it to George. As a joke, or in a way that she could pass off as a joke, because sometimes George could be a bit funny… sensitive about things like that.
To her surprise, he’d agreed.
It wasn’t like the book… of course not, not even close. So all the stuff, the handcuffs the blindfold and the gag went into that drawer of things that are never used again and then are forgotten about.
Now, though Jenny wasn’t lying on their bed. She was on some hard, rough floor. She could feel it against her skin.
It could be the garage. There was a cold draft and the floor was hard, rough and dirty. She felt with her fingers, back past the pain in her back, wincing again as the rough floor grazed her nakedness.
It felt like concrete. There was a hollow feeling to the air and a hint of engine oil on the air too, something damp against her bare thigh.
Her head throbbed as Jenny tried to remember, to cast her mind back to what had happened before… well, before this.
There had been an argument, or as close to an argument as George ever got. He was quiet equitable, most of the time. But that old saying about still waters was more than true of him. Which was why she’d been hesitant about bringing the toys into the bedroom, not sure of how he’d react.
Now here she was tied up and blindfolded, lying naked on the floor of the garage. This time it didn’t feel like a game.
When he let her go, this time there would be trouble. The hard cold concrete dug into her back, her shoulders, and her thighs.
She was getting cold now too and the taste of the cheap plastic ball gag was making her feel a little sick.
She wished she could scream, or stand up… or anything.
It sounded quiet, wherever she was, as though it was the middle of the night. As if just to confirm it, an owl hooted. If this had been a TV mystery drama, she’d have laughed at the cliché. She didn’t feel like laughing now. If anything she felt like… she needed to go, the pressure in her stomach, her bladder, was increasing, and now she couldn’t stop thinking about that.
Then she heard the door open.
Then footsteps.
More than one set. Jenny thought about her nakedness and people looking down at her.
Strangers?
‘What shall we do with her?’ It was the voice of Sarah, her best friend.
She was safe! Jenny sighed with relief around the gag. Surely, it was over now.
‘We’ll get rid of her,’ George said.
The footsteps turned and walked away.Abstract
OBJECTIVE: Screening for inherited thrombophilias with laboratory tests is impractical before starting women on combined oral contraceptives. As an alternative, some recommend eliciting a family history of venous thromboembolism. The validity of this approach, however, remains unclear. DATA SOURCES: We sought all published reports that correlated a family history of venous thromboembolism with any thrombophilia confirmed by laboratory test. We used sequential, overlapping computer searches including MeSH terms used for articles in PubMed, a narrative search phrase in Google Scholar, and then all "related" articles in PubMed for each article included without time or language limitations. This was supplemented by a search of. gov. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: The search yielded 10 reports. Information was sought without success from corresponding authors of four other reports that may have had relevant data. Most reports studied atypical, high-prevalence referral populations. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Results were presented according to the MOOSE (Meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology) guidelines for systematic reviews of observational studies. The patient populations varied widely, definitions of family history included first- or first- and second-degree relatives, and the thrombophilias studied differed among these reports. Hence, aggregation of results was not possible. Despite these differences, all reports consistently documented poor validity of family history for detecting thrombophilias. Sensitivity ranged from 16% to 63% and positive predictive value from 6% to 50% for the various thrombophilias studied. In no study did family history meet the benchmark for a good test (sensitivity plus specificity greater than 150%). CONCLUSION: Obtaining a family history of venous thromboembolism before starting combined oral contraceptives is not a valid means to detect a woman's risk of thrombophilia. Even in high-prevalence populations, in which the positive predictive value is increased, a positive family history of venous thromboembolism was no better than flipping a coin in predicting thrombophilia.

Of the name Regardless, one must know that examined MSCs isolated from bone tissue marrow typically, adipose or orofacial tissue as mono-nucleated and adherent cells are each extremely heterogeneous cell populations (Gronthos et al., 2002; Guilak et al., 2004; Mao and Marion, 2006; Lee et al., 2010a; Keating, 2012). Considering that mesenchyme just prenatally is available, we make use of connective tissues stem/progenitor (CTS) cells to make reference to stem/progenitor cells in postnatal orofacial connective tissue. CTS cells as a result consist of all putative stem/progenitor cells which have been examined in orofacial connective tissue including oral pulp, jaw bone tissue, periodontal ligament, and lamina propria of dental mucosa. Developmentally, orofacial CTS cells occur from 1) neural crest produced mesenchyme and/or 2) orofacial mesoderm. Presently, mono-nucleated cells that are isolated from orofacial connective tissue and stick to tissue lifestyle polystyrene are considered to become stem/progenitor cells (Desk 1). Ex girlfriend or boyfriend vivo differentiation of adherent and mononucleated cells into osteoblasts, chondrocytes and/or adipocytes is recognized as evidence they are stem cells (Desk 1). However, adherent and mono-nucleated cells isolated from orofacial connective tissue, if indeed they differentiate into multiple lineages ex girlfriend or boyfriend vivo also, are definately not natural stem cells. Extra rigor is vital to characterize orofacial CTS cells, including colony clonogenecity and development, in vivo cell lineage tracing and orthotopic cell infusion (Desk 1). Desk 1 Existing and strenuous strategies for characterization of orofacial CTS cells. Teeth pulp CTS cells The majority of the teeth in humans and several various other mammalian species is certainly formed by extremely mineralized dentin. Dentin is included in the teeth enamel in the crown from the cementum and teeth in the main. Dental pulp may be the just soft tissues in the teeth, and GANT 58 features to keep its homeostasis which of dentin primarily. Dental pulp is certainly a heterogeneous cell tank, and includes odontoblasts that reside on mineralized dentin surface area, furthermore to abundant interstitial fibroblasts that can be found among an internet of bloodstream nerve and vessels endings. Teeth pulp is certainly mobile in the youthful extremely, but its cellularity lowers with age group (Smith et al., 1995; Nanci, 2007). Cranial neural crest cells are multipotent stem cells and present rise to oral mesenchyme within a structure referred to as the oral papilla (Chai et al., 2000). Teeth Rabbit Polyclonal to MAEA. papilla may be the known origins of postnatal oral pulp stem/progenitor cells (Smith et al., 1995; Nanci, 2007; Chai et al., 2000). Mesenchymal cells in the developing E13.5 mouse button tooth germ are multipotent and distinguish into non-dental lineages including chondrocytes and osteoblasts readily, furthermore to odontoblasts (Yamazaki et al., 2007). Some, but definately not all, from the mononucleated and adherent cells isolated from postnatal oral pulp demonstrate stem/progenitor cell properties including colonogenecity and differentiation right into a limited variety of cell lineages (Gronthos et al., 2000; Batouli et al., 2003). At a clonal level, about 2/3 of oral pulp CTS cells generate ectopic dentin when transplanted heterotopically cell tracing, displaying that odontoblasts in oral pulp may result from two different resources: perivascular and non-perivascular cells, both which can handle migrating to and possibly replenishing odontoblasts upon pulp damage (Feng et al., 2011). Significantly, few cells in oral pulp go through migration in postnatal homeostasis (Feng et al., 2011). To time, few studies have got centered on molecular signaling of orofacial CTS cells. Notably, Notch signaling provides been shown GANT 58 to keep the stemness of oral pulp CTS cells and attenuate their differentiation (Zhang et al., 2008). Nevertheless, little else is well known about the contribution of various other molecular signaling pathways towards the stemness of orofacial CTS cells. Jaw bone tissue CTS cells Tissue in oral pulp are linked via the main apex with both periodontal ligament and bone tissue marrow in either the maxilla or mandible. Considering that bone tissue marrow MSCs had been initially isolated in the marrow of appendicular bone fragments like the iliac crest, you might assume that the marrow of jaw bone tissue harbors stem/progenitor cells also. Certainly, CTS cells have already been isolated from jaw bone fragments of GANT 58 both human beings and rodents (Matsubara et al., 2005; Akintoye et al., 2006; Yamaza et al., 2011). Like iliac crest cells, stem/progenitor cells in the jaw bone tissue are clonogenic and also have powerful osteogenic potential in vitro and in vivo (Matsubara et al., 2005). Nevertheless, a genuine variety of differences exist.News
Enhancing service in an age of accountability
Production at Smartroof has been at an all-time high throughout 2017 and with the well documented skills shortage providing a challenge to UK house builders, it certainly looks like more and more will be looking towards offsite systems and components in the coming year.
The many advantages of Smartroof’s ‘room-in-roof’ panelised system are most appealing to those building multiples of the same house types, where a degree of repetition secures production efficiencies. The move away from traditional roof structures towards these more efficient panelised systems has been the logical step for many national and large regional house builders.
To facilitate the increase in demand, Smartroof has increased its production capacity at its Cwmbran and Swadlincote factories and output has now tripled.
Setting new standards
Offsite is a relatively new concept for many house builders so Smartroof’s focus is on establishing systems which take the exacting quality standards set in the factory and transfer them to the site during handling and installation.
By engaging with the NHBC’s technical team, the company has identified the most important points in the construction process which should be validated for effective quality management, providing traceability and compliance with best installation practice.
The first initiative is a detailed Customer Support Pack containing every detail required to manage and record an effective installation. This ensures that installation teams are fully briefed on the correct processes, guiding them to an energy efficient conclusion.
The new Smartroof Customer Support Pack has been designed with house builders in mind. With each stage of the Smartroof process being covered meticulously, from the call-off process right through to post installation checks and after sales support, the Customer Pack gives support to the house builder throughout the entire process, ensuring the smooth running of delivery and installation of Smartroof products.
In addition, a new mobile app is available as a companion to the Support Pack which allows the compliance reports to be completed on screen for convenience during installation rather than a paper form. The app will automatically update a database of site specific records so compliance reports are safe and secure.
Effective support
Designed for installation teams, the Smartroof.
Most importantly, the app allows real-time correspondence with the Internal Sales Support Team, meaning reporting facilities are tightened and issues can be resolved instantaneously. The app is currently being rolled out across Smartroof installation teams including those from house builder customers who have been trained by technical experts to become Smartroof Registered Installers.
Maintaining effective Health & Safety procedures onsite remains a priority for the business, and to further promote best practice, Smartroof has recently hosted a number of visits from the NHBC at its Swadlincote production facility. These visits also provided the opportunity to gain valuable feedback from the NHBC boosting the company’s awareness of the changing needs of its members working within the NHBC’s own certification process.Investment Management
What is P&A’s investing philosophy?
- Patience and discipline are an investor’s friend, while fear and greed are their enemies. We don’t believe in trying to time the market. Staying fully invested to an appropriate investment mix will lead to the best long-term outcome for you.
- Keeping your investment costs low means more of your money is compounding for you. High fees make it more challenging to achieve successful financial outcomes.
- Market volatility is normal and to be expected. It also presents opportunities to rebalance your account or realize losses that we can use to offset future gains.
- Having a defined account review process ensures your accounts receive the ongoing attention they deserve. This process provides us with an opportunity to reach out to you at least four times per year.
- We eat our own cooking by investing our personal monies in the same investments and strategies that we use for our clients.
You might also have the following questions about working with us:
Where will my assets be held?
- Charles Schwab is our preferred custodian. They are an independent, third-party who holds your investment assets. When you add money to your account by check, you will make the check out to Charles Schwab, not to Pittenger & Anderson.
- Schwab was founded in 1971 and has been a pioneer in lowering investments costs for the investing public over the last 50+ years.
- Schwab carries SIPC insurance covering fraudulent activity and protection against insolvency in the amount of $500,000 per account type on your behalf. They’ve also purchased excess SIPC coverage up to $600 million in aggregate.
How much will it cost to work together?
- Unlike most financial advisors, we don’t sell products or earn commissions, nor are we paid by any of the investments we use in your account. Our sole compensation is a transparent management fee billed to your account quarterly and based on the quarter-end account value.
- Our management fee varies depending on the size of your accounts and the investment strategy we utilize. Retirement accounts start at 0.75%. After-tax investment accounts begin at either 0.75% or 1%, depending on the strategy used. You can view our fee schedule here and find out Why investment fees matter.
- For example: If your IRA account is worth $500,000 at the end of the quarter, your quarterly fee would be $938. This fee is calculated by multiplying $500,000 by 0.75% and dividing by 4.
- Our management fee covers our Financial Planning and Complimentary Services.
Can I easily access my money once invested?
- Yes! None of the securities we invest in have lock-up periods, surrender charges, or other hooks that penalize you for accessing your money. We can liquidate an investment and have the funds to you within a couple of days.
- There are a handful of ways to access the money in your account. You will receive a Schwab checkbook on your brokerage account and a debit card if you like. Additionally, you can establish an electronic link between your brokerage account and your personal checking account (called a MoneyLink) that allows for easy and quick money movements to and from each account.
- You can also wire funds from your brokerage account or we can have Schwab mail you a check.
- Brokerage accounts have margin lending capabilities, too, meaning you can borrow against the value of your account. For example, you’re looking for a short-term bridge loan when buying a new house and waiting for your old one to sell.
- If you have known cash needs or recurring monthly withdrawals, we can set up a cash reserve in your account to fund these for a period of time.
How do you help me measure my success?
- As a team, we formally review your accounts each quarter. After our review, we will reach out to update you on how your account is doing and to see if there’s anything we can help with.
- You will have 24/7 access to your account information via the P&A Client Portal and the P&A app. You can view your account info through the Schwab Alliance website, too.
- Included in the portal and on the app are performance reports showing how your account fared against its assigned benchmark, net of all fees and expenses. See “How we benchmark performance.”
- While our goal is to beat the benchmark assigned to your account, your success likely doesn’t require you to outperform some index. See “What is performance?”
- We measure success by our efforts to help you maximize your financial life so you can spend your time on what matters most to you. Whether that’s family time, community involvement, or leaving a legacy.Snow has returned to West Yellowstone!

A franchise marketing strategy, also called a plan, is a practical document that includes everything you do (or will do) to market your franchise brand. It is essential for the success of your franchise. Marketing doesn’t just happen – it requires strategy, goals, and tactics. Understanding these three components will help guide you as you build out your franchise marketing plan. The best way to create a franchise marketing plan is through investing in professional guidance that can maximize your chances of success.
A franchise marketing strategy includes everything you do to market your brand. Marketing involves the promotion of products or brands to buyers. It may have a higher focus on building awareness for your brand, rather than satisfying customer demand, which is largely the function of sales organizations. Some examples of franchise marketing solutions are advertising, social media marketing, web design and development, SEO, or public relations activities.
It’s never too early… Failing to create a marketing strategy before starting to market your franchise can be costly long-term for any business. By creating a properly comprehensive, targeted, and time-specific marketing plan you’re maximizing the possibilities of generating significant ROI in various marketing platforms.
You should only write your own franchise marketing strategy if you have a very broad range of exposure to all types of marketing platforms and tactics in order to know what combinations might work. The more experienced you are in the field, the stronger your plan will be. Otherwise, find an expert in franchise marketing who can take on your brand’s needs and execute them better than if it were being handled by someone with fewer years in the industry or just one type of exposure or experience.
As often as necessary. The summary below is a suggested process for reviewing your existing franchise marketing strategy and incorporating new ideas:
A) Has anything significant changed? If your franchise brand is offering additional services, or digital versions of formerly in-person-only services, then it’s time to check if the current marketing strategy can cover these. Changes in audiences most often prompt the biggest changes.
B) Review the results of prior campaigns based on sales and customer feedback. Consider whether they were successful and if so, what they accomplished? What new insight was gained from monitoring these campaigns? What did you learn about your customers? Use these insights to revise, adapt, and add to your marketing strategy.
